There is a perception that once legislation has been enacted the job of the Oireachtas is done, but if we have learned anything from the experience of recent years, it is that the people who have been entrusted to do a job do not always do it.  It is not the job of the Oireachtas to micromanage these issues.  Sometimes we put regulators in place but the question is asked regularly &quot;Who regulates the regulators?&quot;.<br\/>We will have procedures in place for protected disclosure right across the entire country.  To instill public confidence in the system of protected disclosure it is reasonable that people would believe there is a consistent approach.  If one makes a complaint to the local authority in Kerry or makes a complaint against the Department of Justice and Equality, there should be similar type protections, not just specified in law but being interpreted and implemented.  It is similar to the point we addressed when we discussed the freedom of information legislation.  There is training for people across the public service to ensure there is a consistent approach to all these matter.<br\/>In my amendment I call for a procedure whereby a year after the enactment of the legislation, the Ombudsman, or a designated person, if the Minister considers that somebody other than the Ombudsman should do it, should carry out a review of the protected disclosure process, following which the Ombudsman or other person shall report to the Minister on whether the said process is operating in a consistent manner across all bodies which come within the remit of the Act.<br\/>To repeat, we often hear that new rules and regulations are not implemented because the body does not have the resources to do so.  It is fine to have the legislation, but we need to know it will be applied in a consistent manner in every organisation to which it applies.  To ensure that the legislation is working, we must conduct an annual review.  I ask the Minister to accept the principle of the need for a review to ensure the legislation is working in practice.  The Minister will probably tell us several times that this new legislation has groundbreaking procedures and is a major reform.  That counts for nothing unless it is applied on the ground after the legislation has been passed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400002#A00500","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1400072400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>There is nothing in what Deputy Fleming has said that I would disagree with in principle.

It is an appropriate job of work, particularly for the Oireachtas committee to look at the operation of the legislation.<\/p><p>  I have three difficulties with the amendment tabled by Deputy Fleming.  I think a period of 12 months is too short for such \"groundbreaking\" legislation to borrow the phrase he used.  I do not think the typical pattern of cases will be built up in 12 months time that could then be reviewed.<\/p> <p>That is why, in the Bill itself, I have said there will be a statutory obligation on the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to formally review the Bill after five years and to cause a report on that review to be presented to the Oireachtas.  After five years, I believe we will have a significant variety of cases across both the public and private spheres in order to be able to fundamentally see how the Bill is operating.<\/p><p> I have a difficulty with the timeline.  I also have a difficulty in regard to giving the role to the Ombudsman, as I do not believe that is the appropriate person.  The Ombudsman, under the legislation we enacted in 2012, has been given a very extended and broad remit, which is, in essence, to look into complaints whereby members of the public - citizens - have been unfairly treated by public bodies.  This is quite a different set of issues because it involves both the public and private spheres.  I believe it would intrude on and not gel well with the Ombudsman's work.<\/p><p> I believe we are in a good place, as a Department, to be able to pull together the information after five years and make a reasonable analysis of it, and to make a presentation to see if it is working well.  Of course, at any time over the intervening period the Oireachtas itself can review the legislation, and it will be obliged to look at it after a year under the new protocols we have established for ourselves in the Houses of the Oireachtas.

The amendment seeks to ensure that external advisers or professionals who may be contracted into a particular organisation - for example, auditors - would enjoy the full protection of the legislation.  I have a concern that the legislation as currently worded would exclude not just auditors but accountants, financial advisers and professional advisers from those protections in the course of their work in circumstances in which they may uncover wrongdoing, which is not implausible by any means given other events that are further back but still in the recent history of the State.  I believe such contracted persons should be protected and taken account of in this legislation to ensure they enjoy the same protections as others from, for instance, any form of retaliation that could emerge should they come forward with information of wrongdoing.  It is not hard to imagine circumstances in which there would be a fairly limited number of people in different disciplines that provide certain types of professional support, analysis or advice to different organisations.

I want to acknowledge from the start that my approach is exactly that - namely, to see how we can jointly, as a committee, work to improve the Bill.<\/p><p>  The effect of the amendment put down by Deputy McDonald would be to delete that part of subsection (b)(i) of the definition of \"worker\" relating to contractors which excludes from the definition of persons \"whose status is not by virtue of the contract that of a client or customer of any profession or business undertaking carried on by the individual\".  As I explained during Second Stage, it has been my intention at all times to include within the definition of \"worker\" the widest possible range of persons who interact in the workplace.  In this regard, I am anxious to ensure that contractors come fully within the ambit of the legislation.<\/p><p>  I have asked my officials to look very carefully at the amendment the Deputy has put forward.  Having considered the proposed amendment, for the purposes of getting greater certainty in regard to the achievement of this objective - that is, to achieve the widest possible inclusion of workers - I have asked the Office of the Attorney General to consider a redrafting of the definition of \"worker\" so as to provide for a simpler definition of \"contractor\" than that currently set out in the Bill in parts (b)(i) and (b)(ii) concerning the definition of \"worker\".<\/p><p>  I hear what Deputy McDonald is saying.  I ask her to bear with me in this regard because I propose to bring my own amendment on Report Stage which should not only meet the Deputy's concern, which she has ably voiced today, but also provide greater clarity in regard to the position concerning contractors.  To be truthful, we lifted this from the UK legislation and it has worked very well there.  However, the Deputy makes a good point, and I want to have greater clarity.  If she bears with me, I will get the Attorney General to craft something that I hope we will both find fit for purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400003#B00700","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1400072400,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The Minister will know, while it is perhaps not so much the case across private industry, that public bodies rely in some instances quite heavily on the efforts of volunteers and voluntary staff.  I believe it would be logical and wise to include volunteers in that definition.  Therefore, I suggest the insertion of a new subsection, to read: &ldquo;(e) works on a voluntary basis, as a volunteer for no pay,&rdquo;.

As I said in response to the Deputy on the last amendment, the basis of this legislation is to afford workers protection against harm, if one likes, in terms of their employment status, so that nobody can demote them, ensure they would not get proper remuneration, fire them or exclude them from promotion.  None of that applies to volunteers.<\/p><p>  The idea, in essence, is to ensure that people can out wrongdoing without detriment to themselves.  The problem with volunteers is that there is no contractual relationship and, as they are not paid, they do not fall into the normal definition that would require the sort of supports and protections the Bill sets out for workers in the broadest possible way.  Normal workers have a role in employment within an organisation.  If they have information on which they want to blow the whistle, they should be able to do that without detriment to themselves.<\/p> <p>That applies to a volunteer.  There is no financial or employment consequence an employer can impose on a volunteer in that context.  I have examined international best practice in this area and it shows that volunteers are not generally included in this type of legislation.  I do not see a compelling case for their inclusion in these provisions.  Moreover, it would be very difficult for a volunteer to find a mechanism that would fit him or her within the architecture of this protection system.  Seeking a restitution of position, pay or anything like this from the Labour Court would not apply.  Having said that, I am interested in hearing the Deputy's views on how this might work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400003#B01200","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400073000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>The Minister is right that, by definition, a volunteer does not face detriment in terms of pay or promotion prospects, as would arise for a worker.  It is also true to say, however, that many people who volunteer for organisations within the charitable sector, including, for instance, section 38 and 39 organisations, do so on the basis that they have a personal vested interest in the work being carried out by that organisation.  In the case of a parent or sibling of somebody with a profound disability who volunteers with a particular organisation, to give an example, that person is not being paid, but he or she is still doing work on behalf of the organisation.  That work is an important part of the person's life and an important commitment he or she has made to the organisation.  Let us then imagine a situation where this person, in the course of carrying out his or her voluntary efforts, encounters substantial wrongdoing.  Should he or she not have access to the whistleblowing mechanisms and associated protections, not so much in respect of loss of pay or promotion prospects but in a context where an individual could potentially be unceremoniously told his or her efforts were no longer required?  While this would not represent a loss of income, it would represent something traumatic and very unjust for the individual in question.  That is what I am getting at in this proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400004#C00200","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1400073000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I understand entirely and the Deputy makes a very valid point.  The problem lies in the practicality of organising a structure that would accommodate these types of scenario.  It seems that a volunteer who sees wrongdoing in an organisation for which he or she is working is very likely to expose it.  There would not be great pressure on such an individual not to do so in terms of damage to promotion prospects or anything like this.  Giving volunteers access to the Labour Court would not be of great advantage to them or confer great additional protection.  What could volunteers hope to achieve from such an appeal other than confirmation that they are still entitled to be a volunteer?<\/p><p>  I assume that for a volunteer in a charitable organisation, the people to go would be the charitable organisers who would be scandalised if the organisation were to take action against a volunteer simply for pointing to wrongdoing.  The difficulty with the Deputy's proposal lies simply in the practicality of finding a set of remedies that would fit into the scheme of remedies operated by  the Labour Court.  Is there detriment for volunteers akin to unfair dismissal or discrimination in the workplace?

I simply cannot assume that a person, in the absence of a channel for securing protections, would necessarily come forward with that type of information.  Having dealt in recent months, as part of my work on the Committee of Public Accounts, with a number of people who have significant experience in volunteering for different organisations, many of them in receipt of substantial State funding, I can say there would be a view among volunteers, many of whom, as I said, have a personal vested commitment to particular organisations, very often for personal family reasons, that a reluctance to come forward could be an issue.<\/p><p>  The Minister might be right that this is not the legislation in which this issue should sit.  On the other hand, perhaps I am right and it should sit in it, but we need to find remedies other than through the Labour Court.

We are bringing forward this legislation in tandem with the freedom of information legislation as part of an overarching development of policy.  The whistleblowing legislation has to be understood by people.  One of the criticisms I have made during the years of the sectoral approach of previous Governments is that the more variance there is, the less likely it is that individual workers will understand how whistleblowing provisions should operate and what protections apply on a uniform basis.  That is why this overarching legislation is important.  The issue the Deputy has raised relates to this concern of requiring that policy to be understood.  Within the public sector, under the legislation, we can determine public policy on whistleblowing, which must be followed by any organisation, including voluntary organisations, in receipt of State funding.  I will reflect further on how this can manifest more clearly such that people will know, as a matter of policy, that there must be a channel for whistleblowing in any organisation that receives State moneys and - again, as a matter of policy - that there can be no detriment for people who utilise that channel.

I am concerned that the implications might be somewhat different from what the Deputy intends.  A failure on the part of a person to comply with a legal obligation is listed as one of the relevant wrongdoings in section 5(3)(<i>b<\/i>).  Therefore a breach of the statutory code would represent a breach of such a legal obligation and may fall under one or more of the relevant wrongdoings depending on the issue and the substance of the matter.  The Deputy seeks to include breach of a &quot;workplace code of practice&quot;.  Many workplace codes of practice and even professional conduct are designed to protect the house, not to allow for the exposition of wrongdoing within the house.  I recall doctors being concerned about a contract that would require them not to speak adversely about the policy of a one state institution.  There are examples where such in-house rules would work to the detriment of other workers who wished to out wrongdoing.  I think there is another way of going about this and it is not unrelated to our last discussion.  I have been speaking to my officials as to where we could slot in the initial point the Deputy made.  Perhaps the Chair will indulge me to refer to the previous discussion.  Let us look at Part 5, section 21, of the Bill.  We may be able to include volunteers in the internal procedures for protected disclosures made by workers employed by public bodies, where they are required, under section 21, to establish and maintain procedures for dealing with protected disclosures made by workers who are or were employed by a public body.

It is a graded level of disclosure.  While I believe, and it should be encouraged, that the vast bulk of the initial reporting of wrongdoing should be to the employer within the workplace, there should be a mechanism to allow a whisteblower to go beyond that, either if he is not listened to or if no action is taken on foot of it.  The whole structure is a graduated scheme.  I believe there is a relatively low threshold of reasonable belief in respect of disclosing matters without any particular burden of proof being required.  To go further to an external disclosure - this is the model used in the UK and elsewhere - one ratchets up slightly the requirement that one believes it to be substantially true.  It is not a high threshold that one believes it to be substantially true.  To match the gradation required of the legislation, it is important that there is a stepped approach as one broadens the accusation, because it will not always be true, but certainly one should believe it to be substantially true before taking it outside the workplace.  Although our entire focus, rightly, is on ensuring that somebody who perceives wrongdoing is fully protected, we must provide for a situation where malicious harm cannot be encouraged.  A requirement simply to enjoy the protections of the Bill, that one believes it to be substantially true, is a relatively low threshold to bring a charge of some description, outside the remit of one's employer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400005#D01700","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1400073600,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I do not accept that, not least because the Minister is bringing forward this legislation in a culture and environment in which it is exceptional for people to come forward and to blow the whistle.

One is not starting from a position of widespread practice or acceptance.  In the public sector we have seen that writ large and one can only surmise that extends into the private sector for people coming forward.  I accept the Minister's point that he does not want to encourage anything that would be malicious or vexatious and the legislation adequately provides for that.

Last year I held discussions in London with colleagues there with long experience of this type of legislation.  In fact, I was asked to make a presentation on our legislation, which is now regarded as cutting edge.  I made several changes to the original draft on foot of these discussions and the experience in the United Kingdom.  Deputy Mary Lou McDonald may be surprised to learn that one such change was to remove the good faith requirement which was included in the original UK legislation.  A person could have a malevolent motivation, but if the accusation is true, the motivation does not enter into it.  I have personal experience of this in the case of the Morris tribunal.  One of the most egregious discoveries was revealed because a spouse was not best pleased with the actions of her husband and she exposed certain things.  The UK legislation would not have catered for this because it was not a disclosure in good faith.  The fact that something is true, or that the person believes it to be true, is enough.<\/p><p>  I also removed the public interest requirement.  Something need not even be in the public interest.  Based on experience in the UK system, the argument goes that this requirement was too high a hurdle and cases that were demonstrably true were defeated in the courts because they did not pass the public interest test.  As a result, I removed this requirement also.<\/p><p>  There are low thresholds to avail of the protections included in the Bill.  If we reflect on it, the threshold caters for believing what a person is saying publicly is not true, although he or she believes it to be substantially true.  There are two caveats.  One is that the person believes it to be substantially true.  We need not believe all of it is true.  If the person believes the bulk of it is true, he or she is sheltered by the protections included in the Bill.

I thank her for the amendments and realise this matter was raised on Second Stage.<\/p><p>  The Deputy is aware that under section 9, as drafted, a worker has the protections provided by the legislation in circumstances where he or she makes a disclosure or charge to out the wrongdoing while obtaining legal advice from a barrister, a solicitor or a trade union official.  I understand from my good trade union colleagues that they give legal advice because people come to them to ask how they should advance in unfair dismissal cases or how to deal with bullying in the workforce and they explain the law to them.  I am advised by the Attorney General that this amounts to giving legal advice, which is why I have crafted the section in this way.  Its purpose is to provide a safe place for a potential whistleblower to allow him or her to determine the basis of informed and expert advice on where he or she would stand if he or she progressed to making a disclosure to his or her employer or otherwise.  In particular, potential whistleblowers may wish to assess with their chosen advisers, either legal advisers or trade union representatives, whether their disclosures would meet the conditions set out in the legislation for them to be protected disclosures and if they would be provided with the safeguards inherent in the legislation.  I have sought to ensure the legislation is as clear and straightforward as possible, which is important.  However, I appreciate, given the complexity of the issues likely to be involved, the potential implications and impact of the steps a potential whistleblower would be taking, that it is likely to be the case in many instances, particularly where a worker is apprehensive that he or she might be penalised or suffer detriment for his or her actions, that external expert advice would be required.<\/p><p>  The effect of amendment No. 6 would be to restrict the protection provided in section 9 to cases in which legal advice had been obtained from a barrister or a solicitor only.  If we were to take out the reference to a trade union official, legal advice from a solicitor or a barrister only would have protection under the Bill.  I do not believe that is what the Deputy intends in respect of a worker taking the advice of a trade union official or a person authorised by a worker's employer on a disclosure in accordance with the procedure prescribed by the worker's employer.  The nub of the issue, therefore, is whether advice given by a trade union official is legal advice.  While reflecting on the amendment, it occurred to me that we needed to avoid a situation where a potential whistleblower could not or would be afraid to take expert or informed advice on account of a concern on the part of a trade union official that he or she was not offering what would be regarded in a strict legal sense as legal advice commensurate with that provided by a solicitor or a barrister.  Deputies will be aware of this dilemma from their constituency work.  I have rehearsed some of the instances I have encountered in discussions with my officials.  There are times when I proffer advice on the law, although I am not a lawyer.  To safeguard myself I always advise people that they may wish to take independent legal advice on a matter but that in my experience a given approach is the way to go.  That is what trade unions officials and shop stewards sometimes do as a matter of routine, especially those familiar with the Unfair Dismissals Act.  As a matter of routine, they represent clients or members before tribunals and so on, a matter in which they would be expert.  Are they giving legal advice or do they have to be a barrister to give it?  My advice is that a person need not be a barrister to give legal advice.<\/p><p>  The definition of what constitutes legal advice is important.  In the light of the foregoing and subject to the committee's approval, I propose to consider the amendments further with a view to clarifying the position on the giving of formal legal advice.<\/p> <p>When I went through the provision in detail this morning with my officials, from the perspective of Deputy McDonald's proposal, the concern arose that there might indeed be some confusion in our placing advices given by a trade union official together with legal advice.  It might be a worry for officials to think they are giving actual legal advice.  I hope I am not being too lawyerly in my explanation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400006#E01000","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400074800,"counter":66,"content":"<p>No, the Minister is not.

As I indicated, the priority must be to ensure that the legal framework is fully effective, that it works, that it protects members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that it is consistent with the general principles of the Bill before us.  Those principles apply to all workers.  I am, therefore, pleased to propose amendments, the combined effect of which will be to provide for what I term the mainstreaming of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purposes of the Bill.<br\/>There are three distinct elements required in order to bring members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fully within the ambit of the protected disclosures legislation.  The first of these is the ending of the separate and distinct arrangement provided for in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, the purpose of which is to allow for the making of confidential reports.  The change required in this regard is addressed in amendment No. 18.  The second element is ensuring that members of the force have access to the same redress provisions as all other workers in the State.  This is addressed in amendments Nos. 11 and 12.  The third element involves the making of any consequential amendments arising and this is addressed in amendments Nos. 13 and 14.<br\/>In light of the sequence I have just outlined, it might be helpful for me to address amendment-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400008#G00400","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1400075400,"counter":96,"content":"<p>Did the Minister refer to amendments Nos. 11 and 12?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400008#G00500","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1400075400,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I did.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400008#G00600","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1400075400,"counter":98,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 12 is not relevant to this group of amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400008#G00700","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1400075400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I suspect the Minister should actually have referred to amendments Nos. 10 and 11.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400008#G00800","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1400075400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Yes, it should be Nos. 10 and 11.<br\/>As I was saying, I am of the view that it would be of assistance if I began by addressing amendment No. 18.  This amendment will bring to an end the separate arrangements put in place in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act in respect of members of the force.  Amendment No. 18 relates to section 19 of the Bill as it currently stands.  As originally envisaged, section 19 proposed to amend section 124 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 - which allows for the making of regulations relating to confidential reports by members of the force - by adding a further subsection requiring the Minister for Justice and Equality to make new regulations to provide for the making of protected disclosures by officers in accordance with the provisions of the protected disclosures legislation and for the putting in place of redress arrangements for officers.  This is the <i>status quo<\/i>.  The effect of that to which I refer would have been to retain the confidential reporting arrangement and the redress provisions relating to members of the force within the ambit of the Act in question.  I am now proposing to replace section 19 in its entirety and to make provision for a completely new regime.<br\/>The proposed new section 19(1) will provide for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC - under section 7 of the Bill before us - to be prescribed as a suitable body to accept disclosures.  As a result, GSOC will be the new recipient of disclosures from garda&iacute;.  The sub-committee will be aware that the former Minister for Justice and Equality announced his intentions in respect of this matter some time ago.  These intentions have been reiterated by the new Minister.  From the perspective of mainstreaming, I ask the sub-committee to note the proposed new subsections (1)(b) and (2) of section 19.  The purpose of the latter is to repeal the existing arrangements within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of confidential reporting and to revoke the associated regulations, which, as the sub-committee will recall, provide for matters such as the acceptance of disclosures by a confidential recipient, so-called.  The effect of this will be to terminate all separate and distinct arrangements relating to confidential reporting within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to bring all members of the force fully within the ambit of the legislation with which we are dealing.  In the context of the findings of the Guerin report in respect of the operations of the confidential recipient for whistleblowers, this is a significant and appropriate reform.  Acceptance of amendment No. 18 will involve removing the existing section 19 and replacing it with a new section.<br\/>Amendment No. 10 relates to unfair dismissals.  As matters currently stand, the effect of section 11(1)(c) would be that if a person who is currently excluded from the Unfair Dismissals Act is dismissed for having made a protected disclosure, he or she may make a claim under that Act.  Two categories of person remain excluded from this provision - namely, those listed under subsections (2)(e) and (2)(f) of the Unfair Dismissals Act.  I refer here, of course, to members of the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Arrangements in respect of the Defence Forces will be dealt with under section 20 of the Bill.  However, in order to ensure that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be entitled to access the Unfair Dismissals Acts in the context of protected disclosures, all that is required is a reference in the Bill to section 2(1)(e) of the Unfair Dismissals Act, so the reference &quot;(f) to (k)&quot; will now become a reference to &quot;(e) to (k)&quot;.  This will ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be brought within the ambit of the Unfair Dismissals Act for the purposes of protected disclosures.  The effect of the change to which I refer will be to allow members of the force to make claims under the Unfair Dismissals Act in respect of dismissals in the wake of the making of protected disclosures.<br\/>Amendment No. 11 relates to access to the standard industrial dispute resolution mechanisms.  The purpose of section 12(4), as it currently stands, is to exclude members of the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from the possibility of accessing standard industrial relations resolution mechanisms such as the Rights Commissioner service.  It is now proposed that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have access to those mechanisms for the purposes of making claims of penalisation following the making of protected disclosures.  It is therefore proposed to reverse the exclusion relating to garda&iacute; in this regard.  In order to achieve this, it is necessary to delete the phrase &quot;or (e)&quot; from section 12(4).  The effect of this will be to allow members of the force access to normal industrial resolution mechanisms such as the Rights Commissioner service.<br\/>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 are minor in nature and they arise as a consequence of amendment No. 18.  One of the original intentions behind the existing section 19 was to insert a new section 124A into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 in order to provide for the making for new regulations under that Act in respect of the making of protected disclosures by members of the force in accordance with the provisions of the Protected Disclosures Bill and for the securing of redress for such members if they were penalised for having made such disclosures.  On foot of the evidence relating to the operation of the confidential recipient regime, it is not now proposed to put in place any power which allows for a separate regulation to be made in respect of the making of protected disclosures by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As amendment No. 18 proposes to repeal section 124 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, the reference in section 13(2)(iv) to &quot;section 124A of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005&quot; will no longer be required.  This deletion - and the necessary consequential tidying up - is effected by amendments Nos. 13 and 14.<br\/>I hope I have set out the position fairly clearly.  Should the sub-committee be prepared to accept amendment No. 18, the effect of which will be to end the separate and unique arrangements relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of whistleblowing and replace the existing section 19 in its entirety, then acceptance of amendments Nos. 10, 11, 13 and 14 would logically follow.  As amendments Nos. 19, 20 and 22 each refer to section 19 as it currently stands, they will fall.<\/p> <p>The proposal is simple.  Finally and rightly, we should bring an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into the normal regime, with the proper body to receive whistleblowing reports being GSOC and with members of the Garda having exactly the same redress mechanisms as any other worker in the public or private sphere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400008#G00900","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400076000,"counter":102,"content":"<p>In my view, this is the key issue for this legislation, as evidenced by the three amendments I have submitted on section 19.  I do not have a copy of the speech I made on Second Stage, but I strongly opposed section 19 at the time because it removed  whistleblower protection from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and attempted to create a separate procedure which involved regulations being made by the Minister, having consulted with the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Garda Commissioner, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the inspectorate.  Thank God we changed that section, although I have issues with how the Minister has dealt with it.  Can the Minister imagine the situation if that same section was still part of the Bill today and if the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, and former Commissioner Callinan were in place?  There would be no protection for anybody.<br\/>I am pleased the Government has agreed to make some changes, but I am not satisfied with those the Minister has made.  In the context of section 19 as proposed on Second Stage, there are now a number of amendments to it, some of which are in the name of the Minister.  I will refer to the amendments in my name first because they follow logically on the position on Second Stage and will then move on to the Minister's amendment.  I am pleased the Minister agreed with my contribution on Second Stage, that section 19 should not be the position and that garda&iacute; are entitled to the same level of protection, under the Protected Disclosures Bill as every other worker in the country.  The Minister has agreed now that garda&iacute; should be part of the mainstream and in line with everybody else.  He has agreed this in principle, but I do not believe he has achieved it in the amendment he has put forward, amendment No. 18.<br\/>If the Minister's amendment, No. 18, is passed, I will not be able to move my amendments because they are logical alternatives to the Minister's amendment and are part of the same grouping.  Therefore, I will put forward my views now.  Having looked at all the amendments being discussed in this grouping, amendments Nos. 10, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20 and 22, I believe that amendment No. 19, in my name, is the right amendment, but I have no problem with technical adjustments that may be required to it.  I am happy also with amendments Nos. 10 and 11.  Amendment No. 10 allows the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and members of the Defence Forces access to legislation for unfair dismissals if they are dismissed and amendment No. 11 allows members of the Garda and the Defence Forces access to the standard industrial relations procedures, to rights commissioners and everything else.  These amendments are a logical follow through and we are happy with them.<br\/>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 deal with tidying up the legislation once the section related to the discredited confidential recipient and the provision for the regulations proposed in the original section are removed.  Therefore, I am happy to accept amendments Nos. 10, 11, 13 and 14.<br\/>I will move now to my amendment, No. 19.  This amendment is simple, straight and direct and achieves what amendment No. 18 does not achieve.  My amendment states:<blockquote>Any protected disclosures made by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall be made directly to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.<\/blockquote>This is what is required in the legislation if it is to have the public confidence.<br\/>The Minister's amendment deals with &quot;ifs&quot; and &quot;mays&quot; all of which might never happen.  The first word in the proposed section is &quot;If&quot; and later it suggests the ombudsman commission &quot;may&quot; do something.  This wording is weak and ineffectual and may never apply, because that &quot;if&quot; may never happen.  On the other hand, my amendment is very clear.  The essence of what the Minister wanted to and is trying to achieve is to ensure that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be able to make a complaint or protected disclosure directly to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  That is what is proposed in my amendment, No. 19.  This appears to be what the Minister is trying to tell us he wants to achieve with amendment No. 18, but I believe he knows in his heart it does not achieve that.  In that context, amendment No. 19 is the superior amendment.<br\/>Amendment No. 20, in my name, proposes to make a change on page 18, line 19 - to delete &quot;Ombudsman Commission and the Inspectorate&quot; and make the substitution I have proposed.  In the original legislation, the now discredited Minister and departed Commissioner were obliged to consult with the ombudsman commission and the inspectorate before drafting the separate regulations for the Garda.  On Second Stage, I pointed out that this consultation should have included representatives from the Garda Representative Association, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and a public interest group and suggested the Minister would have the latitude to decide on which public interest group it should be.<br\/>Given the Minister was going to draft regulations before he decided to mainstream the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I had drafted my amendment before he came up with his amendment.  I submitted my amendments a month ago and clearly I must have had some foresight not to trust the Minister and the commissioner who were <i>in situ<\/i>at that stage in seeking that they not be allowed go behind closed doors to draft regulations.  I asked on Second Stage for the Garda Representative Association, Garda sergeants and inspectors and public interest groups to be involved in such regulation.  The Minister has now avoided the need for this by his amendment, but what I am trying to achieve is far superior to what the Minister had in the legislation.<br\/>Amendment No. 21 has been ruled out of order.  It related to the draft form of the regulations, but it is not necessary now because there will be no regulations.  Amendment No. 22, again in my name, was also concerned with regulations and asked that they be passed within 30 days of the passing of the Act.  We did not want to come back in a year and find that while the legislation was in place, the Minister for Justice and Equality had not implemented the regulations.  That was the reason for the 30 day time limit I suggested, which was the correct thing to do at the time, as it was before the Minister proposed the amendments he has put forward today.  The Minister can understand where I was coming from in that regard.<br\/>In regard to the Minister's amendment, I agree with two elements of it.  First, I agree with the abolition of the confidential recipient process.  This process has been a farce and a discredit to everyone associated with it.  I also support the essence of what the Minister proposes here.  I said plainly on Second Stage that I did not trust the then Minister for Justice and Equality to be allowed amend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act to make these regulations, as was proposed at the time.  I said at the time that I would trust the Minister here today far more than I would trust the then Minister for Justice and Equality and asked for him to make the changes required in this legislation rather than allow the former Minister for Justice and Equality make the change.  At least the Minister has taken an initiative in this regard.  I am happy this initiative has been taken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and that it will be in the primary legislation and we will not rely on the Department of Justice and Equality to deal with the issue.  I welcome the fact the issue is being dealt with here rather than behind closed doors in the Department of Justice and Equality.<br\/>I want to examine the Minister's amendment now.  It proposes to amend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 by inserting the following section after section 102:<blockquote><b>&ldquo;Protected disclosures relating to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na<\/b><br \/>102A.(1) If the Ombudsman Commission is prescribed under <i>section 7 <\/i>of the <i>Protected Disclosures Act 2014 <\/i>...<\/blockquote>Again, the Minister uses the word &quot;If&quot;.<\/p> <p>Let us analyse this line by line.  The legislation stands and falls on these few lines.  The Minister has not even said today that GSOC will be a prescribed recipient under section 7.  He used the word \"if\" with regard to prescription.  We cannot accept the legislation on the grounds that he may decide to prescribe GSOC as a recipient if he feels like it.  The use of the word \"if\" negates the entire section.  As prescription might never happen, the reference might as well not be included.  I would accept it if the Minister stated the commission \"shall\" be a prescribed body under section 7, but I will not accept the use of the word \"if\" because prescription might never happen.<\/p><p> The next line of the Minister's amendment is fatally flawed also.  The proposed subsection states that if GSOC is prescribed under section 7 of the Protected Disclosures Bill 2014 in respect of disclosures relating to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it \"may\", if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate any disclosure.  It is now the case that if the Minister decides to make GSOC a recipient for protected disclosures, it \"may\", if it believes it to be desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate any disclosure relating to it, even if the worker, within the meaning of the Bill, making the disclosure is a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> My amendment suggests any protected disclosure made by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall be made directly to GSOC.  The Minister's amendment-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400009#H00200","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400076600,"counter":104,"content":"<p>Then what?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400010#J00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1400076600,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I refer the Minister to the rest of his amendment.  It is very simple - we have to get rid of the word \"if\".  The Minister can agree to prescribe the commission.  If he has not yet decided on all the bodies that could be recipients and he has to prescribe them in some way by regulation under section 7, this issue will not be dealt with for the likes of Sergeant McCabe or any other such individual whose case may arise in the future.  Members of the Committee of Public Accounts, including me and Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, have met Mr. McCabe and can testify to his character and good standing and the reasonable approach he took in all cases.  We met him for hours at a meeting of the committee.  However, I am referring to future cases.  Such persons will have zero protection under this legislation until such time as GSOC is prescribed as a public recipient of complaints.  Stipulating that the Minister may prescribe it if he feels like it will not pass muster.<\/p><p>  In the light of everything that has happened, the Minister would do well to make one exception.  He was leaving the Garda out of this legislation altogether.  He has agreed with my suggestion on mainstreaming, but he should go the full distance.  If GSOC is to be the first body to be prescribed as a public recipient, he will have done a good day's work.  He can do this.  He can agree to the principle today or on Report Stage, but leaving the big decision until sometime down the road will not be bought by the public.  He might see the merit in what I am saying.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, says he gets it and I hope the rest of the members of the Government do so too.  Telling us that the Government will put the legislation through without putting what I suggest in place represents a bad day's work.  The Minister needs to make an exception.<\/p><p>  The commission, if it appears to it to be desirable to do so, \"may\" investigate a complaint.  We need to find a word other than \"may\".  I acknowledge that the commission might receive frivolous or trivial complaints &mdash; that is an issue &mdash; but there ought to be a mechanism whereby people can be assured the decision to investigate will not just be at the whim of the commission.  The word \"may\" is too weak.<\/p><p>  Ministers have been tripping over one another in recent days.  Not only have they lost confidence in the Department of Justice and Equality and many others, they have also stated GSOC needs a root and branch review.  Giving the body discretion as to whether it should carry out an investigation when there is a lack of confidence in it among members of the Government does not represent a sufficiently strong approach.<\/p><p>  Let me refer to a comment made by GSOC's director of investigations, Mr. Ray Leonard, who I believe attended a meeting of the justice committee this morning.  He issued a press release and a statement.  Some time ago GSOC or some other body sought submissions on the operation of GSOC.  Mr. Leonard made a personal submission and reiterated that position in the Oireachtas today.  He has condemned GSOC, although he is its director of investigations.  He has condemned it as \"not fit for purpose\" in his personal submission to the justice committee.  He claims the Garda oversight body lacks effective independence and that the Minister still has too cosy a relationship with GSOC on occasion and that this has been unhelpful.  He states &mdash; this should interest the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform &mdash; GSOC does not represent value for money for the taxpayer based on the way it is doing its business.  This is a serious condemnation and the body needs to be strengthened quickly.  Therefore, I cannot be happy with the Minister not giving a commitment on who the recipient will be and how that recipient might deal with complaints, when received.<\/p><p>  Subsection (2) of the proposed new section states: \"The provisions of this Part relating to investigations and reports apply with the necessary modifications in relation to a relevant wrongdoing...\".  The Minister might explain what \"with the necessary modifications\" means.  I am a layman, not a legal practitioner, and do not understand it.  The Minister will have to give us examples of what precisely he means.<\/p><p>  If the legislation is passed today with the Minister's amendment intact, there will be no protection for a future Maurice McCabe because there will be no guarantee that GSOC, bad as it is and much as it needs reform, will be a confidential recipient.  The Minister went out of his way not to provide for this.  He issued a press release last week, on 6 May, stating, \"This change builds on that earlier secured by the Minister on 24 February 2014, which allowed members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make protected disclosures to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.\"  It does not.  The press release is not true.  It will allow members to make protected disclosures only if the Minister decides to make the commission a recipient.  One week after he issued that statement, there is no suggestion he will decide to make it a recipient.<\/p><p>  I am happy the Minister has gone the distance with me since Second Stage by agreeing to mainstream An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the legislation, but he needs to go a step further and implement the recommendation made in his press release last week.  He stated the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be able to make protected disclosures.  However, this is not included in the legislation.  It may be his intention to do so some time in the future, but it will not satisfy this side of the House if it is not written in the legislation.<\/p><p>  The Minister's press release states: \"The separate and unique arrangements applicable to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act of 2005 will no longer apply upon enactment of the Bill and members will, at that stage, report in a similar manner to and have the same protections as every other worker\".  I agree to mainstreaming.<\/p> <p>This is my first intervention and I will have a second response for the Minister.  I want him to respond to it, as the political issue and the people on the stand constitute the broad issue.<\/p><p> After we have discussed this aspect of the Bill, I want the Minister to tease out how the amendment will work.  The amendment refers to section 91 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 which affects sections 95 and 98.  The Minister must explain to us step by step how the amendment to which he asks us to agree fits in with the rest of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  I will come to the specifics of that legislation and the way in which the proposed change tallies with it separately.<\/p><p> In general, I will be happy if amendments Nos. 10, 11, 13 and 14 are made.  I presume amendment No. 18 will go through.  I am disappointed that I cannot move my three amendments, but there is a fundamental problem with amendment No. 18 in the Minister's name.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400010#J00300","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400077200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Can Deputy Mary Lou McDonald ask her questions at this stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400011#K00200","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1400077200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>It would help the flow of the debate if I could answer those questions first, or I will lose track.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400011#K00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1400077200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>The point I wish to make has not been made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400011#K00400","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1400077200,"counter":110,"content":"<p>I am in the hands of the committee.

The public interest reference relates to the investigation by GSOC of a complaint it receives where it appears to that body to be in the public interest to carry one out.  That is the way it deals with complaints.  The reference I have made to the public interest refers to affording the protections under the legislation for workers.  It does not have to be in the public interest to make the declaration, nor would the declaration have to be in the public interest for a garda to avail of the protections.  It is the next step involving an investigation GSOC undertakes that has a public interest aspect.  There is not a different regime for garda&iacute;.  They will have the same protections when making a disclosure to GSOC as those set out in the Protected Disclosures Act.<\/p><p>  I turn to the general points made by Deputy Sean Fleming.  I do my best not to be discordant on these issues, but it is very difficult, having crafted whistleblower legislation twice and having had it voted down by the Deputy as completely unnecessary.  The Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, did the same.  It was stated the way to go was sectoral application.  I remember the rows we had with the Deputy and his party when the original 2005 Bill was going through in attempting to provide for whistleblowing in the Garda.  It was just incredible.  I proposed the establishment of a Garda authority in 2002 and fought for nearly two years to have the Morris tribunal open an investigation into wrongdoing in County Donegal, allegations about which had been given to me.  While we managed to have a tribunal of inquiry, Fianna F&aacute;il insisted, despite my best efforts, on the Department of Justice and Equality and its Minister being excluded from the terms of reference.  On many of the things we now need to find out and which we could have found out a decade ago we were resisted by Fianna F&aacute;il.  In that historic context, it is difficult when people are genuinely coming to the issue with positivity and openness to have history rewritten.  It is like Pol Pot talking about Year Zero as if nothing happened before and as if Fianna F&aacute;il did not resist tooth and nail greater openness on these matters for the 14 years it was in office.<\/p><p>  Let me deal with the specifics.  I do not accept the Deputy's point that his amendment is better.  It is a very simple one to provide that any protected disclosure made by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be made directly to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  That is it, \"thank you very much, Ma'am.\"  It does not state what should happen to it, whereas my amendment provides for how it should be investigated.  If I were to accept the Deputy's amendment, it would be discordant with the entire regime.  My ambition from the beginning has been to have every worker in the public and private spheres subject to the same regime.  We often make legislation in the context of the latest news round, but we should do this in terms of what is the ideal and right way to go, which is to make An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na subject to the same regime as everybody else.  There should be a clear recipient for protected disclosures and clear protections analogous to those available to every other worker afforded to members of the Garda.  That is what the amendment I have set out will achieve.<\/p><p>  I have regard to the other strong point the Deputy made on the phrase, \"If the Ombudsman Commission is prescribed\".  This is an amendment to the 2005 Act and it must be consistent with its language, as introduced by the Deputy's party in government.  There is a formal Government decision and the Deputy is wholly wrong, as he knows, to say the statement issued is wrong.  It is intended to bring GSOC into the position of being the recipient of protected disclosures from members of the Garda.  That is the formal position.  I have regard to what the Deputy says, as well as to what Deputy Mary Lou McDonald said on phrasing.  Sometimes we can be wrong in understanding things.  If it is possible to put a different phraseology in place to the effect that GSOC will be prescribed, I commit to doing so on Report Stage.  I must check to see if that is proper with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Attorney General.  It is absolutely our full intention and there is already a formal Government decision to that effect.  If there is any element of doubt, I will address it.<\/p><p>  The other point of discord the Deputy made was related to the word \"may\".  If one establishes an independent investigative body, it must be given the necessary discretion to be independent.  One does not say it shall do something.  It may do something if it determines that it is right and proper to do so.  The broader sense of the refurbishment of the Garda S&iacute;oc&aacute;na legislation does not fall to me.  I was anxious to include the Garda in this legislation as we should not make fish of one and fowl of another.  They are all public sector workers and I fought hard to achieve this.  We made some progress in the initial draft, but we have made enormous progress in this draft to get to where we are now.  The other refurbishment of the Garda S&iacute;ochana Act, including the structure of GSOC's powers to strengthen them, is another matter.   I do not want to speak out of turn or rule in commenting on other legislation, but GSOC has pointed to this and the Government wants to facilitate it.  The Deputy is almost adopting a twin approach.  He says we should give it all the powers in the world, but, by the way, it is not fit for purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400011#K01200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1400077200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>A Minister said that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400011#K01300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1400077200,"counter":119,"content":"<p>The Deputy was quoting somebody else, but I am mindful of what Mr. Guerin said about GSOC.<\/p> <p>If it is going to be the recipient for this, we must all be confident that it is the right place and that it is properly equipped and structured to do the job.  That is another day's work.  I agree strongly with Deputy Fleming that crafting the legislation does not mean the job is done.  <br\/>The other point relates to amendments to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and section 19.  The proposed new section 102A states:<blockquote>The provisions of this Part relating to investigations and reports apply with the necessary modifications in relation to a relevant wrongdoing to which a disclosure referred to in subsection (1) relates as though it were the subject of a complaint referred to in section 91.<\/blockquote>This is wording that was given to us by the Attorney General.  It aims to ensure that when a raw complaint is received, it can be shaped in a way that makes investigative sense.  That is what I understand it to be and that is what was explained to me.  One could have flows of consciousness.  Somewhere in there is a real issue that needs to be addressed.  It is aimed at enabling investigation of a complaint that is not, shall we say, particularly well-structured but at its heart has something that is worth investigating.

The effect of amendment No. 15 would be to remove section 16(2)(a) which states the requirement to protect the identity of the maker of the disclosure set out in section 16(1) does not apply if &quot;the person to whom the protected disclosure was made or referred reasonably believes that the person by whom the protected disclosure was made does not object to the disclosure of any such information&quot;.  The effect of amendment No. 16 would be to remove section 16(2)(b) which states the requirement to protect the identity of the maker of the disclosure set out in section 16(1) does not apply if:<blockquote><br \/>the person to whom the protected disclosure was made or referred reasonably believes that disclosing any such information is necessary for -(i) the effective investigation of the relevant wrongdoing concerned...<\/blockquote>Having reflected again and reread the Second Stage debate, my understanding is that amendment No. 15 reflects the Deputy's concern that section 16(2)(a) effectively provides a holder of protected disclosure information with unrestricted permission to allow the identity of the maker of the disclosure to be revealed.  I am also taking it that amendment No. 16 reflects the same concern.<br\/>Section 16(1) imposes a duty on the recipient of a protected disclosure and any person to whom the protected disclosure is referred in the performance of his or her duties - I underscore this point - to &quot;take all reasonable steps to avoid disclosing any information that might identify the person by whom the protected disclosure was made&quot;.  It is extremely important to point out that the imposition of such a duty could never, from a practical or pragmatic perspective, be made absolute.  <br\/>Section 16(2) sets out the necessary practical and pragmatic circumstances under which the duty to protect the identity of the maker of the disclosure does not apply.  Bearing in mind that whistleblower complaints will require investigation by the employer, it must be recognised that, as a matter of practicality, such an investigation will, in many cases, result in circumstances where the duty to maintain the identity of the maker of the protected disclosure becomes unreasonable if a valid investigation is to happen.  The simplest and most pragmatic reason of all for revealing the identity of the maker of the protected disclosure is on the basis that the recipient or other handler of the information that is disclosed has a reasonable belief the original maker of the disclosure does not object to the revelation of his or her identity.  The recognition of these circumstances should not be taken, however - this is the point I want to underscore for the Deputy - to mean that the holder of the disclosure information is given <i>carte blanche <\/i>to disclose the identity of the maker of the protected disclosure.  He or she must, by law, under section 16(1), take all reasonable steps to avoid disclosing any such information.  With this in mind, section 16(3) makes it clear that a failure to comply with a duty to protect the identity of the maker of the protected disclosure &quot;is actionable by the person by whom the protected disclosure was made if that person suffers any loss by reason of the failure to comply&quot;.  Not only is there a legal obligation to avoid disclosure, there is a mechanism for the person to take action against the person who discloses his or her identity.<br\/>I am satisfied that these provisions will provide a significant brake on any view that might be taken that it is simple or frivolous to divulge the identity of the maker of  a protected disclosure.  It could, of course, almost go without saying the simplest way for the recipient or other handler of the protected disclosure to determine how the revelation of the identify of the maker of a protected disclosure of information would affect that person is simply to confirm it directly with the person involved.  The handler could simply ask the question.  <br\/>While I do not propose to accept the amendments, I acknowledge that the issue of the protection of identity is central.  Recent whistleblowing scandals have highlighted it as a central issue.  We need to separate as far as possible the messenger and the message.  The provision in relation to confidentiality included in the Bill has been the subject of a substantial amount of work designed to strike that really difficult balance between safeguarding the identity of a whistleblower and other significant public interests and to ensure the issues are properly ventilated and examined.  I wish, however, to take the opportunity before the passage of the Bill and in the light of the points made by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald to consider the issue of confidentiality further.  Again, it is one of those issues I have thought about long and hard, but I do not know how to improve the balance.  I will consider it further between now and Regard Stage, if the Deputy so wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400014#N00500","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1400079000,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I would like the Minister to reconsider it.

These disclosures are not protected.  I am not arguing the point if it adversely affects the security or defence of the State.  However, in regard to adversely affecting international relations, it could go too far.  There is no protection under the legislation for a person acting on behalf of the Government, as well as another government, or a person acting for that government, if he or she makes a disclosure.  Let us think of international corporation tax regimes.  It is reasonable that people acting on behalf of the Government, another government or other bodies and institutions at an international level should be able to discuss a broad range of issues affecting our international relations, whether positively or negatively.  Sometimes it could be in the public interest for a person to make a disclosure and it would be very wrong if he or she were to be excluded from protection under the Bill.  We will have a banking inquiry.  There are letters from the European Commission that are being withheld.  They have landed in the Department of Finance and probably been seen by umpteen people.  At the end of the day, it would be wrong if a senior official in Ireland with access to these letters decided to make a protected disclosure under the legislation and yet had no protection under it because somebody deemed it affected our international relations with other countries.

What does this mean?  There are pages on end.  I know of cases that went to the Labour Court for supplementary provisions and the Circuit Court enforced the decisions, but when the sheriff arrived, the employer had disappeared and the person who took the case was left swinging.  People cannot get their P45s.  As the Minister is responsible for the public service, it is important that he be aware of this situation.  In Laois and Kildare, the waiting list for a hearing with a rights commissioner can be as long as two years.  I have submitted parliamentary questions to establish waiting times, but I have been told that they cannot really be established.  For example, ten cases could be cleared when hearings are held in a hotel and that county might be okay for another year or two.<\/p><p>  I have encountered cases in which, just a day before a hearing by a rights commissioner into a person's dismissal, the employer telephoned to say that he or she was abroad, leading to the appointment being postponed for nine or ten months.  I know of a case in which a rights commissioner could not adjudicate because a person was unable to prove to a mortgage provider's satisfaction that he or she had been dismissed.  The person had been paying mortgage protection, which provided cover in the case of loss of employment.  As the person could not get an appointment with a rights commissioner and the employer gave him or her the two fingers, the person could not get independent evidence of being out of work even two years later.  In the meantime, the person was unable to draw down mortgage protection insurance to cover loss of employment because that loss could not be proven.  The bank told the person to sell the house due to a lack of income from work or mortgage protection insurance.  The rights commissioners service stated that it would take two years to adjudicate on the case.<\/p> <p>The person was told to sell his or her home.  All of this happened because he or she was unable to get an oral hearing with a rights commissioner.  I know this is not the subject of the Bill before the committee.  It is useful for the Minister, who is responsible for the public service, to hear about the actual knock-on consequences of what is happening.  People are losing their houses because they cannot get appointments with public bodies to prove their cases.  I will put that to the Minister, for what it is worth, and ask him to think about it.  The Minister should not waste our time by talking about amalgamating bodies if he does not have the budget for it.  These measures must work for the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400016#P05000","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400080800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I would like to say two things in response to the Deputy.  First, I am alarmed to hear that there was a delay of the magnitude he suggested.  Part of the reform agenda involves the introduction of more efficiencies in this area.  Obviously, that is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Second, the case mentioned by the Deputy once more underscores the importance of providing for interim relief, which is not the norm in labour related legislation.  It should be possible to go and get interim relief for people.  I was anxious to provide for that as a unique feature of this Bill.  It was pointed out by those who were resistant to such a provision that it is not the norm in legislation on labour matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400017#Q00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1400080800,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1400080800,"counter":300,"content":"<p>SCHEDULE 3<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1400080800,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 27:<blockquote><br \/>In page 30, line 9, after &quot;year.&quot; to insert the following:&quot;The details of such report shall be published in such manner as would not in any way identify a person who has made a protected disclosure.&quot;.<\/blockquote>This Schedule provides for the appointment by the Taoiseach of a disclosures recipient for the categories we discussed earlier.  This amendment relates to the final subsection of the Schedule, which provides that: &quot;No later than 31 March in each year the Disclosures Recipient shall submit to the Taoiseach a report on his or her activities in the immediately preceding year.&quot;  I am proposing that &quot;The details of such report shall be published in such manner as would not in any way identify a person who has made a protected disclosure&quot; be included after that.  There is no point in the Taoiseach putting such a report in his bottom drawer where no one can get hold of it.  The Minister spoke some time ago about the idea of open information and open data.  This provision is part of that issue.  It is clear that I do not want to compromise that issue in any way.<br\/>I intend to table a further amendment to this Schedule on Report Stage.  The first subsection of this Schedule provides that: &quot;The Taoiseach shall appoint as the Disclosures Recipient a person who is a judge or retired judge of the High Court.&quot;  The second subsection of the Schedule provides that: &quot;The Taoiseach may remove the Disclosures Recipient from office, but only for stated misbehaviour or for incapacity.&quot;  I will propose on Report Stage that the appointment of this person should be subject to approval by the Oireachtas.  In addition, I think the grounds for removing this person from office should not be so narrow.  If we provide that the recipient can be removed &quot;only for stated misbehaviour or for incapacity&quot;, it might not be possible to remove the recipient if he or she has lost the confidence of the Government or the Parliament.  An attempt to remove the officeholder in such circumstances might not fit into the categories that are listed in the Bill as it stands.<br\/>I will propose an amendment to try to give the Oireachtas a role in the appointment of the recipient.  I do not think the Taoiseach would have a problem with a 15 minute debate like that held when a new Ombudsman or freedom of information commissioner is being appointed.  Indeed, I think it would help the process.  I do not think any member of the public knew about the existence of the Garda Inspectorate or the presence of a confidential recipient within the force.  It is now proposed to provide for a disclosures recipient who can only be appointed by the Taoiseach and who will report only to the Taoiseach.  There will be no public notice of his or her appointment and no annual published report.  It will be another mystery.  It seems that the Government is looking for trouble.  All I am saying is that it should be a little more open about this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI22014051400017#Q00500","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1400080800,"counter":302,"content":"<p>We will examine the Deputy's second set of proposals on Report Stage.

Amnesty International launched a new global campaign on torture yesterday.  We have decided to launch the global campaign because of our analysis that, 30 years after the adoption of the United Nations Convention Against Torture, torture is not just alive and well but is flourishing in many parts of the world.  As more Governments seek to justify torture in the name of national security, the steady progress made over the past 30 years in this field is being eroded.  Our presentation will focus predominantly on the human rights situation in Egypt, but we also want to raise concerns about the prevalence of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment across the Middle East and north Africa region.  We have also provided the committee with hard copies and access to digital copies of a media briefing paper, &quot;Torture in 2014: 30 years of Broken Promises&quot;, which provides an overview of our concerns about torture at the global level.  It provides a regional breakdown and contains some of the information we will flag in this presentation.  We would also be delighted to meet the committee on the topic of the wider global campaign.<br \/>The Middle East and north Africa has been convulsed for much of this decade.  Initial optimism that human rights, including the right to be free from torture, would be better respected has largely given way to despair at the lack of broad progress or, in the case of Syria, horror at a human rights catastrophe in which torture is being committed on an industrial scale.  Elsewhere, particularly in countries in which we have seen the fall of long-standing rulers, there has been frustration at the pace of change.  New authorities, in some cases, have taken limited positive steps such as strengthening the legal prohibition of on torture and, in the case of Tunisia, have begun the process of transitional justice.  However, the factors that facilitate such abuses have so far proved to be too deeply entrenched to translate law into practice.  Reports of torture and other ill-treatment in Syria have skyrocketed since protests in March 2011 drew a brutal response from the authorities and led to an ongoing internal conflict.  The practice is used routinely against those detained for their suspected involvement in opposition activities, including peaceful activists and children.  There are reports that thousands have died in custody as a result.  Amnesty International has also documented torture by armed opposition groups.<br \/>Torture and other ill treatment have also blighted the records of countries emerging from conflict.  In Iraq, the phenomenon remains widespread in prisons and detention centres.  More than 30 people are believed to have died in custody as a result of such treatment between 2010 and 2012.  In Libya, the practice is rife in both state and militia-run facilities.  Amnesty International has documented 23 cases of deaths under torture since the end of the 2011 conflict in Libya.  A common feature across the Middle East and north Africa is the extent to which Governments have resorted to torture and other ill-treatment to clamp down on dissent and protests or to respond to perceived threats against national security.  In Egypt, the current authorities are drafting new counter-terrorism legislation that would, if passed, erode existing safeguards against torture and other ill-treatment, a practice that has remained endemic.<br \/>In Iran, the authorities have relied on torture and other ill-treatment as a way to obtain confessions to secure convictions which can lead to death sentences in cases ranging from repression of peaceful dissent and drug-related offences to trials of minorities.  The committee visited Iran this year and raised some of these issues.  We are grateful to the committee for that.<br \/>In Jordan, 11 men arrested in October 2012 for allegedly planning violent attacks in Amman claimed to have confessed under torture.  Moreover, Government opponents and civil society activists have often intentionally been caught up in operations under the guise of counter-terrorism or security operations.  In Saudi Arabia, torture and other ill-treatment are frequently reported in cases of individuals suspected of security-related offences, a category that can include political opponents.  There are recent allegations of torture or other ill-treatment against detainees, some of them held on security grounds, in many Middle East and north African states and other Gulf countries, including Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.<br \/>In Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, abuse of detainees during arrest and interrogation remains a serious concern, particularly in the case of Palestinians.  The Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and the <i>de facto<\/i>Hamas Administration in the Gaza Strip have been responsible for torturing and otherwise ill-treating detainees, particularly their respective political opponents.<br \/>Cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments such as stoning, flogging and amputations remain on the statute books of a number of countries in the region, notably in the Gulf, but it is in Iran and Saudi Arabia that they are principally imposed.  The entrenched patterns of torture and other ill-treatment across the region are facilitated by the fact that security forces operate largely unchecked, the judicial system relies heavily on confessions, and the judicial authorities, which generally lack independence, often fail to act when faced with reports of such treatment.  Across the region, violence against women is a persistent problem.  States have failed to ensure effective protection in law against such crimes committed by private individuals and tolerated them in other ways by not ensuring they are adequately investigated or prosecuted.  Further detail of our analysis of the use of torture across the region, and globally, is available in the briefing document supplied to the committee via the clerk.<br \/>Egypt is the country of principle concern to the committee.  Egypt is rapidly spiralling into a human rights crisis.  Repressive legislation restricts the rights to freedoms of expression, association and assembly.  The security forces routinely use unnecessary and excessive force to disperse protests and have detained thousands of supporters of ousted president Mohamed Morsi as well as activists and journalists.  The Judiciary has been quick to jail Mohamed Morsi&rsquo;s supporters and political activists, but has largely ignored human rights violations by the security forces.  The 2014 constitution contains improved human rights guarantees, although these are insufficient to meet Egypt&rsquo;s international human rights obligations.  The constitution does not establish the supremacy of international law over national legislation and fails to address endemic human rights problems such as prohibiting military trials of civilians and forced evictions.<br \/>In recent weeks, two grossly unfair trials have exposed the shortcomings and selective nature of Egypt&rsquo;s judicial system.  In both cases, the court agreed to impose hundreds of death sentences despite a lack of due process.  On 28 April, a criminal court in the Upper Egypt city of Minya sentenced 37 people to death and 491 others to life in prison.  All faced charges of involvement in an attack on a police station in the village of Mattay on 14 August 2013, murdering a police officer and the attempted murder of two other police officers, as well as belonging to the banned Muslim Brotherhood movement.  During the previous hearing on 24 March, the court had agreed to sentence 528 of the defendants to death and referred the case to the Grand Mufti, Egypt&rsquo;s highest religious official.  Under Egyptian law, criminal courts must consult with the Grand Mufti before formally handing down death sentences, though his opinion is not legally binding.  The court&rsquo;s reversal on 28 April of the majority of the death sentences appeared to follow widespread criticism from Egypt and outside the country.  The first hearing in the trial of 528 defendants, on 22 March, lasted less than 30 minutes.  Just 64 defendants were present in court out of the 118 people in detention, defence lawyers told Amnesty International.  At the start of the trial, the prosecution failed to read out the charges against the defendants, a requirement under Egyptian law.  The judge did not review the evidence against the men or allow the defence to cross-examine any witnesses.  He also rejected the defence&rsquo;s request for additional time to review over 3,000 pages of case documents.  The judge then ordered armed guards to surround the defence team after some of them called for him to recuse himself from the case.<\/p> <p> In a separate hearing on 28 April 2014, the Minya Criminal Court referred a further 683 people to the Grand Mufti, after agreeing to sentence them to death.  They included Mohamed Badie, the detained General Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood.  All faced charges of involvement in deadly violence around the police station in the village of al-Adwa in Minya governorate on 14 August 2013.  No defendants were present in court, although the security forces are holding 74 of them in detention, a defence lawyer told Amnesty International.  It was unclear what evidence the prosecution had produced, if any, connecting Mohamed Badie to the violence in al-Adwa.  The court will formally hand down the sentences on 21 June.<\/p><p> Defence lawyers boycotted the only previous court hearing in this case on 25 March, after the same presiding judge referred 528 of the defendants in the Mattay village case to the Grand Mufti.  Despite the absence of the defence lawyers, the judges continued the trial, questioning more than 50 witnesses and 74 defendants in only one hearing that lasted just a few hours.  An Amnesty International delegate observed the court sessions on 28 April 2014, speaking to some of the defendants and their families outside the courtroom.<\/p><p> Those sentenced to death in their absence have the right to a re-trial.  Others may appeal to Egypt's highest court of law, the Court of Cassation, which may quash the verdicts and order a re-trial.  The Egyptian authorities do not release figures on death sentences and executions, despite repeated requests over the years by Amnesty International.  According to our monitoring, Egyptian courts handed down at least 109 death sentences in 2013, at least 91 in 2012 and at least 123 in 2011.  The last known execution was in October 2011, when the authorities hanged one man for the killing of six Coptic Christians and a Muslim police guard in a drive-by shooting in January 2010.  It is fair to say that the level of death sentences handed down in recent months is sentencing on a industrial scale in a grossly unfair legal process.  It just calls into very significant disrepute the notion that system can even be described as a justice system anymore.<\/p><p> The security forces in Egypt have continued to use excessive force, including unnecessary lethal force, to disperse protests.  Since 3 July 2013 alone, 1,400 people have been killed in political violence, most after security forces forcibly dispersed protests by Mohamed Morsi's supporters.  In the bloodiest incident, security forces killed at least 550 people when they used unnecessary and excessive force to disperse Morsi supporters at Rabaa al-Adawiya Square in Cairo on 14 August 2013.  Hundreds more died the same day after security forces used excessive force to disperse protests by Mohamed Morsi's supporters across Egypt.  The only response we are seeing from the criminal justice system to that level of deaths and that extraordinary range of human rights violations are the trial to which I referred to earlier.  There has been no appropriate investigation of the deaths at the hands of the security forces.<\/p><p> Over three years since the 25 January revolution, impunity for human rights violations remains the rule.  Most human rights violations since the uprising have never been investigated and prosecuted and measures taken by the authorities to deliver truth and justice have proven toothless.  The public prosecution has not effectively investigated the killings of hundreds of protesters by the security forces since 3 July.  The government has ordered a judge to investigate the violence but with little guarantee that the investigation will be independent or impartial.  A fact-finding committee appointed by President Mansour last year lacks the mandate to properly investigate human rights violations or to establish individual criminal responsibility for them.  Furthermore, the committee does not have powers to compel government bodies to co-operate with it or to make its findings public.<\/p><p> Since the 2011 uprising, the authorities have suppressed the findings of the fact-finding bodies appointed to investigate human rights violations.  Egypt's new constitution enshrines impunity for human rights violations by giving military courts continued jurisdiction over crimes linked to the armed forces.<\/p><p> The unwillingness by the Egyptian authorities to investigate human rights violations should not go unchallenged by the international community.  A key indicator of progress will be whether Egypt's investigations deliver accountability for the events of 14 August 2013 and the authorities make the findings of such inquiries public.<\/p><p> The security forces have led a sweeping crackdown on individuals perceived to be supporters of Mohamed Morsi, arresting thousands and detaining many without respecting their due process rights.  Those detained include people who were peacefully expressing their opposition to the authorities.  Some detainees have complained of torture or other ill-treatment by the security forces.<\/p><p> As mentioned earlier, the government is also drafting counter-terrorism legislation which, if adopted, could impose further arbitrary restrictions on freedoms of expression, association and assembly and erode fair trial safeguards.  In practice, the authorities are likely to use any new counter-terrorism powers to crack down on the Muslim Brotherhood.  The authorities designated the group as a terrorist organisation in December 2013.<\/p><p> In the months after 3 July 2013, the circle of repression has widened to encompass journalists and opposition and human rights activists more generally.  The authorities have restricted freedom of expression.  Journalists and media workers who have reported on abuses or criticised the authorities have faced harassment, arrest and trial on accusations of spreading false rumours and belonging to banned terrorist groups.  The authorities have also closed down television stations known for their support of Mohamed Morsi.<\/p><p> The authorities have continued to suppress the work of human rights organisations.  The government restricts the registration, funding and activities of civil society organisations and it is drafting legislation that would further constrain freedom of association.<\/p><p> The authorities have also imposed new restrictions on freedom of assembly.  A new protest law gives the Interior Ministry sweeping powers over demonstrations.  The security forces have used the law to forcibly disperse protests staged by Mohamed Morsi's supporters, as well as other opposition and human rights movements, and to arrest and detain protesters.<\/p><p> I will move on to discrimination against women and Coptic Christians, which we want to flag.  Women and Coptic Christians have faced a rising tide of violence and discrimination amid the political turmoil.  Women protesters continue to face the threat of sexual violence, with more than a hundred such attacks around Tahrir Square reported in the week of 30 June 2013 alone.  Despite the level of violence, and the fact that attacks regularly take place during protests, the authorities have taken little action to stop or investigate them or to bring those responsible to justice.  Coptic Christians faced an unprecedented level of violence after the Rabaa al-Adawiya dispersal.  Sectarian attacks left four dead and 200 Christian properties and 43 churches damaged.  The Egyptian authorities said the attacks were terrorism, yet failed to ensure adequate, impartial and independent investigations, including into the security forces' failure to prevent and stop the violence.<\/p><p> Both supporters and opponents of Mohamed Morsi committed human rights abuses in the protests around the former President's ousting in July.  In most cases documented by Amnesty International, security forces failed to police protests adequately to defuse the situation or to protect the right to life.  Amnesty International is also concerned at ongoing political violence, including attacks by armed groups.  The organisation condemns indiscriminate attacks, as well as attacks targeting civilians.  However, the authorities are using the deteriorating security situation as a pretext to repress all forms of perceived opposition, including those who use lawful and peaceful means of protest.  The Egyptian Government has the right and duty to protect lives and prosecute those responsible for crimes, but it must not sacrifice human rights in the name of countering terrorism.<\/p><p> The security situation has deteriorated in the months following Morsi's ousting, with army checkpoints, security personnel and government buildings all coming under increased attack by various armed groups.  Attacks against the security forces have left more than 100 security personnel dead since 3 July 2013, according to figures from the Interior Ministry, military spokespeople and Egyptian media.  While the violence has mostly affected North Sinai, it has increasingly spread to other regions.  Violence targeting the security forces in the wake of Rabaa al-Adawiya left 64 police officials dead, according to a recent report by the National Council for Human Rights.  <\/p><p> That is a very broad overview of our concerns in the region in respect of torture and cruel and inhuman treatment.  There are very specific concerns in regard to the human rights situation in Egypt.  We also supplied some detail on a number of cases of prisoners of conscious and individuals at risk as well as some further detail on some of the human rights violations I mentioned earlier in a separate document.  We are very happy to talk about individual cases and any action the committee might be able to take but at some point, I would like to flag the case of Ibrahim Halawi with which I am sure the committee will be very familiar, where an Irish citizen is being detained in Egypt.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014051400003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400074800,"counter":366,"content":"<p>Before I call Deputies Brendan Smith, Maureen O'Sullivan and Eric Byrne and Senator Michael Mullins, I would like to say we will try to finish at a reasonable time because we have other pressing engagements.

There is Angola, Chad, Gabon, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, Gambia, Kenya, Mali, and the list goes on and on.  All I can do is congratulate the work of Amnesty.  Who are the unfortunates in Somalia, where al-Shabab have carried out stonings and mutilations?  This is a terrible read.  It behoves the international organisations, the UN and all the main players in the field of human rights, including the European Union and the High Representative of the Commission, to address the issues.  Quite frankly, it is difficult to comprehend that things can swing as badly as they have in Egypt, from democratic elections that elect a democrat and everybody applauds the process of democracy and the participation in elections to what has been in effect an overnight 180 degrees somersault that has created the most horrendous human rights abuses, such as mass sentencing.  It is tragic for the victims and those living in these regions where this is part of the unwritten culture of the police and security forces and government.<\/p><p>  We need to be focused and reminded every so often about these abuses.

This was not a terribly encouraging realisation.  Amnesty International first launched a major global campaign on torture in 1972.  Looking back over some of our archives, I found that Se&aacute;n MacBride launched the global campaign in 1972.  This work made a significant contribution to the adoption in 1984 of the convention against torture, which is a United Nations treaty.  From memory, I understand 155 states have thus far signed and ratified the convention, while approximately 40 UN member states have not done so.  It has, therefore, been widely adopted, and the absolute prohibition against torture is binding on all states under international law, irrespective of whether they have signed the convention.<\/p><p>  It is a sobering fact that we decided it was necessary to raise the level of the work Amnesty International has been doing on torture since it was founded to a global priority campaign, which means that every single Amnesty International entity will work on the issue in the coming years.  In the past five years, we have reported on 141 states which have ratified the treaty, and in 76 of these - that is, more than half of them - we reported incidents of torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.  This is at the global level.  We have presented an overview of the Middle East and North Africa region in the context of torture.  Torture is, however, a global problem which is prevalent worldwide.<\/p><p>  There is no doubt that the justification of torture that occurred after the September 2001 and the arguments about the so-called war on terror have substantially eroded respect for the safeguards that exist.  As part of the preparations for our campaign, we surveyed public attitudes towards torture in 21 countries spread across the globe.  It was striking that the study found that 82% of people globally wanted stronger mechanisms to protect them from torture and 44% of respondents would fear torture or ill treatment if they were detained or held in custody.  However, the survey also found that 36% of the same cohort believed torture could be justified in certain circumstances.  The practice at the level of states or their security forces is underpinned by an erosion of public rejection of torture as a principle.  This has its basis in the promotion of a culture of fear in which permission is sought to inflict torture on other people. <\/p><p>  To respond directly to Deputy Brendan Smith's question on mechanisms, the UN Committee against Torture reviews compliance with the convention against torture in the same was as any of the other treaty body reporting mechanisms do.  However, the UN Human Rights Committee and Human Rights Council also consider issues related to torture.  It is the Committee against Torture which carries out periodic reviews of compliance among state parties.  Another mechanism that is available is the optional protocol to the convention against torture, which allows for a greater level of engagement.  If individual complaints have not been addressed at state level, the protocol allows them to be raised with the committee for investigation.  While Ireland has not signed the optional protocol, which we strongly urge it to do, it has put in place many of the preventative mechanisms required under the convention.  The optional protocol allows for a greater system of inspection and independent complaints where they arise.  <\/p><p>  A French resolution on Syria is before the Security Council, which is a welcome development.  It includes a specific request that the situation in Syria be referred to the International Criminal Court.  Amnesty International has been calling consistently for this action since the beginning of conflict in Syria and the emergence of evidence of widespread human rights violations being committed by parties to the conflict.  Members will be aware that the Government has also consistently called for this step to be taken.  For this reason, I am confident that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will be supportive of the resolution at international level.  We have not engaged with the Minister directly on the issue because it is only now being tabled.  Resolutions of this nature are of crucial importance if we are try to bring the conflict to an end. <\/p><p>  Another problem that needs urgent address is the plight of refugees who have fled the conflict in Syria.  This is where there is a direct European Union component.  Another area of particular concern to Amnesty International is the way in which Europe responds to those who are seeking protection.  Members will have seen reports as late as yesterday of a boat carrying hundreds of migrants - one report put the number at 400 - that sunk south of Lampedusa in the Mediterranean.  Reports over the weekend indicate that 37 migrants died in a shipwreck just off the coast of Libya.  These are people fleeing the conflicts in the region to seek protection in Europe.  Flight by sea is not the only major issue.  The Italian Government undertook an important initiative in recent years when it commenced a search and rescue operation by its naval forces.  While this is a major step forward, there is also a phenomenon known as \"push-back\".  Greece is committing appalling human rights violations against people seeking protection by literally pushing people back across its borders to prevent them from accessing protection or safety in Europe.  Amnesty International produced a report on this practice in recent weeks.  I will provide an example, because the issue relates directly to Syria.  I recall reading the details of a case involving a group of Syrian refugees who crossed the border from Turkey into Greece.  They were apprehended by the Greek authorities and handed over to men wearing dark or black uniforms with no insignia on them.  Their money, possessions and passports were taken and they were transported in small plastic boats across a river and dumped in Turkey.  Other reports we have documented include one involving a boat of Syrian refugees that was fired on with live rounds by the Greek coast guard as it approached the coast.  People were injured in this incident.  Another boat of refugees was pulled back out into international waters after being disabled by the Greek coast guard.  Dozens of people subsequently died when it sank.  <\/p><p>  There are major concerns about the way in which Europe is responding to people fleeing the atrocities and human rights violations being documented by Amnesty International.  Europe is failing to respond to this need.  To put the issue in context, I recall a startling statistic from the report on the practice of \"push-back\" in Greece.  Europe provided approximately &euro;227 million to Greece to secure its borders but less than &euro;20 million to assist people seeking to access protection.  Greece is a country on Europe's borders and these figures tell us something about Europe's priorities.  While &euro;220 million was provided to keep out people who need protection and prevent them from entering \"Fortress Europe\", only &euro;20 million was provided to respond to people who desperately need protection and support.  Incidentally, states such as Greece and the wider European Union have clear international obligations on protection under international law.<\/p> <p> On the wider question of gender-based violence, over many months and years I am sure this committee has heard about and has a full appreciation of the gender component to human rights violations and concerns.  Deputy Smith flagged it well in the context of what we have seen in Nigeria.  We live in a world where it is possible for an individual who sees himself as a leader to describe how he will commodify and sell girls of the age of nine or 12 into marriage or sexual slavery, and feel entirely justified in doing that.  All of us might see that as extreme, which we should, but it demonstrates an attitude, pervasive across the world, that commodifies and devalues women and girls.  The objection to the notion that women and girls have the same rights as other people, including the right to education, is the basis of many such violations, and this is something we must continue to deal with.<\/p><p> A question was asked about the impact of reports.  These reports have little impact if all they do is sit on shelves.  It is dependent upon people paying attention to what they say, including members of committees such as this one, and our members and others taking action on information we have been able to gather and put in the public domain and the political arena.  Reports, statistics, information and compelling stories are meaningless unless people are provoked into taking this kind of injustice personally and doing something about it.  This committee has a fine record of doing that, and we hope it will continue to do so.<\/p><p> We know we have an impact.  We know it in individual cases.  The existence of the UN Convention against Torture is an example of what can be achieved if a sufficient number of people stand up and demand change, whether it is at a local, national or international level.  The arms trade treaty agreed last year is another example of the power of individual activism and the work of organisations such as Amnesty International that can work in co-operation with like-minded states that want to act with integrity.  In the international arena, Ireland is one of those.<\/p><p> I have tried to deal with the question on the European Union.  The specific question I referred to about the notion of \"Fortress Europe\" is being addressed.  I recognise that is not fully a matter for this committee, but members might encourage colleagues in the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to consider it.  It is a grave and significant issue.<\/p><p> I am sure members are wondering what we are asking them to do.  I want to flag the specific case of Ibrahim Halawa.  As members are aware, Ibrahim has been in prison since August 2014 without referral of his case to court for trial.  He was 17, a minor, upon his arrest.  He was arrested from the al-Fath mosque on 17 August.  We understand he is accused of violence that took place on 16 and 17 August in Ramses Square.  Approximately 16,000 people have been arrested, but he is among thousands held in prisons on very broad and vague accusations including attacking security forces and hindering the work of public institutions.  Those same accusations are faced by many thousands of people although the Egyptian authorities have not established individual criminal responsibility in these cases.  His family, with whom he was in contact, are obviously gravely concerned as they see the level and scale of death sentences and life imprisonment that have been handed down in recent weeks.  <\/p><p> Senator Michael Mullins asked if we take any reassurance from the fact that only one execution has been carried out.  Frankly, no.  Given the number of death sentences that have been handed down and the unprecedented downward spiral witnessed in Egypt in recent months, the answer is \"No\".  It is very difficult to try to apply any kind of logic or reason from a justice perspective to how the Egyptian criminal justice system is functioning at present.  One lawyer who is an Amnesty supporter and member said recently that it is almost an insult to even call these trials or to call these people judges.  This meets no measure of widely understood fair trial processes.  I think he makes a reasonable point.  Our specific calls in relation to Ibrahim Halawa are that he should have access to a fair trial, including independent, fair and impartial investigations, and be released if nothing is proved against him.  Our primary call at this point is that the Egyptian authorities should urgently either refer his case to trial or release him.  We urge the committee - this is a call that is shared by his family, with whom we have been in contact - to make that call directly upon the Egyptian Government via the Egyptian embassy, and to impress upon them the urgency of this particular case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014051400006#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400076600,"counter":375,"content":"<p>As I was in the Chair in the House, I apologise to Mr. O'Gorman that I did not hear his initial submission.  Certainly, since the tragedy at Lampedusa, there has been a clear directive that it is the responsibility of any European country to pick people out of the water, not shoot them.  One of the results of that directive has been that the people who transport asylum seekers from African countries, for example, are dumping them into the water if they see land because they know they have to be picked up.  That is such a dangerous practice.  Mr. O'Gorman mentioned the \"push-back\" from Greece.  I have some sympathy for countries such as Greece and Malta that are in the path of waves of asylum seekers escaping torture, war and so on.  In Greece, the church has to feed a quarter of a million people every day in Athens alone.  It cannot afford to feed its own.  If we make rules in Europe whereby people must be processed in the country in which they land, then we have to ensure we can afford to look after such people properly.  Therefore, it is the responsibility of the rest of Europe either to abandon that rule and take them to be processed in other countries, or to pay Greece to do it.  To sit in judgment on a country that is already starving is very difficult.  It is all right to condemn them, but they are in a difficult situation.<\/p><p>  I read Mr. O'Gorman's report and noted that Nigeria was not mentioned, but my colleague Deputy Brendan Smith mentioned it.  I read in a newspaper article that Amnesty International said there had been a warning of the Boko Haram attack.  We raised the issue at the meeting last week.  The lack of any kind of action or interest from the rest of the world is pervasive.  If one good thing comes out of that attack it will be to highlight the fact that so many people think it is all right that girls should not go to school.  That is a point of view that is quite prevalent in many parts of the world and it is something that has to be fought at every turn.<\/p><p>  I agree with the Chairman that this is only a small committee, and maybe Ireland does not have a big impact.  However, we cannot be silent.  When I raised this issue yesterday the Chairman asked for the Nigerian ambassador to appear before the committee because we want to make it absolutely clear to him that we are very unhappy at Nigeria's lack of action.  I do not know if he has responded.   I appreciate that there has been a little more activity since on a world scale, but we have to use whatever powers we have here and also our powers through the European Union, the Council of Europe and the UN.  We cannot be silent when such incidents take place, or assume that somebody will do something.  Their own government knew about it in advance and did nothing to prevent it, and then did nothing to save the girls subsequently.  I feel I am lecturing somebody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014051400007#F00300","speaker":"1026"},{"type":"speech","time":1400076600,"counter":376,"content":"<p>I presume the reference to August 2014 is a typographical error and that August 2013 is the intended reference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014051400007#F00400","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400076600,"counter":377,"content":"<p>Excuse me.

Will the delegation tell me how this view goes down in Third World countries when they read about or hear people in the West decrying their cultural attitudes to homosexuals and people of different tribes and religions?  What is their reaction when they hear the sickening debate on what constitutes torture when it is engaged in by the United States of America?  Everybody knows about the degree to which one can waterboard a prisoner and how close one can bring a person to death before it constitutes torture.  We know that the policy in the West has been to engage a lot in what we call rendition to bring people to countries such as Jordan and Egypt.  The reason they are brought to such locations is the use of torture is prevalent and prisoners can be subjected to it.  Apparently, there are secret prisons around the world.  They are so secret we do not quite know where they are.  There have been reports on Guantanamo Bay and pictures of men in orange suits being detained, yet the West talks to the rest of the world about how terrible countries are to engage in torture.

He is now 18.<\/p><p>  I agree that we need to have concern, sympathy and perhaps empathy for the Greek Government in the situation in which it has found itself.  I also agree that there is a need for the European Union to look at a burden sharing approach to the issue of protection.  I flagged the question of it giving Greece &euro;227 million to secure its borders versus the &euro;20 million given to respond to the needs of those seeking protection as an example of its priorities, not those of Greece.  Let us remember that is European funding.  <\/p><p>  Previously, there was an Amnesty briefing on detention centres in Libya.  As members of the committee may be aware, there is great concern about Europe externalising its responsibilities and also outsourcing its responsibilities to provide protection.  EU-funded or part-funded detention centres for migrants in Libya, where we have documented significant acts of torture and ill-treatment, is another issue of significant concern for us.  <\/p><p>  We agree that there must be a European response.  That is why we launched a campaign, SOS Europe, which focuses specifically on the question of fortress Europe.  Equally, we will continue to condemn the human rights violations committed by Greece, for which there is no excuse.  Greece has consistently denied the pushbacks, despite all the evidence to the contrary.  We hope to see the European Union taking significant action against Greece on foot of these violations.<\/p><p>  With regard to Boko Haram, towards the end of last week we produced clear evidence that the Nigerian authorities had had a minimum of four hours notice of the attack on Chibok and also that they would have been made aware of, at different levels, the fact that the school was a building of interest to those who were going to attack Chibok, yet they failed to act.  I remember reading that when the Boko Haram fighters reached Chibok, they encountered 17 army personnel who left after a short battle, despite the fact that the knowledge outlined had been available.  We have confirmed and verified, through a number of sources, the names and identities of senior officials to whom these concerns were passed, both at state or federaland at military level.  Obviously, we must be careful about revealing the source of this information for safety reasons, but they include senior military personnel.  We are very clear that the Nigerian authorities had significant and advance warning of the attack on Chibok, yet they did nothing to prevent it from happening.  <\/p><p>  We understand the point made that this is a small committee and the question of what Ireland can do in terms of providing support.  It should continue to do everything it can at the Council of Europe, in the European Union and at the United Nations but also in its ongoing bilateral engagements with other states.  It is in its bilateral discussions and engagements on human rights issues that Ireland has traditionally been able to exert influence through considered, appropriate, sensitive and sensible diplomacy.  Ireland recognises that real change happens through the establishment of relationships, not necessarily by banging on tables and shouting at people.  We believe every opportunity, including bilateral discussions, should be used to advance respect for human rights. <\/p><p>  In the context of the question on the developing world, Deputy Eric Byrne is right.  We have talked about torture, but we gave it a regional focus because of the purpose of this hearing.  However, the Deputy was right to flag the fact that public acceptance of torture, or the view that it is justified, undoubtedly, has its origins in the degrading of international protections and the increasing justification of torture by countries that previously would have championed campaigns against it.  It is particularly revealing - we have talked about this repeatedly - that in 1948 the US prosecuted a Japanese soldier for waterboarding.  However, in the past decade it has spent a lot of time justifying and suggesting waterboarding does not constitute torture and is not illegal in the first instance.  When the great defenders of human rights become the great violators, that gives licence and, frankly, even greater impunity to those who might be minded to engage in it.<\/p><p>  The Deputy referred to the \"black sites\" of secret prisons.  We knew where they were.  There were at least six in Europe, including in Lithuania, Poland and Romania.  Credible information from the European Union, the Council of Europe, the United Nations, journalists and NGOs indicates - this matter is mentioned on page 37 of our document - that there were secret CIA detention sites in Lithuania, Poland and Romania between 2002 and 2006.  Only Romania has held an investigation in the form of a secret parliamentary inquiry that lasted a few hours and the conclusion was kept secret, except for one short public announcement that the country was not involved in any way in rendition and secret detention programmes.<\/p><p>  Of course, it is important to point out that there has never been an investigation conducted by the Government or the State into the role it played in the rendition programme.  There is no doubt, however, that Ireland facilitated the programme.  It is very clear from the evidence revealed in research we carried out for many years that on a number of occasions flights on rendition circuits landed and refuelled at Shannon Airport.  Members may be aware of evidence from Wikileaks cables from the US Embassy in Dublin that a previous Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was aware of the situation.<\/p> <p>Dermot Ahern in those cables made it clear that he believed that it happened on a number of occasions.  There is a need for an investigation in Ireland and that not has been delivered.  It has not been delivered by this Government, despite promises that it would happen when the Government parties were in opposition.  That absolutely needs to happen and it needs to be seen as part of the wider global situation.  If we do not stand for the rule of law, how can we demand that others do?  As a state in this part of the world, we have to account for ourselves and then demand that others are equally accountable.<\/p><p> I have one suggestion as how to some of this can be advanced. We would be enormously grateful if the committee advanced Ibrahim Halawa's case specifically with the Egyptian authorities and the other cases we have highlighted by making specific calls on them.  If the ambassador is invited before the committee, that would be valuable.<\/p><p> With regard to the broader issue of torture, we might agree with the committee a means through which we can share information with it regarding specific countries in order that we could assist it in getting an overview of what are the concerns in those countries, including individual cases.  We will have a focus over the next number of years on five countries - Nigeria, Mexico, the Philippines, Morocco and Uzbekistan - where we have identified that is it possible to achieve breakthroughs that would have a significant impact both within those countries and at regional level.  We would be happy to come back to talk to the committee about each of them, give examples of cases within those countries and perhaps look at ways in which the committee could engage with their embassies in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014051400008#G00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400077800,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I propose to draw up a list to prioritise the issues and the locations.

I am joined by Dr. Des Hogan, acting chief executive of the commission.  Following my short introductory remarks, we will be pleased to answer questions from members.<\/p><p>  It is very welcome that the joint committee has taken the initiative on this issue.  Our appearance at this meeting is evidence of the ongoing strengthening of co-operation between the national human rights institution and the Oireachtas in addressing human rights and equality issues.  As our submission sets out, accountability in the policing structure of the State has been a significant theme in the work of the Irish Human Rights Commission since its inception, and a number of policy statements and legislative observations have been published which underline the importance of a human rights compliant police service in the State.  This is unsurprising given the commission's genesis in the Good Friday Agreement and the influence of the Patten report and attendant policing reforms introduced in Northern Ireland.  Equivalence of rights, North and South, is a key principle in the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p>  Effective oversight bodies, coupled with transparency and engagement with the community, are core mechanisms of human rights accountability.  While the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, under the 2005 Act was a significant step forward, there are deficits in the legislative underpinnings to this complaints mechanism.  In this matter, we welcome the initiative announced yesterday to strengthen the powers of GSOC.  The IHRC considers that, on its own, a mechanism such as this is not necessarily sufficient to provide a comprehensive structure to ensure human rights and equality and accountability in policing.<\/p><p>  Added to the five aspects of accountability identified in the Patten report, namely, democratic accountability, transparency, legal accountability, financial accountability and internal accountability, we identified in our submission a sixth aspect of accountability that has become increasingly evident in the years since the Patten report was published, namely, the responsibility of the state parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to ensure proper accountability structures exist in their police forces to ensure effective investigations following suspicious deaths, in line with Article 2 of the convention; proper planning and oversight of police operations to address foreseeable risks of human rights violations, in line with Articles 2, 8 and 13; and proper complaints mechanisms following any human rights violations that can occur at the hands of police, in line with Article 13 when read in conjunction with Articles 2, 3, 8 and 14.<\/p> <p>We have identified a number of elements which will be essential in the new policing authority in our submission and which we are happy to elaborate on in questions. The main benefit of a new authority is to depoliticise policing or the perception of its politicisation by decoupling the Commissioner&rsquo;s office from that of the Minister for Justice and Equality.<br\/>In relation to complaints, we see these as addressing not just issues of breach of discipline or criminality <i>per se,<\/i>but also issues of disrespect for human rights and dignity, which, although not a breach of discipline, diminishes the public&rsquo;s confidence in the service on the one hand and serious violations of equality and human rights on the other.  As to who should receive and consider those complaints, we argue this should be the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, with reconfigured resources and a strengthened statutory mandate.  We believe all complaints, including those relating to the Commissioner&rsquo;s office and national security issues, should be capable of being investigated, allowing for sufficient safeguards where national security is concerned.  No police station should be out of bounds for investigators as is currently the case under sections 93(3) and 126 of the Act.<br\/>GSOC&rsquo;s formal independence should be strengthened to insulate it from ministerial control.  GSOC should be properly mandated and resourced if we are to avoid the need for future commissions of investigation.  There will need to be continued linkage with Garda disciplinary procedures to allow violations of rights to be addressed quickly in order that systemic issues of low level disrespect of individuals can be acted upon.<br\/>The proposed policing authority offers the opportunity to capture a number of these elements, with the caveat that the independence of GSOC and the national preventative mechanism yet to be established under the UN optional protocol to the torture convention, allowing for inspection of all places of detention, would not be compromised through reporting requirements at odds with the discharge of functions by independent bodies.  We also consider the new authority should prioritise equality and human rights training throughout An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including for its middle and senior management.<br\/>We are happy to take any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Joyce","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400058000,"counter":396,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. David Joyce for his presentation and also keeping within the time limit.

I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Walter Jayawardene, communications manager at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  We are appearing before the committee with a certain sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>.  The committee will have seen in the submission forwarded that we both provided our submission of April 2014 but we also did something we would not usually do for an Oireachtas committee, that is, we resubmitted an old document from November 2006, entitled Implementing Morris [the Morris being the Morris tribunal]: An Agenda for Change: Placing Human Rights at the Core of Policing in Ireland.  A central thrust of that document eight years ago was to look at what we saw as gaps in the 2005 Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, the subject being dealt with today.  It is clear to us that we are in a situation, as my colleague, Mr. David Joyce, has outlined, where human rights had not been placed at the core of policing in Ireland and that in our submission now needs to happen.<br\/>I want to touch briefly on four major points in our April submission and I would be happy to come back to it if the committee has further questions.  On the powers of GSOC, again my colleague, Mr. David Joyce, has touched on the issue.  So far as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties is concerned, there is a need to increase the inadequate powers that GSOC currently enjoys under the 2005 Act.  Our view is that should be done subject to the overarching principle that GSOC should be responsible for the investigation of every complaint against a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It would be nice to hear from GSOC today as some form of categorical reassurance that that is also its own approach.  More specifically, there are four additional things we would like to see GSOC empowered to do.  It should have the power to investigate the Garda Commissioner, which it does not have; it should have access to the PULSE system directly and not through the intermediary of serving members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; it should have the power to receive complaints from serving officers, and we have seen vividly in recent days the consequence of it not having that power; and specifically under section 106 of the 2005 Act, there is a need for GSOC to have the power to conduct a review of practices, policies and procedures on its own initiative in order that it can look at and extract systemic factors that arise from patterns of complaints.  Currently, it needs the consent of the Minister for Justice and Equality to do that and that should change.<br\/>Second, in regard to the Garda authority, I refer to our submission of November 2006 when we said, and it remains true, that civic oversight is the missing piece in the Garda accountability jigsaw.  There is a wide consensus that this should happen.  We welcome the fact that the Government has said it will happen and in a relatively short timeframe.  In my opening statement I will not go into detail on the substance of what we think a Garda authority should do.  Not long ago an interesting paper was prepared by Deputy Anne Ferris and Senator Ivana Bacik on this subject and we have had regard to that.  We will make a detailed submission to the Cabinet committee on justice reform with a deadline of the end of this month.  I am happy also to forward a copy of that submission to the committee if it considers it would be of interest to it in its work.<br\/>Third, the Garda Inspectorate is created by Part 5 of the 2005 Act.  In our April submission we reflected on whether, given the other changes in the architecture of Garda accountability that we are anticipating, there would still be a need in future for the Garda Inspectorate because the cardinal point we would like to convey about the inspectorate, arising from section 117(2) of the 2005 Act, is that despite misapprehensions to the contrary, the Garda Inspectorate is not an independent body.We have set out section 117(2) in full on page six of our submission.  In a statutory sense, it is a creature of the Minister.  That is the way in which it is set up under the 2005 Act.  I have to confess that it was with some measure of astonishment yesterday afternoon that we learned from the new Minister for Justice and Equality and the Taoiseach that it is the inspectorate that is to be asked to carry out a comprehensive inquiry into serious crime investigation, management, operational and procedural issues in the light of the Se&aacute;n Guerin report.  This was presented as being part of a package of measures in response to the Guerin report whereas in our understanding, and this is something the committee might come back to with the representative associations later in the day, more than a year ago, under appendix 3 to the Haddington Road agreement, it was agreed that the inspectorate would conduct a limited review into structure, organisation and staffing of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and into the deployment of members and civilian staff to relevant and appropriate roles.  This was referenced just a fortnight ago by then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, in the D&aacute;il.  This review, essentially, is a review of a human resources dimension arising from the Haddington Road agreement.  If it is now being proposed that the terms of reference given to the Garda Inspectorate under appendix 3 to the Haddington Road agreement should be expanded to look at the investigation of crime, then we should have some clarity on that.  Even if that is the Government's proposal, in the view of the ICCL it does not constitute a robust and independent inquiry into Garda malpractice identified in the Guerin report.<\/p> <p> Lastly, I endorse the comments made by my colleague, the acting chairman of the Irish human rights and equality commission.  It is now seven years since Ireland signed - it has yet to ratify it - the optional protocol to the UN convention against torture and we do not yet have the independent, national preventive mechanism required under the treaty, one of the functions of which would be to carry out independent inspections in Garda stations.  This is another significant lacuna.  If the committee is looking at the 2005 Act in the whole, this missing piece should be included.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400058600,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly and invite Mr. Devitt to make his submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400004#C00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400058600,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for their invitation to address them.  I am joined by Susheela Math who is Transparency International Ireland&rsquo;s legal counsellor and manages our Speak Up helpline.  We have been operating a free telephone helpline for whistleblowers since 2011.  It is part funded by the European Commission.  So far, we have worked with approximately 400 clients, including Garda John Wilson and Sergeant Maurice McCabe who used the helpline in 2012.  We offer advice, referral and information to whistleblowers and witnesses of economic crime and other forms of abuse of authority.  Our submission is largely informed by our engagement with the two whistleblowers mentioned and other whistleblowers who have approached us for advice.  We have also undertaken systematic reviews, with the support of the Department of Justice and Equality in 2009, of the governance of public bodies.  They included a national integrity system study and an addendum study in 2012 which I will be happy to share with committee members after the meeting.<\/p><p>  In summary, Transparency International Ireland welcomes the Government&rsquo;s intention to establish an independent Garda authority.  We also welcome its promise to reform Garda oversight measures and recommend that the Minister&rsquo;s current powers under the 2005 Act be transferred to the new Garda authority, particularly in respect of the appointment of senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and investigation and oversight of the Garda Commissioner.  This change would go some way towards placing some distance between the Garda and the Department of Justice and Equality and address the risk of political interference in policing.<\/p><p>  We also believe members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be able to make reports, under section 62(4) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, directly to the Garda ombudsman, without fear of disciplinary action.

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Damien Walshe, membership development worker with the Irish Traveller Movement.<\/p><p>  I welcome the opportunity for our organisation to feed into a vital process to ensure the police force has an independent process to oversee policing.  I stress from the outset that the Irish Traveller Movement recognises the difficult job the women and men of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na face in their work, facing not only dangerous and potentially life-threatening situations on a daily basis but also the impact of cutbacks to their services, which places additional pressures on members of the Garda in carrying out their functions.  The Irish Traveller Movement has a strong relationship with the racial, intercultural and diversity office of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our organisation has been regularly invited to talk to trainees in Templemore on the issues Travellers face and the work we do as a movement. <\/p><p>  As committee members will have seen in our submission, our members, local Traveller organisations, have stressed the positive relationships that have been built between Travellers, Traveller organisations and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a local level through initiatives such as the local Traveller inter-agency committees.  This work is to be applauded as it has had a substantial influence in building trust between members of my community and members of the Garda.  Trust in the policing service, given the pivotal role An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plays, is vital for every member of Irish society, regardless of ethnicity.  However, as noted in our submission, trust in the police force among Travellers is not as strong as it is among the general population.  Our submission to the committee stressed and our presentation will stress the need for an independent policing board and suggest Traveller representation on the board will be vital to build on this trust into the future. <\/p><p>  In comparison with a Garda public attitudes survey, PAS, a Traveller-ethnic minority communities attitudes survey, TEMCAS, conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2007 showed significant levels of dissatisfaction with the force among Travellers.  While 14% of the general population surveyed were &ldquo;very satisfied&rdquo; with the service of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, only 5% of Travellers were.  More worrying, while 16% of the general population were &ldquo;dissatisfied&rdquo;, 26% of Travellers were and while only 3% of the general population were &ldquo;extremely dissatisfied&rdquo; with the service of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, 22% of Travellers were.  Therefore, we can see from a survey carried out by the force that there is cause for concern in terms of the relationship between Travellers and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We note that this survey, which has not been replicated since, was carried out before the establishment of local Traveller inter-agency committees, whereby relationships have developed between Traveller organisations and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <\/p><p>  The Traveller-ethnic minority communities attitudes survey suggested attitudes towards the Garda were related negatively to personal experience of the Garda.  In both surveys with the general public and minority groups those who had no contact were more likely to express higher levels of overall satisfaction with the Garda than those who had contact.  This is borne out by concerns raised by our members in preparing our submission to the committee.  Many Travellers do not believe the Garda offers protection to them as Travellers when they are the victims of crime -  for example, there is a slow response time to calls about incidents on Traveller halting sites.  Travellers believe garda&iacute; see them only as criminals, never as victims, and cite the practice of frequently stopping and searching or questioning Travellers, especially van drivers and young Traveller men, which further erodes trust between the force and the community.  Some Travellers report frequent Garda car patrols on halting sites or group housing schemes, up to three times a day in some cases.  Travellers believe this is merely to keep them under surveillance, as during these patrols there is no interaction between garda&iacute; and the community.  The surveillance, or perceived surveillance, of the entire community by garda&iacute; further alienates Travellers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Installation of CCTV cameras beside existing or planned Traveller accommodation, without notification or public consultation, erodes trust further.<\/p><p>  On direct contact between Travellers and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while many Travellers have positive relationships not only in reporting crime and making inquiries, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been tasked with carrying out evictions of Traveller families, which strains relationships.  Travellers often believe the use of armed response units and large numbers of garda&iacute; when other State officials are visiting halting sites creates a conflictual stance whereby the Garda is no longer their police force. <\/p><p>  On Travellers using the Garda, some Travellers do not believe they are treated with respect when they need to use Garda stations, for example, there is a lack of eye contact and an unfriendly manner, while garda&iacute; casually drop into an unrelated conversation the fact that they know other family members who have criminal records, which makes innocent people feel criminalised and that they have been racially profiled.<\/p> <p>This negative relationship is not only noted by our members, it is borne out by research carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which was alluded to earlier.<\/p><p> The work that has been undertaken and the relationships that have been built up through the hard work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local Traveller organisations has been severely damaged recently by the allegations by Garda whistleblowers of ethnic profiling of Travellers, including Traveller infants, on the Garda PULSE system.<\/p><p> The Irish Traveller Movement has been inundated with calls and e-mails from Travellers who fear their details and those of their children have been entered onto the PULSE system simply because of their identity.  These few allegations have caused such widespread distress among the community and have seriously impacted on relationships between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Travellers in Ireland.  I wrote to the then Minister for Justice and Equality asking for Se&aacute;n Guerin's investigation to be broadened specifically to investigate these claims.  Unfortunately, this did not materialise and an opportunity to restore Travellers' confidence in our police force was lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400004#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Brigid Quilligan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400059200,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I must ask you to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400005#D00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400059200,"counter":405,"content":"<p>I will wrap it up.

We are grateful for the invitation to address the committee today to raise some of the points in our submission.<\/p><p>  Recent events have undermined public confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the structures to provide external oversight of the service.  The Guerin inquiry has shone an important light on how one Garda whistleblower and his complaints were treated and we welcome the commitment of the Minister for Justice and Equality to establish a commission of investigation as the inquiry has recommended.  I note and echo what Mr. Mark Kelly has set out regarding the role of the inspectorate in the process as proposed by the Minister.<\/p><p>  While we welcome the committee reviewing the legislation on Garda oversight we urge that the internal accountability and human rights promotion mechanisms within the police service not be overlooked in the debate.  Amnesty International participated in the Garda human rights working group, established in 1999, and has been a member of its strategic human rights advisory committee along with others, such as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, since it was established in 2005.  We have thus seen several high-level projects undertaken internally to further the service's human rights compliance, including the 2005 human rights audit and its implementation of the action plan for the implementation of that audit.  Garda&iacute; need to be supported and resourced to move these initiatives forward and they must be prioritised within the service.<\/p><p>  I will highlight our main areas of priority and refer the committee to our submission for further explanation on each.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2995 adopts too narrow a definition of cases under the automatic and mandatory jurisdiction of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Where complaints are related to acts not resulting in death or serious harm, GSOC may refer such complaints to the Garda Commissioner for investigation.  GSOC may decide to supervise such investigations but it is under no legal obligation to do so.<\/p><p>  We have suggested that the Act should provide an explicit presumption in favour of investigation by GSOC of all complaints with any referred for investigation by the Garda expressly confined to minor complaints.  However, I note the interventions by the ICCL and the Irish Human Rights Commission today suggesting that all complains be mandatorily investigated by GSOC and, therefore, we concur.  The involvement of GSOC in a supervisory function should be mandatory rather than discretionary in all cases and the exclusion of the Garda Commissioner and complaints of serving members from GSOC's jurisdiction should be removed.<\/p><p>  Under section 102 of the Act the Garda Commissioner is obliged to refer to GSOC any matter that appears to indicate the conduct of a Garda member may have resulted death or serious harm.  Again, this is too narrow a range to be automatically referred to GSOC.<\/p><p>  GSOC should be empowered to conduction an inquiry under sections 62(2)(f) and 106 into any practice, policy or procedure of the Garda of its own volition rather than at the request or consent of the Minister.<\/p><p>  International human rights law demands that police accountability mechanisms be institutionally completely independent of government and free from political influence.  GSOC needs far more functional independence from the Department of Justice and Equality, especially in terms of its budget.  Ideally, the Act should also provide an independent selection and appointment process for members of GSOC involving representatives of civil society, especially those representing the interests of marginalised groups.  This is no aspersion on the current members of GSOC, rather a generic recommendation Amnesty International makes in all jurisdictions.  Should the Government process its commitment to establish an independent policing authority, that body should be given a key role in this regard.<\/p><p>  Another matter is the live issue of whistleblowers and the flawed confidential recipient process.  The confidence of garda&iacute; to report concerns confidentially and to have those concerns addressed is of critical importance to ensure that individual or systemic weaknesses in the service can be revealed.  Whistleblowers serve a significant public interest function and should be encouraged rather than dissuaded from disclosing information.<\/p><p>  The degree of ministerial influence over An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na committed to under the Act undermines its actual or perceived independence.  Amnesty International wholeheartedly supports the establishment of an independent and representative agency with responsibility for Garda oversight and appointment.  We recommended this measure in 2004 and we look forward to seeing the details of what is proposed.<\/p><p>  The Act or other relevant legislation must provide robust oversight of Garda covert surveillance functions and operations as well as its national security and intelligence functions.  We echo what Mr. Kelly said with regard to urging the committee to press for Ireland finally to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the expeditious establishment of a national preventive mechanism required thereunder.<\/p><p>  The manner in which police reform and accountability happens can be as important as the content of the reforms.  The Government must be pressed to thoroughly consult with the Irish Human Rights Commission, NGOs and other members of civil society in deciding and implementing its reforms.  It is especially important that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of all ranks are engaged.  They must feel that accountable policing based on human rights is in their interests too and that they are being supported to fulfil their duties accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400005#D00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Crowley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400059200,"counter":408,"content":"<p>I am joined by the other commissioners, Ms Foley and Mr. FitzGerald.  I thank the committee for the invitation to assist with its work on improving the effectiveness of legislation relating to oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 12 proposals in our submission received by the committee represent the 12 ways that amendments to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 would most affect our ability to do our job effectively.  The proposals in the submission focus on improving the capacity of GSOC to effectively achieve resolution of issues on strengthening GSOC's independence - a crucial characteristic of any oversight agency - which has been perceived as compromised under current legislation, not least by the United Nations.  I will set out the key recommendations made in the submission.<\/p><p>  We recommend new approaches to dealing with minor complaints to facilitate effective resolution.  Many complaints to GSOC do not allege serious misconduct or criminal behaviour but breaches of discipline, for example, discourtesy or the poor response of a garda to an incident.  The current system favours these being dealt with via a lengthy, bureaucratic, disciplinary investigation.  In addition to the cost to the taxpayer, this approach does not necessarily always address the fundamental issue of complaint.  GSOC has proposed new approaches to dealing with these kinds of relatively minor complaints to decrease cost and increase efficiency and satisfaction.  These include removing legislative barriers to informal resolution in order that more than the current 1% of complaints can be resolved informally, i.e. allowing GSOC to decide when it is appropriate for this route to be taken.  It also includes creating new protocols for dealing with issues relating to customer service.<\/p><p>  We have also proposed new approaches to dealing with more serious complaints.  Currently, for serious disciplinary issues, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may undertake investigations into complaints following referral from GSOC.  GSOC believes that the concept of garda&iacute; conducting investigations on our behalf is questionable in terms of independence and effectiveness and the commission proposes the discontinuation of this arrangement.  By the way, undertaking all investigations by itself would have considerable resource implications for GSOC and these would have to be taken into account were this recommendation seen favourably by the committee.  In the event the practice is retained we recommend that all investigation reports should come back to GSOC for decision on appropriate next steps.  Furthermore, we are asking for adherence to protocols around investigations to be put on a statutory footing.<\/p><p>  We would like to see the Garda Commissioner becoming subject to oversight.  Currently the Act states that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not include the Garda Commissioner.  Therefore, that officeholder is outside the remit of GSOC.  GSOC believes that effective oversight of policing, and public confidence therein, favours the Garda Commissioner being subject to independent oversight and that legislation should be changed to allow for that.<\/p><p>  We believe the definition of serious harm should be expanded.  The Act provides for investigation by GSOC, following referral by the Garda Commissioner, of any matter appearing to indicate that the conduct of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may have resulted in the death of, or serious harm to, a person.<\/p> <p>The definition of \"serious harm\" does not encompass, for example, sexual offences of a serious nature; therefore, such offences allegedly committed by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na do not merit referral to GSOC for independent investigation and can be investigated internally, which we do not believe is fair to any party involved.  GSOC believes there should be flexibility introduced by the Legislature in order that, as society&rsquo;s definition of \"serious harm\" evolves, the definition and thus the types of offence which merit independent investigation may be expanded. <\/p><p> We recommend removing limitations on GSOC in conducting and publishing examinations of policy, practice and procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Act provides for such examinations, but, in reality, the defined circumstances are so narrow that this has only been done once to date.  <\/p><p> While there are several other matters covered in our submission, the last specific proposal to which I will refer concerns the nomination of GSOC as confidential recipient.  Recent events have suggested the existing system for the raising of issues by Garda members requires significant overhaul.  While provisions would need to be made to ensure GSOC would not become a mediator in HR disputes within the organisation, it could be nominated as an external confidential recipient, with the capacity to receive complaints from serving Garda members about serious corruption, malpractice or systemic issues. <\/p><p> It is important to highlight again that an overarching recommendation is that the objectives of GSOC, as set down by the Act, be fundamentally reset in order that, rather than favouring a system of seeking to apportion blame on garda&iacute; for specific actions, the legislation will enable us to actively seek a resolution of issues and provide feedback for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to help to bring about long-term change.  <\/p><p> GSOC looks forward to having an opportunity to work with the committee, the Legislature, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other parties in the next few months to assist in the practical application of these and other recommendations.  We want to build a robust, effective, workable system of oversight in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400005#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400059800,"counter":410,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Brien for his opening statement and keeping within the time limit.

They are doing the job they were given to do under the 2005 Act.  The implementation of the suggestion made in our submission will depend a little on the eventual redesign of the architecture of accountability systems.  The fundamental question that we think needs to be addressed in the new architecture is whether the oversight function needs to sit in a completely independent body.  The suggestion made in our submission that has been echoed by colleagues that section 106 be amended in order that GSOC can look at policies, practices and procedures would, in itself, scoop up quite a bit of what the inspectorate does.  We have had a good look at its reports - it makes one substantive report per year and has done so since 2006 - which are very good and technical in nature.  They benchmark operational policing against best practice.  There is a place for that role to be continued, but we question whether, once the Garda authority has assumed the oversight functions of the inspectorate, it particularly would make sense to have this happening as an adjunct to the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>  There has been much talk in recent days about a change of culture in policing.  If that change is to happen, it has to happen within the police service.  We would like to see the police service assume responsibility for benchmarking against best international practice.  The 2005 Act also created the Garda professional standards unit, GPSU, which works closely with the inspectorate.  Our view at this stage, without having seen the new accountability architecture, is that quite a bit of what the inspectorate does on a routine basis could be done by the Garda professional standards unit, with oversight by a combination of GSOC under a revised section 106 and the new Garda authority.  To give a direct answer to the Senator's question, what the inspectorate does still needs to happen, but we think the operational functions could be vested in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the oversight functions in independent bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400006#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1400059800,"counter":413,"content":"<p>That is very helpful.

We have looked at and counted the number of reviews, inquiries and investigations under way and counted ten or eleven as being active in various ways, including the Haddington Road review by the inspectorate to which I referred.  The real problem is twofold.  First, we are facing into a period of weeks and months when from week to week, month to month, there will be new revelations and findings, starting perhaps with the Cooke report, followed by the Fennelly review.  If it is done in a piecemeal fashion, public confidence in the integrity of Garda accountability and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to be affected.  Second, the effect of having this series of reviews which are partially overlapping but with different mandates and terms of reference is that we will not get the whole picture.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties stated previously that in its view one of the single most important reviews being undertaken was the review this committee was undertaking because it was at least focusing on the legislation as a nexus.  If the committee makes recommendations about how the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 should be amended, these recommendations will need to include the full panoply of accountability changes.

It is quite unusual to have this absolute conflation.  From the beginning of the current spate of Garda-related controversies, it first arose in connection with the allegations of bugging of our colleagues in the ombudsman commission.  One of the points we have been highlighting is that the legislative framework under the 1993 and 2009 legislation for the oversight of surveillance and intelligence activities is inadequate, that it is not subject to appropriate supervision or surveillance.  We fully appreciate that there are sensitivities, but GSOC stated in its submission that even if the Garda Commissioner were to become subject to its authority, there might have to be a space carved out related to State security.  To be honest, I am not sure the Irish Council for Civil Liberties agrees with this.  Later this year representatives of a treaty body, the European committee for the prevention of torture, CPT, are again coming to Ireland.<\/p> <p>That body has never accepted that there are aspects of policing that fall within its mandate which it should not be able to look at simply because they are classified as issues of state security.  The top-level message we have taken from Mr. Guerin's report is that we cannot have a situation where a Garda Commissioner defines what is and is not to be looked at by independent bodies.  Unless we tackle that issue head on, it will continue to be a very contentious area.  There is a need to strengthen independent oversight of intelligence activities and seriously consider decoupling the conflation of the two roles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400006#E00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400060400,"counter":419,"content":"<p>It is interesting that the Human Rights Commission's submission raises this point of whether policing and national security functions should be severed.

I do not know if Deputy Anne Ferris was present earlier when I stated one of the things we had examined was the very interesting paper which she, Senator Ivana Bacik and others had drawn up a short time ago.  The ICCL has not reached a settled view on the matter, but our preliminary opinion is that we need to consider a model which would not be a carbon copy of the Northern Ireland Policing Board but which would be inspired by the same general principles.  We will be examining this matter in greater depth in the coming weeks in order to identify exactly how we might establish democratic accountability in such a body.  That type of accountability would imply a measure of political participation but without over-politicising the board.  The cardinal point for us is that appointments to such a board should be made in an independent and transparent manner.  Any form of political participation should be organised in such a fashion that the independence of the new authority would be crystal clear.<\/p><p>  I did some work with the Northern Ireland Policing Board immediately on its establishment and for several years thereafter.  I found it quite remarkable how a professionally run and administered and well chaired policing board could result in people from very different political perspectives actually acting in a very coherent way in the interests of good policing.  The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, when this proposal was first mooted in the context of the 2005 Act, is on record as stating he thought the Houses of the Oireachtas could take the place of a Garda authority and that, therefore, one was not needed.  Recent events have shown that that is not really the model we want.  At the same time, however, the ICCL is not at this stage ruling out some measure of political accountability being built into the mechanism.  However, we need to give further consideration to how this might be done in practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400008#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400061000,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I echo what Mr. Kelly has just pointed out.

One of the biggest drags on our organisation at present is the lowest level of complaints.  I know people focus rightly on the very serious ones when they occur but in terms of resources and day to day work, one of the biggest issues we face is that the informal resolution process provided for in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 does not work because we do not have the capacity to decide when it is appropriate to apply.  In effect, there exists a veto and the result is that less than 1% of the complaint load is dealt with in this manner.  I would have thought it would have a huge attraction for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the sense that through the informal resolution process we can write guidelines, and those guidelines may include a non-recording of a sanction.  For the complainant, whoever they may be, it includes the real advantage that they may get their issue resolved.  Currently, the entire focus of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act is about apportioning blame and at that entry level of complaints, so to speak, very often the complainants who speak to us are not necessarily looking to have blame or a sanction apportioned on a member of the Garda; they are looking to have their problem resolved.  We would like to see that changed, and we see our organisation having oversight of that and any solution being signed off by us.  Echoing the question Deputy Collins asked, we see front-line management having a serious role in achieving that resolution but we see our organisation as the oversight body being the logical people to sign off on it.

Our recommendation is to allow for some internal facility that would provide advice to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on how they can report.  If the investigation and the advisory function is not separated, it can create some confusion in the mind of the whistleblower as to whether they should be reporting the concern and asking advice about the concern, and how they should deal with it.  To put it in clear language, it is worth distinguishing between help lines and hot lines.  The help line offers advice; a hot line offers someone an opportunity to report.  We would suggest that the confidential recipient offers members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na an opportunity to seek advice in the first instance on reporting to GSOC, a Member of the Oireachtas or directly to a senior member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400009#H01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Devitt"},{"type":"speech","time":1400061600,"counter":464,"content":"<p>Mr. Devitt is saying that in many organisations there is a culture of encouraging people to point out deficiencies, which benefits the organisation in the long run anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400009#H01700","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400061600,"counter":465,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p> <p>I make the point that it is important to separate grievances from protected or public interest disclosures, and having someone to advise one on whether one is dealing with a grievance or a potential protected disclosure can be helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400009#H01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Devitt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400062200,"counter":467,"content":"<p>My next question is for the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, which in fairness has acknowledged the professionalism of the Garda Inspectorate, and the curricula vitae of the three senior personnel in the inspectorate show they obviously are people of the highest calibre.  However, the ICCL makes the point that in the forthcoming new dispensation its existence might not be necessary.  The Garda Inspectorate, which will give a presentation to the joint committee later this afternoon, has made a submission in which it mentions amending legislation to give it the right to take initiatives itself and not to be obliged to rely on the Minister.  The ICCL refers to the inspectorate as being a creature of the Minister, while it appears to desire to be free of that control and to have its own initiative in these matters.  What are the ICCL's thoughts in this regard?  I hear its points on a Garda professional standards unit and how there will be a new police authority, as well as a Garda ombudsman with newly strengthened powers.  Another point made by the Garda Inspectorate, which strikes me as logical and sensible, is that there are crossovers regarding the roles and responsibilities of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and the Garda Inspectorate.  Would it not be better were they to co-operate on such matters and, perhaps on a statutory footing, meet on a regular basis to ascertain how they could deliver their respective responsibilities efficiently?  I seek the ICCL's thoughts on this point.  In fairness, I am asking questions of the ICCL that are ahead of its ability to have sight of the inspectorate's submission and its presentation to be made later on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400010#J00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1400062200,"counter":468,"content":"<p>That is an issue.

I have not seen the submission and certainly at the very minimum will watch the hearing this afternoon with close interest.  It is the substance that matters.  Briefly, it might be interesting to look back to the history of why we have what we have in the 2005 Act.  The original proposal brought forward was that there would be something called a Garda Inspectorate that would have ombudsman-type functions.  At the time, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and other organisations were highly critical of the proposed model.  In particular, we pointed out that if one was to have something that effectively was an ombudsman, one clearly should call it an ombudsman and give it ombudsman-type functions.  The nomination of our three colleagues to GSOC - or their predecessors - was the eventual outworking of that.  However, there were bits that were left over from the then Government's proposal, which were gathered into Part 5 of the Act, and this unusual statutory creature which we now call the inspectorate was created.  There are not many similar models, although, for example, there is something similar within the Ministry of the Interior in Portugal.<\/p><p>  To be brutally frank, our view is that the inspectorate, at least as currently constituted, has not really proven its worth.  It has done the job it was given to do by statute, but one has heard, for example, that its current chairman never actually had a sit-down face-to-face working meeting with the Minister, who effectively is the line manager of the inspectorate.  The essence of what was the aspiration for the inspectorate is extremely important to deliver upon.  The existing model plainly has not worked.  Our view is that if we are now going to recalibrate - and, in particular, if consideration is being given to the establishment of a Garda authority - there is scope for a Garda authority to do many of the valuable aspects of what the Inspectorate does.  In particular, to return to the Northern Ireland Policing Board for one second and then to conclude, one thing it did in its early years was that when it felt it did not have the required expertise within the body, it appointed expert people to come and help it.  For example, it appointed a human rights legal adviser, Keir Starmer, who subsequently went on to become a distinguished Director of Public Prosecutions in England and Wales.  He did some excellent work in developing monitoring frameworks and audit tools and a range of practical measures, which is exactly the kind of thing a Garda Inspectorate should do.  The ICCL is not particularly hung up on one model or another, but we think that if the architecture is to be recalibrated the oversight really should go to bodies that will be genuinely independent and which have that as their tradition and legacy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400010#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1400062200,"counter":470,"content":"<p>As a final question, I obviously had questions on intelligence, security and policing and whether functions should be separated or held together.

In the United Kingdom, the services are separated into MI5 and MI6.  There is also GCHQ, which is responsible for data monitoring, and then police forces have responsibility for terrorist intelligence and other criminal intelligence.  I am unsure whether Ireland needs a foreign intelligence service.  We do not need spies in our embassies overseas.  In general, we get whatever information we need from friendly police forces and intelligence services anyway.  I am unsure what purpose would be served by establishing a separate intelligence agency here.  What would it monitor that G2 in the Defence Forces or the crime and security branch in the Phoenix Park are not already doing?  To my mind, the purpose of an intelligence service, particularly in a country as small as this with few foreign commercial and economic interests, is to prevent crime and physical threats to the State.  I do not wish to have, nor would I support the establishment of, an intelligence body that would scrutinise the private affairs of Members of the Oireachtas or members of the media or civil society, as have other intelligence agencies, which gather details on every aspect of the private lives of such individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400010#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Devitt"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400062200,"counter":473,"content":"<p>Amnesty International would not point to any one state as a model of excellent practice.  However, there are lots of examples of really poor practice, and the states that are engaging with their national populations on disclosures regarding the levels of personal data that are being captured have shown quite a lot of weaknesses.  At a minimum, there should be both judicial oversight and parliamentary engagement.  It would be optimal to have some sort of parliamentary committee that engages with the national intelligence and security service functions.  However, whenever I hear the term \"national security\", the phrase \"happy hunting ground\" springs to mind.  The Dick Marty inquiry into secret detentions and conditions in 2005 referred to Europe as a happy hunting ground for foreign secret services.  It was reported that no state has any idea of what other states are doing in its territory and consequently, I do not believe that anybody really knows what is the best practice in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400010#J00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Fiona Crowley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400062200,"counter":474,"content":"<p>As the Irish Council for Civil Liberties is currently suing GCHQ in the British courts and the National Security Agency in the New York federal court, we probably are not in a position to give members a model of best practice.

In reality, in respect of crime and security, we have Special Branch activities within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Mr. John Devitt mentioned G2 within the Defence Forces.  Our understanding is that they work hand in glove and between them effectively constitute Ireland's spying service.  The point is that it is not subject to any effective oversight, and one point that is very clear in better models of practice is that one has effective oversight.  One has tribunals and the possibility of challenging the activities or at least knowing who is doing which parts of the job.

GSOC, for example, attended the meeting.  At the time we were looking at the fact that Ireland was soon to ratify the optional protocol to the UN Convention Against Torture and all Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  That has not happened and there has been a very worrying lag.  In fact, with hindsight, if we had the independent mechanism, some of the issues that arise today might have come up in independent reports.  The whole idea of the optional protocol and the UN disability convention is to bring in third dimension protection where one has national bodies that do what the UN Committee for the Prevention of Torture, CPT, or the international bodies do routinely.  One has a national body that is designated in statute to go into any place of detention in the State.  One is talking about Garda stations, prisons, psychiatric institutions and in some cases nursing homes when de facto detention happens.  We could also be talking about airports and parts of airports where the possibility of de facto detention might occur.<\/p><p>  That is what the mechanism is.  It is either a single body, which is the model in some states, or it is a number of bodies that are designated to carry out the function itself.  There are advantages for single bodies over multiples ones.  For example, in the United Kingdom there are multiple bodies but then one does not have a lot of coming together of the different bodies because of mandates overlapping and people not wanting to step on others&rsquo; toes and the duplication of issues.<\/p><p>  The requirement is not as clear as the disability convention but there are also moves to say that the body that is set up must be independent as well.  For example, internationally, we would have a situation in Europe where a lot of national human rights institutions are designated as the national preventative mechanism.  A lot of them are ombudsman-type bodies which already go into prisons and such places so they already have those powers.  We in the commission have said we would be very reluctant to take on that role unless we were given adequate resources because the last thing one wants to do is not to be able to discharge the very important mission properly because one is trying to do that and other things as well.<\/p><p>  As Mr. Kelly has said, it is probably another element missing from the current picture when we are looking at the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  One could ask whether it is something that needs to happen anyway.  If one has the GSOC body which is receiving complaints, adjudicating and acting on them, this is the other part where a body does on-the-spot inspections and looks at the systems and practices underlying that.<\/p><p>  The opposite is the case in the prison system.  We have an Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention but we do not have a prison ombudsman.  The Mental Health Commission has different roles as well.  That is the idea.  It is a case of the CPT doing spot checks but the visits are made by the national body so one does not have to go to the international body with complaints.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400011#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Des Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1400062800,"counter":480,"content":"<p>My next question is for the ICCL.

There is a tripartite question for me.  I would not look at it in terms of merger; I would be looking at it in terms of two independent bodies &ndash; GSOC on the one hand and the new Garda authority on the other &ndash; asking themselves whether they have within their existing capacity the expertise to do this new role and, if not, what they need to do to address that.

Travellers are afraid to report crimes - for instance, if a woman is experiencing domestic violence on a site.

Having listened to Ms Quilligan and Mr. Fitzgerald as to the importance of basic customer service training, it seems to be something that was lost along the way.  I am not <i>au fait<\/i>with the precise training methods used in Templemore.  I am aware it is a significant degree that the recruits go through.  It is a level 8 FETAC qualification.  I wonder if the importance of customer service is lost during the years of training.  Ms Quilligan mentioned the importance of professionalism and politeness in the carrying out of duties.  That reduces the number of questions and queries that are referred on through complaints and procedures which reduces the workload for everybody here and will improve the trust that is there.  Bolstering that level of training is of critical importance.  We should as a committee get our teeth into that.  It is extremely important.<br\/>I have a number of questions, some of which will be for specific witnesses and others of which will be general.  It would be very welcome for witnesses to contribute even where I do not address them specifically.  Mr. Fitzgerald mentioned systemic issues of customer service and service delivery.  I appreciate what he said in terms of his role as an ombudsman.  Is the implementation of best practice in that particular area something he feels GSOC can make a contribution to?

It was intended to get over the idea that policing is simply about control, coercive policing and crime prevention, detection and investigation.

The report pointed out that within a large institution where there are policies in place, racism can be unconscious and unintended and have disproportionate impacts on minority groups.  There were instances recently around allegations about PULSE and Traveller infants and also the incident last year where Roma children were taken into care.  The report is due on that.  Potentially, there needs to be an ongoing investigation into practices within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a requirement for an ongoing audit to see what is happening.

In those circumstances, Ireland will be found to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.  There needs to be a link when we define service to include middle management staff and to ensure that their service is also to the people who report to them.

I ask members, witnesses and visitors in the public gallery to switch their mobile telephones to airplane, safe or flight mode, depending on the device.  It is not enough to put them in silent mode, as this will maintain interference in the room and negatively impact on broadcasts.  We have had a number of communications from broadcasters who say that telephones active in the vicinity of microphones interfere with the broadcast and they cannot pick up what people are saying.  We want people to know what witnesses and members are saying and, therefore, I ask them to switch the mode.<\/p><p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.

The men and women at sergeant and inspector rank are honest, hardworking, committed and dedicated to their roles in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They have demonstrated this by studying in their own time and passing at least six legal, policing and management exams and by having been successful in a minimum of four promotion interviews.  These people are the first line supervisors and managers and play a pivotal role in the running of the Garda organisation.<\/p><p>  That An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be open to scrutiny, examination and oversight is a given for AGSI members.  The processes, however, must be clear and the guidelines under which this oversight is carried out must be adhered to.  It cannot be a case of \"make it up as you go along\" with timeframes and fair procedures cast aside at will.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 sought to codify and to integrate the organisation into one statute.  From a discipline point of view, I refer to the most significant changes within the Act.  The introduction of section 39, statutory duty to account, was brought about in the aftermath of the disclosures in the Morris tribunal, which was ongoing at the time, and, in particular, in respect of difficulties senior officers had espoused by reason of the fact that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would not answer questions or would not \"account\".  Prior reasoning was that a member did not want to incriminate himself or herself or to provide information which may lead to a disciplinary process.  This was always misconceived and in the normal relationship that exists between an employer and employee, the duty to account applies as a matter of law.<\/p><p>  This section was amended by section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2005.  In practice this appears to work but it has also been open to abuse.<\/p> <p>It has led to the use of the section to compel individuals in the disciplinary process.  That is to say that after the process of the disciplinary regulations has been initiated, the deciding officer, investigator or otherwise invokes this section which clearly should not be the case.  It is a breach of discipline not to comply with a properly made direction but it should be clarified that this section cannot be invoked in the disciplinary process as that process is fully covered in the 2007 regulations.<\/p><p> The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Discipline) Regulations 2007 came into operation on 1 June 2007.  They brought in a two-tier element for minor and non-minor breaches of the discipline regulations.  The general disciplining particularly on the non-minor side has been open to abuse where it has become simply a paper exercise and used in circumstances to discipline individuals within a division without any real recourse.  The procedure is that the appointing officer appoints the deciding officer.  In the very nature of how this is organised, there is a degree of prejudgment, particularly where no specific reasons are given, and in the decisions no reference is made to the facts relied on or ignored in reaching the decisions.<\/p><p> The review by the appointing officer is even less effective and I am not aware of any review that was successful save for maybe a reduction in a fine or other disciplinary action or allowing of a review in respect of one of a number of breaches otherwise upheld.  The process should be more open and transparent and not be dealt with within the Garda division in which the person under investigation is working.  Any determination of facts in any event should be dealt with where the Garda member gets a fair hearing and puts forward his or her case and cross-examines where necessary.  This is simply not available to them at this time in this process.  Importantly, a person should be entitled at an interview in respect of these minor breaches to have their legal representative present.<\/p><p> Regarding standard of proof, in the discipline regulations a breach is to be established on the balance of probabilities.  Clearly, the balance of probabilities is what applies in civil law; in other words, one proves, for example, 51% in favour of a particular proposition and then on that basis the balance is tipped in favour of the proponent.  Obviously, when dealing with breaches of discipline and in particular the serious ones, this leaves us with 49% possible doubt which does not arise in this standard but which has grave effects on a Garda member, including dismissal from his or her position.  Consideration should be given in the more serious matters to establishing the proofs beyond a reasonable doubt when an individual's career is in the balance.<\/p><p> Suspension is another area of contention where there is no readily available review of a suspension order when a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is subject to an inquiry - either discipline or criminal.  There are clearly no guidelines given concerning suspension save that the opinion of the Commissioner having regard to the circumstances when rendering such a course desirable is in the interests of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is noticeable with internal investigations and also those being governed by GSOC.  There are huge delays in our legal representatives' dealings with GSOC.  In the case of one member who is currently suspended, long after the initial investigation was notified the AGSI solicitor is unable to obtain a proper update from GSOC or enter a process where the AGSI client can make submissions concerning the lifting of the suspension which would have regard to factors in the case, including the nature of the alleged offence or breach, delay, etc.<\/p><p> The rate of pay of a Garda member on suspension must be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  All civil servants who face suspension are automatically granted suspension allowance or pay at 100%.  A garda is allowed 75% of basic pay, or following intense scrutiny of his or her financial situation, a maximum of 90% of basic pay.  This of course is not 75% of the garda's pay, as allowances make up almost 24% of his or her pay.  This provision must be regularised to bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into line with others in the public service.  The suspension of staff occurs more often in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na than in other agencies.  It must be remembered that in penalising the garda by the reduction in suspension allowance as occurs at present, the garda's spouse and children are also penalised, which is wrong.<\/p><p> The 2005 Act contains several features which should bring about proper oversight of the workings of the organisation.  We have strategy statements, annual reports, a three-year review report, a professional standards unit, joint policing committees, section 43 accountability, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Inspectorate.  Each of the sections and parts of the Act set out the various frameworks.<\/p><p> It seems to be that several organisations should be merged into one and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na through the Commissioner should answer to an independent body such as a Garda authority which is wholly independent of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Minister.  The make up of this authority and the selection of people to serve on such authority are vital.  At present, the Government is keen to make all the decisions, which is a cause of concern to the AGSI.  It is suggested that a group of Deputies representing all parties consider the formulation Garda authority.  It would seem that a committee such as this one would fit this requirement.<\/p><p> I wish to make a few additional points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400018#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Redmond","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400067600,"counter":577,"content":"<p>Mr. Redmond's time is almost up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400019#S00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400067600,"counter":578,"content":"<p>We believe that GSOC should be answerable to the new Garda authority.

GSOC should investigate all complaints made to it and should not \"lease back\" complaints to the Garda organisation for investigation.<\/p><p>  The Guerin report mentioned the lack of supervision for probationer garda&iacute;.  We have raised that and similar matters for many years.  The lack of supervision is as a result of a lack of available sergeants to mentor and coach probationer garda&iacute;, in particular when they enter the Garda organisation.<\/p><p>  The new roster introduced a new unit, meaning that the numbers in the Garda organisation are now divided by five as opposed to four previously, because there were four units.  Reducing the numbers adds to the burden on current numbers in the Garda organisation, which are just above 13,000.  There are ratios in EU police organisations of police officers to citizens; no such ratio is applied to the Garda organisation.  This means that the numbers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are decided on a subjective basis.<\/p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a police service.  The idea that an annual budget can be set aside to deal with everything that might occur in any year is not realistic.  While we must be conscious of financial constraints, an emergency service cannot provide a full service to the public in the same way that a business might provide a service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400019#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Redmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1400067600,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Redmond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400019#S00400","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400067600,"counter":580,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman, committee members and assembled guests.  The Bar Council's position as outlined in the written statement is reasonably short.  It steps slightly back from the situation because some of the other contributors will be able to give information from the coalface.  Those of us in the barrister profession see matters that come up in court.  In an arena where a number of reports are being done and commissions of investigation have been announced and are to commence their works on varying aspects of oversight and effectiveness of policing, at the same time this committee has been charged with doing this work by the Oireachtas by way of a D&aacute;il motion.  There may be a requirement for some pause to step back slightly and consider the structure of the house as a whole and the framework we will have after this is complete rather than patching up little problems here and there, fixing a few leaks while the major infrastructure of policing is not addressed.<\/p><p>  It is important for the public and the system itself that if there is to be a Garda authority, inspectorate, ombudsman, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na itself and some of the subliminal things such as the policing committees that operate in communities, it will be hard for the public to know what everybody is doing.  Even the interrelationship between them is difficult without having a framework at the start.  Our position as outlined in our submission is that we need an overall review either by this committee or the Law Reform Commission even if that meant that whichever body was asked to do it was asked to put aside whatever other work it was doing for a number of months.<\/p><p>  Some people might believe that is akin to asking for a Patten-like commission; I do not know if that is the case.  There were different historical situations in Northern Ireland in terms of policing being a contested issue and different parameters and matters that came into the background there.  Given where we are in May 2014, it is less than ten years after the introduction of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  It might be seen as a cause of concern that this committee and the other ongoing reviews and public events show that there is considerable stress in that 2005 Act.<\/p> <p>One might say that an Act from the 1960s or 1970s might not be working properly or different bodies are perceiving different problems with it.  It is more concerning that this is being perceived for a recent Act.  That is why the Bar Council is calling for legislation in this area to be done properly.  There might be an impetus to do something quickly but it is more important to do it properly.  If one steps back a little now, one might save matters in the future.  That is taking account of the public need and concerns about this area.<\/p><p> One must take into account policing on the ground in a changed society with more diverse racial backgrounds and mix of people, as well as being more urbanised than heretofore.  Then one must consider the management and oversight of that and then over that the policing authority and the Minister and the Oireachtas having accountability.  The issue of how this pyramid of responsibility works is a much more significant issue than just doing something piecemeal regarding oversight.<\/p><p> The Bar Council would be happy to contribute to any overall review but it believes a body such as the Law Reform Commission should draw together the different strands of reviews and recommendations in this area.  One must also look back at the recommendations of the Morris tribunal to see what was done to implement them.  If they have not worked, we must ask why.  This could be done quickly if the impetus were there.  It is important that the public knows what the proposed oversight bodies will do.  For example, does the public know what the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate does now?<\/p><p> Over the years, many of us in criminal law practice have seen garda&iacute; not putting dates on statements, a point brought up in the Guerin report.  Judges have also made criticisms about this.  We have seen junior garda&iacute; handling cases with little assistance from their seniors.  How does a junior level garda who is not equipped with experience or the tools to handle a case find himself or herself prosecuting a rape case or a serious robbery?  Where is the continuing professional development for these garda&iacute;?  There is a bigger picture here and far bigger than the matters being considered today.  The committee should consider making that its first and overall recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400019#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony McGillicuddy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400068200,"counter":582,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McGillicuddy for his presentation.

I am chief inspector of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and I was appointed to this position in June 2012, having previously served for three years as deputy chief inspector on the establishment of the inspectorate in 2006 with Kathleen M. O'Toole.  Today, I am joined by our two deputy chief inspectors, Mark Toland and Debra Kirby.  Mark Toland joined the inspectorate in June 2012, having retired at the rank of chief superintendent from the London Metropolitan Police Service after 30 years of service.  He was awarded the Queen&rsquo;s Medal for Policing in 2009.  Debra Kirby was appointed as deputy chief inspector in January of this year, having served with the Chicago Police Department for 27 years.  She retired at the rank of chief having served in a variety of commands including general counsel to the superintendent commissioner and a licensed barrister in the state of Illinois.  We are very fortunate to have both as members of our team.<\/p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate is an impartial independent statutory body which is tasked by the Minister for Justice and Equality with evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to recommend best practices in policing.  Established in 2006, the inspectorate has to date produced nine reports on various thematic inspections making a total of 281 recommendations for change.  The majority of these recommendations have been accepted with over 66% already implemented.  This will increase dramatically with the implementation of the most recent report on the fixed charge processing system where all recommendations made have been accepted and the appointment of a criminal justice working group to ensure implementation.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the difference in focus of GSOC, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, and the inspectorate, the 2005 Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act provides potential for some overlap of responsibility under section 106(1) of the Act, which caters for GSOC examining a Garda practice, policy or procedure for the purpose of preventing complaints.  Section 106(2) states the Minister may request the ombudsman commission to examine the practice, policy or procedure either on his or her own initiative or following a recommendation to do so by GSOC.  The inspectorate suggests an amendment to this part of the Act that requires the Minister and GSOC to consult with the inspectorate in the first instance on any such examinations.  The nature and scope of the consultations with GSOC could be underpinned by protocols.  This is recommended to ensure the respective organisations are fully aware of work previously or currently being undertaken and that the inspectorate be in a position to advise on the issue or issues being examined.<\/p><p>  Section 115 deals with membership of the inspectorate.  Due to problems and challenges posed with a mid-term vacancy, the inspectorate suggests that this provision in the Act should be amended to include the wording &ldquo;in so far as is practicable and having regard to relevant experience, shall have regard to the objective that at least one of the members shall be a woman and at least one of them shall be a man&rdquo;.  This form of wording is similar to that used in section 14(7) of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  This amendment will provide the necessary flexibility in filling mid-term vacancies, such as occurred last year.<\/p><p>  The inspectorate, as an independent body, considers that it would be desirable to have available to it in legislation provision for inspections or inquiries to be carried out on its own initiative.  It is noted that GSOC has the ability to carry out a public interest inquiry and the inspectorate considers that where there is a policing public interest issue which relates to inspectorate functions, it should have that ability to commence one.  The inspectorate considers that this is an opportunity to enhance the responsiveness of the legislation in anticipation of any matter of public interest which the inspectorate considers should be inspected.<\/p><p>  The inspectorate has no statutory authority to require full implementation of its recommendations, but considers it desirable that section 117(2) of the Act be amended to provide for follow-up to the inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendations.  A practice of monitoring implementation through constructed status implementation reports templates has been adopted with the co-operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, the inspectorate&rsquo;s value would be considerably strengthened through the introduction of a specific follow-up role in the implementation of its recommendations.  The Act should also make provision for re-inspection at the discretion of the chief inspector.<\/p><p>  Section 117(4) provides for the laying of inspectorate reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister.  The inspectorate suggests this section be amended to provide for the prompt publication of its reports.  The members of the inspectorate consider that publication of its reports should be made as soon as practicable following its submission to the Minister.<\/p> <p>From time to time delays have been experienced in the application of section 117(4).  The inspectorate acknowledges that a new process has recently been put in place to ensure timeliness in publication of reports but considers that the Act should encourage such timely publication.<\/p><p> The inspectorate has encountered some problems with section 118 regarding the provision of information from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It considers its functions would be significantly enhanced and made more efficient by a statutory requirement for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide unimpeded access to Garda records, including unrestricted access to PULSE and other record management systems.  In addition, the inspectorate considers that statutory provision should be made to provide for drafting of protocols regarding unannounced site inspection visits to Garda facilities.  Currently, protocols established with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provide for advance notice of visits to Garda locations.  Cold calling has a particular value in establishing, in real time, the operational effectiveness of how the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na undertakes its policing functions.  Police inspectorates in other jurisdictions are provided with this capacity.<\/p><p> The inspectorate is grateful for the opportunity to raise these matters with the committee today and would welcome any issues which committee members may wish to further explore with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400020#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert K.

This presentation will give a broad overview by focusing on an abbreviation of extracts from the association&rsquo;s submission.<\/p><p>  The views expressed in this submission are those of the ACJRD in its independent capacity and are not those of ACJRD members' organisations or their employers.  We have structured our report in four parts outlining the organisation, an executive summary, reference and analysis of current legislation for ease of reference and our proposals.<\/p><p>  Conducting research towards the advancement of community welfare and the integration of those who are disadvantaged is a key goal of the ACJRD.  This community focus is a critical issue in policing and consequently its incorporation, as public confidence, into police oversight is synonymous with rule of law principles.  Another ACJRD focus is the interaction of children and young people with the criminal justice system, which is generally regarded as an important matter, as demonstrated by the Children Act 2001 and policy of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The ACJRD accordingly proposes consideration of some amendments to reflect the heightened importance of ensuring the protection of young people as a distinct cohort in these circumstances.<\/p><p>  One of the ACJRD&rsquo;s stated objectives is the promotion of the highest standards of practice among professionals who work in the criminal justice system.  The ACJRD&rsquo;s proposals are proffered with a desire to suggest possible improvements towards best practice and effective policing, while noting that it is important to strike a balance to ensure any oversight system does not frustrate members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in carrying out their duties.  The ACJRD aims to promote innovation in justice and supports the development of new approaches to criminal justice challenges.  It is hoped that by suggesting innovative approaches, the governmental goal of achieving optimal oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be assisted.<\/p><p>  The ACJRD supports the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the establishment of an independent policing authority to exercise executive control over An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We respectfully submit that lay involvement in any such authority should be more extensive than was envisaged in respect of the proposed Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na executive management board, included in 2007 legislation which has not been enacted, and suggest that any model adopted might draw extensively on the experience of the Northern Ireland Policing Board.<\/p><p>  This submission confines itself to the powers and remit of GSOC and the processing of public complaints regarding the behaviour of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  At present, GSOC&rsquo;s independence of action is limited on a practical level by its resource dependency, and on a theoretical level by the statutory restrictions on its capacity to communicate.  The current model can be perceived as facilitating the existence of a systemic accountability and communication gap, although as GSOC comes within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality it is not subjected to extensive oversight by the Minister due to an appropriate respect for its autonomy.<\/p><p>  The ACJRD proposes that measures should be adopted to bolster the independence of GSOC by having a system of Oireachtas committee oversight to facilitate accountability and reporting, a legislative restatement of the independence of GSOC and the removal of current restrictions on GSOC discussing matters of policy.  Consideration should be given to facilitate sharing between GSOC and the Garda Inspectorate of appropriate information, applying appropriate safeguards and confidentiality measures.  The ACJRD further submits that the current system imperfectly balances individual and collective responsibility with respect to public complaints.  GSOC should be empowered to recognise and deal with systemic problems which cause complaints to be made.  Certain duties in respect of complaints could be imposed on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in an individual capacity, rather than in a collective or representative manner.  Mandatory reporting requirements in respect of serious incidents could apply in a discretionary manner to all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na individually with an appropriate mechanism to prevent multiple reporting.  Individual garda&iacute; could bear a similar duty regarding the preservation of evidence, as occurs in the ordinary course of the prevention of crime.  There should be a broad duty on individual garda&iacute;, GSOC and members of staff of GSOC not to discuss ongoing complaints outside of the complaints investigation process.  The nature of a complaint determines the manner in which GSOC investigates it.<\/p><p>  With regard to informal resolution, referral to the Garda Commissioner, an Ombudsman hearing or a section 98 investigation, the ACJRD proposes the adoption of a broader definition of serious harm.  Cases involving death or serious harm might be extended to include non-minor incidents of misbehaviour which relate to persons under the age of 18.  The existing six-month time limit which regulates the admissibility of complaints should not be applied where serious matters such as these are in issue.  Amended legislation could review section 94 of the 2005 Act to provide GSOC with a method of identifying minor or routine complaints utilising an accelerated complaints procedure.  The duty to inform a Garda member of the existence of a complaint, and the discretion to delay that notification could be transferred from the Garda Commissioner to GSOC, as could any matter which requires investigation under Part 4.<\/p><p>  To facilitate the speedy processing of complaints, it is suggested that where matters of State security are in issue they should be resolved by way of direct application to court.  GSOC might be empowered to authorise its officers to access electronic information systems operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within the parameters of an ongoing investigation.  Complaints against off-duty Garda members could give rise to a discretion to discontinue an investigation where appropriate, rather than disentitling GSOC from considering the complaint.  However complainants should be required to disclose any personal interactions or grievances which they may have with the member complained.<\/p><p>  It is submitted that the scope of a breach of discipline which may come within the remit of GSOC could be regarded as restrictive and that Schedule 5 of the 2005 Act ought to be revised accordingly.  Provision could be made for a disciplinary register wherein the Garda Commissioner records the outcome of all complaints procedures which are then made available to GSOC on request, while taking into account the confidentiality of information and personal data protection provisions.  Where a complaint is upheld, consideration could be given to granting GSOC the power to impose minor sanctions equivalent to those available under internal Garda disciplinary procedures, subject to an appeals procedure.<\/p><p>  Members should be entitled to legal aid once they are informed they are being investigated for serious misbehaviour and have complaints overturned or alternatively have any public record of the complaint expunged once a predetermined amount of time has passed.  Complaints could be published, as occurs with regard to the solicitors' disciplinary tribunal process.  Provision should be made for a system whereby the Garda Inspectorate may request statistical information and data from GSOC and that appropriate safeguards are designed to allow such a request to be processed.  The ACJRD&rsquo;s submission details some thoughts on possible amendments to sections 90 to 98, inclusive, of the Act.<\/p> <p>In short, they are as follows.  GSOC identification of routine or minor breaches of duty could be resolved by an informal procedure with a unified set of investigatory powers vested in GSOC officers.  Mediation should only take place on a voluntary basis in accordance with the International Mediation Institute and the Mediators' Institute of Ireland guidelines, as opposed to the present situation in which there is almost an imposition on garda&iacute; to become involved in mediation.  Obliging members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apologise for behaviour that they do not accept occurred is unlikely to enhance the integrity of the complaints resolution process.  Section 91 could be extended to include any complaint of significant misbehaviour affecting a person under the age of 18 years.  Section 94 has the potential to lead to an extremely prolonged disciplinary process.  It should be considered whether GSOC might be given the power to impose limited sanctions equivalent to those available for minor breaches of the Garda regulations.  I am referring to section 95.  GSOC's power to make a finding that a complaint was a result of a systemic error and to suggest that an apology be made on behalf of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na generally should be considered.  Where GSOC makes a finding that a serious breach of discipline has occurred, it could have the power to instigate disciplinary proceedings under the regulations.<\/p><p> It is submitted that the investigatory powers of GSOC officers should be extended to include access to the relevant files, records and electronic information systems of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, subject to authorisation by the Commission.  I am referring to section 98.  Regarding section 99, the power of the ombudsman to authorise a search of a Garda station could also incorporate less serious instances.  However, it should be noted that the current provisions have been shown to be adequate and extension of the powers has not been sought by the ombudsman commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400021#U00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maura Butler","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400069400,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I must interrupt, as Ms Butler&rsquo;s time is well and truly up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400022#V00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400069400,"counter":588,"content":"<p>I beg the Chairman&rsquo;s pardon.

A protocol should be put in place to protect vulnerable people, which I was trying to describe to the committee.  Another vital element can be seen in England and everywhere else.  No statement should be taken without a solicitor being present, and it is crazy to allow two detectives to question an illiterate person, a dyslexic or somebody with limited intelligence, essentially by reading a statement to the person.  It is crazy in this day and age to have two big garda&iacute; do such a thing, as it is intimidating enough to be in the presence of garda&iacute;.  Not having a solicitor present, especially if the person may have been subject to a little bit of intimidation, is not right.<\/p><p>  The appointment of free legal aid solicitors and doctors used by garda&iacute; should not come at the discretion of the Garda, and they should not be paid by same.  The doctors should have the same independence as a coroner.  As in England, the solicitors present when the statements are taken should come from a panel with slots.  It should not be at the discretion of garda&iacute; to give money to the free legal aid doctors to make multi-millionaires of the favoured while excluding those whom they do not like.<\/p><p>  The methadone issue is a disgrace, as a death occurred in Dublin because of 50 ml of methadone.  No history was taken in that case and the garda&iacute; in such cases would call in an assigned doctor, with no knowledge of the patient, who could prescribe methadone willy-nilly.  That is not helpful, and we need a methadone programme to be put in place immediately.  I contacted the coroner about that case, and I was working as a deputy coroner in Limerick until I got too old.  I know what goes on.  A garda should not be allowed to collect medicine from pharmacies for patients, and garda&iacute; in stations should be trained in the care of patients.  It is a disgrace that they now have control of medicine but have no training in that respect.  They do not have training for defibrillator use either, and if somebody collapses, they cannot use the defibrillators.<\/p><p>  As a member of Justice4All I supplied to the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, a draft statement which included photographs of beatings I saw in Garda stations carried out by garda&iacute;.

The former Minister hoped before the end of the year to have them in public areas of stations or where prisoners are being detained.  In other words, this would bring safety for a garda who may have an allegation of beating somebody against him or her and safety for the patient who may have the crap beaten out of him or her downstairs.  I can show these photographs to the committee, as I took them in the cells and produced them in court.

The issue I wish to raise applies to several groups as it arose during our hearings this morning.  It concerns the complex relationship between different bodies with various oversight roles.  Mr. McGillicuddy expressed the view from the Bar Council that the reviews are somewhat fragmented and it would be better to have an overview somewhat like the Patten inquiry into policing as a whole.  That is certainly what the Irish Council for Civil Liberties has been seeking.<\/p><p>  We are tasked with looking to the 2005 Act and its provisions on oversight.  One of our focus points, particularly since this morning, is the relationship between GSOC and the inspectorate.  Mr. Olson and others may have views about this as well.  If GSOC is given the strength and powers it seeks, and if we establish as intended an independent policing authority, is there any longer a role for a Garda Inspectorate?  Should the functions of the inspectorate be assigned to a body that would effectively be an amalgamation of the two?  It is interesting that today the inspectorate is seeking the sort of powers also being sought by GSOC, including PULSE access, the power to initiate investigations and so on.  The ACJRD has also indicated that GSOC needs power to deal with systemic problems.  This arose earlier when indicated by the representatives of GSOC in the context of an issue arising regarding the neglect of supervisory duties, as highlighted by the Guerin report where probationary garda&iacute; were not given adequate supervision or management.  Is this a matter for GSOC or the inspectorate?  Which is the more appropriate body to investigate and what is the best mechanism for this in the review of the Act?<\/p><p>  The question is long-winded but what is the best way to bring about a good oversight mechanism that can oversee the sort of systemic failures that are not specific breaches of discipline or allegations of misconduct?  Should there be two beefed-up entities involving the inspectorate and GSOC, along with an independent policing authority?  Should there be one entity with unfettered PULSE access and power to initiate its own investigations?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400023#W01700","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400070000,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I cannot give the clear-cut answer that there should be one or the other.<\/p> <p>If one body is investigating individual complaints, should it have to communicate with another body that will then take it over and look at the systemic issues, or could there be a single body with two arms which can correlate and have some type of cross-transfer whereby it can identify if there is an undercurrent or underground river of a bigger problem with these individual complaints?  I cannot say exactly what the answer is.  The 2005 Act is complex.  There are so many different parts to it which, perhaps, do not all fit together very well.<\/p><p> Consider what our colleague, Dr. O'Flaherty, said.  What about the person who is in the Garda station or the garda themselves in the future if they see something is wrong?  For the public, if somebody has a complaint, whether it is a systemic thing, a garda or member of the public, one must have a system where the member of the public will instantly know that if they think something is wrong, they know who they should approach.  Where there is a plethora of bodies I always think it is better to have one body that people know they can approach.  A little placard could be put up in Garda stations around the State stating a telephone number and e-mail address to contact if somebody has a complaint about something that has gone wrong.<\/p><p> I am not saying I can give a clear-cut answer, but sometimes with individual complaints one can see an undercurrent.  If it then has to be transferred to another body, it could be 12 months later before the other body can look at it.  Time is lost in the meantime.  It is also a matter of helping garda&iacute;.  They want to be assisted.  They must deal with a situation where the Oireachtas will change criminal justice legislation and it is very hard to keep up.  There are changes in practice and case law at all times and they must keep up to date.  There may be supervision problems in terms of some legislation where provisions are changed year on year.  Some provisions relate to custody regulations, for example, holding prisoners between midnight and 8 a.m. and whether they are interviewed.  It is a tiny matter but the Oireachtas has made three or four changes to that, none of which it has brought into force in the past ten years.  Sections have been introduced in legislation and have not been commenced, but that makes the situation confusing.  If one read the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, one would have thought the law had changed on what one does with prisoners between midnight and 8 a.m., but it had not because that section was not commenced.  The garda who is doing his or her best to try to keep up to date with the law is not being served well.<\/p><p> For that reason, the Oireachtas must take a step back rather than do something quickly.  Many different issues are being raised but it still sounds to me like patching up little things here and there.  Rather than the Minister or the Government being involved along with the Garda Inspectorate or liaising with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, if one puts the Garda authority in between, how would that change things and would some of the responsibilities of the inspectorate go to the authority instead to carry out that systemic role?  My view is that one must take a step back and look at where one should start.  We have the garda&iacute;, and their superiors discipline and organise them on a daily basis.  How does one deal with complaints, the systemic matters, keeping up to date and developing new strategies, and where is the political and legal accountability over that?  That requires something more than just doing patchwork to the current Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400023#W01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony McGillicuddy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400070600,"counter":639,"content":"<p>I agree with what Mr. McGillicuddy said.  This is an enormous legislative measure and, as has been said, there are a huge number of different bodies, so it is difficult to ascertain who is doing what.  However, I draw an analogy between the role of a board and the role of a HR department within a business context.  If it is the case that the governance of an organisation must be examined, I see that as synonymous with the role the Garda Inspectorate can easily carry out.  It is quite distinct from the role that GSOC has with regard to public complaints and dealing with those complaints.  The systemic issue might arise with regard to GSOC when it comes to the fact that there are certain complaints that are common across the Garda force.  There might be a particular type of complaint which could be looked at almost like a class action, in legal terms, and there could be recommendations or reporting to the Minister or whomsoever in that context.<\/p><p>  I believe there is a huge role also for the Garda Inspectorate, as outlined in our submission, relating to the research aspect of best practice.  Some of the on-the-ground information that is collected by GSOC in the context of dealing with public complaints could be accessible by the Garda Inspectorate from the point of view of recommending best practice into the future.  I see a symbiotic relationship between the two.  However, we are talking in a vacuum to a degree because until the new policing authority structure has been determined by policy-makers, we are doing the piecemeal thing.  It is really important to see what works and does not work in respect of all aspects and parts of the structure that currently exist and to take the best of it.

It is a huge piece of work.

What I would say about our relationship, when we go out and visit a Garda station, I have been amazed, in my experience as a police officer, just how honest guards are with us about the systems.  They  understand that we are here to try to improve the systems and to get them some equipment.  The engagement has been terrific, very honest and very open to the point where it does border on the neglect of duty sometimes about mistakes they have made, but people have been very honest.<\/p><p>  My experience is that if one goes in to investigate, in terms of an allegation of discipline or misconduct, that changes the relationship.  Guards understand that we are clearly there to look at systems, structures and the way they are organised and perform, not to investigate them.  The Garda has guards who are investigating misconduct and also involved in investigation.  One week they could be in a particular Garda station investigating a serious crime, like a murder, and the next week they are back with a different hat on investigating misconduct.

There was a series of meetings with interested parties or stakeholders and I represented the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.  We met on a regular basis coming up to it being empowered to carry out its duties.  For about 18 months before it came into force I met it on a regular basis where we discussed many things.  We discussed the culture of the organisation, we discussed how best it would approach complaints and what the likely reception was going to be from members of sergeant and inspector rank.  The other associations were represented as well.<\/p><p>  At all times I accepted the need, and AGSI accepted the need, for an oversight group to deal with complaints against members of the Garda organisation.  At all times we proposed that it should be totally and utterly independent from the Garda organisation.  This is one of the problems.  GSOC operates with a limited number of staff and within a limited budget.  It is constrained, to some extent, in the amount of business that it is tasked with investigating or examining.  The result is that it passes or leases back a certain amount of complaints to the Garda organisation.  In our view, one can never have a robust or publicly acceptable system that gives back, to the people complained of, a complaint made against them.  It should be totally separate.  That is one of the biggest issues that we have.<\/p><p>  With regard to interaction on a daily basis, we have some concerns.  Some of it is that GSOC is constrained within the Act and within some sections of the Act.  First, where there is an inadmissible complaint made against a member of the Garda organisation, GSOC feels it is obliged to tell the person.  Let us say it is me, for instance, then it would say: \"Dear John, There has been an inadmissible complaint made against you\".  That is where the matter ends.  I am left wondering what I did, what am I alleged to have done and where I did it.  How am I going to learn from a person who makes such a complaint?  Even though it has been judged to be inadmissible by GSOC, how can I learn from it?  How will I know what I did that might have been wrong and how can I correct it?<\/p><p>  Second, I would want to know who made the complaint or through what interaction was this complaint made.  That is another issue of concern.<\/p><p>  Third, Ms Butler mentioned mediation earlier and the necessity to be totally accepting of mediation before one is tasked with being involved in mediation.  That is an important issue from our point of view and so we would agree with her view, of course. <\/p><p>  The fourth point refers to where GSOC would try to say, in some instances, that there are several service level complaints and \"we would like you to deal with them informally, please\".  At the moment, unless the person complained of agrees to the informal resolution of those complaints, as well as the person who made the complaint, they cannot be dealt with in an informal way.  We have found that some of our people, men and women who carry out their duties, have a bad day from time to time.  Please bear in mind that I am not talking about serious breaches but minor, informal service level things where somebody was rude to a person they may have stopped or somebody who approached the counter.  They are very much the small breaches at service level.  We have no problem, in theory, with dealing with those complaints.  The problem is there is a requirement and expectation that one will immediately apologise even where one might not have been wrong.  That seems to be the desire from GSOC whose attitude is: \"Look, accept this, its no biggie and deal with it.  The complainant is happy, you just have to suck it up, it is something alleged against you but it is nothing big.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400025#Y01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Redmond"},{"type":"speech","time":1400071200,"counter":662,"content":"<p>In light of what Mr. Redmond has said, does he think GSOC is sufficiently transparent in its operations?

We were not and we read about them in public which was the first we heard of them.

We demand no more than to be treated as fairly as anyone else in society.  We are members of the Garda organisation but we have rights the same as anyone else and we are only asking that we be treated the same as others with regard to the rights people have.  I am not saying for a minute that someone has the right to say nothing about a complaint.  I would not suggest that for a minute.

Invariably, a number of inspectors in the Garda organisation are tasked with investigating complaints that have been leased back to the Garda organisation from GSOC.  There is a cost in the number of hours a person at inspector level puts into investigating something on behalf of GSOC.  Another cost is the loss of that inspector to the Garda organisation and the policing of the community while the inspector is investigating on behalf of GSOC.  That cost is less quantifiable.  The quantifiable cost should be paid from a budget set aside for that but, unfortunately, those costs are taken out of the annual Garda budget.  That point should be regularised, as well as the consideration of the loss of that inspector and its cost.

The case of the ICCL is that because there will be a new policing authority, a Garda professional standards unit and GSOC, there is, with all due respect, no need for a Garda Inspectorate, which is an organisation too many.

They have not been updated since and it probably would be worthwhile that either the inspectorate, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Oireachtas, through the relevant Minister, would update them.  The custody regulations provide that when a person is arrested and brought to the Garda station that they should receive a notice of their rights which would include, times of rest and also sets out what the detainee should do if he or she requires the services of a doctor, for example that he or she should communicate that he requires the services of a doctor to the member in charge.  There is a person designated in each Garda station who is required to ensure the person is properly treated and in accordance with the regulations.<\/p><p>  In terms of Dr. O'Flaherty's comments, just from experience of doing court cases in which these issues have arisen, certainly in Dublin, there is a list of doctors that the garda&iacute; use and from my own experience, detained persons would almost never be allowed to get their own doctor, it would be a doctor from the list the garda&iacute; use and have some kind of contract with.  Issues might arise around that.<\/p><p>  If a person is detained in a Garda station, the member in charge can make a decision if the detainee has been arrested for questioning under the Criminal Justice Act 1984, the Drug Trafficking Act, the Offences Against the State Act or the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  They can make a decision for that person's detention to be suspended or for the person to be removed to a hospital and their detention is then suspended if that is the case.  There is also a provision in the legislation - I cannot remember the Act - that if a doctor comes to a station that he or she can make a decision that a person's questioning would be suspended for a certain period if the doctor provides a certification.  A doctor might say that person can take medication.  They do not have to be brought to hospital, but the doctor can suspend his or her questioning for a particular period.  There are provisions in the custody regulation, albeit they are there since 1987.  There have been a great many changes in the law since.<\/p><p>  In response to another matter that Dr. O'Flaherty raised, the Director of Public Prosecutions has issued a communication to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recent days about having solicitors present at interviews.  I have not read that myself, but as I understand it, it is a communication to the effect that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should accede to a request if the detainee asks for his or her solicitor to be in attendance with him during an interview, that the request should be granted.  I think that communication issued towards the end of last week from the Director of Public Prosecutions.  There has been recent case law on that issue.  There is video recording of interviews, but one of the other points raised is that there is not much video recording of other parts of a Garda station.<\/p> <p>Some years ago in the United States, video recording was introduced in police cars and police officers had video recorders fitted on their lapels.  This practice has been of assistance as it allows interactions between the police and members of the public to be recorded and retained.  I hope I have been of some assistance as regards the law on these matters. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400028#BB01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony McGillicuddy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400073600,"counter":713,"content":"<p>Ms Butler wishes to contribute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2014051400029#CC00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400073600,"counter":714,"content":"<p>I was about to make the same point as Mr. McGillicuddy on the treatment in custody regulations of 1987 and the recent directive issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions.

Many would have been trained at Templemore as many as 20 or 30 years ago and there is no ongoing training.  For example, if one of their colleagues collapses or they are dealing with a member of the public, they will be depending on the skills they were taught a long time ago, but in the interim practices such as CPR have changed completely.  Many organisations are providing training yearly; it used to be provided every three years when I was in the police service.  Mr Tim Galvin is correct that detectives and armed officers are attending firearms training courses which is crucial.  Sometimes it is softer training courses which are not taking place such as on customer service-type skills or the development of managers.  As there has been a moratorium of at least 12 months on most training courses, there are big gaps in the numbers of people promoted.  I know that the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors is worried about Garda sergeants and inspectors going out without having taken a promotion course, which is putting people in difficult positions.  We are committed to providing training, but Ms King is correct that there are innovative ways of providing it such as CPT packages whereby my staff could log on to undergo training during down time.  Much of it relates to information provision and the raising of awareness.  It is crucial to have big pieces of legislation and for people to come together to discuss that legislation to make sure they understand it and allow them to ask questions.  The organisation needs a training board and to undertake a training needs analysis at the highest level to prioritise the training that will be undertaken and specify how it will be delivered and by whom.  Some training can be carried out locally and some at Templemore.  It can be also be carried out remotely.

Mountain Rescue Ireland, MRI, is a representative as opposed to a governing organisation.  My three colleagues and I are actually involved in mountain rescue.  We are not officials, administrators or elder lemons.  I thank the committee for inviting us to come before it.<\/p><p>  Mountain Rescue Ireland represents 12 teams comprising approximately 365 volunteers.  Those figures are easy to remember if one thinks of the number of months and days in a year.  Our teams are regionally based - as members can see from the map shown in the slide currently on screen - with the exception of the Search and Rescue Dog Association, SARDA, which is a countrywide organisation.  In fairness, Mountain Rescue Ireland is an all-Ireland organisation.  The highest point in Cavan also happens to be the highest point in Fermanagh so if one breaks one's leg while on Culcaigh Mountain, one could be rescued by a team from either jurisdiction.<\/p><p>  We are not paid for the work we do.  To paraphrase this Taoiseach, is this because we are worthless?  The answer is \"No\"; it is because we are priceless.  However, nothing comes without a price and that is why we are attending this meeting.  Before I refer to the latter at greater length, I wish to examine on our core function.  The latter is mountain search and rescue and this involves removing casualties from high, rough ground which ambulances cannot reach and which helicopters might occasionally reach but not when the weather is bad.  We are an absolutely integral part of the 999-112 emergency infrastructure.  In response to a parliamentary question tabled in 2011, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar - possibly unintentionally - intimated that we might be a dispensable appendage and that the Garda, the Civil Defence and the Coast Guard are all available to deal with circumstances where people get into trouble on mountains.  I dispute that assertion.  The next slide provides a nice shot of Magillycuddy's Reeks at 4.40 p.m. on a January evening.  On such an evening, the helicopter would only have a further 20 minutes in which to operate before it became dark.  The only way to get someone off one of the peaks in the mountains in question would be by means of manpower.<\/p><p>  If members were to visit the Reeks today, they would hear the cuckoo singing.  That is one of the highlights of May in the area.  The State is not like the cuckoo; it does not lay its eggs in our nest and expect us to carry all the burden.  The State supports us to a degree.  Our level of basic State support is &euro;111,111.  We also receive a development grant of &euro;60,000 and a Pobal insurance grant for the same amount.  The amount of the latter is shown in italics because that is not a sustainable arrangement going forward.  The grant used to come from the Department of the Taoiseach and was in the amount of &euro;75,000.  It has been reduced to some degree and is not, as stated, sustainable.  That fact will have to be addressed quite soon.  In total, the State gives us &euro;231,000 per year.  We appreciate this funding but we need more because, as I already indicated, nothing comes without a price.<\/p><p>  Photographs relating to mountain rescues often show people being taken down extreme vertical cliffs on ropes or being carried out in military formation across flat ground.  The truth is somewhat in between.  The slide on screen shows an actual rescue and, as members can see, it involves manhandling people across rough, steep slippery ground.  One must have balance and be strong in order to participate in a rescue.  Ours is an all-male deputation but there are females involved in mountain rescue.  However, we do not have a gender balance as only 5% to 10% of our members are women.<\/p><p>  The ultimate goal of mountain rescue is to locate the person who is injured.  With the advent of smart phones, this has become somewhat easier.  As a recent tragedy in Mayo illustrated, however, it can take days to find a person who dies in the mountains.  If the person one is rescuing is not dead, one must stabilise him or her.  All mountain rescuers have extensive first aid skills and are trained up to remote emergency care, REC, level 4, which is quite a high standard.  We are not cleared to administer drugs but that may change in the coming years.  Our main role is to evacuate casualties.  On a cloudy day or in the dark it can take six or eight hours to carry somebody out on a stretcher.  That is what we do and we are happy to do it.  We do not ask payment for that and the members of the current generation of mountain rescuers are unlikely to request payment.<\/p><p>  We are obliged to fund-raise in order to finance some of our operations.  Fund-raising by means of a pub quiz - as shown on the next slide - sounds like fun but I have also stood outside church gates and on the streets of Kerry seeking money from members of the public.<\/p> <p>It is not the best use of my time.  To return to mountain rescue, it is high-level, in all senses of the word.  We operate at a high level in the context of height but we also pride ourselves on being very professional.  We are a community-based emergency rescue organisation.  Administratively, we do not seem to be specifically owned by any one person.  In effect, we are dangling.  We are funded by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport via the Irish Coast Guard and we are tasked by the Garda, which reports to the Department of Justice and Equality.<\/p><p> I believe the Pobal grant comes from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We are also dangling between the present and the past, which is full of glorious certainties.  The photograph I show is from the 1960s and those noble gentlemen are now in their 70s or 80s.  Life was much simpler then.  They probably had no view on technology or the idea that one could hold something in one&rsquo;s hand that would allow one to communicate with the world or even argue with strangers one had never met.  The future is much less certain; it is hard to know what is going to happen, but we do know that Ireland is positioning itself as an adventure destination for walking and climbing.  We have the Wild Atlantic Way, which is probably tarmac-based, but it gives a flavour of how Ireland is positioning itself.  Walkers bring &euro;500 million per annum into the economy - twice the amount brought in by fishing and golf combined.  These people bring in a lot of money.  They come from abroad and they expect the rescue infrastructure to be on a par with their home countries &ndash; Germany, France or wherever.  In the past 12 months I have dealt with two casualties from Japan and one from Korea.  We are dealing with a truly international market.<\/p><p> Some people will speculate that the future is all about technology.  The photograph of the helicopter that members can see was taken very late in the evening.  It is leaving the scene because it is dark.  Technology will appear and it will be very welcome, but at that time of night it disappears.  The Air Corps has night-flying capacity, but access to the Air Corps at the moment seems to be caught up to some degree in red tape.  In fairness, the Coast Guard helicopter gives sterling support, but often it is not there.  Sometimes we have a combined operation in which it lifts us up under the clouds; we go up and get the casualty and bring him or her down and then he or she is airlifted out.  It is technology with a big \"T\" and muscle with a small \"m\".  But there are days when all one has is skilled muscle.  In white-out conditions in winter, helicopters do not go to the top of mountains, and nobody other than skilled mountaineers can do the job.  The non-mountaineering fraternity will not be trained.  That is simply not credible and will not happen.<\/p><p> A steady upward climb in activity is evident.  In 2009, there was extensive flooding late in the year which then generated frost and snow.  In 2010, we had two winters.  Mountain rescue teams give humanitarian support within their own communities when the weather is particularly severe.  Ignoring those years, one sees a steady upward climb in activity.<\/p><p> Last year the State got a total of 20 years from the 365 volunteers.  That is 20 years of unpaid work.  For each volunteer that breaks down to two and a half weeks.  Roughly speaking, that is a week on rescue, a week on training and half a week on fund-raising.  I wish to dwell on fund-raising.  Half a week on fund-raising is 20 working hours.  Of the 20 working hours one spends fund-raising, four and a half are for the Revenue Commissioners, because if one buys an item of rescue equipment in Ireland for terrestrial or land-based rescue, VAT applies at 23%.  If it is for water-based rescue, VAT does not apply.  It is seriously important to achieve equity.  We are all at sea in that respect.  We need parity of esteem.  We need VAT reform.  I do not know whether it is a domestic decision or a European decision.  I am a mountain rescuer; I am not an expert on tax or governing a country.<\/p><p> The other really important issue is insurance.  That is probably the one thing that is likely to bring down the voluntary house of cards.  Insurance, nationally, comes in at &euro;99,949.99, which is not much less than &euro;100,000.  We get a grant from Pobal of &euro;60,000, which is unsustainable.  Teams have to come up with the balance, which is a lot of money.  The insurance covers team members should they suffer an injury and it is also liability insurance should we be sued by somebody we have rescued.  To my knowledge, the latter scenario has never happened.<\/p><p> The final necessity is capital funding.  The Minister has intimated that capital funding might be available.  Capital funding in the context of mountain rescue is what we are looking at.  We are looking at vehicles - not necessarily Land Rovers, but certainly vehicles of that ilk - and we are looking at bases.  Not all teams have bases.  South Eastern Mountain Rescue Association, SEMRA, recently fitted out a base in Clonmel that I think it got from the local authority, but the fitting-out costs incurred VAT of &euro;18,500.  One hand giveth and the other hand taketh away.<\/p><p> I do not believe there is a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow, but I would like to think there is silver - certainly a silver lining - and I would like to think the silver lining would be evident in the immediate future.  It is said that eaten bread is soon forgotten, but promised bread never really arrives either.  One positive note is that the International Commission for Alpine Rescue will hold its global international conference in Killarney.  This year the event is at Lake Tahoe in the United States.  In fairness, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has given us enormous assistance.  It is a feather in the country&rsquo;s cap and a feather in the cap of Mountain Rescue Ireland, MRI.  We look forward to the conference.  I understand the committee will have a representative of F&aacute;ilte Ireland before it this afternoon and members might be able to further explore the concept of Ireland as an adventure destination and the expectations that go with that.  My final slide summarises everything I have said.  The stakeholders must support the pyramid.  Committee members are the stakeholders.  On that note, I invite questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Christie","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400056800,"counter":843,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Christie very much.

We are all familiar with advertising campaigns broadcast on television and radio during the summer months relating to water safety and swimming.  Is Mountain Rescue Ireland behind the curve in marketing its safety message in that regard?  Has it considered getting a sponsor for the organisation?

Without volunteers, the representatives could not operate.  They are not getting sufficient funding.  I would not like to see a country that did not have sea and mountain rescuers.  I asked about the co-operation between North and South.  I do not know what would be the nearest mountain rescue team to me.  I admire the all-Ireland approach.

Personally, I believe that brings a range of corporate responsibilities.  We are very independent-minded volunteers, and we value that independence.  I would be wary of the responsibilities that might result from that, but if a company wants to subsidise safety, that would be welcome.  It is important to state, however, that a safety message will not stop something from happening.

Mr. Christie mentioned the Coast Guard and the search and rescue operations that take place - especially in my area - operate very well and efficiently.  The organisations that run these operations are due many thanks.  I also am conscious that, as Mr. Christie mentioned and others have noted, the efforts are voluntary in the main.  The mountain rescue teams do it because they almost have a vocation or a passion for it.  However, such passion should not be abused in any way and I certainly hope it is not.  Similarly, I am sure MRI will agree there are many other organisations within the community with which the witnesses probably interact, such as the Irish Red Cross, the RNLI, the volunteer Coast Guard units and the river rescue teams, all of which do similar work within communities to that of MRI.  When an emergency is called, they turn out and help citizens in a positive way.<\/p><p>  That said, I also am interested in the VAT issue.  The purpose of this meeting is to try to find ways to help the mountain rescue teams and the other organisations I listed, all of which also are emergency response groups.  I find it anomalous that some groups are entitled to a VAT rebate or do not pay VAT initially for safety and search equipment.  Can the witnesses explain how this operates?  Is the VAT taken off at the outset or do the beneficiaries get a rebate once the equipment has been bought?  Are the witnesses aware of how that works?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400006#G00500","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400058000,"counter":872,"content":"<p>In respect of water rescue, I am not aware as to whether one pays and reclaims or if VAT is just not imposed in the first instance.

The witnesses might clarify who pays for, provides or maintains that system.  As for the basic equipment that all mountain rescue team members require, I am sure they all have personal equipment they maintain and manage themselves.  Is there communal equipment the team members then share, such as more complicated equipment in the form of stretchers, lines, shackles or whatever?  The witnesses might outline how this is funded at present or how mountain rescue groups share their resources.<\/p><p>  I also mentioned the support Mountain Rescue Ireland gets from the Coast Guard and the search and rescue helicopters.  Much Government investment has gone into this area and I note a new fleet of helicopters has been commissioned and put into service, which I am sure MRI welcomes.  The fleet of helicopters contains a lot of additional technology that will assist all rescues.   However, I also appreciate the helicopters cannot go everywhere and they need the man or woman on the ground.  The reason I raise this point is Mr. Christie mentioned the Air Corps, which also is a resource.  However, he mentioned there was some red tape in respect of engaging the Air Corps.  Are the witnesses in a position to explain this point further to members or what is the problem in that regard?  Finally, as I mentioned the Air Corps, I also refer to interaction with or supports from the Army.  I presume or expect the State has exceptional resources in that area.  Could the Army be of assistance to MRI in any way or is it already of assistance to the mountain rescue teams in respect of training, assistance and other supports?  The witnesses might answer these general questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400006#G00700","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400058000,"counter":874,"content":"<p>I will kick off with the first few of the Deputy's questions.  As to how we are tasked, the tasking for mountain rescues is through the 999-112 system.  An injured person or someone who is concerned about a lost person makes a 999 call and requests the assistance of mountain rescue.  That call is managed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which then will task the local team in the area concerned.  Consequently, if someone is lost in the Wicklow mountains, the Garda will task the Dublin-Wicklow and the Glen of Imaal mountain rescue teams.  If a person is lost in County Kerry, the Kerry Mountain Rescue Team will get the local page.  It comes out through a text system and on to the team organisation.  From there, we then make contact, get the details of the call and then operate and manage the entire search, recovery and transportation back out thereafter.  We then close the loop on those communications back to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by giving it a brief update as the operation is ongoing and close it off to say it is complete, it all has been handed over and what are the details.<\/p><p>  In respect of the Deputy's question on equipment, most teams will provide the baseline personal protective equipment, PPE, which will include waterproof jackets, over-trousers and helmets as a base minimum.  That is what we aspire towards.  Everything else they wear, including their base layers, trousers, fleeces and hats is all personally bought.  Probably the biggest and most important items to wear when going onto the mountain are one's boots and people as individuals will buy those and replace them themselves.  The rest of the rescue equipment, such as the stretchers, ropes, land rovers and specialist medical equipment is all centrally purchased by each of the teams and each team manages its own equipment.  The teams will consider the long-term replacement of that equipment, which comes out of our funding.  Part of the funding comes to replace team members' jackets and helmets, right through to ropes, carabiners and major purchases of Land Rovers and so on.<\/p><p>  As for helicopters, new Coast Guard machines have just been rolled out nationwide and we have seen great use for helicopters from the old Sikorsky helicopters right through to the new ones.  They are an invaluable tool on many occasions.  The difficulty we have is they fly under restricted services because of the environment of safety under which they work.  When the cloud comes down, they cannot fly in the mountains.  They primarily are marine-operated machines and coming into the mountains is a different environment for them.  They are very big, have a hard down-wash and a range of safety factors comes with them.  When one is on a steep cliff, the last thing one wants is to have a helicopter sitting right over one's head with a heavy down-wash that potentially could blow someone off a cliff.  Consequently, we also must consider this point when we task a helicopter, to make sure it is safe both for our people on the ground and for the crew when they come in.  Ultimately, the pilot will make his or her own judgment on whether to come in but I must state they are a valuable tool.  When used, they are a valuable tool and we thank the Coast Guard for its services in that regard.  It is very good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400006#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Christopher England"},{"type":"speech","time":1400058000,"counter":875,"content":"<p>Do the rescue teams ever need to use helicopters to get on to the mountains or do they always go in by land and then----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400006#G00900","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400058000,"counter":876,"content":"<p>Both.

Again, that call is made by the aircrew that is managing the machine.  It will know the tolerances of its helicopter.<\/p><p>  As for Air Corps red tape, there are existing relationships between the Air Corps and the Coast Guard helicopter.  The primary setting is that the Coast Guard helicopter is the primary rescue helicopter for these islands.  I say \"islands\" because the Coast Guard helicopter from Dublin also serves Northern Ireland.  Moreover, the other machine comes up from the County Donegal side right through into north County Derry.  As backup to that, if one of those machines has a technical fault or is out at sea, for example, there is a secondary standby whereby we can ask for the assistance of the Air Corps.  However, the primary use is of the Coast Guard helicopters.<\/p> <p>We continue to train with them and ensure that the crews understand us and we understand them.

It takes a day or two to gather all the troops in and get the relevant persons in place, if one has a prolonged search.

I am not from a mountainous county but we have low uplands, in Ballyhoura and Mullaghareirk.<\/p><p>  In the area, there is a response organisation.  Following a missing young person case a number of years ago in the Abbeyfeale area, there came about the Abbeyfeale and District Search and Rescue.  Subsequently, there was the establishment of Foynes and District Search and Rescue, a voluntary organisation which acts as a support to the State agencies on the Shannon Estuary from a water point of view.  Unfortunately, in the recent past, search and rescue staff and volunteers have been confronted more than ever by the spectre of those going missing, in some cases in the process of dying by suicide.  In my area, on the banks of the River Shannon, this has been a significant issue for the voluntary services, from Limerick city and Bunratty, down into Foynes, Ballybunion and elsewhere, looking for and trying to retrieve those who have tragically died by suicide.  Anybody who in any way can assist the families of loved ones who have gone out and taken their own lives, or lost their lives, either from a cliff face in Ballybunion, in the water at Ringmoylan in Pallaskenry or wherever, should be applauded for the fantastic work that they do.  I have seen it at first hand myself where volunteers take time off of work to walk the shoreline or go out in rigid inflatable boats, RIBs, with the sole purpose of, where possible, rescue or recovery.<\/p><p>  I understand that Mountain Rescue Ireland is primarily focused on mountain rescue.  What relationship does it have with those organisations carrying out important work in serving areas not necessarily a certain level above sea level, whether due to persons who got lost through dementia, as occurred in my area in bogs, in some cases for weeks or those who would have gone away with the intent of not coming back?  Do they see any pathway towards making such services present in other communities, not only those of a mountainous nature?<\/p><p>  I can understand that the risk level is much higher in their case because mountains attract those of all levels of experience.  One obvious case is Croagh Patrick in the Chairman's constituency, which I have climbed on a good few occasions.  One sees every shape and make of person going up and down that mountain and one would wonder how some of them manage to do it.  Some of them run it barefoot, which is a fair achievement.  I wonder what kind of relationship Mountain Rescue Ireland would have with organisations across the country that are not necessarily servicing the mountainous areas.  I acknowledge, and thank them for, the work that they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400007#H00600","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1400058600,"counter":883,"content":"<p>We are hardy people in Mayo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400007#H00700","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1400058600,"counter":884,"content":"<p>Fierce hardy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400007#H00800","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1400058600,"counter":885,"content":"<p>I join in the welcome to Mountain Rescue Ireland and also commend the fantastic contribution of the volunteers.  We all should recognise that all of this work is done on a volunteer basis - one can be called out at any hour of the day and night in any weather, and once one signs up for this, one is expected to go.<\/p><p>  We should look at this in the wider context.  Over the past ten years, the State has promoted hill-walking, hill-climbing and rural recreation as a major tourism growth area.  We have also encouraged our population, with all the challenges of obesity, etc., to get more active and get out in the great outdoors, particularly on the mountains.  I note that the figures for tourists stating that walking was an important part of their holiday were as low as 200,000 at their lowest approximately ten years and they have risen above 800,000.  The Department and the Government have ambitions to grow those numbers and it is a significant source of revenue.<\/p><p>  One must accept that where there are more hill-walkers, there will be more accidents, some of which are unavoidable.  They will happen anyway and the one question the mountain rescue teams will not ask before they get them down off the mountain is whether they could have avoided it.  If the State is serious about growing this sector, we must see mountain rescue as a necessary adjunct to that sector.  One cannot have increasing numbers of hill-walkers without having comprehensive mountain rescue services.  Those on the mountain, coming from other jurisdictions, will expect as of right that there would be somebody to take them down if they get into trouble.<\/p><p>  The question is - who pays?  In the past, all of us have faced the difficulty of joining an organisation to do something only to find we spend most of our time collecting funds.  Most of us would rather get on with the business of the organisation.  That is true in the case of mountain rescue, that one joins to give of one's time, effort, training and everything to go up the mountains to rescue hill-walkers and it is not good to find that one is spending a lot of time shaking a bucket.  We should look at other rescue services.  For example, the Coast Guard has been mentioned here, and, of course, we mentioned the helicopters.  However, the other part of the Coast Guard is voluntary.  Those Coast Guard members, with the boats around the coast, are volunteers but everything is paid for by the State because it is a State service.  Civil Defence is a State service.  Here, again, nobody expects the Civil Defence to shake a bucket outside the church because it is the State's service.  The Red Cross is a voluntary organisation, not a State one, but it is very much a creature of the State.  Quite rightly, there is funding given to the Order of Malta and to all of these services because they all are needed.  The RNLI is fairly unique.  Because of its long history and because it covers both Ireland and Britain, it probably has one of the most efficient fund-raising machines, and full-time offices, etc., to that end.  It is unique, but we must recognise here also that it is a voluntary service and it has access to the funds.<\/p> <p> We should consider this structurally.  Is funding given by the Northern Ireland Executive to the northern part of the organisation?  If so, who gives it?  The delegates might provide information on that.  The issue of an ongoing revenue stream must be tackled.  The organisation was funded previously under the community and voluntary organisations heading.  That is where the Pobal funding came from.  One had to bid for that funding.  It lasted for three years, and then one started again without certainty that one would win the lottery the next time.  This committee needs to approach a Department and ask it to take the lead on this.  In that regard, it would be very useful to get the view of Comhairle na Tuaithe on the extent to which it regards mountain rescue as part of its work in developing the whole hillwalking scene.  I hope this committee, of which I am not a member, will follow this issue up with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p><p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland is represented on Comhairle na Tuaithe.  I understand its representatives will be coming here today to examine the schedule.  The view of F&aacute;ilte Ireland on the number of foreign tourists and revenue attracted by hillwalking is that hillwalking is much more significant than golf and angling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400007#H00900","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400059200,"counter":887,"content":"<p>The new chairman designate of F&aacute;ilte Ireland is the individual we will be interviewing.

The final report is due for publication in the next few weeks.  This was brought about by devolution.  The responsibilities for search and rescue in the North are now the responsibility of the Executive.  The authorities are trying to sort all that out.<\/p><p>  Mountain rescue has been slightly separate.  It came under the Northern Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure from a sporting context.  Our funding stream came through that.  Traditionally, we received &pound;75,000 per year, of which 50% was taken off for administration.  Therefore, the two mountain rescue teams, in the South and North, and cave rescue, which has not been mentioned, received &pound;40,000 per year.  We also had sporadic access to some sort of capital funding.  The outcome of the strategic review is that the lead Department will become the Department of Justice.  This is leading us into closer alignment with the PSNI.  We are seen as an asset of the PSNI in the same way as Mountain Rescue Ireland is regarded as an asset by the Garda.<\/p><p>  Several other organisations have been mentioned.  An aspect we must consider when we talk about missing persons and injured people is the possibility of a crime scene.  One must have a very close relationship with the policing forces to enable one to operate at that sort of level.  The required trust must exist.  The mountain rescue service has built that trust up over the years such that the Garda and PSNI are willing to allow us to take part in a search.  On the other hand, organisations that do not have crime scene training are a bit reluctant to get involved.<\/p><p>  The problem is very much approaching bursting point.  The number of calls has doubled over the past ten years, not because people are engaging in more dangerous activities but simply because the number of participants has been increasing.  Therefore, we are getting more calls to mountain areas.  We are also getting calls from the Garda, the HSE and ambulance services to assist in remote-area evacuations and recoveries because these organisations do not have the specialist equipment to carry people over rough terrain.  We are called because the services are being put under pressure.  If anything goes wrong, they are put under the spotlight so they have to ensure that they use the best-available resources in the circumstances.  We are now getting calls from many mountain bikers because mountain bike trails have been opened.  Many mountain bike accidents are occurring.  We have to deal with these because we are the only people with the required stretchers, ropes, etc., to get the bikers out of very rough terrain.

That was to ensure that people understand the personalities and also how each of them works, as well as the benefits and pros and cons of each one.  In that way, we can understand how they work together.  That was very successful.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v commented on increased numbers of walkers using the hills.  I was team leader of the Dublin-Wicklow mountain rescue group and last year we had 109 call-out operations for a voluntary organisation of 42 members.  We will be 30 years old this year, but we still do not have a base.  Those operations were run out of the back of a Transit van. <\/p><p>  The operations ranged from multi-day searches for missing persons - unfortunately, a lot of them were suicide victims - right through to live tourist casualties getting lost in clouds and snow.  A large number of people got stuck in snow in upland areas.  I joined the mountain rescue service 14 years ago when, traditionally, the majority of calls were on a Sunday afternoon.  One could almost set the clock by the 3.30 p.m. call-out.  In more recent years, along with marketing Ireland as a tourist destination, we have seen not just an increase in the number of calls but also an increase in when they come.  They are no longer spread across Sunday afternoons but can happen on any day of the week.  Last Thursday, I was on a call-out for an injured walker on a Thursday afternoon when I should have been at work.  The Friday before that I happened to be on a day off and Kerry mountain rescue were out at 6 o'clock on a Friday morning to search for, and treat, an injured walker.  <\/p><p>  As a voluntary organisation, we are not just seeing numbers increasing, but such incidents can now happen on any day of the week when our volunteers are asked to respond.  On top of that, I am asking them to go out and shake a bucket on Sundays.  It can put a lot of stress on their work and family time.  That is a major difficulty when we are trying to train, rescue, do our own daily work and have some family time.  If one of those burdens - the fund-raising element - could be taken off us, it would be of massive assistance to mountain rescue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400009#K01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Christopher England"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400059800,"counter":908,"content":"<p>Can I add to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400009#K01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Goddard"},{"type":"speech","time":1400059800,"counter":909,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400009#K01400","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400059800,"counter":910,"content":"<p>We are 100% volunteers.

I was seeking figures for hoax calls to the emergency services last year, including the ambulance and fire brigade services.  I was stunned by the figures.  Does Mr. Christie's organisation receive many hoax calls?  The nature of his work is that he has to respond, so are there many hoax calls?  If so, has anyone been prosecuted?  I could not find any record of anyone being prosecuted for hoax calls to the various emergency services.<\/p><p>  As regards recruitment, Mr. Goddard said he would lose a day's pay if he was on a call-out and he had to buy his own equipment.  Does that effectively mean that people approach the organisation or are people actively recruited?  It seems to me that only fairly well-off people could buy their own equipment.  People in certain jobs would not be able to do mountain rescue work, so it seems to be very restrictive.<\/p><p>  Is there a limit on the length of time people spend in mountain rescue work?

Generally, in western Europe the agency that tasks the rescue teams - in our case the Garda or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform - pays the insurance.  That is the norm in western Europe.  It would mean we would not have to go around making a case to Pobal or whoever was likely to listen to us.  It is important to stress that.  Finally, VAT is an issue.  In fairness, Deputy Kyne asked a question on that in the House recently, to which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, provided a two-page reply.

I thank the Chairman and committee members for their invitation to present to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.<br\/>I was born and reared in Cork city.  My father was a Garda detective sergeant and my mother, a housewife.  I am the youngest of five children and have two elder sisters and brothers.  Having attended Col&aacute;iste Chr&iacute;ost R&iacute;, I completed a B. Comm degree at University College Cork in 1975 and qualified as a chartered accountant in 1978, having worked with Coopers and Lybrand for three years.  I lectured for one year at UCC before joining Frank Boland Limited, a motor distributor, as financial accountant in 1979.  Subsequently, I worked as finance manager and sales and distribution manager with Kodak Ireland before joining Athlone Extrusions, a plastics manufacturer, as financial controller in 1986.  I was promoted to managing director in 1989 and led a management buy-out in 1990.  The company was subsequently successfully floated on the Irish Stock Exchange.<br\/>Having spent three years as finance director of the Gowan Group, one of Ireland&rsquo;s largest private family-run companies, I joined Ryanair as chief financial officer in 1997.  In this role I was centrally involved in the airline&rsquo;s flotation on the Dublin and NASDAQ Stock Exchanges in 1997 and its subsequent listing on the London Stock Exchange in 1998.  In 1998 I assumed additional responsibility for the commercial department and was promoted to the position of deputy chief executive and chief operating officer in 2002.  In this role, as well as deputising for the chief executive, I had responsibility for all airport negotiations, route selection, pricing, yield management, scheduling, sales and marketing, <i>Ryanair.com<\/i>and ancillary sales.  In addition, I played a key role in investor relations and strategic management.  My role involved managing relationships with governments, both national and regional, tourist authorities and industry players such as hotel groups.<br\/>During my time in Ryanair the airline grew its business from 3 million passengers in 1997 flying on nine routes with nine aircraft to 81 million passengers in 2013 flyng on 1,600 routes with 309 aircraft.  In those 16 years Ryanair sold over 600 million seats and grew to be Europe&rsquo;s biggest airline and the worlds&rsquo; largest international carrier.  I stepped down from a full-time executive role in Ryanair on 31 March this year but will remain as a non-executive board member.<br\/>I am also a non-executive director of Paddy Power plc and Kingspan plc, both publicly quoted companies, as well as Prepay Power, a privately owned company involved in the energy sector.<br\/>In considering the further development of the tourism industry the key themes I wish to highlight are growth &ndash; earnings and employment growth.  Like all sectors of the economy, tourism has been adversely impacted on by the recent recession.  However, I believe the sector is now turning a corner and moving from a phase of business survival into one of recovery and growth.  Tourism is one of Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous industries and has considerable potential to grow not just in Dublin but also in the regions.  The majority of tourists come from overseas markets.  Over 80% of international visitors to Ireland come from North America, Britain, Germany and France.  Consequently, economic conditions, employment levels and consumer sentiment in these countries can greatly influence the fortunes of the tourism industry.  We are fortunate that these three factors in these key markets are turning positive once again.  Irish tourism looks set to continue the early signs of growth which emerged last year.  It is important to point out, however, that some countries grew their tourism numbers even during the economic downturn.  There is much we can do to help increase our share of the market, irrespective of the external environment.  The extent to which Irish tourism captures this growth opportunity, with its undoubted earnings and jobs dividend, depends on how it responds to several challenges which I will outline.<br\/>Members of the committee will be aware that the tourism industry has an important role to play in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  Tourism generates significant export earnings and initial Central Statistics Office, CSO, estimates indicate that tourism and travel earnings from overseas trips to Ireland amounted to some &euro;4.1 billion in 2013.  Tourism also makes a significant contribution to employment and jobs growth.  Last year, based on the CSO&rsquo;s narrow measure of employment in accommodation and food services, employment in the sector increased by almost 15,000 to 138,000.  Using a wider measure, including accommodation and food services, F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimates that the industry employs some 200,000 people.  If the improved performance in 2013 can be built upon - early indications for 2014 are positive - we can be confident of again reaching the peak level of 7.7 million overseas visitors recorded in 2007 and, in time, our longer term target of 10 million visitors.<br\/>There are, however, key issues to be addressed.  The first challenge facing Irish tourism is the continuing need to enhance competitiveness.  During the Celtic tiger era price levels in the tourism sector rose to unsustainable levels.  Our customers sought better value and other destinations improved their competitiveness.  Ireland became known as a relatively expensive country to visit.  In common with many sectors of the economy, the tourism sector has reduced costs in the past few years as business models were reappraised and the cost base re-engineered.  This has had the effect of improving value for money, although it has taken some years for this improvement to be recognised.  Fortunately, however, recent research confirms that Ireland&rsquo;s value for money rating has improved significantly.  This improved value for money position reflects several factors, including price reductions across the full range of tourism goods and services, service improvements that represent enhanced value for the consumer and the retention of the very important 9% VAT rate on tourism items, announced in last year&rsquo;s budget.  It is important to remember, however, that in common with all sectors of economic activity, the tourism sector competes with other countries and regions which are also seeking to improve their competitiveness and attractiveness to international tourists.<br\/>As an island destination, Ireland is wholly reliant on competitively priced access transport.  A key challenge to tourism will be to grow our extensive network of air and sea access routes to facilitate travel from our key source markets.  I am particularly pleased to acknowledge the progress made on providing improved air access in 2014.  The abolition of the air travel tax has been a key element in reversing a previously downward trend.  Additional routes have been added and the quality of access in carriers and destinations serviced has improved.  The task is to enhance this position further.  Undoubtedly, the reduction to zero of the air passenger tax has been critical in this regard, as would further measures such as reduced airport charges which would enhance the attractiveness of Ireland to new and existing carriers.<br\/>To succeed, the tourism industry will need to be crystal clear on what it is offering the international visitor.  This is sometimes referred to as our tourism product offering.  It is important that it meet the expectations of tourists whom we know are looking for both value and a unique and authentic Irish experience during their visit to the country.<\/p> <p>The challenge is to ensure the experience matches their expectations.  This is particularly important because the Irish tourism experience is probably somewhat more nuanced than in other destinations.  Research tells us that many visitors to Ireland want to get involved in an authentic \"experience\" and that these experiences are mainly rooted in three principal tourism assets &ndash; our natural heritage, our built heritage and our cultural heritage.  These are also assets that &ndash; when presented properly &ndash; can differentiate Irish tourism from competing destinations.<\/p><p> We also need to know exactly which consumers we should be targeting for growth.  In that regard, I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has been engaged in a very significant research programme over the past 18 months to understand better who these people are and what it is they want to do when in Ireland.  Just like any other consumer-based business, it is vital that we understand what the consumer wants or we simply will not capture the growth we are targeting.<\/p><p> I believe that a further challenge facing Irish tourism is to determine how and where it should promote itself so as to achieve a stand-out position in the international marketplace.  Tourism is a global industry characterised by a very noisy marketplace with many firms, tourism boards, channels and competing destinations.  It is also characterised by the bombarding of consumers with a great deal of choice and information.  Furthermore, we know that tourism consumers carry out a considerable amount of research prior to booking, most of it online.  Tourism consumers are, therefore, very much in the \"digital space\" and they routinely use online and social media channels to access and share information.  I understand there is now considerable evidence to suggest that this peer-exchanged information or user-generated content is now more influential in steering consumer buying behaviour than anything a governmental agency or official tourism board can say.  The challenge, therefore, is clear.  If consumer research and information exchange predominantly takes place in digital media, Irish tourism's message and communication must be largely positioned in that same digital media.  Equally, if the credibility of official websites has peaked, Irish tourism businesses, and collectively the Irish tourism industry, need to respond to this challenge.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will, of course, maintain its own online presence, but the real challenge may be in assisting tourism enterprises to stand out in these noisy sales channels by positioning compelling and creative content in the digital domain.<\/p><p> I would like to comment briefly on the regional impact of tourism.  The growth of tourism to 2007 and its more recent signs of recovery are well documented.  In reality, I am aware that not all parts of the country have benefited to the same extent.  Given the clear economic and social benefits of tourism, it should be a stated goal to achieve an improved distribution of tourism benefits across Ireland.  Regional distribution must be linked back to my comments on growth at the outset.  It can never be about attempting to engineer some forced reallocation of a fixed tourism pie.  It must be about expanding the overall pie by encouraging and supporting more businesses in becoming involved in tourism, most particularly those which bring fresh insights, innovation and new ideas.  In this regard, the role of regional airports and consequent direct air access to the regions from international markets are particularly important.<\/p><p> As an industry, tourism has one attribute which makes it relatively unique.  It is sometimes referred to as \"an industry of every parish\".  In other words, unlike pharmaceuticals or financial services, which are often tightly clustered in one particular region or city, tourism has the potential to take place in any part of the country.  However, it cannot be forced into place by some official policy.  It remains a matter for those local communities and those local businesses that want a slice of the tourism action to come up with a service or an experience that will prompt the individual consumer to choose to go and visit their part of the country.  This is their challenge.  This, of course, will be easier to do in a growing industry.<\/p><p> As Irish people, we are all justifiably proud of our parishes and our counties.  Parish and county are core features of the Irish social fabric.  This is a strength and it is also a reason why The Gathering worked so well last year.  Community engagement and community activation, rather than any action of an official agency, were the real reasons that initiative succeeded.  I have a strong sense that we need to be careful not to allow what is a strength in a local context to become a limitation in a global one.  As I mentioned a moment ago, tourism is a global industry, and many Irish tourist destinations and indeed many Irish counties do not enjoy a high recognition factor among international consumers.   So while local communities and tourism businesses must work hard at putting together their tourism service or experience, F&aacute;ilte Ireland can play a stronger role in bundling these experiences together so as to build saleable propositions of scale and significance which can be sold internationally and which need not be tagged with a county label.  The success of the Wild Atlantic Way initiative is an example of this principle in action and shows that this is the way to go in the future.<\/p><p> As chairman designate of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, I am particularly concerned about ensuring value for money in respect of all State funding and delivering the optimum return for the government on its investment in Irish tourism.  In doing so, I am aware that I will benefit from momentum based on earlier programmes of work.  Over the past eight years F&aacute;ilte Ireland has led and facilitated a reduction in the number of tourism boards in the country from ten in 2006 to two today.  It has significantly reduced its overhead costs through an aggressive programme of outsourcing and shared services and has managed to reduce its staff complement in line with the challenging targets set out in the Government's public sector reform programme.  These achievements have secured significant savings for the Exchequer while at the same time delivering a more attractive tourism offering for the consumer.<\/p><p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland has also played a lead role in supporting prudent capital investment in tourism product and infrastructure.  Over the past five years, a total of &euro;120 million has been invested in tourism assets such as the Viking Quarter in Waterford, the Medieval Mile in Kilkenny, the Greenway in Mayo, King John's Castle in Limerick, Malahide Castle in Dublin and Killarney House in Kerry.  These are just a few examples from almost 60 projects which are now driving incremental overseas visitor numbers and spending in locations across the country.  I believe there is a strong case for further significant capital investment in our tourism product if we are to be serious about regaining and increasing our market share.  However, such investment decisions must be based on a detailed analysis of the potential of candidate projects to attract additional visitors and, in turn, additional revenues from outside the country.  It is my hope to work closely with the executive team at F&aacute;ilte Ireland in supporting the important areas of work outlined above, in overcoming the challenges involved and in realising the growth that all involved in Irish tourism now believe to be possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400012#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Cawley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400061600,"counter":931,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cawley.  He is obviously determined to bring the same energy to this job as he did to others down the years.  I have a few quick questions to ask before I hand over to Senator Mooney, who I understand is deputising for Deputy Dooley, because I know everyone is under time constraints.  What has F&aacute;ilte Ireland done well in respect of marketing?  Obviously, Mr. Cawley referred to The Gathering as one thing.  Are there things it could have done better?<\/p><p>  I welcome the fact that Mr. Cawley mentioned the key role of regional airports, given that Ireland West Airport Knock is in my backyard and the importance of that.  At times, those involved with this airport have felt that the region was not being targeted sufficiently and that the marketing was more global and encouraged people to come to Ireland rather than to a particular region.<\/p><p>  Mr. Cawley mentioned improved competitiveness, which is very welcome.  We are facing into the concert season soon.  Garth Brooks is filling all the bedrooms around Dublin and Leinster and I am sure they will be at a premium price.  Is there any way of ensuring that tourists are not ripped off on big occasions such as that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400013#DD00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400061600,"counter":932,"content":"<p>The first thing I should say is that in my previous position, I dealt with tourist organisations in over 30 countries and I would rate both Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland as being among the best.  That is not a new story for me.  It has been a constant theme.  That is not to say they cannot improve.  One of the most important things I stated is that we need to be very cognisant of what the consumer wants, because the consumer has never had so much choice and is literally being bombarded with information.<\/p> <p>Tourism has great potential to grow.  This is not just a truism but is borne out by the experience of other countries, many of which do not have the wide variety of attractions that we have.  While we think typically of southern European countries, many others which do not have the weather or beach tourism of those countries have also done extremely well.  I point to the importance of knowing what the consumer wants.  Research recently undertaken by F&aacute;ilte Ireland with Tourism Ireland will feed into this.  While we are each very proud of our parish or county and think it is the most attractive place in the world to visit, the message must meet expectations, and the delivery must meet and, hopefully, exceed customers' expectations, because they have a wide choice.<\/p><p> The Gathering was a national initiative, and the Wild Atlantic Way could be called a half-national initiative in that it covers half the country.  This seems to be the way to target foreign consumers, because while local places may be known to the Irish tourist staying at home, they are not well known abroad.  With budget constraints we are seeking value for money, and it does not make sense to advertise small areas abroad.  Hopefully, where foreign tourists choose to go along the Wild Atlantic Way will be random and everybody will get their share of it, but the consumer will choose.  The Gathering has taught us that we must have a global message, and we will help and guide individual areas to make the most of their attributes.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is working on a similar concept for the east of the country, apart from Dublin.  A general concept must be communicated abroad so that regions such as Kilkenny and Waterford can benefit from a more global type of marketing in which they can participate as regions.<\/p><p> I share the Chairman's concerns about competitiveness.  There is a certain cycle in hotel prices, although it is not as bad as the property market.  There have been very substantial increases in Dublin hotel room rates, and not just around special events.  There is general under-supply in the Dublin market.  Hopefully this can be alleviated by development over time.  It is healthy in that it reflects good demand, but unhealthy if it chokes demand and gives people a bad experience.  We must be conscious of international comparisons.  In my personal experience, the kind of competitiveness we have seen, particularly in restaurants, in Dublin has not necessarily filtered all the way down the country.  While the market will take care of these matters, the very special deals one gets in restaurants in Dublin, the greater Dublin area and the bigger cities are not found in some rural areas.  While they may have a short season of which they must take advantage, they must be more competitive.  Being competitive does not necessarily mean cutting one's price but can mean enhancing one's offering.  There are many ways of being innovative about giving value for money without necessarily cutting one's price.  We must all be conscious of the wide choice consumers have and the fact that we need to be competitive in the broad sense from the point of view of both price and value.<\/p><p> I share the Chairman's concern about the Dublin hotel market.  Hopefully the rise in prices is temporary.  For special events such as the Garth Brooks concerts it will be very exaggerated.  There is a structural issue that must be addressed apart from that over the next year or two.  It is well known that there is a shortage of bedrooms in Dublin relative to the demand emerging.  This must be addressed, or else we will regain a reputation for being expensive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400013#DD00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Cawley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400062200,"counter":934,"content":"<p>The Chairman has covered the essential elements.

I compliment him on it.  I come from Drumshanbo, County Leitrim.  In terms of tourist numbers, the north west has always been below the radar relative to other areas of the country.  I fully understand that the consumer chooses.<\/p><p>  Should the separate roles of F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland be clarified for the public?  Traditionally there was one tourism brand, Bord F&aacute;ilte.  When people talk about tourism they still refer to Bord F&aacute;ilte, and there is some indication that people are not very clear on the fact that the two organisations, both of which perform excellently, have separate and distinct roles.  Tourism Ireland does an excellent job of bringing tourists here and F&aacute;ilte Ireland ensures they are looked after well once they are here.<\/p><p>  Mr. Cawley said there had been consolidation in the structures of F&aacute;ilte Ireland in recent years.  Was it a good thing?  As somebody who comes from a very strong business background I appreciate that Mr. Cawley must implement Government policy and cannot change it.  Is there a question mark over how it has been rationalised?  Traditionally all the stakeholders were involved at regional level with the regional boards and they were all pulling together.  Admittedly, there was an internal dynamic, even within the north west, which traditionally comprises Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim, although it included Cavan and Monaghan for a while.  Inevitably, Donegal was the dominant county in the north west.  Of Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, Galway is probably the dominant county.  It had a dynamic of its own in that it engaged all the stakeholders, local authorities and everybody involved.  This layer seems to be missing.<\/p><p>  In my county, the county council funds a tourism forum and officer, and the same must be true in other local authorities, but it seems bitty.  As has often been pointed out to me, an American who is looking at a map of Ireland does not single out Mayo or Leitrim, and if he or she puts a hand on the map, Ireland disappears.  Given that such a person does not distinguish between Dublin and the rest of the country, dispersing tourists is a difficulty for F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  Mr. Cawley has referred to this and it will be a challenge.  While I do not want to labour the point too much, I am curious to hear Mr. Cawley's views, as somebody who comes from a very structured business background, on whether there is room for improvement.<\/p><p>  Inevitably, the question about the primary reason for Mr. Cawley's appointment arises.  I will put it in a different way.  With such an impressive curriculum vitae in the business world, and coming from the world's most successful airline, why did Mr. Cawley bother?  I am a great fan of Ryanair and Michael O'Leary.  Mr. Cawley's primary position in Ryanair in the past 15 years was reflected in his presentation.  Mr. Cawley is to be complimented on the growth of Ryanair, which has filtered through to the growth of Irish tourism.  Why would Mr. Cawley want the job?  He must have thought long and hard about it, and his presentation reflects that to some degree.  I would like to tease it out with him.  There must be something he wants to do; what is it?  Given the choices he faces, what is the first thing he will do?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400014#EE00700","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1400062200,"counter":940,"content":"<p>As there is a vote in the D&aacute;il on the banking inquiry, we will suspend for 15 or 20 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400014#EE00800","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1400062200,"counter":941,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Cawley answer the questions I have asked if there is time?

I am sure he understand the constraints under which we are working and which have necessitated several suspensions of the proceedings.<\/p><p>  I come from a part of the country, County Limerick, that has been bypassed by the tourism industry.  We are located along one of the most important strategic roads in Ireland in terms of the tourism industry, linking Dublin with County Kerry and the south west.  In the past 40 years, however, our tourism potential has been bypassed.  In the case of Shannon Development, for example, there was a huge emphasis on Bunratty and the Shannon area, which was fair enough.  At the same time, the increased expenditure on roads which brought Limerick city and, in turn, County Kerry closer to Dublin in terms of travelling time saw my part of County Limerick being even more overlooked than it had been before.  As we know, Shannon Development is no more and F&aacute;ilte Ireland's tourism remit is now slightly different.  In terms of these areas, not just in County Limerick but all over the country which do not roll off the tongue as easily as some of the other tourism destinations, what does Mr. Cawley envisage F&aacute;ilte Ireland doing to change direction?  I realise one cannot drag visitors into specific areas, but something should be done to encourage them to do so.  Every part of the country has something different to sell and something that makes it attractive to potential visitors.  When it comes to marketing, however, in the area I represent it seems to be the same old faces and places - hoteliers, restaurateurs and so on - that are constantly promoted.<\/p> <p> I know that in his previous life Mr. Cawley would have seen the benefits of the separation of Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority.  Is there anything else from his previous life that he could envisage the Government pursuing to try to get people to come to airports such as Shannon?<\/p><p> I ask about the involvement of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Northern Ireland Tourism Board, local authorities and the National Roads Authority in trying to encourage people to visit destinations that were heretofore bypassed.  Just before the vote, Deputy Griffin, who is sitting beside me, said that the Limerick to Listowel route by the coast road, the N69, through Askeaton, Foynes and Glin into Listowel is not promoted to any great extent.  I am sure there are multiple examples of that throughout the country.<\/p><p> I wish Mr. Cawley well in his new role.  Great credit is due to him for taking on this role.  Given our major reliance on two pillars, agriculture and the tourism industry, anything that can be done to advance them should be welcomed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400015#HH00300","speaker":"1058","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400063100,"counter":950,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Cawley and thank him for a very comprehensive presentation.  The figures for his time at Ryanair are very impressive, with passenger numbers increasing twentyfold.  Of course he is under no pressure to do something similar for our visitor numbers.  I hope we can get tourism back to 2007 levels as quickly as possible.  When does Mr. Cawley envisage us getting back to those levels and surpassing them?<\/p><p>  I come from a tourist county, Kerry.  I acknowledge the importance of Government policy in helping our tourism industry, including scrapping the travel tax and the introduction of the 9% VAT rate, which is a very successful initiative.  It represents a beacon for other sectors of the economy and we should try to apply it more widely across the economy.  How can we ensure that the industry is passing that on to the consumer?  The danger is that over time these things get absorbed back and the overall price may go back up again.<\/p><p>  Obviously Mr. Cawley's experience in the aviation sector is very important.  In a way the nature of holidaymaking has changed greatly because people are now going to where the flights take them.  That is guiding many people in their choices of holiday destinations.  Is there any potential conflict of interest in terms of his history and close association with Ryanair?  That is not a personal remark in any way.  I ask him to address concerns people might have in that regard.<\/p><p>  As Ireland is an island, people can only come here by air or by sea.  How does Mr. Cawley believe we can improve access to the country by sea, especially now that we have the Wild Atlantic Way and so many driving routes?

The Gathering gave us both lessons and optimism for the future.  When budgets are constrained, we must market large sections of the country abroad and then individual communities can take advantage of that.  On the one hand the marketing of The Gathering or the Wild Atlantic Way as a concept is the right way to go as I mentioned in my presentation.  We get economies of scale by having perhaps three regions - Dublin, the east and the Wild Atlantic Way.  We are then focusing all our resources on that in order to get the people in.<\/p><p>  The local communities who showed such readiness in The Gathering give me great hope and optimism.  Considering the people employed in tourism in Ireland, we have a much higher cost because historically - before The Gathering - we had a low level of voluntary involvement.  We need to encourage more voluntary involvement because it helps the community socially as well as from an economic perspective.  The Gathering gave us a taste of that.  I do not seek to exploit people, but this is a feature, for example, in Scotland where there is a much higher level of voluntary involvement by people in visitor centres and in a variety of other activities that benefit tourism and benefit from tourism.  We must cultivate that.<\/p><p>  Deputy Griffin spoke about the impact of a tax reduction.  It will not surprise committee members to hear that I am a firm believer that Government can produce the environment in which business will thrive, but it is up to individuals to respond to that beneficial environment and not for the Government to fix it.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will give its expert analysis based on its research and will give technical help and so on.  However, it cannot ultimately coax or encourage people into individual places.  There is no better source of that initiative than local people.  I live in Wicklow and could pinpoint the need for that in individual parts of our county, which in theory is a very attractive county.  However, the way it is presented and the way individual communities take advantage of that varies greatly throughout the county.  That is not to say that one has better resources or better attractiveness objectively than another.  We need people to engage at a community level.  We will be very active in bringing people into the country, producing a package for Tourism Ireland to present abroad but then we need individual communities.<\/p><p>  Senator Mooney asked me about engagement locally.  As I am new and ironically even though I have considerable experience in tourism, I do not have great experience of Irish tourism because 6% or 7% of Ryanair's business was through Ireland.  However, I generally know what is good and what is bad abroad.  I want to match that with local knowledge that I hope to acquire over the next six to 12 months by engaging with people locally on whom we depend for ideas.  I have some ideas of my own but I would not claim to be an expert who knows how to attract people into every corner of the country.<\/p><p>  The Gathering gave us the optimism that that can happen.  It gave the engagement of people and an overall call to action that got people back into all parts of the country - very few parts were not affected in some positive way by that.  We need to harness that local involvement and the overall global issue to attract people here in the first place.<\/p><p>  Deputy O'Donovan mentioned the separation of Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority, which was one of the best things to happen.  I would like it to also happen with Cork Airport because the independence of the airports gives them the opportunity to compete.  In Italy, for example, the airports are independent of one another as distinct from Spain where they are owned centrally.  The competitiveness of airports in local regions with them making packages attractive for many airlines and not just Ryanair has underpinned sustained tourism growth in Italy over the past ten years.  There have been ten years of unbroken tourism growth in that country despite starting from a fairly high base and despite the recession in many of its source markets, such as Germany, United Kingdom etc.  It has succeeded in doing that because the airports were active.<\/p><p>  We want to see independent airports, as we have with Ireland West and Kerry.  Cork Airport is the glaring example of exception to that.  Shannon Airport has shown the way and how it can be.  Shannon Airport will record double-digit growth this year; it also grew last year and I believe it has the basis for further growth in future years.  That would be very important for Deputy O'Donovan's and Deputy Griffin's regions.  We know that Shannon Airport is a feeder into Kerry as well as north into Clare and Galway.  That is very positive and while I know there are financial issues for Cork Airport with an overhang of debt and so on, I hope that will be a high priority for the Government.<\/p> <p> With regard to the relationship between tourism bodies, I worked with both in my previous job and found them very harmonious.  In crude terms, it is F&aacute;ilte Ireland's job to prepare the product offering which I spoke about earlier and Tourism Ireland's function to market the product on an international stage.  They collaborate and I will be seeking to enhance this collaboration where there is no duplication of effort.  We can both find out together, through one piece of research, what consumers want.  We should not duplicate this work.  This work was done collaboratively in the past and I want to see it constantly updated because consumer preferences change.<\/p><p> To answer Deputy Griffin's question, I hope we will return to 2007 levels no later than 12 to 18 months from now.  We can aspire to 10 million tourists over the next four to five years and the benefits this would have for the country would be huge.  As I stated earlier I would like to see this throughout the regions as well in as traditional tourist areas such as Dublin which, perhaps, has an overconcentration at present.  We do not have too much in Dublin but we need to spread it around.<\/p><p> With regard to ensuring savings in VAT are passed on to customers, we must let this to the market to a certain extent.  This sounds very passive but I am a firm believer that if we assume there is not a cartel working, which I hope there is not, in tourist destinations that individual restaurants and hotels who are the beneficiaries of this reduction in VAT will compete actively with one another, and when they are full more capacity will come on the market and more employment will be created.  With tax reductions the overriding issue is that the Government, with the reduction in VAT and the abolition of the aviation tax, has provided an excellent environment in which growth can occur.  I am very confident it will.  Competition will force people, not always but over the long term, to pass on the savings because we and they will not get the growth if they do not.<\/p><p> The question on a potential conflict with Ryanair was interesting.  One of the advantages, I hope there are a few, that I will bring to the position is I have a very clear understanding of what motivates airlines to initiate services to a particular country, which is if it makes economic sense for them.  This is why I would particularly like to see Cork become independent so it can compete.  There is a price for providing services to airlines which is a cost input for an airline.  It is like staying in one hotel beside another hotel.  If British Airways is sitting in London deciding whether to fly a spare aircraft to Venice, Cork or Dublin it will look at the various costs of the airport against the revenue it will receive.  Frankly this is one of the reasons Cork passenger numbers have fallen.  The revenues which airlines can earn are not sufficient to cover the excessive costs being charged there.  I understand this very clearly.  It is not just a Ryanair phenomenon; it is a Ryanair phenomenon, but it is also a British Airways and Aer Lingus phenomenon.  They are all in a competitive world and make decisions on this basis.  I have been a great supporter of Irish tourism in my time with Ryanair.  We have had many opportunities to expand throughout the 35 countries in the open skies regime in Europe.  We have acted on the basis that if it meant nothing to our shareholders we would always give the bounce of the ball to Irish tourism.  Last year we made a commitment that if the aviation tax was abolished we would deliver 1 million passengers to Ireland.  We will exceed this in Dublin, Shannon and Ireland West Airport Knock.  Unfortunately Kerry and Cork airports will have fewer passengers this year.  I hope this will be reversed in the future for the reasons I mentioned earlier.  I do not see a conflict.<\/p><p> The question on access by sea is interesting.  Fortunately or unfortunately - it is because our aviation industry is so strong - sea access accounts for only 5% or less of all our tourists.  I would like to increase all access.  I suspect ferry companies - and I have not spoken to the ferry companies but I will - make their decisions on the same basis as airline companies.  If it makes economic sense for them they will do it.  There is a marine industry which can be promoted with regard to people bringing in their own craft.  I am not clear, because I am not an expert on it, what contribution this could possibly make but I will certainly investigate it.  We are very rich in marine resources with regard to harbours.  Some of the oldest yacht clubs in the world are in this country.

I was up to what might be referred to as nefarious activities in Dublin West and got caught in traffic.  I must speak to my party colleague, Deputy Dessie Ellis, about sorting out the Dublin traffic problems.  I welcome Mr. Cawley and I thank him for his presentation which was very clear and easy to understand.  I have no questions on his qualifications or experience because it is self-evident he has the skills set to do the job.<\/p><p> I wish to examine some of the issues about which Mr. Cawley spoke.  He spoke about the regional and spatial spread.  I represent Sligo and north Leitrim and after the next election the constituency will comprise Sligo, Leitrim, south Donegal and west Cavan.  Donegal seems to get good coverage in terms of tourism but south Donegal gets somewhat less.  The tourist numbers in Sligo are improving but Leitrim and west Cavan do not seem to be on the tourism maps.  The Abbey Manor Hotel in Dromahair is most wonderful.  It is right beside beautiful Lough Gill and Parke's Castle, which is one of the best examples of a castle in Ireland if not Europe.  This lovely hotel is dilapidated and rotting away.  There is a despondency in Leitrim at present.  I cannot suggest what we can do about it but doing nothing is not an option.  I have spoken to some people involved in tourism, and there is much scope for co-operatives of people who deal in the business of tourism products, particularly in weaker tourism areas.  One person or one business will not be able to do anything alone but if we could get past the distrust competitors have for each other and work on a co-operative model it is probably the only way to go.<\/p><p>  I was delighted to hear Mr. Cawley state he will encourage and support people who come with a vision and who bring fresh insight, innovation and new ideas.<\/p> <p>It is necessary.  We all know people like that.  I know a couple of people in the tourism industry who are working on the Atlantic butterfly route as part of the Wild Atlantic Way.  This is the sort of innovative thinking that is needed.  Someone else has developed a website and received a commitment from approximately 120 tourism businesses.  Through a more comprehensive product, it involves the stronger areas and feeds into the weaker ones.<\/p><p> Sometimes, the people involved in tourism with whom I speak voice a criticism.  They believe that full-time tourism promotion staff seem to have more administrative skill sets than promotional ones.  They ask a challenging question to which I do not have a satisfactory answer.  Would it not be better to invest in those with a vested interest in the product they are promoting?<\/p><p> I do not know whether Mr. Cawley has got around to deciding on whether to undertake a special initiative to increase the number of tourists to Ireland to the magic figure of 10 million in 2016 for the 1916 commemoration.  It may be too early to say, but does he wish to make changes to the organisational structure of F&aacute;ilte Ireland or to its relationship with other State agencies, local authorities and groups involved in tourism?  I was delighted to hear that he would speak with the good folk of Ireland West Airport Knock.  It is critical to tourism in the west and the north west, particularly since the closure of Sligo Airport.<\/p><p> Many of us who oppose the potential hydraulic fracturing in the north west believe that the region's main attraction is its unspoiled environment - our hills, valleys, lakes and rivers.  If hydraulic fracturing were permitted in Fermanagh, Leitrim or south Donegal, we could kiss tourism goodbye.  No one would visit a deserted industrial site, which is what we would have after 15 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400017#KK00900","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400064300,"counter":962,"content":"<p>Before I call on Mr. Cawley to answer, I ask Deputy Colreavy to take the Chair for a few moments.

The Acting Chairman was right about the co-operative spirit that we must cultivate.  I am a firm believer in the fact that no one has a monopoly on wisdom.  I will seek ideas from the bottom up.  As I told Deputies Griffin and O'Donovan, The Gathering gave us a tremendous template for success.  Those at the top were surprised by how responsive people at the grassroots were.  I want to harness that, as does F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  This is for practical reasons, as we have neither the budget nor a monopoly on wisdom.  We do not have all of the good ideas, although we have some, and we certainly have expertise.<\/p><p>  The best ideas, particularly those that work locally, are those that come from local sources.  They own those ideas and make them a success.  I am a firm believer in that concept.  We will not be able to respond positively to every idea, but we hope to give everyone a fair say.  I will then rely on the expertise of people in F&aacute;ilte Ireland to make decisions.  I should say that I have only met the chief executive twice, but I have been impressed by him.  I have also been left impressed by my dealings with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, although I was mainly dealing with Tourism Ireland in my previous job.  I am set to meet the rest of F&aacute;ilte Ireland's management later this week.  Its members have skill sets and have proven themselves.<\/p><p>  The committee members can rest assured that any gap in the market, particularly where we need to communicate with customers, will be addressed.  There is an imperative to reduce staff numbers to certain levels under Government guidelines.  Within that, however, I hope to protect the key skill sets, as the Acting Chairman called them, that we need and embellish them in due course with more people who are relevant to the market.  I come from an organisation that went through this type of change recently.  The world is competitive, but Ireland can do well if we have the ideas and the skills to communicate same.  That is where F&aacute;ilte Ireland comes in, namely, the packaging of Ireland.<\/p><p>  I have yet to examine the organisation.  The Acting Chairman asked a detailed question on that matter, but I would rather reserve my position.  Having seen F&aacute;ilte Ireland's performance, I rank it highly thus far.  There is nothing that cannot be improved upon, of course, as there would be no sense in my job if that were the case, but the Acting Chairman can rest assured that whatever needs to be done to achieve the objectives I laid out will be done.  I am keen to achieve the numbers that have been mentioned and to ensure the increase is spread regionally.<\/p><p>  The people in Ireland West Airport Knock are among my best friends in the airport business, if I have any left.  Mr. Joe Gilmore and Mr. Donal Healy run a tight ship and do a fantastic job on behalf of the west.  I would not want the Acting Chairman to lose sight of the importance of Derry Airport to the northern part of his region.  That airport also operates under tight constraints, including financial ones, but it succeeds in overcoming them most of the time and brings many people to that part of the world.  Donegal is much more the airport's hinterland than anything to its east.<\/p><p>  The issue of fracking is way outside my area of competence.  The Acting Chairman is right in that people will not visit old industrial sites.  There are some who take an interest in such places, but I suspect very few.  We have to combine the economy's various competing interests.  I am not one to say what should or should not be done in the area, but Ireland has a fine infrastructure.  One would need to travel a long way to find something to better it.  We will give the highest priority to marketing it in the most attractive way.<\/p><p>  I will make a particular point, as I have personal experience in this regard.  International access to the regions - I would not like to characterise it as bypassing Dublin, but that is effectively what it is - is very important.  On foot of the Government's abolition of the aviation tax, I was happy to announce up to 400,000 more passengers between Shannon and Knock airports in the past 12 months over the previous 12 months.  This work will not stop there, as I hope to promote it further.  Let us hope that many of those passengers migrate to Leitrim, Cavan and so on.  I am sure they will.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400018#LL00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Cawley"},{"type":"speech","time":1400064300,"counter":966,"content":"<p>I wish Mr. Cawley the best of luck in his job.  He certainly brings an enthusiasm and skill set to it that will be welcome.  I followed his contribution on the monitor and am sorry that I was not present for all of it.  In one sense, he is lucky to be working with a progressive and enlightened Minister who is open to change and innovation.<\/p><p>  In the years I have been a Member, I have been worried by how people refer to the \"potential\" of Irish tourism as if we are always striving to achieve something that we have never quite realised.  We probably never will realise its full potential, notwithstanding individuals' good work.<\/p> <p>Like the witness I am loath to criticise organisations when I have not worked with them and I do not know for sure but from the distance from the tourism industry from which I am removed it strikes me that F&aacute;ilte Ireland will have a task in trying to bring people with it.  Wheels move slowly and I am a great believer in having one supremo who is in charge of everything.  Mr. Cawley may well go into the job and find so many elements impinging on the success or otherwise of his job, and they may be outside of his control.  Many tourism bodies have set up some relationships with county councils, for example, or other developments.  I do not mean to be patronising but although all these are well intentioned, they are often cases of everybody looking to do a job but nobody doing it.  That is instead of having one organisation.<\/p><p> It can be quite difficult to shake off history, as Mr. Cawley knows, and his new job will be a big change from his previous work.  He should not be afraid to ruffle feathers.  Irish people in general - although I suppose it could be applicable to everyone - are creatures of habit and we have perceived ideas.  When I think of holidaying in Ireland I think of Galway and Dunmore East, for example.  I listened to Senator Mooney and Deputy Colreavy and by chance I ended up in the north Roscommon and south Leitrim area last summer as members of my family attended a music festival in Drumshanbo - the festival was named after Senator Mooney, I think - and I was \"alarmed\" by the facilities and what was on offer there.  We have spoken about dormant industries and in this regard the Arigna mines are well worth a visit.  I was informed of how parts of the English language evolved from mining.  There is Lough Key forest park and Carrick-on-Shannon, which is hive of activity.  If I go to England on holidays I do not head to Brighton or the \"Galway\" of England, as I am inclined to go to the Cotswolds or small villages.<\/p><p> It may be a job for Tourism Ireland rather than F&aacute;ilte Ireland to try to market the country.  There are many different segments and perhaps we should have a position where the north east is X and the south east is Y, for example, in order to keep things simple instead of being all things to all people.  My experience of a place boils down to standards, which may relate to a cup of tea, a hedge correctly cut and clean, correct signage.  The witness mentioned pride of place.  A tourist would not want to land at a beach in Rio de Janeiro or the Gold Cup at Cheltenham every weekend.  People may want to go to a place where they can sit, have a bit of peace and a cup of coffee while learning about a locality.<\/p><p> I may be wrong but I believe the Irish regions are divided.  Mr. Cawley is a native of Wicklow, which is designated as midlands-east and tied in with the likes of Longford.  I remember doing a survey of tourism facilities in Wicklow, and the question was asked of how many people would be sent to Longford or Westmeath from near Greystones or Brittas Bay.  Very few people would be sent that way, which is no reflection on Longford or Westmeath, which has its own beauty.  Trying to market midlands-east could require a magician.<\/p><p> Mr. Cawley will not be short of advice, which may be right or wrong, and many people have ideas.  He will sift through them and may decide to implement some.  I have arrived in some places but ended up in the same spot two hours later.  I do not know how many times we have come out of Dublin Airport and ended up God knows where.  I spoke to the National Roads Authority, NRA, today again about signage on certain parts of the motorway in my own area.  A tourist may come from the airport and at the first or second roundabout see the sign for Westport, which is a lovely town with many attributes, but not many people want to see the sign for Westport straight away.  There may not be another sign for it for 60 or 70 miles.  There is a role to be played with the NRA and Dublin Airport Authority and, for example, there may be directions for regions as people leave the airport.  Perhaps we could have maps at the airport as people collect their luggage and if a group is going to Galway, for example, they would know it is in the west.  I have gone astray as recently as a couple of weeks ago coming from the airport.<\/p><p> The Gathering was a great concept but I often thought we missed some points to a degree.  My concept of The Gathering was to bring home people or relatives of people who may have left Ireland through the centuries.  There is a project in Loughrea called Bring Them Home, although I do not know how successful it has been.  One of my interests outside politics and sport is genealogy and local history and on the Internet one could track a Michael Cawley who may have left Ballindine or Ballyhaunis in 1830 and who may have a great-great-grandchild in Denver, Colorado.  Those relatives may not be sure from where they came but perhaps people like that could receive an e-mail to invite them to Ireland for the summer.  There would be merit in trying to set up a system like that which proactively attracts people to Ireland.<\/p><p> There is great interest in genealogy and a sense of belonging for people.  There are more than 40 million people of Irish heritage in the United States.  We must identify how to sell Ireland in Europe, although it is a Tourism Ireland issue.  We are the most westerly tip of Europe, right at the edge of the Atlantic.  There are many people in central Europe - in places like south Germany - who may not have seen the Atlantic, and there is much potential in selling Ireland as the western tip off the Atlantic.<\/p><p> I am aware of a group which made a submission about setting up an American Civil War trail that would take in Irish-American generals to tie in with the bicentenary of the war.  My understanding is the trail in the United States is worth approximately &euro;2 billion and we could replicate it from an Irish perspective.  This involves fantastic ideas and knowledge but it has never become a reality here.  I might get the group to send on the information, although Mr. Cawley will not take up every project he gets.  Perhaps the project is lying on a shelf.  We all have great ideas but we may find it hard to iron a trousers or shirt in the morning and everything after that is a plus.<\/p><p> Mr. Cawley alluded to the River Barrow and I do not know if he is familiar with St. Mullin's, which is close to Altamount Gardens.  One could be at the Amazon basin, it is so amazing.  Over the years I have raised the issue of vested interests, although that may not be the correct term.  State agencies, in particular, may have a monopoly on ownership in an area.  I saw a video clip from the 1940s or 1950s of Glendalough and it showed how boats would go from Glendalough to St. Kevin's Bed; if a helicopter is heard collecting people from the cliff in Glendalough now, they are trying to access St. Kevin's Bed, which cannot be accessed through the lake.  Some may think it heresy but perhaps we could have an environmentally-friendly boat on the lake in Glendalough.  Some people may say it would ruin the environment but most lakes around the globe have such amenities.  It would be a huge attraction.<\/p><p> After all my pontificating I only have one question.  Mr. Cawley has travelled much in his previous employment so what is the one element from abroad that he thinks we should have in Ireland?  Perhaps that is unfair but has he ever thought that when he becomes chair of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, he would ensure signs are clean, for example?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400018#LL00600","speaker":"1184","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400064900,"counter":968,"content":"<p>To correct the Deputy, I am a native of Cork, although I live in Wicklow and I am very happy to do so.

The diaspora is a very valuable resource that we should tap, and if the number is 30 million or 40 million people it has enormous potential.<\/p> <p>In this regard the committee will be happy to know that The Gathering has maintained some momentum in a number of communities.  They are tracking people and bringing them back.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is actively involved in a much smaller and almost informal way.  There is no part 2 of The Gathering this year but there is so much momentum in certain communities that it is happening regionally, not nationally.  We will be revisiting that issue.<\/p><p> The member who referred to the Atlantic issue is right.  Apart from the Bay of Biscay in France, we have a monopoly on that view and that is why the Wild Atlantic Way is so popular.  I was speaking to people in Tourism Ireland today.  The feedback they are getting from Germans, for example, who are essentially landlocked other than the North Sea, has been phenomenal.  That name will have great resonance, I hope, with people when they arrive.  People will spread out into the various areas and the local communities will take advantage of that.<\/p><p> A key question was asked in respect of access to the country.  Coming from where I come from, I am a great believer in filling up the funnel as much as possible.  I am not saying this for Ryanair but for any airline.  This is an island country and access is critical.  There are examples of other countries that have similar isolation.  Malta, Cyprus and the Canary Islands spring to mind.  Each of those has had crises in tourism and they are far more dependent on it, percentage-wise.  They have nothing like the foreign direct investment we have.  Tourism is 35% of GNP in the Canary Islands and it is similar for Malta.  Cyprus is even more dependent on tourism.  Each of them has taken the route of improving access over the last years and revived their economies.  Malta is the great example of that.  It has sustained unbroken tourism growth for the last six or seven years.  For historical reasons Britain is its biggest market and when there was a crisis in that market, Malta improved air access.<\/p><p> One can improve anything; one can always improve things.  We will be critical of things in a constructive way, for example, there is much to be done about signage.  There is much to be done on many things, but I am a firm believer in getting people in.  Then they can find their own level.  One will find out through surveys and research what people want.  Ultimately, when they come here, the experience is that people will come back to Ireland.  Apparently, only 14% of people in Britain have been to Ireland, but they all come back here.  That is a lesson for us.  If we get them here, we have enough.  Not everybody is happy.  One gets the letters that say they have been disappointed with the experience and so forth, but the general experience of people here, provided they are not coming for the weather, is that they come back.  That is not unique.  People go back to Spain and other places frequently, but not every country has that attribute.  We have it.  Our historical research from Ryanair is that many people travel frequently with us in and out of this country.  The way to tap into that is to enlarge that number.  I have every confidence that when we get people here, we will cope and that we will get a large number of them back again.  That is the test.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400019#MM00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Cawley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1400065500,"counter":975,"content":"<p>I congratulate Mr. Cawley on his nomination.

I know one might need to ruffle feathers on occasion and anybody who knows Mr. Cawley knows that he is well able to ruffle feathers when he feels passionate about important issues.  I believe he will be a very good fit for this job.  It is a proud day for our county as well, to have one of our well-known residents in this position.  I wish him and his family the best of luck.<\/p><p>  Mr. Cawley brings significant business acumen to the job.  In addition, he has an ability to work with people and to bring people together.  I am pleased to hear his comments on the success of The Gathering.  There was so much local information collected and collated that we must keep that network going.  There were so many volunteers, people who had probably never been involved in promoting this country previously.  They voluntarily sat at meetings and brainstorming sessions and came up with ideas, many of which we never even reached, during The Gathering.  That is a huge pool and network that we must maintain.<\/p><p>  I am particularly pleased that the chairman-designate of F&aacute;ilte Ireland is living in Wicklow.  If I can be parochial, Wicklow has been neglected for years with regard to tourism.  Until very recently, when F&aacute;ilte Ireland had a policy shift, it was viewed as on Dublin's doorstep.  It was the official definition of Wicklow.  When one asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland about Wicklow's position, it was in the product called \"Dublin's doorstep\".  As Mr. Cawley, anybody living in County Wicklow and people involved in tourism know, there is much more to Wicklow than being just an extension of Dublin.  I very much welcome the designation of a new product, which is Wicklow-Kildare.  It is working well and there is a huge amount more to be done in that area.<\/p><p>  Mr. Cawley spoke about co-operating with other State agencies.  I recently attended a briefing by Coillte.  Common sense prevailed regarding a decision not to proceed with the sale of the harvesting rights, but we must now examine Coillte and what it can bring to the table in respect of tourism.  There are some well known Wicklow residents involved in Coillte as well, but there appears to be a sense that Coillte and its potential in terms of a tourism asset is not being utilised.  I strongly share that view.<\/p><p>  My final point is one that all public representatives, including Deputy Timmins, make quite regularly.  It is about the issue of signage.  It is quite perverse to have a State agency in this country telling our villages and towns that they cannot direct tourists to their destinations.  I understand we cannot have main roads littered with signs and we cannot promote every pub and tourism product at every crossroad, but the arrogance of the National Roads Authority, NRA, in dealing with this issue has been quite astonishing.  We need to bang heads together.  It is frustrating for communities that come together, in both my county and other counties, and really work on promoting their destination, only to be told by tourists that they could not find it or drove past it.<\/p><p>  Mr. Cawley is a perfect fit for the job and I wish him the best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400020#NN00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400065500,"counter":976,"content":"<p>I was not aware of the last issue the Deputy raised.

Otherwise they will just be bypassed and that defeats the purpose of the work they do.<\/p><p>  I thank the Deputy for his good wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400020#NN00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Cawley"},{"type":"speech","time":1400065500,"counter":977,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Cawley, for your engagement with the committee.  I note you have been claimed by five or six counties in the course of the meeting.  It is a wish that many politicians lack.  You bring enormous expertise and energy to this job.  You say you wish to engage with the local communities.  A presentation was made to the committee when we were discussing the document on tourism for the Minister.  I cannot remember the name of the person who made the presentation but he spoke about volunteerism.  That was what The Gathering was about, from the grassroots up.  You mention that you must undertake a great deal of engagement with people to get a full knowledge of Ireland, but it appears from your presentation that you have a fair grasp of it already.<\/p><p>  On behalf of the committee, I wish you well in your new task.  With your track record I have no doubt that you will be exciting and will deliver in the job you are about to undertake.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400020#NN00400","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1400065500,"counter":978,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014051400020#NN00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Cawley"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1400065500,"counter":979,"content":"<p>The joint committee adjourned at 7.20 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 28 May 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
