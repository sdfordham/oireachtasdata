It is the intention of Government to develop as many centres as possible by one of three separate methods:<\/p><p>- by direct investment;<\/p><p>- by way of leasing arrangements;<\/p><p>- by way of Public Private Partnership.<\/p><p>The locations were then considered for development by way of PPP as part of the Government&rsquo;s stimulus package.  <\/p><p>  Selecting the Primary Care Centres under PPP was not, as is generally believed, done on the basis of one criterion, the deprivation index. Three criteria were deployed:<\/p><p>- the deprivation index for the catchment population of the centre;<\/p><p>- the service priority identified by each Integrated Service Area \/ Local Health Office;<\/p><p>- an Accommodation Assessment which assessed accommodation available for the primary care team within the catchment area, the quality of the accommodation, and whether or not the accommodation was spread over more than one building.<\/p><p>The HSE in this new process identified 338 locations for PC centres. From this 20 were selected on the basis of accommodation availability in the locale, service priorities, and deprivation. 37 locations within the list of 338 had similar rankings.<\/p><p>  I accepted the first list of twenty prospective centres presented by Minister Shortall, but I decided, in consultation with my Department officials and Government Ministers, to go beyond the initial mathematical model, as the number was too small and we needed at least 35 centres.  Advice from the HSE\/DoH based on experience of PPPs is that if only 20 were pursued, considerable slippage could arise and the health system could lose a badly needed investment. I also took into account that the track record of the HSE in delivering PCs on time is poor. In addition the &euro;115m stimulus fund available could only be accessed by means of PPP.<\/p><p>  I wrote to Minister Shortall on the 25 of July stating: &quot;A very strong consensus emerged at Government level that identifying 35 locations would stimulate and encourage wider interest and participation...&quot;  In other words, if we were to identify only twenty, and stick with twenty, GPs would then be able to sit back await their completion and then enter on their terms only. If you look at what happened in an urban area where a primary care centre has been built, the process began 4 years ago with pre-contract discussions with local GPs, the building was completed in 2012, but it took several months to get the GPs to move in. A similar situation arose in a rural area. So the list was widened. In addition, new criteria were added. It was evident, for example, that consideration needed to be given to: <\/p><p>- Existing health facilities;<\/p><p>- GP to population ratio;<\/p><p>- Pressures on services, particularly Acute Services;<\/p><p>- Funding options, including exchequer funded (HSE) build or lease; and<\/p><p>- Implementability of a PPP (size, site and scale).<\/p><p>The criterion of existing health facilities was added because if they weren&rsquo;t considered, you could possibly have a health centre built in the shadow of an acute hospital, while a nearby area of great need would be left without a primary care centre, which would make no sense.  Under these wider criteria, 15 additions were made to the list.  Some of those extra 15 had in fact been identified by the HSE as far back as 2007 as high priority (under a Fianna Fail Government). However, because of the weighting I mentioned earlier (multiplying the deprivation index by three), two of these areas &ndash; Balbriggan and Swords - both lost out. They got swept from high priority to low priority. Under the original priority system both would have been in the top 35. However, under the new system with an altered weighting system, they ended up down the list.  The realities had not changed. The weighting made it look as if the realities had changed.<\/p><p>  Here are the realities. Balbriggan is an area of high unemployment with no existing primary care centre, where the current health centre is in a very poor state. The centre in Balbriggan will, in fact, proceed under a lease arrangement.  Swords has a population of 48,000, no primary care centre, and no direct public transport link to its nearest hospital, Beaumont.  There can be no doubt that these two areas are high priority for primary care centres.  It is my intention to further primary care developments as resources become available.<\/p><p>  I cannot be certain of who the GPs are in the proposed Primary Care centres in Balbriggan and Swords. However, I was acquainted with all GPs in North County Dublin in my former role as an Irish Medical Organisation representative and as a GP in North County Dublin.  I can confirm that since becoming Minister I have had no representations from private contractors or GPs involved in building primary care centres in Swords and Balbriggan in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[40993\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the Framework for Smaller Hospitals; the location and by whom is it being drawn up; if there is consultation with the smaller hospitals concerned; if there will be public consultation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":20,"content":"<p>The future organisation of our acute hospitals is a major policy issue for the Government.

The challenge is to make sure that they provide services, which can safely be delivered in these settings, in order to maximise the benefit to patients.All hospitals, irrespective of size, as well as associated GP and community services, must work together in an integrated way. There have already been very significant developments recently in healthcare delivery, particularly in the context of shifts to day surgery and ambulatory care, and the centralisation of low volume high complexity care into larger centres. In this context, it is necessary that we redefine the role of the smaller hospitals so that they continue to play a central part of the Irish Healthcare system. <\/p><p>The Framework for Smaller Hospitals defines the role of the smaller hospitals. It outlines the need for smaller hospitals and larger hospitals to operate together. The Framework outlines the wide range of services that can be provided within the smaller hospital.  It defines the need for the smaller hospital to be supported within a group of hospitals in terms of education and training, continuous professional development, the sustainable recruitment of high quality clinical staff and the safe management of patients who present with varying levels of complexity. It also sets out to address the categories of services that should transfer from the larger to the smaller hospitals and <i>vice versa<\/i> within a Hospital Group so that services are delivered in the most appropriate hospital.<\/p><p>Work is in progress on developing a detailed plan for service enhancements in each of the nine smaller hospitals that are covered by the Smaller Hospitals Framework.

The HSE has been required to review all pay and non-pay savings targets with a view to further targeting all areas which do not compromise patient safety.<\/p><p><br \/>  The HSE has indicated that it will achieve &#8364;130m in savings to address the deficit.

This initiative was in response to concerns about the large numbers of qualified Irish doctors travelling abroad, the career structure for doctors and the recent difficulties in filling non consultant hospital doctor (NCHD) posts in our hospitals. <\/p><p>  As part of my deliberations I consulted, in the first instance, with the medical schools via the Forum of Irish Postgraduate Medical Training Bodies. I met with representatives of the Forum last May concerning the proposal at which the NCHD representatives outlined their concerns regarding the proposed new grade. A survey of Higher Specialty trainees indicated that 75% of respondents did not agree with the proposal and 80% considered it would not incentivise them to return from abroad to work in Ireland.   Last July the Forum Trainee Subcommittee, which includes trainee representatives from across all the postgraduate training bodies, formally responded to me indicating their strong opposition to the introduction of a new consultant grade on the grounds that it would not address the issue of doctor retention and has the potential to exacerbate the problem. They also considered that it would  under utilise the trainees potential contribution to the Irish Healthcare System. <\/p><p>  As an alternative to the introduction of a new entry level consultant post it has been decided to introduce new salary arrangements for future consultant appointments involving a 30% reduction in salary for future consultant appointees.  <\/p><p>  The new salary arrangements for future consultant appointments will facilitate the continuing appointment of consultants, which will benefit patients as well as offering job opportunities for NCHDs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":45,"content":"<p>Question No. 19 answered with Question No. 11.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Reports","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA03450"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[40961\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he was informed of findings in the Health Service Executive July performance report which was published on 20 September 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"976","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":48,"content":"<p>The draft HSE performance report for July was received in my Department on the 7th of September. The figure reported therein of 339,441 patients waiting for an outpatient appointment is unacceptably high.

In April this year a HSE report indicated that based on unvalidated interim results, not including all hospitals, nearly 178,000 patients were waiting for an outpatient appointment. That HSE report related to 30 hospitals and indicated that the figures were likely to rise once figures became available from all hospitals.<\/p><p>  In a press briefing on 21 June this year the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) reported that its best estimate at that time was that the total national outpatient waiting list was likely to be approximately 350,000 patients. The major problem for patients was the number having to wait an inordinate amount of time for a consultation.<\/p><p>  I am determined to address outpatient waiting lists. Improving outpatient services is the next priority for the SDU.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in this standardised format will enable the SDU and NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed. It will also allow hospitals to begin to reform and standardise the manner in which they provide outpatient services to ensure that patients receive an equitable service irrespective of their geographical location.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA03600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":49,"content":"<p>Question No. 21 answered with Question No. 14.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Consultants Remuneration","counter":50,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA03750"},{"type":"question","counter":51,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[40792\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the options in place to deal with the medical consultants pay and their unwillingness to support his plans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":52,"qnumday":28,"qnumall":"[40092\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department was involved in the recent negotiations on the consultants contract; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":53,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[41011\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the issue of private practice was not on the table for negotiations with the consultants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1094","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[40965\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA04100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount the &euro;200 million in savings expected from the agreement reached with the hospital consultants will contribute towards bridging the deficit in the health budget this year; when he expects to see the savings from this agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":55,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[40791\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the options he has to deal with the position taken by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association (details supplied); if he will consider recommending to the Department of Finance the introduction of a super tax in such circumstances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1012","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[40966\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA04300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will outline the terms agreed with consultants at the Labour Relations Commission; the aspects of the deal that have yet to be agreed; his views on whether these changes will begin from 1 October; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 28, 33, 40, 52 and 63 together.<\/p><p>  Following a request on 13 September by senior health service management on behalf of the Government, intensive discussions between health service employers and the two consultant representative bodies commenced immediately at the Labour Relations Commission and concluded on 17 September 2012.  These dealt with a range of matters, including measures to ensure that the relevant parts of the Health Sectoral Agreement within the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 can be given effect.  The management team comprised officials from the HSE, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p>  The outcome of this engagement is that detailed proposals have been agreed between the parties. Amongst the key provisions of this agreement are that:<\/p><p>- Consultants will be available for rostering for any five days out of seven as opposed to weekdays as at present;<\/p><p>- There can be rostering of consultants where required on a 16\/7 (8 a.m. to midnight) or 24\/7 basis in services where this is required;<\/p><p>- Clinical Directors will have a much strengthened management role in respect of consultants;<\/p><p>- Consultants will cooperate with a range of measures to support improved Community and Mental Health services;<\/p><p>- Consultants commit to expeditious processing and signing of claims for submission to private health insurers;<\/p><p>- There will be more cost-effective arrangements for funding of continuing medical education.  <\/p><p>  In addition, the proposals agreed include provisions regarding compliance with the contractual requirements regarding private practice  These include a commitment by consultants to measures that ensure that public patients waiting for elective care of any type are seen within clinically appropriate timeframes and that the entirety of the Consultant&rsquo;s private activity, including in-patient, day-patient and out-patient activity, is within contractual limits. Also, the parties agreed that the current methodology and process for private practice measurement will be accepted as a minimum base for the purpose of determining compliance with contractual commitments on private practice and the parties are committed to developing the system to include the appropriate range of clinical activity.<\/p><p>  The agreement also puts on a formal basis consultants' co-operation with a range of productivity flexibilities, which will allow for considerable efficiencies in the use of hospital beds, with the potential to deliver a saving of 220,000 bed days annually.  Given that these flexibilities are centred on enhancing productivity on an ongoing basis, they are not expected to deliver immediate monetary savings.  A range of other measures are in train to address the current deficit. <\/p><p>  Separately, Government will apply a 30% reduction in salary for future consultant appointees.  Management proposals to reduce the &ldquo;rest day&rdquo; arrangements that currently apply and to eliminate the fee to consultant psychiatrists for giving a second opinion under the Mental Health Act 2001 will be referred to the Labour Court, in line with the procedures provided for in the Public Service Agreement.  The issue of &ldquo;historic rest days&rdquo; will be referred to the Labour Court in line with normal procedures.<\/p><p>  The medical representative organisations have agreed to present the agreed proposals on reforms to their members for consideration.  I expect this to be done in a timely manner having regard to the relevant provisions in the Public Sector Agreement.  <\/p><p>  I believe that the proposals which have been agreed between the parties, when implemented, will allow for very significant reforms in how health services are delivered and ultimately will lead to improved outcomes for users of the services. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA04400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":58,"content":"<p>Question No. 23 answered with Question No. 21.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA04550"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[37887\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"in relation to kidney transplant operations in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, where the waiting time for the procedure has increased from three to six months to 14 months, his views on the 70 patients who as of 31 May 2012 are at an advanced stage of work-up to have this procedure done with live donors; the number of those 70 patients thart are pre-emptive patients; and the difference in waiting times for those patients having the same procedure done privately at the same hospital","asker":"954","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":61,"content":"<p>I am advised by the HSE that the &lsquo;work up&rsquo; of patients for the live donor programme involves clinical assessment of both recipients and potential donors.

As a first step on that journey, hospitals will be aligned within groups on an administrative basis. Each Group will have a single consolidated management team with responsibility for performance and outcomes, within a clearly defined budget and employment ceiling.<\/p><p>  Hospitals in Cork and Kerry have already undertaken a significant amount of work in this respect, through the ongoing reconfiguration program, which has received wide support through its comprehensive consultation process.  Hospitals in the region have cooperated with a range of changes in the services they provide, in order to optimise patient care.  South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital has seen a number of changes in the past twelve months, such as the relocation of services from the St Mary&rsquo;s&rsquo; Orthopaedic \/HSE to the SIVUH which includes the orthopaedic services.  The transfer of this service coupled with the development of the paediatric orthopaedic services on the SIVUH site will greatly benefit the children of the Cork and Kerry region and reduce significantly the need for children and their parents to travel to Dublin based hospitals as heretofore.  The transfer of these services has been supported through the appointment of three additional consultant orthopaedic surgeons. <\/p><p>  The profile of the hospital is changing from an acute general hospital to a specialist tertiary referral hospital for the Cork and Kerry region; e.g. Orthopaedic surgery, Ear Nose and Throat (including head and neck surgery) and, in the near future, Ophthalmology.

The provision of services should be planned and facilitated across the group so as to ensure effective, efficient and safe services in the most appropriate location, to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients and their families.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700068#WRA05100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":67,"content":"<p>Question No. 28 answered with Question No. 22.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Bed Numbers","counter":69,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700069#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[40994\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700069#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason 22 beds remain closed at the Hospital of the Assumption, Thurles, County Tipperary; the efforts he is making to ensure that these beds are re-opened at the earliest opportunity; the date on which they will be re-opened; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":71,"content":"<p>The bed provision at the Hospital of the Assumption was reduced by 22 in September 2011, from 67 to 45 beds.

There is intensive engagement between my Department and the Health Service Executive to address the overrun in health expenditure.  In the short term to address the 2012 position I have instructed the Executive to impose cash limits on agency and overtime.  Furthermore, there will be more intensive management of absenteeism, travel and subsistence will be limited, and there will be more intensive management of stocks in order to better manage cash.

We are bound by our commitments to our international partners. They are our lenders of last resort. For now, we depend on them to enable us to pay our way. Our country has suffered the greatest economic crisis in living memory leading to a large fall in Exchequer revenues. Tax revenues fell from &euro;47 billion in 2007 to &euro;34 billion in 2011. However, we are rebuilding our revenue base - 2011 tax revenue was up &euro;2 billion on 2010 - but we do not have the resources to fund all the services that we would like to provide.<\/p><p>  It is in this context that expenditure plans for 2012 - 2014 were set in the Comprehensive Expenditure Report, published last December. The Health sector as with other sectors has incurred a reduction in the resources allocated to it. Further significant cost reduction\/extraction is required in 2013 and 2014. This year, in accordance with the National Service Plan, the HSE had to plan for a reduction in expenditure of &euro;750m in order to meet the targets set by Government as well as unavoidable pressures.  In the Comprehensive Expenditure Report for 2012 the Government has indicated that further savings of &euro;280m in line with Government targets in current health expenditure would be required over that period. However, additional savings will also be required to fund unavoidable pressures particularly in the area of community drugs schemes, additional superannuation costs and service pressures arising from demographic trends. Savings will also be required to provide for investment to meet commitments in the Programme for Government.<\/p><p>  The savings being sought over the period are designed to reduce the cost base in the health service, particularly in the areas of drugs costs and procurement and also provide for a more efficient and equitable collection of income from the use of private beds in public hospitals. Initial indications are that between &euro;750m and &euro;900m will have to be taken out of the cost base of the health sector next year to meet the commitments I have outlined. Some savings will arise from the reduction in the numbers employed in the Health Services in line with the Government's policy in respect of employment in the public services generally. There are also some efficiencies being sought in the provision of services. The objective is to reduce costs while maintaining services to the greatest extent possible. It is acknowledged that the Programme poses serious challenges to the management of the health services in the coming years particularly in the context of the major reform programme being undertaken by the Government.  However it is intended that through the achievement of greater efficiency in the delivery of services and the operation of the Croke Park agreement the savings can be achieved with the minimum impact on services.<\/p><p>  My Department is working intensively with the HSE on proposals for submission to Government to address structural expenditure issues in the context of the 2013 Estimates.

The priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.  The health service faces challenges this year, both in terms of reduced staffing levels and a reduced budget. The 2012 National Service Plan sets out what actions will be taken to address these challenges and to mitigate the impact of the reductions in overall staffing numbers on front line services. These actions include a target for reductions in agency costs.<\/p><p>  Agency staff may be used only in the most exceptional of circumstances and when all alternative avenues have been exhausted.  Such staff may only be engaged when signed off by identified senior management. In the light of the current serious budgetary situation in the HSE, further instructions concerning reductions on the use of agency staffing were issued by senior management in August this year.<\/p><p>  The HSE has provided the following information, as at the end of July 2012, on the average number of staff engaged each week from contracted agencies.

The HSE and the contracted agencies are currently making arrangements for the calculation and payment of back money due to agency staff.<\/p><p>  The health service must operate with the employment targets set by Government, in line with the Government's commitment to reduce public expenditure. The HSE has also implemented a general pause on recruitment in order to deal with the serious budgetary situation. Decisions on the filling of positions, including whether posts should be filled by directly recruited staff or by agency will be made by the HSE in the context of the need to meet employment reduction targets and cost containment targets. This would include the cost effectiveness of the direct recruited staff compared to agency staff. However, such cost comparisons will depend on the individual grade and the differing costs of using agency staff in that grade, such as the fee to be paid to the contracting agency and VAT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700072#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700072#WRE00750"},{"type":"question","counter":149,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[40975\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700072#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the special delivery unit has achieved its target of a nine month maximum wait time for inpatient and daycase surgery by September 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":150,"content":"<p>The target for 2012, as set in the Health Service Executive (HSE) Service Plan 2012, is that no adult shall be waiting more than 9 months for an elective procedure.

This means that we must concentrate on maximising efficiency and getting the best possible services for patients from the budgets available to us. However, this on its own is not sufficient. Activity levels in our acute hospitals have been running ahead of the levels set in the approved HSE Service Plan and therefore it is inevitable that activity levels must also be reduced. This will be a significant challenge, and in meeting it we must be flexible and responsive to service needs, in order to ensure that essential services are protected and that patient safety and quality remain paramount. <\/p><p>  For the Louth-Meath Hospital Group cost-containment measures will include:<\/p><p>- Reduction in spending on agency and overtime<\/p><p>- Closure of some beds, the effect of which will be mitigated in so far as possible by the commissioning of transitional care beds for clinically discharged patients<\/p><p>- Reduction in activity to bring it into line with approved levels<\/p><p>  This will be a significant challenge, and in meeting it the focus is on ensuring that essential services are protected and that patient safety and quality remain paramount. In particular, emergency services, oncology services and obstetrics are being prioritised and the focus is on protecting these.<\/p><p>  The Senior Management Team in the Louth Meath Hospital Group have already met with staff and staff union representatives to advise on the range of cost containment measures being introduced in Louth Meath Hospitals.  All measures proposed to date have been risk assessed and the Senior Management Team in Louth Meath Hospital Group are satisfied that the risk assessment is a reasonable and comprehensive assessment of potential risks, and their mitigation and control and is compliant with national policies and HSE guidelines.  The risk register will be managed by senior managers and clinicians within the hospital group.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that across the acute hospital sector as a whole, reduction in costs will come from greater efficiencies where possible, including shorter average length of stay which in turn reduces the number of bed days needed. For example, the implementation of the HSE&rsquo;s Acute Medicine Clinical Care Programme has saved 121,000 bed days to date this year.  Similarly, the HSE&rsquo;s transitional care initiative is shortening the average length of stay in acute beds by putting in place 190 transitional care beds and 150 rehabilitation beds this year, to which patients can move when appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700072#WRE01800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":166,"qnumday":61,"qnumall":"[40996\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700073#WRF00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a pregnant patient in Dublin is given an anomaly scan and a similar patient outside the city, and its hinterland, is not catered for in the public health system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1037","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":167,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700073#WRF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prescription Charges","counter":168,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700073#WRF00350"},{"type":"question","counter":169,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[40976\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700073#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to increase the 50 cent prescription charge; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":170,"content":"<p>Medical card holders are required to pay a 50c charge for medicines and other prescription items supplied to them by community pharmacists, subject to a cap of  &euro;10 per month for each person or family.

The HSE is committed to working in partnership with voluntary disability service providers including HDAI, to ensure that all of the resources available for people with disabilities are used in the most effective manner possible.  The HSE recognises the valuable contribution of the HDAI and approved a grant of just over &#8364;68,000 for 2012 to support the work of the organisation.

In conjunction with the development of the Rehabilitation Medicine Programme of the HSE Clinical Strategy Programmes Directorate, there is now a clear policy with a recommended service framework, which when implemented, will ensure that neuro-rehabilitation services are developed for those we serve in the most appropriate, effective and efficient way.  The HSE National Service Plan 2012, specifically supports the work of the Rehabilitation Medicine Programme in committing to the development of regional networks, local rehabilitation teams and the development of associated protocols, pathways and bundles.  The appointment of Regional Rehabilitation Medicine Consultants will, together with a multi-disciplinary team, ensure that national best practice is implemented in each Region, crossing the boundaries between acute and community services.   <\/p><p><br \/>  Medical cards are provided to persons who, under the provision of the Health Act 1970, are in the opinion of the HSE unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services and other health services for themselves and their dependants.  The assessment for a medical card is therefore determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  Under this legislation, there is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with specific illness such as Huntington's Disease.  There is however, a provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a card in cases of &quot;undue hardship&quot;, where the income guidelines are exceeded.  The HSE has recently set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ireland has been supportive of EU proposals on rare diseases, which concluded with a council recommendation in June 2009 that countries are recommended to develop plans or strategies preferably by the end of 2013.

The restructuring plan for the banking system creates capacity for the two pillar banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of &#8364;30 billion in the next three years. The Government has imposed targets on the two domestic pillar banks for lending to SMEs over the three calendar years 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending, including lending for working capital purposes, of at least &#8364;3 billion in 2011, &#8364;3.5 billion this year and &#8364;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. Both banks achieved their 2011 targets.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Credit Review Office (CRO) reviews decisions by the pillar banks to refuse, reduce or withdraw credit facilities (including applications for restructured credit facilities) from &#8364;1,000 up to &#8364;500,000. The Credit Review Office has to date overturned 60% of the decisions referred to them, supplying &#8364;6.9 million of credit, supporting 683 jobs in the SME sector. The Action Plan for Jobs 2012 contains a commitment, to be completed this year, to &#8220;assess the Credit Review Office to ensure SMEs are getting the support on bank lending they require.&#8221;  I understand that work is underway on this process and that my Department expects to receive a report in early November.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme, a key commitment under the Action Plan for Jobs 2012, will facilitate up to &#8364;150 million of additional lending to eligible SMEs per annum. Take-up of the Scheme will be closely monitored. The purpose of the scheme is to encourage additional lending to SMEs, not to substitute for conventional lending that would otherwise have taken place. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill was published on 22 June and my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is taking the legislation through the Oireachtas at present. The scheme, which is expected to be operational shortly, will facilitate up to &#8364;40 million in additional lending to microenterprises over the next five years (an Exchequer allocation of &#8364;10 million has already been approved by Government as seed capital for the fund).  Furthermore, the Government is in the process of facilitating up to &#8364;150 million per annum of additional credit through the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme, designed for SMEs which, because of lack of collateral or because of the specialised sector they operate in, face difficulties in accessing bank credit.  <\/p><p><br \/>  On 4 November 2011, the Central Bank published a revised statutory Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises (the SME Code) setting out new requirements for lenders when dealing with SMEs in, or facing, financial difficulties which came into effect from 1 January 2012. A full review of the SME Code will be undertaken by the Central Bank in 2012.<\/p><p><br \/>  In addition to these initiatives, and following the meeting between the President of the EIB, Mr. Werner Hoyer and myself and the Minister for Public Enterprise and Reform, officials from my Department and the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) have been engaging with the European Investment Bank (EIB) on non-traditional forms of EIB financing for Irish SMEs. This includes the EIB providing financing to SMEs via non-bank channels and there have been detailed discussions with the EIB on financing for an SME Fund being developed by the NPRF.

However, the budget measure that requires schools to manage the provision of guidance from within their standard staffing allocation must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times. The net impact on overall teacher numbers in our schools has been minimised to the greatest extent possible. <\/p><p>  Teacher allocations to post primary schools for the 2012\/13 school year have effectively been settled at this stage and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. Decisions on how this is done are taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.   A key priority for me is to continue to prioritise and target available funding at schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. All 195 second-level school in DEIS have been given targeted support by a more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This is a 0.75 point reduction compared to the existing PTR of 19:1 that applies in non fee-paying second-level schools.  <\/p><p>  My Department also provided some limited short-term support to schools through curricular concessions in order to help them manage within their approved teaching allocation.   It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students.  While the school's guidance planning should involve the guidance counsellor(s) in the first instance, other members of school staff and management also have key roles to play.  Parents and students must be seen as an essential part of the process.  Through this process schools can, for example, consider the following options for maximising the use of their available resources for the provision of guidance:<\/p><p>- Optimise the delivery of  personal educational, career and vocational guidance in class group settings,<\/p><p>- Enable students to use directly the extensive range of guidance tools available through the internet from relevant websites (e.g. Qualifax, Careers Portal) <\/p><p>- Enable some of the curriculum elements of  the planned guidance  programme  to be delivered through other teachers such as SPHE staff,<\/p><p>- Maximise the role of the pastoral care team in schools, and<\/p><p>- Ensure that the  guidance counsellor has 1:1 time towards meeting the counselling needs of students experiencing difficulties or crisis.<\/p><p>The support of the whole school community, parents and the relevant external agencies such as NEWB and NEPS are key to the provision of guidance and support to schools.<\/p><p>  Psychologists from my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) also provide a range of supports to schools.  These include the promotion of positive mental health among the general student body and assistance in supporting pupils with particular social, emotional or behavioural difficulties.<\/p><p>  My Department is also aiming to launch the Guidelines on Mental Health for Post-Primary Schools later this year. These guidelines aim to support schools in developing a whole-school approach to mental health promotion and suicide prevention and are of relevance to all members of the school community. In particular, they have been developed to support principals, guidance counsellors, student support teams, and teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700075#WRH01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700075#WRH01550"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[41206\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700075#WRH01600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to cater for the future accommodation needs of a school (details supplied) in Dublin 24; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":228,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department is currently considering the position relating to the accommodation needs of the school to which he refers and my officials will be in further contact with the school authority as soon as this process has been completed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700075#WRH01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":231,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700076#WRJ00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Monuments","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700076#WRJ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[41220\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700076#WRJ00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the current position regarding a project (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>Following an engineering assessment, it has been found necessary to replace three of the existing pedestrian footbridges at the Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne Visitor Centre.<\/p><p>  The Office of Public Works is currently on site and has commenced work assembling a temporary bridge, which will be used while the permanent bridges are being replaced.

In addition, IDA Ireland continues to promote other key locations as part of its marketing efforts and on an opportunistic basis in response to specific client requirements.

The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is around &euro;2 billion. Child benefit is paid to around 600,000 families in respect of some 1.15 million children. The Government is conscious that child benefit, as a universal payment, can be an important source of income for all families, especially during a time of recession and high unemployment. The social protection system also provides assistance to low income families with children through the payment of qualified child increases on primary social welfare payments and through the family income supplement payment. Both of these provide a level of assistance to low-income families. <\/p><p>  I am conscious that achieving a better design of the overall system of child income supports, including child benefit, raises complex issues about the effectiveness of the full range of income supports currently provided to families and their children. In this context and in line with a commitment in the Programme for Government, I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year, which has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Advisory Group prioritised the area of family and child income supports and has completed its work on this area. Their report is currently receiving my consideration and will assist the Government in setting out a pathway towards a more appropriate system of child income supports. <\/p><p>  Given the universal nature of child benefit, claimants are not asked to make a declaration of their income or that of other members in their family.  It is not possible therefore to make a reliable estimate on the basis of available data of any savings that might accrue through the non-payment of child benefit to persons in households with incomes of over &euro;100,000 per annum.  A detailed estimate of this nature would not only require current household income data but also detailed specifications of the definition of income, whose income was to be included, what time period was to be considered etc.   Issues regarding compliance procedures of the Revenue Commissioners do not therefore arise and in any event would be a matter for my cabinet colleague, the Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700078#WRL02200","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Statutory Sick Pay Scheme","counter":287,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700078#WRL02300"},{"type":"question","counter":288,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[41145\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700078#WRL02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding statutory sick pay in respect of persons (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":289,"content":"<p>The Government is considering the introduction of a scheme of statutory sick pay at this time for a number of compelling reasons &ndash; firstly as a measure to help in addressing the deficit in the social insurance fund; secondly, as a measure to limit progression from short-term illness to long-term illness or disability; and thirdly, to bring Ireland into line with practices in other countries in this area.<\/p><p>  In considering the matter, I am acutely conscious of the pressures facing employers in the current economic climate, and in particular, the pressures facing smaller and medium-sized enterprises.<\/p><p>  There is a range of complex issues that need to be addressed before any decision could be taken by Government on the possible introduction of such a scheme &ndash; the extent of coverage; the rate of payment; possible compensation mechanisms for employers where appropriate and how a scheme would be enforced and policed &ndash; and these will be discussed in the course of the wider process associated with the preparation of Budget 2013.

The CER&#8217;s review for the gas year commencing 1<sup>st<\/sup> October 2012 involved a detailed assessment by the CER of BGE&#8217;s own proposals on gas prices published on the 18<sup>th<\/sup> July, followed by a consultation process inviting comments from interested parties - including the public - and culminated in the decision published by the CER on 4<sup>th<\/sup>   September.  <\/p><p>In the CER consultation document published on 27<sup>th<\/sup> July, the CER noted that the proposed allowed increase in revenue would go up or down depending on the movement in commodity prices, exchange rates and the ongoing 5 year review of network tariffs.  The annual consultation process also allows BGE to update the regulator in regard to any changes in the intervening period.  All documents are available on the CER&#8217;s website at <\/p><p><br \/>  The increase initially sought by BGE in its submission equated to a 7.5% increase in tariffs.  However, in the period following the publication of the CER&#8217;s consultation paper on the BGE tariff, gas commodity costs rose because the value of the Euro against Sterling further decreased.  This is a key driver of prices given that Ireland purchases over 95% of its gas from Great Britain.  To take account primarily of these external cost drivers, I understand that BGE subsequently sought CER approval for an increase in retail tariffs for the coming year of the order of 9.2%.  The CER considered, however, that an increase of no higher than 8.5% was justified. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Government is most concerned at the impact of higher gas and electricity prices on residential and commercial consumers.  As indicated above, it is regrettably the case that in the main Ireland is at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices which dictate the retail price of gas and electricity.  My focus is on those very limited elements of energy costs over which policy can exercise some control.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Accordingly, it is estimated that some &#8364;226 million overall has been spent on the Better Energy programme on energy efficiency measures since commencement.  This includes funding of &#8364;142.25 million for some 330,000 measures in 130,000 households under the Better Energy: Warmer Homes scheme.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Better Energy: Warmer Homes delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to household that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors in order to ensure national coverage.  Since the commencement of the Programme in 2000, energy efficiency upgrades have been delivered to 85,000 homes amounting to &#8364;84.5m in Exchequer funding.  In addition, the Government is actively supporting the rollout of renewable resources of electricity which has grown from an estimated 9.3% of electricity consumed in 2007 to an estimated 17.6% in 2011.<\/p><p><br \/>  There are a number of ways for consumers to take actions on electricity and gas prices, and measures in place to assist them.  They can shop around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers bearing in mind that other suppliers can and do offer competitive prices and products.  Consumers can also take steps to improve the efficiency of their electricity and gas usage which delivers demonstrable savings.<\/p><p>The CER is also working with energy suppliers to ensure that vulnerable customers are protected through, inter alia, the installation of Pay As You Go meters.  The long term policy responses for Ireland to combat vulnerability to high and volatile gas prices continue to be increasing the use of renewables, achieving better energy efficiencies and reducing the reliance on gas in the fuel mix.  Implementation of the measures set out in the Government&#8217;s Affordable Energy Strategy is also key to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700080#WRN00700","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Television Reception","counter":313,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700080#WRN00750"},{"type":"question","counter":314,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[41091\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700080#WRN00800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his views on a matter regarding Saorview in County Kerry (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":315,"content":"<p>RT&Eacute; has built, owns and controls the SAORVIEW TV network and is responsible for the roll-out, coverage and operation of that network.

Mindful of the very difficult situations faced by affected homeowners and the time that they have waited for a resolution to the pyrite problem, I set a tight deadline of the end of September for the stakeholders to come back to me with their proposals. I recently wrote to them reaffirming the position I outlined in my discussions with them. <\/p><p><br \/>  In its report, the Pyrite Panel clearly states that it did not believe the State responsible for the pyrite problem and consequently did not consider that it should be expected to bear the costs of remediation. The basis for this conclusion is dealt with in some detail in the report, including a comparison with the regulations for hardcore in other jurisdictions . The Panel concluded that , prior to the identification of pyritic heave in Ireland, the Building Regulations in Ireland compared favourably with those in the UK and in other jurisdiction   s and were reflective of the knowledge and experience at that time in Ireland. <\/p><p><br \/>  Part D (Materials and Workmanship) of the second schedule to the Building Regulations required that all works be carried out with proper materials and which are &#8220; <i>fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used<\/i> &#8221;. Technical Guidance Documents (TGD) provide guidance on how compliance with the Building Regulations can be achieved in practice and TGD C provides general guidance on hardcore. Prior to the emergence of the pyrite problem 2007 it required the hardcore to be &#8220; <i>clean and free from matter liable to cause damage to the concrete<\/i> &#8221;. It was the Panel&#8217;s view that it was unreasonable to expect the unprecedented nature of pyrite in hardcore to be identified during routine inspections by building control officers.<\/p><p><br \/>  The report is also clear in terms of who it believed should be responsible for the cost of remediation.   As I have stated on a number of occasions , my preferred approach to achieve solution s for homeowners is for the responsible parties to work with me to agree a voluntary process.  However, in the absence of industry coming forward with a viable process, I will seek Government agreement to an imposed solution as envisaged in the pyrite report. Recommendation 14 in the report recommends the establishment of a Resolution Board and the suggested mechanism for the funding of this Board is a levy on the construction\/quarrying sector and related insurance sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700082#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":365,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[41157\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700082#WRP01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will ensure that all homes containing reactive pyrite be systematically remediated; the steps that have been taken to ensure that mortgage providers and insurers are not blacklisting pyrite remediated developments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1020","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":366,"content":"<p>I believe the approach recommended by the Pyrite Panel to categorise dwellings provides a practical solution to prioritise the remediation of affected dwellings.

My Department supports fire authorities through the setting of general policy and guidance, and the provision of capital funding, including the recoupment (within the overall funding available) of costs incurred by fire authorities in relation to approved construction projects and the purchase of fire appliances and equipment.  The current priority for capital funding is supporting the national fire appliance fleet, in respect of which Dublin Fire Brigade has been approved for 2 new appliances which are currently in the tender process. <\/p><p>  A proposal to extend Tallaght fire station was approved in principle in 2006 under the\u00a0Fire Services Capital Programme.

Those having to wait longer than 3 months (the target for 2012) have decreased from 5,062 to 1,711, a drop of 66% .<\/p><p>  The initial priority for the SDU was trolley waits and day cases. It has now begun to work on improving access to outpatient services.  The SDU and National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) are on trajectory to take over the reporting of outpatient waiting times from the HSE shortly.  This work will involve the systematic collection of waiting time data at an individual patient level and in a standardised format from all hospitals providing a consultant-led hospital outpatient service. The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will enable the SDU and NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure they are seen and assessed. It will also allow hospitals to begin to reform and standardise the manner in which it provides outpatient services to ensure that patients receive an equitable service irrespective of their geographical location. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700091#WRY00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Issues","counter":565,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700091#WRY00550"},{"type":"question","counter":566,"qnumday":199,"qnumall":"[41171\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700091#WRY00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is satisfied regarding the adequacy of staff numbers throughout the various health services with particular reference to accident and emergency or other emergency services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":567,"content":"<p>The cumulative impact of staff reductions from this year and previous years presents a significant challenge for the health system in delivering services.

In the current economic climate, the acute hospital sector must reduce its costs in order to deliver the agreed level of activity within the resources available to it. In terms of service delivery, we must concentrate on getting the best possible services for patients from the budgets available to us. This means we need to focus on how beds are used, on the throughput of patients, on reducing length of stay to international norms and on having as many procedures as possible carried out as day cases rather than inpatient work, thus maximising also the efficient usage of operating theatre facilities.<\/p><p>  Measures aimed at achieving greater efficiency in the use of existing resource include prudent management of high-cost drugs (eg oncology and rheumatology) as well as a range of measures related to better use of bed-days and staffing, including bed capacity.  The Reduction in Average Length of Stay (ALOS), from the performance to date this year of 7.2 days to the target in the HSE Service Plan of 5.8 days.  The reduction in ALOS will be achieved by full implementation of the HSE National Clinical Care Programmes, in particular the Acute Medicine Programme, the Surgery Programme and the Frail Elderly Programme. As an example, approximately 121,000 bed days nationally have been saved to date through the implementation of the Acute Medicine Programme. <\/p><p>  The Clinical Care Programmes provide a national, strategic and co-ordinated approach to a wide range of clinical services.  They have three main objectives &ndash; to improve the quality of care, to improve access and to improve cost-effectiveness.  Their primary aim is to modernise the way hospital services are provided across a wide range of clinical areas.  This is being done through standardising access to and delivery of high quality, safe and efficient hospital services, and maximising linkages to primary care and other community services.   Funding of &euro;23.4m is being provided in 2012 to hospital budgets to recruit staff to progress the implementation of the Acute Medicine Programme, the Emergency Medicine Programme, the Stroke Programme, the Surgery Programme and other clinical programmes.  Currently there are 29 Clinical Care Programmes in different stages of development\/implementation. There are also initiatives underway for Retrieval, Medications Management, Perspective Funding and Productive Wards.  Many of the programmes have now produced models of care and guidelines which have been jointly agreed and endorsed for implementation with\/by the colleges. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700091#WRY01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service Provision","counter":576,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700091#WRY01350"},{"type":"question","counter":577,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[41176\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012092700091#WRY01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is satisfied regarding the adequacy of ambulance service cover in all regions throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":578,"content":"<p> The HSE National Ambulance Service (NAS) provides pre-hospital emergency care and emergency and some non-emergency patient transport. The Service has undergone significant change and modernisation, in order to ensure quality, safety and value for money.  <\/p><p>  Before the NAS was established, each health board had its own ambulance service.  There was little co-ordination of activities across board boundaries and no clear national leadership on pre-hospital care. Supported by my Department, the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council and HIQA, the NAS is providing national management and integration of ambulance services.<\/p><p>  In particular, the following are being addressed: ongoing reduction to two ambulance control centres nationally; appointment of a medical director for the NAS; introduction of advanced paramedics who can provide more complex life-saving care on-site care; modernisation of communications and control infrastructure; and development and implementation of new performance indicators for pre-hospital care.<\/p><p>  In addition, and in line with the Croke Park Agreement, the Labour Court issued a binding recommendation, directing the National Ambulance Service (NAS) and the unions with negotiation rights for paramedic staff to address a number of overtime inefficiencies in rostering arrangements. Up to recently, a number of ambulance stations had worked in isolation from each other, with built in overtime for staff resulting in duplication of service. The amount of overtime involved was 24 hours per station per week. <\/p><p>  The National Ambulance Service and recognised unions have concluded discussions on roster changes at approximately 30 ambulance stations around the country, to eliminate such arrangements and improve operational efficiencies. New rostering arrangements have begun in a large number of stations. Following discussions with staff and based on activity and demand levels, a number of stations have additional cover under the new arrangements. <\/p><p>  Where necessary, emergency cover is supported by advanced paramedics in rapid response vehicles and by resources dynamically deployed from adjacent stations on a rolling basis.  The NAS has also introduced a new Intermediate Care Service to address routine inter-hospital transfers and to release emergency ambulances for emergency service work. The net effect of these changes is improved efficiency and increased resource availability across the area. <\/p><p>The NAS is a dynamic service. It responds to calls on a prioritised basis, through the Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System (AMPDS), which is in operation in all NAS Command and Control Centres. The NAS has established that 10% of all 999 calls are inappropriate for an emergency ambulance and a further 50% are neither life threatening or serious.
