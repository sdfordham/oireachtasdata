There is no doubt that the Seanad has been to the fore in prioritising LGBT rights this term, from introducing legislation dealing with an apology to and exoneration of men criminalised in the State before 1993 to a Bill dealing with pensions and my upcoming Bill dealing with transgender rights so that young people can have their true gender recognised.  That Bill will be debated in the House on 10 May.  All these initiatives are part of an important process that aims to make Ireland not only a model republic but a beacon of hope for oppressed people and LGBTQI people everywhere.  It is in that spirit that I hope Ireland does what we can and I expect Ireland to do what we can to support LGBTQI people, in particular, gay men, in Chechnya.<\/p><p>I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the reports from human rights groups in Chechnya that more than 100 men suspected by Chechen forces of being gay have been interned in specifically designed internment camps.  The reports go further to say that three men have been killed and that, so far, men currently detained are being tortured with electric currents and heavily beaten, sometimes to death.  When asked for a reaction to the allegations, a spokesperson for the Chechen President denied the claims and suggested that there are no gay people in the region.  He stated:<\/p><blockquote>You cannot arrest or repress people who just don't exist in the republic.  If such people existed in Chechnya, law enforcement would not have to worry about them since their own relatives would have sent them to where they could never return.<\/blockquote> <p>Chechnya is largely isolated and this situation remains shrouded, with a lack of confirmation on the exact situation regarding the internment camps.  I do not think I could point to a more worrying situation than the Administration itself has done.  It is clear that the Chechen President feels that Chechnya needs to be cleansed of gay citizens and his delusional denial of the existence of gay men does not invoke any degree of confidence in his rejections of claims that these internment camps exist.<\/p><p>I have a couple of questions which I hope the Minister of State will be able to answer or take to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade aware of the situation?  Has the Department spoken to the Russian ambassador?  Will the Department continue to monitor and investigate these reports?  Will the Minister urgently contact his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, to ascertain the situation in Chechnya?  Will the Minister make contact with his European counterparts also?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#A00500","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue and apologise that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is not able to attend.<\/p> <p>In our international relations, Ireland supports the promotion and protection of the human rights of all persons, irrespective of their sexual orientation and gender identity.  Ireland believes that consensual same-sex relationships between adults should not be criminalised and supports measures to ensure that the right to freedom of expression and association can be enjoyed effectively by all people.  Ireland co-sponsored an historic resolution on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity, which was adopted at the UN human rights council in 2011.  This was the first time a UN resolution explicitly acknowledged human rights protection as covering sexual orientation and demonstrates the increasing commitment across the broader international community to the promotion and protection of the human rights of all persons, irrespective of their sexual orientation and gender identity.<\/p> <p>The ongoing deterioration in the protection of human rights in civil society space in Russia is deeply troubling.

The United Nations and regional institutions, of which Russia is a member, made clear that the Russian law in question, as well as other infringements of LGBT rights in the country, are a direct violation of international human rights law and of Russia's international obligations.<\/p><p>I am aware of alarming reports by international human rights organisations and by the media of the abduction of over 100 men in recent days in the Chechen Republic on the basis of their sexual orientation, as part of a co-ordinated campaign.  Reports also indicate that those abducted were subjected to torture and ill-treatment, as well as forced to disclose the identities of other LGBT individuals they know.  According to these reports, at least three men have also died as a result of these actions.<\/p><p>lf confirmed, these reports would amount to serious violations of basic human rights that are sadly a further addition to the long list of human rights abuses in Chechnya.  The reaction of Chechen authorities to these allegations, seeking to justify violence against members of the LGBT community, is unacceptable and deeply disturbing.  I note a statement on behalf of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, last week that law enforcement authorities would look into these reports.  The Minister is calling on the Russian Government to urgently undertake a thorough investigation into the reports of the abduction and killing of gay men in Chechnya, to reject the cynical statement of local Chechen officials justifying violence against and the murder of gay men and to make it clear that it does not condone such statements.  It is also incumbent on the Russian Government to take the necessary steps to protect those fleeing persecution in Chechnya, as well as those civil society activists who are offering assistance to them.<\/p><p>As to Senator&rsquo;s question as to whether the Minister has raised this with the Russian ambassador, it is my understanding that it has not been raised directly yet.  The reports of this have only emerged over recent days and the Minister is still in the process of receiving information on the extent and the nature of the actions.

As the Minister of State is aware, over the past several years, there are 678 fewer local authority members than there were when the reform of local government took place under the previous Government.  There are now only 949 local authority members.  We used to have 114 local authority areas, including town councils, but this has been reduced to 31.  Ireland holds the sad distinction of having fewer public representatives per head of population than any other country in western Europe.  There is one local authority member for every 5,000 members of the public, as opposed to one local authority member for every 100 persons in France.  France takes local government seriously with every town, village and crossroads having somebody who represents the community at local authority level.<\/p> <p>Ireland has not only taken away many of the local authority areas and members, but their terms and conditions have been reduced drastically over the years.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government previously outlined to the House why he was discriminating against those in Dublin, Galway and Cork cities and not treating them equally in his proposals.<\/p> <p>I was hoping the Minister of State would outline to the House if the Minister has fulfilled his pledges to us and the terms and conditions he promised would be put in place.

Unfortunately, that is not the case.<\/p> <p>We are chasing county councillors out of local democracy because the reality is that, in order to do one's job properly, it is a full-time job.  There is no way one can hold down a job properly and be a local representative at the same time.  It is just not possible.  All we are looking for is fair play and a fair day's pay for a fair day&rsquo;s work.  No local representative goes into local government to make money.

In turn, effective local government cannot be achieved without the hard work and commitment of elected members in service of their communities.  I join with the Senators in commending the work of many local authority members across the country.  A range of financial supports is in place to assist councillors in their vital work.  These include a representational payment, fixed annual expenses allowances, travel and subsistence allowances, a mobile phone allowance, a retirement gratuity, as well as conference and training provisions.<\/p> <p>The programme for a partnership Government includes a commitment to review the supports provided to councillors, in consultation with representative bodies, to enable councillors to continue their important work.  Shortly after assuming office, the Minister met with representatives of the Association of Irish Local Government, ALG, and the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA, to discuss the view of their members that positive consideration should be given to improving the range of supports available.  In January this year, taking account of the considerable additional workload on councillors since the 2014 local government reforms were introduced, the Minister announced two important changes to better support councillors in their role as public representatives.<\/p> <p>First, a municipal district members' allowance worth &euro;1,000 per annum is being introduced in the 25 local authorities that now have municipal districts, as these areas were most affected by the reduction in councillor numbers since 2014.  Second, a new vouched annual expenses allowance of up to a maximum of &euro;5,000 is being introduced which councillors may choose to opt for in place of the existing unvouched fixed rate annual expenses allowance worth approximately &euro;2,500.  These new measures must be implemented from July this year, following the necessary legislative amendments being put in place in consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The ALG, on behalf of its members, has called for a degree of flexibility to be applied to the new annual expenses allowance by retaining an unvouched element while amounts above this would be claimed on a vouched basis.  The Minister is taking this matter under consideration and has asked his Department to examine this proposal in the context of the arrangements in place for members of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>The Department is also examining the revised travel rates for public servants recently announced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform so as to consider how they can best be aligned with councillors' terms and conditions in a manner that is both fair to councillors but also has a clear rationale and is consistent with rates that apply elsewhere.  Consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Revenue Commissioners will be necessary.<\/p> <p>I again thank the Senators for raising this matter.

It caters for pupils between the ages of four and 18 years with severe and profound learning difficulties, moderate and multiple learning disabilities and-or autism.  It is an important project for the community at large.  While the Department has gone some way towards progressing the project, the approval of the Minister for Education and Skills is necessary if it is to proceed further.  <\/p> <p>The Department has accepted that this major building project is a priority to progress to tender and construction stage.  On 31 January it was authorised to complete stage 2B, architectural planning.  The initial feasibility study for the new school accommodation was carried out in 2002.  The design team was appointed in 2006 but for various reasons delays have occurred, including because of an increase in enrolments and changes to the schedule of accommodation.  Since 2002 the school population has doubled in size and the school's facilities are totally inadequate to meet the needs of the pupils.  The school operates on two sites such that pupils attending the White Star complex in Market Street in the town have to travel by bus, on a daily basis, to the main building for lunch.  There is a severe lack of space in both buildings.  For example, one class which comprises four wheelchair users is held in the PE storeroom.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree that this is not acceptable.<\/p> <p>I pay tribute to the board of management, previous boards of management, the principal and staff for the excellent job they are doing in difficult circumstances.  The board of management does not want to introduce waiting lists for the first time in the school's history as it is the only school of its type in Cavan-Monaghan.  However, if something is not done soon and it is not possible to accommodate all of the children who need to attend the school, serious problems will arise for children in both counties with moderate, severe and-or profound disabilities.  Children who need to attend the school must not be deprived of that opportunity.  It is important that the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, give the go-ahead for commencement of construction of the project this year.  <\/p> <p>The school sought and was granted planning permission last year for temporary accommodation to enable it to move site this summer to allow construction work to commence on the main site before the end of this year.  The board of management, the parents association and the wider school community are frustrated by the delays.  It is important that the requisite approval be issued at the earliest possible opportunity.  I ask the Minister of State to impress this point on the Minister.  <\/p> <p>The project is a priority for councillors and Oireachtas representatives in Cavan-Monaghan.  My colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, has been raising the issue on a regular basis and was instrumental in the granting of initial approval in 2002 for commencement of construction of this project.

I understand the urgency attached to the project, given that it involves a multidenominational and co-educational special needs school which caters for pupils aged between four and 18 years with moderate and profound learning difficulties and autism.  The project was included in the six-year programme announced on 17 November 2015 to proceed to tender and construction.  The original brief was to provide a 21 classroom school.  Following a meeting with the Department in December 2015, the school and its design team were authorised to increase the scale of the project to deliver a new 26 classroom school.  As outlined by Senator Diarmuid Wilson, on 18 November 2016 the design team submitted a stage 2A addendum report to the Department for review.  The review was completed by the end of January 2017 and the board of management and its design team were authorised to complete stage 2B - developed design stage.  This stage includes obtaining planning permission, a fire safety certificate and a disability access certificate.  <\/p> <p>All statutory approvals have now been secured for the project.  Construction will require the full decant of the existing school to temporary accommodation on a nearby site.  The decant will be an integral part of the school building project and form part of the main contract.  Planning permission for the decant accommodation was secured in August 2016.

I welcome the long-awaited deal struck between the Department of Health and Vertex to provide the life-saving drug, Orkambi, to cystic fibrosis patients.  Campaigners have been appealing to the Minister for Health for well over 18 months for this drug, which will radically change the lives of more than 1,000 people who suffer from cystic fibrosis.  There has been a lot of campaigning for this and Deputies and Senators in my own party have been dealing with cystic fibrosis patients and their supporters.<\/p> <p>I also wish to raise the controversy surrounding the post office network.  It has been indicated that 265 post offices around the country are unviable and many face closure.  I am sure this will affect post offices in urban areas but it would decimate rural Ireland as post offices are a lifeline to many areas.  On last night's \"Prime Time\", the chief executive of An Post, David McRedmond, said there would be a significant number of closures and that if the company does not make changes needed for the future the whole system will collapse.  We need urgent clarity from the Government on what it intends to do to prevent such closures.  Government responsibility for post offices and the future network seems to be shared by a number of Departments and Ministers.  The Government received the Bobby Kerr report almost a year ago, which outlined a number of practical solutions, but it has not yet addressed it.  It is unacceptable.  It is important that we tackle this issue.  We must put a new emphasis on defending services, particularly in rural Ireland, and stop neglecting positive ideas that could help.  I see there has been a row between the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, and the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, which the Minister, Deputy Naughten, seems to have won for the moment.  We should bring the Minister to the House to talk about it.<\/p> <p>I call on the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, to come to the Seanad to discuss the delay in publishing the interim report on mother and baby homes.

It is all very well for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, to say he has asked the joint committee, of which I am a member, to look at alternative funding models but many people have taken exception to the suggestion that every large tablet other than a mobile phone should attract a television licence fee or something like that.  This House should debate the issue thoroughly.  There are many other models, such as earmarking a portion of the local property tax for the fee and imposing it on every house, or giving responsibility for collecting the fee to an agency such as the Electricity Supply Board, which supplies to every single dwelling and commercial premises in the country.  It would be a retrograde step to ask people for over &euro;150 per year for the capacity to receive television programmes, however indirectly, on their tablets and portable computers and it would be deeply unpopular with the people.  It is about time that the management in RTE realised that there cannot be an increase in the licence fee as it is currently constituted.

I would like an invitation to be extended as a matter of urgency to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, to come to the Chamber to respond to questions on the second interim report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes which was published yesterday and her response to it.  The survivor groups waited anxiously for eight months for the report to be published and their experiences to be validated by the State.  Yesterday, amid the noise from the water committee and on other issues, they received validation that the lies and their experiences did not matter.  They are reeling from the shock and speechless for now at their dismissal in the report.  This compounds the pain and emotional distress for those blighted by the cruelty wrought upon them.  It is laughable that Judge Murphy found no evidence of abuse because 600 people gave harrowing evidence to the commission, in many instances backed up by medical documents, of the physical, emotional and sexual violence that made up their daily lives.  The Minister also talked to survivors, yet she agrees with the commission's statement.  The dogs in the street know that abuse of an horrific nature occurred.  I have counselled many survivors and I am privy to the extremities of the twisted abuse they suffered.  It was a sadistic environment and a reign of terror by religious orders with State support and involvement.  The report is an attempt at washing Ireland's dirtiest open secret - our concentration camps, our babies for adoption factories and our slave trade.  Look at the length of time it took for the Magdalen women to be given an apology.  They were made to beg for years.  Even now, what was promised remains to be fulfilled.  As the final report is not due to be published until next year, there is still time to extend the terms of reference.  Survivors have the right to know who they are, where they came from and who their people are.  They have the right to know why the adoptees are treated differently in the report.  Is there a hierarchy in Ireland's concentration camps?  There was a recommendation that there be an amnesty from prosecution in order that those who were involved would give evidence.  They should be subpoenaed and not treated with kid gloves.  Survivors have asked me to ask the Houses and the Minister responsible where is the decency and empathy and where the moral compass lies in determining whether heinous wrongs will be investigated and addressed.  Who in this Chamber believes the State has not been implicated in the savage cruelty inflicted, the slavery and torture of very vulnerable women, girls and infants?  The survivors I have mentioned all seek truth, justice and accountability.  They want more than tea and sympathy.  The terms of reference of the commission must be extended.

Yesterday the national safeguarding committee chaired by Patricia Rickard-Clarke launched the findings of its RedC poll on vulnerable adults in Irish society.  I recommended that people look at the report.  Some of the findings are stark and timely, given our recent debate.  It is clear from the findings that adult abuse is widespread.  Two in five people think vulnerable adults are treated badly, while 48% claim they have experienced abuse of a vulnerable adult.

There have been a number of requests made this morning and I agree that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs should be invited to come to the House to discuss the issue of mother and baby homes.  In the past few weeks I have found the noise in the Houses on the issue of water charges distressing.  One sees images of Deputies and Senators with scraps of paper surrounded by other parliamentary colleagues and there have been discussions of the threat of an election and the possibility that the issue will cause the collapse of the Government.  An incredible amount of energy has gone into discussing the issue.  It would be refreshing if the issue of child poverty created the same amount of heat, excitement and enthusiasm in all political parties represented in the House.  It would be refreshing to witness a politician in the Houses with a scrap of paper discussing how the issue of child poverty could be adequately addressed and tackled and to have those surrounding that individual saying it is something on which we could go to the country.  It is of fundamental importance to the survival of the Republic.  Anybody who believes in the real meaning of the word \"republic\" would take the issue of child poverty that seriously.  However, the issue which generates that effect is water charges.  It is the issue that has got people excited.  On the issue of child poverty, I want to make a practical suggestion that the Minister be invited to come to the House to discuss her vision for the ongoing area based childhood, ABC, programme which encompasses a number of initiatives, including in my constituency the preparing for life scheme in Darndale.  There are 15 such schemes across the country.  I would like to have the Minister's input on how she believes the schemes that tackle child poverty and empower parents can be enhanced in the coming years.<\/p> <p>Like other Senators, I raise the issue of Chechnya and LGBT rights.  This was the first country in the world to openly vote in favour of marriage equality.  We have a number of things of which we can be proud in this country in promoting LGBT rights across the political spectrum.  Most recently, my colleague, Senator Gerald Nash, has been attempting to push that agenda further in this Chamber.  We are a beacon of light for the world when it comes to LGBT rights.  It is important when the Vice President of America wants to roll back on LGBT rights that we stand firmly in opposition.  In Chechnya there are reports that camps and detention centres are being established and that young LGBT males, in particular, are being rounded up and sent to them.  It is important we take a stand against this.  I respectfully ask that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade be asked to come to the Chamber to discuss the issue in order that we can have a proper conversation with him about how he can discuss the issue with the Russian ambassador to this country because we are a beacon of light when it comes to dealing with certain issues.  This is a country which has a proud recent record of promoting LGBT rights.  It is something on which we should not be behind the door when speaking about how we can play our role in the international fight for LGBT equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#H00600","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":50,"content":"<p>As my party's spokesperson on foreign affairs, I support the views of Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in on what is happening in Chechnya and LGBT rights.<\/p> <p>I will raise a different issue.

In December 2014, I spoke on \"Morning Ireland\" on the day after the \"Prime Time\" investigation featuring bungalow 3 in &Aacute;ras Attracta in Swinford.  A major water protest was held the following morning.  The question that struck me that day was when we, as a country, would deal with the major issues we face, given that people in a nursing home were being rounded on by others whose role was to care for, protect and support them.  I do not wish to detract from the concern and passion people have about water or their ability to pay water charges or otherwise.  I plead with all Members in both Houses to get back to the work of ensuring we have proper public and social services, especially in the area of disabilities.

Since then, many individuals with disabilities, their families and supporters and members of disability groups have visited the House.  Those with whom I have spoken have said they found all of the staff of the Oireachtas, including ushers, porters and catering staff, to be highly thoughtful and accommodating.

The suggestion that half of all post offices could face closure creates fear throughout rural Ireland and among those who are aware of the value of the post office network.  Post offices are crying out for investment and diversification of services.

We have heard a great deal over the years about post offices providing banking and other services.  Reports have been produced and action has been promised for years.  We have reached a crunch point and we must stop talking about how great the post office network is because every change to date has involved diminishing post office services or shutting down branches on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis.  We must be honest and put everything on the table.  Post offices should examine the possibility of assuming responsibility for compiling the register of electors.  In many cases, local authorities have been unable to do this job, creating a gap in the register.  Postmasters and postmistresses have a great deal of local information which could be valuable in this regard.<\/p><p>As I have stated before, post offices should be allowed to provide driver licence services similar to the passport express service they currently provide.  This is not rocket science and I hope there will be an impetus to take many of the steps required for post offices now that the writing seems to be on the wall and An Post's plans have become known.

The most recent statistics from the Central Statistics Office show that 35.2% of the workforce earn less than &euro;400 per week.  Senators should think about that statistic because it means one in three workers employed in the State earns less than &euro;400 per week gross.  Incidentally, this is less than one third of what Senators are paid weekly before expenses.  Another 32% of employees earn between &euro;400 and &euro;800 per week.  As such, the Government's own statistics demonstrate that this is a low-wage economy.  Ireland is second from the bottom in terms of low wages in the OECD.<\/p> <p>I ask that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, come to the House to debate this issue.  The problem with the so-called recovery is simple.  There is no recovery for people who earn &euro;400 per week or less and when we have one in three workers employed on poverty wages.  We must implement constructive policies that will help to address this issue.  One simple way of doing so would be to address how the State can support a living wage, perhaps in its procurement policies, as occurs in Scotland.  I am trying to be constructive and I would like a constructive response from the Government side, rather than have Senators throw the usual brickbats.

What has gone on at political level over the last weeks and months has not been edifying and has not inspired confidence in the political process.  We must consider our political priorities here.  We have had all this distraction about whether people should pay and how much for their water usage while the entire political establishment on practically all sides of the House has ignored completely the fact that we face hundreds of millions of euro worth of overspend in relation to the proposed children's hospital, far beyond what was originally projected.  There is a high likelihood that the hospital is being built in the wrong place and that it will endanger the children who need its services.

Retail Excellence Ireland has started a campaign and is working with small retailers to help promote them online and showing that they have goods and offer value for money.

It is probably one of the biggest races in the history of national hunt racing.  I am not sure what jurisdiction these Houses have over the Turf Club.  It is a fairly arcane body and its members are touchy about their rights and procedures.  I hesitate to mention them here.  Members of this House might be aware of the recent controversy arising from the non-triers ruling which was brought in recently.  Nobody likes to see a horse on a racetrack who is not running to his best ability, especially the punter who has backed the horse.  There is very little of that in Irish racing today, but it used to be widespread when I was a youngster.  It is no longer prevalent as racing has become far too professional a business for that.  The new ruling has been brought in by the Turf Club which states that if a horse is not seen to be trying then its trainer or jockey can be fined.  The infamous case recently was the Music Box case, which resulted in trainer Aidan O'Brien, one of our best and most professional trainers, being fined &euro;10,000 and his jockey being put off the tracks for five weeks.  That is that man's livelihood.<\/p> <p>Not too long ago the Turf Club was warning jockeys about the excessive use of the whip.  Where does one draw the line?  How one times a horse and decides what chance it has or how to produce it in a race is something beyond all our imaginations here.  It is not an easy thing to call, and horses have to be ridden sympathetically as well.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to bring the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to this House when we can have a good discussion on this issue.  It is mostly positive, but perhaps the gentlemen with the hard hats might answer a few questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#M00500","speaker":"1394"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for letting me speak as I was late to the Order of Business.  I previously called for the rolling out of hospital car parking guidelines for seriously ill patients and for a consistent service to be provided across the country for families when a member of their family is very seriously ill and they accrue major costs for car parking.  There have been several studies discussed in the media and reports of hospitals making high incomes from car parking, which I am sure they rely on.<\/p> <p>I would like to make proposals to the Minister and hope that I will have the opportunity to make them in this House in the near future.  I propose that a designated member of staff be appointed in all hospitals to deal with cases where car parking concessions are required for patients with long-term illness.  At the moment in many hospitals it is the nurse manager who takes care of this.  No more than any other nurse, even if they are a manager, they have little time to deal with this as a priority.  That person would then grant the concession of free parking to certain patients and their families.  It would be very beneficial to people in those circumstances.  I also propose that such concessions be advertised and displayed.  In certain hospitals where these concessions exist people have so much on their minds with the illness of a family member that they do not realise it exists.  I renew my call to the Minister to roll out guidelines for hospitals in this area, and in particular to take these suggestions on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#M00600","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I rise today to talk about rates and the revaluation of rates, which has been going on throughout the country at present.  Recently we had the revaluation in Westmeath which brought in two reasonably sized provincial towns, Mullingar and Athlone, both with populations of approximately 30,000.  It has been an eye-opening experience for small retailers.  As we know already, in rural Ireland small retail businesses have gone to the wall and are non-existent.  I feel that the next rung on the ladder is going to be provincial towns.  This is coming down the track at speed.  I have seen five different businesses over the last month that are seriously considering closing due to the revaluation of rates.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aidan Davitt:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2475\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2475&amp;amp;pid=AidanDavitt&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One of the businesses in question has been in existence for over 100 years.  Senator Byrne hit on it earlier when she said there is a change in shopping patterns.  Up to 85% of clothing in the UK is now bought online, while in Ireland it is 60% and heading in that direction.  We really have to look at a system where net profit is compared to rates.  There will have to be changes or we will have no more shops and town centres will be decimated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#M00700","speaker":"1411","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I thank the 25 Senators who made contributions to the Order of Business.  I welcome Mr. Tiernan Brady of Australians for Equality to the Public Gallery who is here for the Easter holidays.  He is a former member of the Yes Equality campaign and I pay tribute to his work here.  I wish him well in his work in Australia and hope to see it pass marriage equality.<\/p> <p>I join with Senators Horkan, Dolan, Mulherin, Colm Burke and Byrne in congratulating all concerned in the protracted, although unnecessarily so, negotiations on the provision of Orkambi.  I congratulate Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, its chief executive, Philip Watt, the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and the Health Service Executive, HSE, for their perseverance in negotiating a deal on the commercial terms of supply to patients who require this much-needed treatment.  This is about patients and the lives of people.  It is about improving the quality of life.  The negotiations showed the importance of persevering and entering into talks.  It is important we pay tribute to Vertex Pharmaceuticals and thank it for its willingness to engage in compromise and negotiation.<\/p> <p>There is still a significant amount of work to be done, as Senator Colm Burke said, in keeping the cost of drugs and medications at a point at which people and the State can afford.  The significance of this deal will be seen in time.  Again, I join with everybody in welcoming the conclusion of talks and hope it can bring a positive outcome.  It is a pity it took so long, but it shows that the collective bargaining power of the Government through the HSE is important.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Harris, for that.<\/p> <p>Senators Devine, Mullen, Higgins and Horkan raised the issue of the second interim report of the mother and baby homes commission published yesterday.  Senator Devine articulated remarks many of us would share.  Rather than divide the House on a sensitive and important issue, I appeal to her to agree to dealing with this after the Easter recess.  I am not in a position to bring the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to the House today but I would be happy for her to come to the House after the Easter recess.  All Members are committed to having services and supports put in place for the people who were cruelly abused in these homes.  I agree with Senator Devine that it is a shameful period in our history.  We must take cognisance that this is an interim report and that the final report has not yet been completed.  It is also worth noting the commission has made no findings to date in terms of abuse and neglect, to which Senator Higgins also referred.  Rather than divide the House, which would be unnecessary, in the spirit of co-operation, the Government is committed - I am of the same view as the Senator - that we need to see action steps, not just, as some people claim, posturing.  This is about the human rights of people which were cruelly denied and abused under the care of so many.  I would happily bring the Minister to the House after Easter, if the Senator accepts my bona fides.  If she does not, that is a matter for herself.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell proposed an amendment to the Order of Business to take all Stages of the Intoxicating Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2017 today.  Senators Reilly, Ruane and Craughwell also referred to it.  Senator Lawless has put much work into this Bill.  I am happy to take Second Stage today.  However, there are anomalies in the Bill and taking all Stages today would not lead to good legislation.  As Leader, I am committed to working with Senator Lawless, irrespective of whether there will be different views expressed later today in the debate, to have Committee Stage in the House on the last week of May.  I also want to pay tribute to the former Senator, Imelda Henry, who did a significant amount of work on this Bill in a different format.  I know Senator Lawless would not want me to forget her.  I am happy to take Second Stage today.  Notwithstanding there will be different viewpoints and those who will not want to see alcohol served in public houses on Good Friday, many Members will want to get this Bill right so it can be enacted by this time next year.  I am more than happy to take Committee and Report Stages at a later date.<\/p> <p>Senator McDowell also raised the issue of public broadcasting.  We are at a serious point in regard to the future remit and role of RTE as our public service broadcaster.  I fundamentally agree there needs to be a national debate from Cork to Donegal on the role and the future of broadcasting and RTE as well.  I would not like to have to explain to people how we can put a tax on a laptop, an iPad or an iPhone because one can get TV coverage with them.  I believe it is a wrong move and that debate needs to be had.  I would be happy to have a debate in this House on it.  Away from the committee doing work on this matter, this is of fundamental importance to our country.  We see our print media under sustained pressure but we have the commercial growth of local radio.  I know the Minister published remarks on it but I would be happy to debate this in the House after the Easter recess.<\/p> <p>Senators Mulherin and Horkan raised the issue of the post office closures.  I would be happy for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to come to the House.  To be fair, the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, was explaining he did not have any responsibility in the matter.  Senator Mulherin raised some interesting points about the role of the post office in the future, which merits discussion and consideration.  To be fair to her, the fact she has put some of those suggestions on the record this morning is good.  I will be happy to have a debate on this subject at a later date.<\/p> <p>I commend Senator Kelleher for her work on the Adult Safeguarding Bill.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, had a family bereavement yesterday and that is why yesterday&rsquo;s debate on migrant integration strategy was cancelled.  It will be held on 16 May.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in raised the issue of child poverty.  He is correct in that regard.  Senator Mullen used the word &ldquo;posturing&rdquo; earlier.  We have seen much posturing by certain groups over the past several weeks around the issue of water.  Notwithstanding the good work Senator Kevin Humphreys did as Minister of State in the Department of Social Protection on child poverty, I hope we will have a debate on this after the Easter recess.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> All of us will welcome figures from the Central Statistics Office showing a reduction in the number of children in consistent poverty as a consequence of the policies of the previous Government.  Notwithstanding this, 11.5% of children are in consistent poverty and I fully accept that this figure is much too high.  It is important to recognise that the Government, in budget 2017, increased the weekly rate of payment for working age schemes and the income disregard for one-parent families.  It also introduced additional child care and paternity leave provision.  The issue the Senator raises is important and I will be pleased to have it debated in the House. <\/p><p>I join Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in in condemning the allegations made in reports from Chechnya concerning the rounding up and incarceration of members of the LGBT community.  I have written to the Russian Ambassador Peshkov on the matter.  I would also be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss it.  There can be no rowing back on the fundamental human rights that have been won across the world.  In some countries, the LGBT community has not yet achieved any victories.  I am conscious that we have visitors from Australia in the Public Gallery who are working to have human rights made available to all Australian citizens.  It is important that the House stand up for the rights of all citizens.  The reports from Chechnya are deeply worrying and distressing.  As advocates for human rights, we must stand in solidarity with our LGBT brothers and sisters in Russia.  We cannot allow anyone to be treated in the callous manner described.  I will be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the matter, which was also raised by Senator Joe O'Reilly. <\/p><p>Senators Keith Swanick and Rose Conway-Walsh raised the toll charges incurred by volunteers from Carrick-on-Suir.  It is extraordinary that they were charged tolls given that they were returning from volunteering in County Mayo on a major rescue mission to recover the bodies of two missing R116 crewmen.  We all hope the bodies will be returned to their families and loved ones, for whom this is a traumatic time.  From watching television coverage and listening to radio reports, I am aware of the major voluntary effort that took place along the north-west coast at the weekend.  It beggars belief that no cop-on or common sense was shown or no recognition given to the fact that the individuals in question were on a humanitarian mission.  I join Senators Swanick and Conway-Walsh in appealing to the company that operates the toll bridges to show common sense and latitude in this case.  Perhaps the Senators will raise it as a Commencement Matter with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The House must also take up the issue. <\/p><p>Senators Gerard Craughwell and Diarmuid Wilson raised the issue of entrepreneurship in education and training boards.  The local enterprise offices are engaged in work to increase employment.  It is important that they work together with the education and training boards.  I will be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the issue. <\/p><p>Senator John O'Mahony raised the issue of the N4 and N5 motorway projects.  He has consistently advocated their prioritisation as part of the mid-term capital review.  I hope the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, will come to the House after Easter because we need to discuss the mid-term capital review.  We also need to have the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, before the House for a discussion on the Ireland 2040 plan which deals with regional and economic development and the locations at which we will build and concentrate population masses. <\/p><p>I welcome Senator Rose Conway-Walsh back to the House and wish her well.  She referred to the case of Evan Morrissey which was outlined yesterday in the coroner's court.  There are protocols in place to deal with medical negligence.  I sympathise with the family of Mr. Morrissey and all those who have been the victims of misdiagnosis.  To be fair to health professionals, their record in this regard is good.  I will be happy to have a debate on the issue. <\/p><p>Senators John Dolan and Gabrielle McFadden raised the case of &Aacute;ras Attracta and disability issues.  The Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Finian McGrath, is committed to delivering a comprehensive package for the disability sector and I will be pleased to have him come to the House to discuss disability issues. <\/p><p>I welcome the decision of the Joint Committee on Future Funding of Water Services and hope the issue of water charges has been addressed for the last time.  I pay tribute to Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh for his excellent stewardship of the committee.  He demonstrated a willingness to go the extra mile, while being fair, impartial and stern when necessary.  It is important to recognise the significance of yesterday's developments.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#N00200","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>He had a great deal to put up with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#O00200","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>Yes, and I am glad Senator Mullen was not on the committee because the Chairman would have had much more to put up with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#O00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":108,"content":"<p>As Senator Buttimer well knows, I would have been one of the constructive voices on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#O00400","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Senator Mullen walks on water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#O00500","speaker":"1410"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>If Senator Mullen can walk on water, he should patent it and make a fortune.

Those who peddle a certain line must recognise that the provision of clean drinking water does not come cheaply.  In County Cork, raw sewage equating to 40,000 full wheelie bins is being pumped into the River Lee and out to sea every week.  This sends a message to all of us, as responsible legislators, to be clear in what we stand for in the provision of drinking water and clean waterways.<\/p> <p>I sympathise again with Senator Paul Gavan on his bereavement.  The Senator raised the appearance at a committee yesterday of Ms Patricia King at which she referred to low pay.  This issue is linked to the contribution made by Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  It should be recognised that the previous Government increased the minimum wage, removed the requirement to pay the universal social charge from a large number of people and is committed to ensuring more people return to work.  Unemployment stands at 6.4%, which is good news that Senators on the other side may not want to hear.  It is not fake news or alternative facts but the truth.  Having a job helps people to get out of poverty.  <\/p> <p>I join Senator Lynn Ruane in congratulating the UISCE organisation on the launch of its strategic plan.  The Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, came to the House to discuss equality. <\/p> <p>Senator McFadden raised unfilled posts in child and adolescent mental health services.  I will be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the issue. <\/p> <p>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen raised a host of issues in the context of posturing on the new national children's hospital.  At the risk of causing a row with the Senator, which I do not want, the debate on the children's hospital is about political posturing and populism at one level.  I was Chairman of the Committee on Health and Children in the previous D&aacute;il when members visited the St. James's Hospital site and carried out an independent review of the work on its suitability.  More important, following decades of discussion and debate, the previous Government took a decision to locate the new hospital on the site and an independent panel of international experts examined the suitability of the site, the board, structures and so forth.  The debate must now focus on delivering the hospital, progressing the needs of children who require urgent facilities and having transparency on costs.  I hope there will not be a cost overrun.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#O00900","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Senator Buttimer should tell that to the Jack and Jill Foundation.

The Government is working on the options paper which will be presented at the Global Irish Forum in May.  This Easter week, it is important to reflect upon and remember the men and women of 1916 and the events that happened that week and in those afterwards.  Senator Feighan mentioned the Assembly elections, which were six weeks ago.  I note the talks have been suspended today until after Easter.  All of us, North and South, have an obligation to reflect upon what happened in 1916 and beyond.  The legacy we have been left with is that all of us, of whatever political hue, must work together.  None of us wants to see a return to direct rule in the North.  I hope we can see both sides coming to an agreement so we can have an assembly up and functioning. <\/p> <p>Senator Byrne raised the issue of online shopping and the Retail Excellence Ireland report.

It is critical we support small, local enterprises.<\/p> <p>I join with Senator Horkan, who raised the issue of Bus &Eacute;ireann, in hoping for a resolution to the dispute.  I have spoken to and met with bus workers in Cork and the issue is before the Labour Court today.  It is having a profound impact not only on the bus workers and their families, but also on local shops, restaurants, cafes and all types of shops and commercial activity in the city of Cork, in particular, which I am familiar with.  It is important we get a resolution so we can have buses back on the road taking people to different parts of the country on a holiday weekend.  We also need a resolution on the issue of Bus &Eacute;ireann for the workers, many of whom are not on the rates of pay being attributed to them by some in the media.  It is important that there is a resolution.  <\/p> <p>Senator O'Sullivan raised the issue of the Irish horse racing industry.  It is important that we congratulate young Fox, the jockey, on his great ride in the Grand National last weekend on One for Arthur from Sligo.  He is an Irish jockey.  The Senator is right that the Turf Club needs an examination.  It seems to be a law unto itself when some of its decisions are mystifying from afar.

She has raised a good point on the issue of the hospitals.  There are derogations and waivers given but the Senator makes a good point.  She also made a point about the concession being advertised and displayed.  <\/p> <p>Senator Davitt again raised the extremely important issue of rates and the revaluation of rates.  Both he and Senator Butler are very strong on that matter.  The Senator is right to raise the issue.  I am happy to have the debate in the House.  It is about the future of our small and not so small towns.  It is also about the viability of our small, rural businesses which are pivotal in drawing people to rural Ireland and creating employment.  <\/p> <p>I will not accept the proposed amendments but I am happy to work with the Senators in the interest of co-operation rather than dividing the House on both issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#P00800","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Senator Michael McDowell proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#P00900","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I withdraw the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#P01000","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Senator M&aacute;ire Devine has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business that there be a debate with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on the interim report of the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes today.

It would also be confined to a particular sector, which I believe would not be appropriate.  Furthermore, it would raise concerns from a state aid point of view.  It is a long-standing rule of Irish company law that virtually all types of company must include the company type in the company name.  Therefore, a limited liability company must include \"Limited\" or \"Ltd.\" in its name.  It is important information for third parties doing business with the company as different rules and considerations apply, depending on the legal form a company takes.  For example, a limited company has full legal capacity, like a natural person.  However, a designated activity company is more restricted in what it can do.  Similarly, the unlimited company is exempt from the obligation on other company types to file financial statements with the CRO.  Therefore, company type is not an insignificant detail for third parties in extending credit to, or doing business with, a company.  The Companies Act 2014 extended the general rule to unlimited companies.  Up until that time unlimited companies were the only type of company that did not have to comply with the obligation to include the company type in its name.  This change gave effect to a recommendation of the Company Law Review Group.  The Government accepted that recommendation and made it public in 2007 as part of the general scheme of what became the Companies Act 2014.<\/p> <p>I accept that the organisational challenge of adapting to the new requirements of the Companies Act 2014 may be significant for some companies.  They may have complex businesses, perhaps with operations around the world, but these are not concerns that are confined to the pharmaceutical sector.  For this reason, all companies were given an 18-month transitional period in which to make the necessary arrangements to comply with the 2014 Act.  The transitional period ended on 30 November 2016.  During that time the vast majority of companies managed to adapt, but some unlimited companies considered that 18 months was too short.  At the time the Companies Act was being passed, the Oireachtas accepted that some unlimited companies might need more time to adapt; therefore, it gave the Minister the power to grant an exemption for longer than the 18-month period in special circumstances.  During the transition period extensions were granted to just over 100 companies, some within the same group.  These extensions are for an additional five years on top of the 18-month general transition period that applied to all companies.  In other words, they run to 1 December 2021.  I understand some companies may now find that the additional five years are not enough.   I have received representations to this effect.  As a result, officials in the Department are due to meet representatives of some companies to learn more about their concerns and identify appropriate solutions.  As Minister, I will also be meeting some companies to discuss their concerns.  If there is a concern, it may not be confined to the pharmaceutical industry, as the amendment suggests, and while some of the companies that have been granted extensions are in the pharmaceutical sector, not all of them are.  In fact, the majority are in other sectors of the economy.  Moreover, I am aware that there are some unlimited companies in the pharmaceutical industry that did not apply for any extension beyond the general transitional period and were able to adapt within the period of 18 months.  If there is a concern, it may not be widespread within the sector.<\/p> <p>I do not support the amendment because it would be an open-ended exemption from the rule that a company must include in its name its legal type.  The rule is an important transparency measure that protects third parties doing business with that company.  Moreover, we must be mindful of state aid rules.  If we were to allow an exemption from compliance rules for only some companies on the basis of cost, we would risk falling foul of the rules.  If an unlimited company faces such significant challenges that it requires more than six and a half years to adapt to the rule, we should examine appropriate ways to address the difficulties for that company.  This should be the case, regardless of in what sector the company is operating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#Q01300","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>On a point of order, I understand I missed an amendment I had tabled because I was outside the Chamber.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#Q01400","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>The Senator was chatting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#Q01500","speaker":"1247"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>It was tabled on the Minister's instructions.

The pharma sector provides highly skilled, quality jobs.  Around two thirds of the people working in the sector possess a third level qualification.  The latest provision, which the Minister has added in section 3, would have such a disproportionate impact with thousands of filings required and an increased compliance on the industry, we do not feel this is prudent at this stage.

Nine out of ten top pharmaceutical companies in the world are based in Cork.  They have come to me to express their concern on this issue and the use of the one word \"unlimited\".  I know that they have an exemption until 2021 and I fully accept that but they have advised me that they have to apply for a new licence in something like 220 different jurisdictions and the net cost to them will be in the order of &euro;25 million.  They are the figures that they have given to me.  I had a long meeting with them to see if there was any other way around this.  I am concerned that we rely so heavily on this industry that one word can make such a difference.  We are not talking about one company but a number of them.<\/p> <p>The Minister outlined the number of companies that did get the exemption and I accept what she is saying about new companies not needing to get the exemption because the issue is clear in regard to individual companies making new applications for a new drug or for the appropriate licence.  The problem is that in each jurisdiction where they have to apply for the licence, they have to make a new application.  It is a very legal technicality.  We need to be very careful in this matter and be conscious that in light of Brexit, with Britain going out of Europe, we must do everything possible not only to keep what we have but also to make sure that new companies are attracted into the country and we do not anything that will upset that in any way.

In effect, they have been given six-and-a-half years to comply.  I note that any company that converted to a designated activity company during the transitional period also had to change its company name.  These include companies in insurance and other financial advisors.  They are also complex businesses with their own organisational challenges and as there is no possibility for these companies to seek an extension they all have to apply within the 12-month transitional period.

I am sure the Minister will agree that the people of Ireland were scandalised at what happened, and that such a thing could be allowed to happen, in a situation where the profit motive triumphed over every other consideration.  Using common enough grip company structures, the valuable aspect of the Clerys business, the building itself, was held in a subsidiary company called OCS Properties while the trading section was held in an outfit called OCS Operations, which is the trading arm that ran the department store.<\/p><p>As the Minister will know, Clerys was sold to a company called Natrium on 11 June 2015 and the trading section was sold for &euro;1.  Lo and behold, at the stroke of a pen, the company was wound up with minimal notice.  This meant, in plain terms, that there was nothing whatsoever in the coffers of the trading company to pay redundancies and to ensure that concession holders who were left on the hook for thousands of euro received what they were owed.<\/p><p>As the Minister will be aware, section 599 of the Companies Act allows for a liquidator or creditor to bolster the assets of a company being wound up and for it to apply to the court for an order directing that a related company, and in this case it was the property company that held a valuable asset, to contribute to the debt.  Since the introduction of the section in the Companies Act 1990 by one of the Minister's predecessors, Desmond O'Malley, the provision has not been used or tested in the courts.  In the meantime, companies like Natrium and its directors have laughed all of the way to the bank and the taxpayers of Ireland, including me, the Minister, everybody in here and citizens across the country, are squeezed for the redundancy money.  This fact was pointed out in a report to Cabinet almost two years ago on the sale and liquidation of Clerys.  I am sure that the Minister has had an opportunity to, if not read the detailed report, be briefed on same.  We do not know when the next Clerys-type episode will happen.  What we can say with some clarity is that the current set of laws, in the absence of testing, are not robust enough to prevent a Clerys-type situation from happening today or tomorrow.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 3 proposes to amend section 599 in the context of today's Bill, which is timely and necessary.  Fundamentally, if the amendment is accepted, it would remove the profit motive and make anyone considering undertaking a Clerys-style stunt to think again and to reconsider their actions because all of their assets would clearly come into play.  Again, this approach was outlined in a report that I drafted and brought before Cabinet in July 2015.  <\/p><p>Limited liability cannot be abused or exploited and company directors have obligations to all of their companies and staff.  Carrying out business of an intermingled nature and within a group structure should never be used to exploit people in any way.  The seven criteria that I have listed in the amendment, if adopted by the House, will send a strong message that we do not encourage, in this country, a business culture where people who are caught up in the wreckage of corporate power plays are treated like collateral damage.  The message will go out that we encourage responsible corporate behaviour, that we do not view it as a luxury, that through our laws we encourage and promote responsible corporate behaviour, and that we do not preside over a wild west-type business culture where people like the Clerys workers, the small business holders and the concession holders in Clerys were left on the hook.  I appeal to Senators, specifically my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il, to support this provision that will have a transformational effect on the conduct of business in this country.  I clearly recall that when the Clerys scandal first broke our colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il were, quite rightly, outraged and they called for laws to be changed and initiatives taken to ensure that something like this did not happen again.  Today they have an opportunity to support a change of the law that will ensure episodes like Clerys are prevented from happening or at least the risk of something like it happening again is minimised. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#V00300","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":212,"content":"<p>If no other Senators wish to comment, I call on the Minister to reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#V00400","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>I am not in favour of accepting amendment No. 3.  The contribution order remedy is a unique feature of New Zealand and Irish company law.  The Irish provision in section 599 echoes the judgment of Mr. Justice Costello in Power Supermarkets Limited <i>v.<\/i>Crumlin Investments Limited.  It is a mechanism that deals with related companies in insolvency and the possibility of unfair behaviour in the group.  Accordingly, section 599 gives discretion to a court to hold a related company liable for the debts of a company being wound up provided that the court is satisfied that circumstances giving rise to the liquidation are attributable to the actions or omissions of the related company.  I note that Ireland does not yet have an authoritative judgment on the circumstances in which a contribution order will be made between related companies.<\/p><p>The Company Law Review Group, CLRG, was requested after the Clerys insolvency to review and recommend ways that existing company law and, indeed, other legislative provisions could be potentially amended to ensure better safeguards for employees and unsecured creditors.

I understand that this review includes the existing section 599 and other related provisions.

We have waited well over a year for the report of the Company Law Review Group.  As I said in my earlier contribution, we do not know the minute or the hour when another Clerys-type scenario will emerge in this country.  If we do not tighten up our laws, and the last Administration attempted to do so, then when something like Clerys happens again it will be on all of our heads in this Chamber.  I have worked extremely closely with those who lost their jobs in desperate circumstances in Clerys in the summer of 2015.  They must be given enormous credit for the way in which they have conducted their campaign.  Their campaign was not about payments and support for the Clerys workers because they knew that their ship had sailed.  They wanted to ensure that the law was amended and strengthened to prevent such an event from happening again.  I am not certain that we are closer to reforming the law in favour of working people in this country and those who go about their business and enterprises in a responsible fashion.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerald Nash:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2281\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2281&amp;amp;pid=GeraldNash&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not think the country wants to have the kind of label around its neck which certain elements of our business community got because of the way the Clerys situation was dealt with.  The strengthening of section 599 and our efforts to make it more robust and meaningful would garner support from responsible business people who want to see a strong business culture in the country.  I am not saying there is not a strong business culture in the country.  However, where there are weaknesses in our law that permit something like this to happen, they need to be addressed.<\/p><p>As I stated, we have been waiting for a considerable period of time for the CLRG report.  We have waited too long.  If the Minister will not accept the amendment, which I am prepared to put to a vote, will she confirm when we will get the CLRG report?  What will be the timeline involved in terms of taking and accepting the report and legislating for any changes the group might propose?  Further, when will she legislate for the provisions of the Duffy-Cahill report?  A twin-track approach was taken by the previous Administration to try to address these issues.  One related to changes in employment law that were required to protect the interests of employees caught up in insolvencies such as that at Clerys.  The second focused on the need to review company law and propose changes to strengthen it in these situations.  I would like to see that happen.<\/p><p>The particular matter I will now refer to is before the courts.  I welcome the fact that this week there has been some formal State action on matters relating to the Clerys redundancies on foot of an investigation that I helped to trigger.  I will keep my comments on it to a minimum as the matter is before the courts.  However, it is high time for concrete action from Government to at least minimise the prospect of a Clerys-type insolvency happening again.  Small businesses are caught up in them and considered to be simply collateral damage in a corporate and property power play, workers are left on the hook and the taxpayers of the country are left to pay only statutory redundancy to employees who, in some cases, have decades of experience and contribution to the company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#V00600","speaker":"1398","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>Senator Nash airs a couple of good concerns.

We all share his concern about what happened to the workers at Clerys and the unscrupulous and cynical manner in which the law was used to - let us call a spade a spade - deprive workers of their rights and a natural expectation, having given a life service to a company such as Clerys, which was iconic in Dublin, that their future in retirement would have been safe.  However, I believe the Minister has made a strong case for having strong and robust legislation which should await the outcome of the review and is imminent in any event.  As Senator Davitt stated, the Company Law Review Group will be very informative here as well.<\/p> <p>All of us in the House are aware of how, despite the best of intentions, rushed legislation has untoward consequences.  While I believe everyone in the House would agree with the sentiment expressed by Senator Nash, we do not want to find ourselves with unintended consequences again or with weaker legislation than we would otherwise have had, had we waited for the Company Law Review Group's report.  As Senator Nash stated, that report is coming any day now.  I know the Senator is anxious that we could have another situation on our hands.  However, in fairness, let us have good legislation that is properly prepared and has the required effect without, in so far as we can manage it, having unforeseen consequences.  We have had too many of those episodes, although they were all done with the best of intentions at the time.  I, therefore, support the Minister's contention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#W00300","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I support Senator Nash's amendment.  We have spoken and heard about unforeseen consequences, but it behoves the House to consider foreseen consequences also.  As the legislation currently stands, we are leaving ourselves exposed and open.  We need to ensure that we do not speak of the situation that happened in respect of Clerys and others as an anomaly because it was a response to and a reflection of the current structuring of the laws and the lack of adequate protection in place.<\/p> <p>We have the evidence that the situation as it stands is not a good or acceptable base position.  When further information comes through and we have the report, we may wish to amend the legislation again.  However, I have no doubt that Senator Nash's proposal in the amendment, if accepted at this stage, would lead to a better starting position from which we could then move.  In terms of political realism, it is unlikely that there will be another Bill to amend the Companies Act within the next five to six months or year, although it is appropriate that we would have a clear indication of timing.  However, while we may get an indication of when the findings and recommendations will come through, we do not want to leave open a period of time in which there is still permission to act in a way that is unconscionable.<\/p> <p>There is a real concern because we have seen this happen systematically.  It is a very real thing.  What is the role of a director of a company?  Are directors of companies there to ensure the companies' success or are people being put into positions in companies to facilitate their dissolution and destruction.  If we are serious about our recovery and are concerned about vulture funds, for example, but do not accept the amendment at this point, we cannot wring our hands and express great surprise and concern if international companies that work to maximise their profits and returns on a quarterly basis with, in many cases, little concern for productivity, are rewarded if they take advantage.  That is what will happen.  In the Companies (Accounting) Bill 2016, we have an opportunity to identify and address a problem.  Can we improve it in the future?  Absolutely.  However, this will be an immediate improvement.<\/p> <p>If the amendment is unsuccessful, I reserve the right to table an amendment that is worded slightly differently to address the issue in a slightly different way.  I reserve that right for Report Stage.<\/p> <p>This is a sensible proposal.  It shows that we are serious and that the Legislature will not lope behind business practices, commenting on the trail of destruction that they leave.  It also rewards good business practice and recognises the majority of good business practices, including those of companies that have been taken over.  It gives them a fair chance of recovering and moving to effective trading practices with decent conditions for their workers.  I strongly support the amendment and ask the Minister to support it or suggest her own amendment on Report Stage.  Either would address the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#W00400","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":219,"content":"<p>While I note that the Senators propose to introduce more prescriptive criteria in terms of the circumstances the court ought to address when considering whether a related company should contribute to the debts of a company being wound up, I am not satisfied the amendment, as drafted, adds to the settled provision.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2284\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2284&amp;amp;pid=MaryMitchellOConnor&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As I already stated, I am not in favour of accepting this amendment.

Duffy and Cahill noted in their expert report on the examination and review of the laws on the protection of employee interests when assets are separated from the operating entity that it seems section 599 is a potentially useful remedy.  However, it is only when the provision is tested in the courts that any necessary amendments may become apparent.  Accordingly, I am not in favour of this amendment.  I understand a subgroup of the CLRG has met several times to consider the wider range of provisions contained in the Companies Act.  I am looking forward to the CLRG report.

I hope, however, I can stand up in the House and correct myself at some point in the not-too-distant future.  However, we will wait and see.<\/p> <p>This is not a case of rushed legislation or concerns about unintended consequences.

It is not a case of rushed legislation but of no or very little legislation that will protect working people and small businesses, as well as ensuring our business culture manages to progress and we do not have situations like this in the future.  This is a genuine attempt to make our company law more robust to protect everybody and improve our business culture.<\/p> <p>We know from the Minister and our own experience that section 599 has not been tested.  When it is a case that provisions in legislation go untested for 27 years, then we must ask why.  Clearly, there are some who would have considered it over the years, but there might have been considerable obstacles to creditors and liquidators taking the case.  I was disappointed that the Department of Social Protection as a creditor - one could argue the lead creditor - in the Clerys situation decided not to test section 599 and to go after the related assets.  The State, one could argue, is owed over &euro;2 million because of redundancy payments paid out of the statutory redundancy fund to those entitled to it in Clerys.<\/p> <p>If the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment, give a date for the receipt of the CLRG report and legislation emerging from that, will she have direct formal conversations with her colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, with a view to taking a case under section 599 to test the robustness, or otherwise, of the legislation?

If the Department of Social Protection decides it does not wish to test section 599 in the courts, will we wait for a test to emerge at some time?

I am also pleased to be able to report that it received general support on its recent passage through the Lower House.<\/p> <p>The Criminal Justice (Offences Relating to Information Systems) Bill 2016 is relatively short but very significant legislation.  It is, notably, the first piece of Irish legislation dedicated to dealing with cybercrime, a transnational problem which requires a co-ordinated, international response.  The Bill will ensure Ireland will play its part by giving effect to provisions of Directive 2013\/40\/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of 12 August 2013 on attacks against information systems.  It will also give effect to many of the key provisions of the Council of Europe convention on cybercrime - the Budapest Convention - which Ireland signed in 2002.  The legislation reflects these international instruments in that it provides for criminal offences in relation to attacks against information systems and establishes effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for such offences, the most serious of which could result in a term of imprisonment of up to ten years.  The offences provided for relate to information systems and data and do not cover content-related matters.  The Bill creates new offences relating to the unauthorised accessing of information systems; unauthorised interference with information systems or data on such systems; unauthorised interception of transmissions of data to or from information systems; and the use of tools such as computer programmes, passwords or devices to facilitate the commission of these offences relating to information systems.<\/p> <p>Before outlining the content of the Bill in more detail, I would like to provide some context for the legislation.  It is true to say information systems are very much part of our daily lives in the modern world.  They are increasingly relied on by governments, businesses and individual citizens alike.  The term \"information system\", as defined in the Bill, is deliberately broad, encompassing all devices involved in the processing and storage of data, not only those considered to be computer systems in the traditional sense.  This reflects the range of modern communications and data storage technology currently available such as tablets and smartphones.  Information systems also encompass the IT infrastructure or networks that support communication systems and individual devices, as well as data.  The term \"data\" is also broadly circumscribed in the Bill, as meaning any representation of facts, information or concepts in a form capable of being processed and includes a programme capable of causing an information system to perform a function.  There is no doubting the very significant benefits which modern information systems bring to our lives.  However, reliability on such systems can also, unfortunately, mean vulnerability.<\/p> <p>New technology creates opportunities for new crimes.  Cybercrime and attacks on information systems have become increasingly problematic and challenging across Europe and the rest of the world.  The European Commission brought forward its proposal for a directive in this area against a backdrop of steadily increasing cybercrime.  It included previously unknown large-scale and dangerous attacks against the information systems of companies such as banks, the public sector and even the military in EU member states and other countries.  New concerns emerged in this area such as the massive spread of malicious software.  Such \"malware\", as it is termed, can, for instance, create what are known as \"botnets\" - networks of infected computers that can be remotely controlled to stage large-scale, co-ordinated attacks.  These networks of compromised computers may be activated, often without the knowledge of the users of the computers, to perform specific actions such as attacks against information systems.<\/p> <p>The interconnection of computers and information systems, through cyberspace, facilitates communication between companies and individuals across the world.  What has become clear is that, as cyberspace has developed and evolved, so has cybercrime which is a transnational phenomenon.  Traditional law is based on physical geography, whereas cybercrimes occur in the virtual world of cyberspace and readily intersect and transcend national boundaries.  There is a clear need, therefore, for international co-operation in this area and harmonisation of national laws to counter the very real threats faced.  It is vital that we seek to protect citizens, businesses and government structures alike from cyber attacks which represent such a growing challenge in the modern technological environment.  That is the central aim of the Bill.<\/p> <p>I propose to outline in more detail the content of the Bill which contains 17 sections.  Section 1 provides the necessary interpretation provisions for the Bill and includes a definition of \"information system\".  The term \"information system\", rather than \"computer\", is used in order to enable the Bill to have the widest possible application taking account of rapidly evolving technology in this area.  The section also includes a broad definition of \"data\".  Both definitions are based on those contained in the EU directive.<\/p> <p>Further important definitions in section 1 relate to the concepts of lawful authority and right holder.  These are particularly significant in relation to how the offences under sections 2 to 6, inclusive, are framed.  I will outline these offences presently, having made a couple of preliminary comments in this regard.  I first point out that the activities concerned such as access to or interference with information systems or data are not offences if they are performed with lawful authority such as with the permission of the owner or right holder of the system.  It is clearly not intended to criminalise the activities of those who have authority to access information systems or possess a computer programme or code for the purpose of maintaining, testing or protecting information systems.  There are, for instance, companies which carry out such activities legitimately in the course of their work which could involve testing the security of information systems and protecting them from attack.  Such companies are effectively exempt from the provisions of the Bill.  A further point of commonality in the manner in which the offences under sections 2 to 6, inclusive, are framed is the notion of intent.  When the activities described are carried out with lawful authority and without criminal intent, they could not be considered to be offences.<\/p> <p>Section 2 provides that it is an offence to intentionally access an information system by infringing a security measure without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.<\/p> <p>Section 3 provides that it is an offence to intentionally interfere with an information system so as to hinder or interrupt its functioning.  It also describes the various means of interference such as, for example, inputting data to the system, damaging or deleting data or making data on the system inaccessible.  <\/p> <p>Section 4 provides that it is an offence to intentionally interfere with data on an information system, for example, by deleting, altering or causing the deterioration of the data.  <\/p> <p>Section 5 provides that it is an offence to intentionally intercept the non-public transmission of data to or from or within an information system.<\/p> <p>Section 6 provides that it is an offence to intentionally produce, sell, import, distribute or otherwise make available a computer programme or any device, computer password, access code or similar data for the purpose of the commission of an offence under sections 2 to 5, inclusive.  It will be noted that the direct intention to commit an offence is specifically required in relation to this provision, in addition to the general intent requirement contained in all of the offence provisions.  This reflects the requirements of the EU directive and is designed to avoid criminalisation where such tools or devices are produced and put on the market for legitimate purposes such as the testing of the security of information systems.<\/p> <p>Section 7 allows a search warrant to be issued to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the District Court in the investigation of the suspected commission of offences under the Bill.  It also sets out the process involved and provides for related matters.  It includes a requirement that a person under investigation shall, on request, provide the Garda with any password or key or code necessary to operate a computer or access the data.  This provision, essentially, replaces the search warrant provision in section 13 of the Criminal Damage Act 1991 in so far as it relates to data and applies the provision generally to the investigation of offences relating to information systems.  Section 13 of the Bill amends the 1991 Act and includes a transitional provision in respect of search warrants issued under that Act.  I will return to section 13 and the Criminal Damage Act shortly.<\/p> <p>Section 8 sets out the penalties for the commission of offences under sections 2 to 6, inclusive.  It provides that a person who commits an offence under sections 2 and 4 to 6, inclusive, will be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine of up to &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a term of up to 12 months, or both.  On conviction on indictment, these offences are punishable by a fine or a term of up to five years in prison, or both.  The same penalties apply on summary conviction for offences committed under section 3 which relates to unlawful interference with an information system but conviction on indictment for this offence carries an even more prohibitive penal sanction of up to ten years.  This penalty reflects the gravity of the offence and the potential for damage in which unlawful interference with an information system could result.<\/p> <p>Section 8 further provides that fraudulent use of the personal data of another person will be treated as an aggravating factor when the court is determining sentence for an offence under sections 3 or 4.  It also provides for penalties for offences in relation to the search warrant provisions in section 7.  Such offences include obstructing a Garda member acting under authority of a search warrant, a failure to provide information to facilitate Garda access to a computer or a failure to give the Garda a correct name and address.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Section 9 clarifies that where an offence under the Bill is committed by a body corporate, liability will rest with the person acting on behalf of the body corporate, as well as with the body corporate.<\/p><p>Section 10 establishes legal jurisdiction with regard to the commission of offences under sections 2 to 6, inclusive.  It provides that a person may be tried in the State for an offence under sections 2 to 6, inclusive, where it is committed by a person inside the State in relation to an information system outside the State or where an offence is committed outside the State in relation to an information system in the State.  Legal jurisdiction also extends to the commission of such an offence in relation to an information system outside the State if the person is an Irish citizen, ordinarily resident in the State or a body corporate or company under the law of the State and the act is an offence under the law of the place where it is committed.<\/p><p>Section 11 relates to evidence of Irish citizenship in the context of legal proceedings for offences under the Bill that are committed outside the State.  It clarifies that it is an officer of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade who certifies that a passport has issued and that it is an officer of the Minister of Justice and Equality who certifies that a person has not ceased to be an Irish citizen.<\/p><p>Section 12 deals with the legal concept of double jeopardy and provides that a person who has been tried for an offence outside the State will not be proceeded against for an offence under this legislation in respect of which the person has already been tried.<\/p><p>Section 13 amends the Criminal Damage Act 1991 in so far as it relates to damage to computer data in the context of damage to property.  The offences contained in the 1991 Act in relation to computer data are being deleted and will instead be covered and expanded on in this legislation.  Section 5 of the 1991 Act which relates to unauthorised access to computer data is, for instance, being deleted as it is being replaced by section 2 of the Bill.<\/p><p>Section 14 amends the Bail Act 1997 to include in the Schedule to that Act the offences provided for under sections 2 to 6, inclusive, of the Bill.  The Schedule to the 1997 Act specifies serious offences, in respect of which an application for bail may be refused by the court.  The offences under sections 2 to 6, inclusive, of the Bill will, therefore, come within this category.<\/p><p>Section 15 is a technical amendment to Schedule 1 to the Criminal Justice Act 2011 which provides for certain powers and procedures with respect to the prosecution and investigation of white collar crime.  Schedule 1 specifies the offences which are relevant for the purposes of the 2011 Act and includes the data related offences which are contained in the Criminal Damage Act 1991 and which will be replaced by the Bill.  Section 15, therefore, includes the new offences in the Schedule and also inserts a transitional provision to cover data related offences which were committed under the Criminal Damage Act prior to the commencement of this legislation.<\/p><p>Section 16 provides that expenses incurred by the Minister for Justice and Equality in the administration of this legislation shall, to the extent sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>Section 17 is a standard provision providing for the Short Title and commencement.  There will be an opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss in more detail any aspect of the Bill that Senators wish to explore further.  I am sure they will agree that it is vital that we seek to safeguard modern information and communication systems and maintain users' confidence in the safety and reliability of such systems.  This is arguably even more important and appropriate in Ireland which has become somewhat of a global cyber-hub in view of the number of high-tech and information technology and Internet based companies that have major operations here.  The legislation ensures unlawful activities relating to information systems are criminalised and that strong penalties are in place to both deter and punish offenders.  I am pleased, therefore, to commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#DD00500","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I have extensive briefing notes and speaking points, but I will try to not to use all of them as I appreciate we are discussing Second Stage and will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to engage further on the Bill.<\/p> <p>The good news is that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party will support the Bill which aims to define criminal offences in the area of attacks against information systems and establish effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for such offences.  As the Minister of State outlined, given the presence here of many information technology companies, including Google, Facebook and eBay - there are too many to mention - it is important that we be at the top of our game in dealing with people who seek to make life difficult and awkward for all of us.  We all rely on mobile phones, use mobile banking services and send e-mails and want to ensure these activities are as safe as possible.<\/p> <p>It is critical that citizens, business and government be protected from cyber-attacks which increasingly constitute a major challenge in today's technological environment.  The presence of so many high-tech and Internet based companies in Ireland makes this even more relevant.  However, it is also critical that we resource the Garda to enforce the laws on cybercrime.  It is a matter of concern that the number of garda&iacute; working in the area of cybercrime fell in 2016.  Late last year figures provided for Fianna F&aacute;il through a parliamentary question showed that only 29 garda&iacute; were tasked with policing cybercrime, despite the number of cyber-attacks doubling.  The number of garda&iacute; working to tackle this growing threat declined in the past two years, despite an increasing number of cyber-attacks in Ireland.  Cybercrime is a real and growing threat to individuals and businesses.  We have seen personal attacks involving blackmail which had tragic consequences, as well as economic crimes that resulted in losses of millions of euro to business through fraud.  In just a few clicks lives can be ruined and businesses destroyed.  While the creation of a dedicated unit is a welcome step, it will be unable to make substantive progress unless it has sufficient and skilled personnel.  The increase in the number of garda&iacute; secured by Fianna F&aacute;il in the confidence and supply agreement must be used in part to help deal with this rising threat. <\/p> <p>A recent comprehensive PwC Irish economic crime survey outlined the scale of the threat posed by cybercrime.  The report found that nearly half of organisations which had reported economic crime had suffered a cyber-attack in the previous two years.  The figure has almost doubled since 2012 and is substantially higher than results globally.  Of those affected by cybercrime in Ireland, nearly one in five incurred losses in excess of &euro;92,000 and figures as high as &euro;4.6 million were reported.  Also, board members and directors are not paying sufficient attention to cyber-readiness.  Fewer than half of board members request information on the cyber-readiness of their organisation in any given year.  <\/p> <p>The 2015 Garda Inspectorate report highlighted how cybercrime and cyber-security covered a range of offences.  Advances in technology are creating new opportunities for criminals.  I appreciate that this area is changing rapidly - almost on a daily basis - and that organised criminal networks are expanding into it.  Cybercrime affects everyone, including citizens, corporations and governments.  During visits by the Garda Inspectorate, many senior garda&iacute; highlighted cybercrime and the threats it posed as requiring the creation of a cybercrime unit and immediate action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Many policing services have developed cybercrime units and some have included cybercrime in an existing organised crime unit.  The Garda Inspectorate believes there is an opportunity to create cybercrime investigative capacity within a serious and organised unit.  As part of the responsibility of such a unit, a national cybercrime strategy should be developed.  In its more than 20 years in existence, the computer crime investigation unit at the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation has had many successes in detecting crimes such as computer related fraud and illegal trading over the darknet.  It has built up significant experience and expertise, with many of its staff regarded externally as experts in their respective fields.  However, a lack of technology has resulted in a widely reported backlog of cases in the unit.  Additional resources and a change in processes in the computer crime investigation unit have led to a reduction in the backlog.  However, to ensure it has the capacity and capability to deal with current and future workloads, the unit will be restructured and further management and staff added. <\/p> <p>Although it is a separate area, the significant growth in cyberbullying in recent years has allowed bullies to target individuals with little or no sanction or regulation.  A September 2016 report published by the Law Reform Commission underscores the need to do more to tackle the emergence of online hate campaigns and bullying.  Cyberbullying can have devastating consequences and tackling it will require much more awareness.  While it has not affected the school, the board of which I chair, I am aware that young people are very vulnerable to this problem which has had tragic consequences for those who have been attacked online.  I appreciate that this issue is not directly related to the Bill.  It is important, however, that the House acknowledge the need to strike a balance when dealing with digital harassment.  Awareness campaigns on digital safety and good practice and better education are all components of this.  Equally, strong sanctions which are provided for in the Bill act as an important deterrent.  Fianna F&aacute;il previously proposed a major shift in the law to protect people, especially children, from cyberbullying and make it a criminal offence to engage in, assist or encourage cyberbullying.  If the legislation had been successfully supported by the Government, the offence of cyberbullying would have been defined in Irish law to help to protect people from online hate campaigns.  Online bullying, hate campaigns and harassment are major issues, principally for the younger generation, and we need a strong basis in law to help to tackle the problem.  The Government must ensure the full recommendations made in reports on how to deal with cyberbullying are implemented.  As the digital and technological revolution continues, we must be prepared to respond to legally protect our civil liberties.  In the past, online bullying has only had consequences for the victims.  Now is the time to ensure the perpetrators also face legal consequences. <\/p> <p>I commend the Minister of State for the Bill, which is great work, and welcome the transposition of EU legislation in this area into Irish law.  We must ensure the Garda has sufficient resources to enforce this law appropriately.  While I appreciate that much of this relates to systems and the cloud and we are no longer talking about computers at home, we must tackle cyberbullying and cybercrime.  This is a good step, but we must make sure the Garda is resourced with sufficient highly qualified and technical personnel.  This is not a job for ordinary garda&iacute; graduating from the Garda College in Templemore, as good as they may be.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerry Horkan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is a very specialised and skilled area.

In this country we regularly pride ourselves on having seven of the top ten IT companies based here, including Google, Facebook and Apple.  We are always pronouncing how we as a nation have been able to attract them because of our talented pool of graduates who have the skill sets required, plus the fact that Ireland is attractive in any regard.  Dublin certainly is a hub, and Senator Horkan is correct in that regard.  Equally so, we should be leading the way in terms of dealing with the criminal aspects of this.  I would be the first to say that the development of technology has been of incredible benefit to many people.  For example, what people with disabilities can do with iPads is phenomenal, compared to how it was twenty years ago.  Equally there is a downside to everything, and this certainly has a downside.  That is why this legislation is timely.  I have no doubt that either the Minister of State here or one of his successors will have to update this legislation because it is very fast moving and constantly changing and evolving, no more than standard crime.  The criminal is almost always one step ahead, and I have no doubt that it is the same in cyber crime.  New devices and methodologies to facilitate crime will spring up.<\/p> <p>I recently became aware of a small retailer in the Galway area who experienced a cyber attack, and their small computer system with perhaps 400 or 500 accounts was invaded.  Unfortunately, the Garda told the company to pay the ransom.  There was some sort of ransom in computer terms, and it cost the people a few thousand euro in order to get their system freed up so that they could continue doing their business.  It was outrageous.  It is the type of thing one might see in the movies, but one would not think that it actually goes on.  <\/p> <p>In the last Seanad I called for SIM cards to be registered, because any young fellow can go down to the sweet shop and buy 20 penny sweets and he can go into the mobile phone shop next door and buy 20 SIM cards for &euro;50 or whatever it is.  One does not have to be over 18 to buy a SIM card.  Furthermore, there is no registration of these SIM cards.  If one had to produce a drivers licence or passport to buy a SIM card and that SIM card was registered, at least then if the Garda are investigating crime and they discover this mobile phone number there would be some traceability there.  I asked the library and research unit here to do some research as to what was international best practice in that regard, and it seems that only five or six countries had a registration of SIM card system in place.  It was seen as unworkable because of the amount of SIM cards.  There are probably twice the number of SIM cards in this country as there are citizens.  That is how fast technology is moving.  <\/p> <p>I welcome the Bill.  It is great that it is getting support from across the House, but I fear that it will be amended many times going forward because of the fluid nature of the Internet and social media and cyber crime.  I look forward to Committee Stage, and hopefully we will get it passed through this House as quickly as it was passed through the Lower House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#FF00200","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in will also be supporting the passage of this Bill today.  Colleagues have succinctly outlined the vast potential of how this can impact in our lives.  I have been a victim of online crime myself, in that someone treated themselves to a flight to Manchester and an overnight stay in a hotel on my credit card.  How that happened I have no idea, but nevertheless it happened.  Colleagues have touched on much more sinister and tragic outcomes from some of the people who are criminally active online, and we have seen this in the North in recent years, where young people have taken their own lives because they have been pushed to such extremes as a result of the manipulation, harassment, bullying and criminal activity being carried out by these people.  While sometimes we can get caught up in the world of technology and we can switch ourselves off to just how vast and complex it is, this does have a very tangible negative impact on people's lives, day in and day out.  It is right, proper and positive that governments are responding to that.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive presentation he gave.  It is very detailed.  As Senator Conway has outlined, this is a very complex situation and one that we will no doubt have to adapt to and be fluid as we move forward.  I have no doubt that we will work collaboratively in terms of the next Stages to try and refine this legislation together to deal with some of it.<\/p> <p>I have some questions that I feel are important to have on the record.  The law on cyber crime in Ireland is somewhat outdated, as the Minister of State has acknowledged, and contained in a range of legislative provisions.  It is difficult to navigate across the Criminal Damage Act, the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act and the Criminal Justice Act 2011.  The provisions of Acts dating from the early 1990s are rarely used because they are not fit for current prosecution needs.  Clearly, given the nature of the technological developments over the last 15 years or so, there is a need to update and modernise laws pertaining to the protection of information and communication systems.  Along with an update to the language and terminology relevant to offences in cyber crime there are a number of substantive offences introduced in this Bill, including the offence of hindering or interrupting an information system, denial of service offences, as well as the offence of providing the tools to commit denial of service offences.  There are provisions for fines of up to &euro;5,000 and 12 month prison sentences. <\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in broadly welcome the Bill and welcome this aspect of it, but we have some concerns regarding the provisions on search warrants.  We wish to hear the Minister of State outline further if there are any protections for whistleblowers who might break the law or be perceived to have broken the law in the public interest.  <\/p> <p>While the Bill is to be welcomed it has to be said that there is little point in introducing more legislation and giving the Garda extra powers if it does not have the resources to investigate any breaches of this new law.  It is not just about the correct training, which is important in terms of capacity building within the Garda , but we also need to resource the Garda to meet the demands that are there as a result of this criminal activity. <\/p> <p>I am aware from the review of the computer crime investigation unit under the Garda Si&oacute;ch&aacute;na modernisation and renewal programme that a dedicated Garda cyber crime unit has recently been established, but there are no figures currently available for the level of resources actually attached to it.  Perhaps the Minister of State can provide those figures, now or later.  Saying that the allocation of resources is ongoing is not enough, for all of the reasons that Members have outlined today.  I also wonder if the Minister would have an update on the intention to establish regional cyber crime units beyond the current pilot regions, when this will happen and what resources will be attached to them.  <\/p> <p>During last summer the Garda Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, said that the Garda would be introducing a new computer based system to track criminal complaints by the end of 2016.  Can the Minister of State confirm that this has happened?  Considering the number of Garda stations that have no Internet access - some do not even have access to PULSE - it seems unlikely that this could be the case.  <\/p> <p>These are practical issues that we hope to work on collaboratively with the Minister of State and other colleagues on Committee Stage to make this a better Bill in order to protect people.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have had many victims of cybercrime at many different levels.

As I stated at the very start, and it has been acknowledged by colleagues, this is significant legislation.  I thank the Senators for their contributions and their general support for the Bill.  It is clear there is a shared determination to combat cybercrime.  The Bill focuses on protecting information systems and the data they contain from unauthorised access or interference.  This is vital to the interests of businesses, Government structures and individual citizens alike, given the central role information systems play in all our lives.<\/p> <p>As technology advances and new forms of crime evolve, our legislative frameworks must also develop to counter these threats.  Cybercrime activities come in many different forms and broadly involve criminal attacks on information systems and infrastructures themselves or on their associated data.  Data are an increasingly valuable commodity in the economic world and personal information in particular carries a premium.  Criminal gangs are aware of this and perpetrate large-scale pervasive attacks involving unauthorised access to, collection of and use of data for monetary gain.  Some of the more common forms of cybercrime involve identity theft, online Internet scams or fraud, cybercrimes on business, cyber extortion, as was mentioned earlier, industrial espionage and online intellectual property theft.  It is these crimes which cause the greatest impact economically in Ireland and around the globe.  It has been estimated the cost of cybercrime to the Irish economy is &euro;630 million per annum.  Grant Thornton, the consultants who carried out this analysis, discovered the cost of traditional crimes, such as welfare and tax fraud, moving into the online environment is a significant threat to the Irish economy.<\/p> <p>The legislation we are introducing seeks to protect information systems and important data from cyber attacks from within and outside the State.  The Bill makes it an offence to engage in cybercrime activity and provides strong penalties for those found guilty of offences relating to information systems, including up to ten years imprisonment if the crime is sufficiently serious.  Cybercrime is an international worldwide problem.  It knows or respects no borders.  There is a need, therefore, for international co-operation to counter the menace.  Harmonisation of national laws is a very important way of doing this.  By strengthening our laws throughout Europe and beyond we present a united front against cybercrime and counter its transnational dimension.  The legislation before us will serve to transpose the EU directive on attacks against information systems and ensure Ireland can stand alongside our European partners in combatting criminality in this area and protecting vital infrastructure.<\/p> <p>International co-operation is also necessary on a practical operational level through sharing information between police authorities to bring cyber criminals to justice and enforce our laws.  A key aim of the EU directive, in addition to criminalising offences relating to information systems, is to improve co-operation with and between competent authorities, including the police and other law enforcement services such as Europol and the European Cybercrime Centre.  For the purpose of exchanging information on cyber offences, member states are required to have an operational national point of contact, which is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  The designated national contact point for Ireland is the Garda computer crime investigation unit, and its contact details have already been provided to the European Commission and can be made available to other member states' competent specialised agencies and bodies.<\/p> <p>The Bill will ensure unlawful activities relating to information systems and their data are criminalised and strong penalties are in place to deter and punish offenders.  In doing this it seeks to protect modern information and communication systems and maintain users' confidence in the safety and reliability of such systems.  This is clearly important for business, the Government sector and individuals.<\/p> <p>Senator Horkan mentioned the Law Reform Commission's report on harmful communications and digital safety published in September 2016.  While noting the positive benefits to society of the interconnected digital world in which we live, the report also noted the negative aspects of the emerging trend to engage in online communications that cause significant harm to others.  While the report identified the existing criminal law already addresses some of the harmful communications described, it also identified significant gaps that require legislation, particularly where new technologies are being used in new ways that could not have been previously anticipated.  Colleagues have mentioned the importance of developing and moving on, and it is changing by the hour.<\/p> <p>In December 2016 the Government gave its approval for the drafting of a general scheme of a Bill which would provide for new and amended criminal offences along the lines set out in the report.  The Bill will address the criminal law aspects of the Law Reform Commission's report.  Work is being undertaken to prepare the general scheme of the Bill which, when published, can be fully considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and the public at large.<\/p> <p>As we know, there are proposals to reconfigure the Garda computer crime unit into the Garda cybercrime unit.  I am not aware of whether many civilian staff will be involved.  It strikes me that what will be involved are people who will really be on top of their game and really specialist people, not the number of people, as has been said, but people who really are specialised in these areas.  The Garda has built up considerable expertise in this area.  The former head of the unit heads up the European cybercrime unit.<\/p> <p>Other questions were asked earlier and I will endeavour to get answers at a later stage, as has been requested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#GG00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491989400,"counter":289,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":290,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#GG00400","speaker":"1426"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#GG00500","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I am grateful for the opportunity to debate the Bill, which has been co-sponsored by Senators McDowell, Boyhan and Craughwell and for which I hope to obtain the support of the majority of the House.  The Bill has one very simple and straightforward objective, which is to remove the prohibition on licensed premises, including restaurants, off-licences and supermarkets, from trading on Good Friday.  I acknowledge former Senators Imelda Henry and Maurice Cummins who, along with a current Member of the House, Senator Colm Burke, sponsored the same Bill which, unfortunately, never got past First Stage in the previous Seanad and was not debated.<\/p><p>It is very welcome, as reported in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>yesterday, that the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, sought Cabinet approval to ensure the support of all of the Fine Gael Senators, and that all parties have indicated their support for the Bill.  I equally respect those opposed to the Bill, including my colleague, Senator Mullen, with whom I recently enjoyed a lengthy and respectful debate.  I am of a generation which fully appreciates the importance of what religious observation means to many in this country and I appreciate how they feel the country in which they grew up has dramatically changed over the past 50 years.  Unlike what we have seen in my adopted country of the United States, however, Ireland's modernisation has been intergenerational and has cut across class divides.  The so-called &quot;left behinds&quot; in the United States, who do not recognise the modern United States advocated by former President Obama and yearn for a country which reflects the old ways of their past, is a constituency in large that is absent in Ireland.  Nowhere was this more self-evident than in the same-sex marriage referendum, when an overwhelming 61% of the population, across all ages, genders and traditions, voted to support a change to the fabric of our nation, which would have been unconscionable when the Irish Free State was established in 1922.<\/p><p>That Free State, in an understandable desire to distinguish itself, in almost one of its first legislative actions enacted the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1924.  Until that point, as the then Minister for Justice, Kevin O'Higgins, outlined to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann when he introduced the Bill, pubs were open on Good Friday from 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. in cities and towns where the population was more than 5,000 and from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. elsewhere.  In an expression of support for the Bill, it was observed by a Labour Party Deputy, Thomas Johnson, that Good Friday is a Christian memorial day.  He supposed one might say that in Ireland, more particularly in the Twenty-Six counties, that it is recognised and taken notice of to an extent more than in any other country, perhaps in Europe or the world.  This is how the debate was framed then.  Prohibition of opening pubs on Good Friday was intertwined with the image which our new independent State was seeking to portray.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Billy Lawless:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2485\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2485&amp;amp;pid=BillyLawless&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=12\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While the prohibition on pubs opening was lifted for St. Patrick's Day some 60 years ago, for the best part of 90 years, the prohibition on pubs opening on Good Friday has stayed the law of the land, with only two attempts to seek legislative change in the area.  One was made in a Private Member's Bill in 1998 by the Labour Party, and I note from the record of debates that it had the support of then Deputy Michael McDowell, now Senator and co-sponsor of this Bill.  It was defeated on Second Stage.  The second was in 2014, by Fine Gael Senators, in a Bill that never got past First Stage.  It was former Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole, however, in seeking to amend a Government Bill in 2000 to allow pubs open on Good Friday, who perhaps framed the debate in the most straightforward manner to date.  He stated:<\/p><blockquote>Ireland is a grown up country.  We appear able to deal with bribery, corruption and other nasty aspects of life.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#GG00800","speaker":"1429","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Like hell we are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#HH00200","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":298,"content":"<p>He continued:<\/p><blockquote>We talk about creating an inclusive society, openness and giving people responsibility for their actions. Perhaps somebody could tell me why pubs do not open on Good Friday.<\/blockquote> <p>He went on to capture what has now become the great irony of the Good Friday prohibition, stating that, &quot;The prescription is more often honoured in the breach than the observance.&quot;  This is plainly the case right across the country, where Holy Thursday is now one of the single biggest off-sales days for supermarkets and off-licence outlets in the entire year.  Past Ministers for Justice have acknowledged time and again that a people are free and entitled to take a drink in their home and that the prohibition on pubs opening on Good Friday does not interfere with a person&rsquo;s right to take a drink on that day if that person so wishes.  It is of course perfectly true to say this, but what the current Minister must acknowledge is that incentivising low-cost drinking away from the controlled environment of licensed premises directly contradicts the current Government's entire alcohol policy.  It is stated Government policy that, to reduce binge drinking in Ireland, an objective with which I believe no one in this House would disagree, we need to remove cheap, low-cost alcohol from our supermarkets and off-licence outlets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#HH00300","speaker":"1429"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#HH00400","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Currently, an 18-year old with &euro;10 can buy ten cans of beer on Holy Thursday to keep for the next day, but cannot walk into a pub and meet friends where he or she might buy two or three drinks with the same money.  Keeping pubs closed on Good Friday actively incentivises binge drinking where people - particularly students - gather all day in arranged premises, and bring cans of beer and bottles of vodka and spend the day fuelling themselves in an uncontrolled environment, simply because the 90-year old rule has remained stubbornly unremoved from our legislation.<\/p> <p>It is no secret that I am a publican and restaurateur.  That is my trade, but I am also a father and a grandfather and I have seen the real damage alcohol abuse does to families and to young people.  There are clear economic benefits to licensed premises opening on Good Friday, where it has been estimated that local businesses lose between &euro;30 million and &euro;40 million as a result of the closure.  Tourists amble around the streets looking for the world famous Irish pub atmosphere, which they have spent hundreds of euro to enjoy in some cases, to be turned away on arrival.  These are strong reasons to end the 90-year rule, but they are not the only reasons.<\/p> <p>I believe there are few in this country, which is a hugely tolerant nation, that believe their values or their beliefs are being harmed or weakened as a result of changing these laws.  If anything, much like Ash Wednesday has become a secular day to encourage people to stop smoking, there is no reason Good Friday could not take on similar manifestations regarding alcohol abuse once the prohibition has been lifted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#HH00500","speaker":"1429"},{"type":"speech","time":1491989400,"counter":301,"content":"<p>What will happen to the Senator's &euro;40 million loss then?

Instead, what we hear are the humorous stories of the ingenuity of those seeking to evade the prohibition, heading to train stations, theatres, greyhound stadiums and other sporting venues.  It does not serve as a reminder to Christians of what I know is an extremely solemn day in their calendar to see images on the 6 o&rsquo;clock news of people guzzling down cans of beer on trains and in sports stadiums.  The prohibition simply solidifies this \"them and us society\" which is not reflected in Ireland.

I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for giving the Bill a Second Stage reading.  I thank Senator Billy Lawless and my fellow Independent colleagues for bringing the Bill forward in 2017.<\/p> <p>The need to repeal the Good Friday alcohol ban is raised on a yearly basis to no avail, but I am very hopeful today.  We know that Ireland's relationship with alcohol dates back to the Stone Age.  Like many other countries, we have an ambivalent relationship with it.  On the one hand, excessive drinking is a serious social and health problem.  On the other hand, the pub, as a focus for drinking, socialising, entertaining and culture is an important part of our national identity.  We therefore have a dual perception of alcohol as a problem to be managed and as a pleasure to be enjoyed.  Our policy and legislative developments have reflected this ambiguity.<\/p> <p>As legislators, we are tasked with balancing the rights of individuals to make their own lifestyle choices with the ethics of legitimate democratic intervention in public health by the State.  In supporting this Bill, I believe that legislation to support our pub and tourism sector and legislation to tackle alcohol-related harm are not mutually exclusive.  By supporting one, we are not automatically diminishing the other.  Lifting the ban on public houses being opened and alcohol being sold on Good Friday does not interfere with the Government's policies and legislation to reduce the harm that excessive use of alcohol creates.  As we speak, the Government's Public Health (Alcohol) Bill is going through the Oireachtas.  Notwithstanding some contentious areas, we must be resolved on it.  It is one of the most progressive pieces of legislation in Europe in the way that it tackles pricing, labelling, marketing and availability.  I supported this Bill when it was in the Seanad, but I am not conflicted in supporting today's Bill either.<\/p> <p>Neither is my support for this Bill an attack on the practices and traditions of the church.  As a nation, we have a strong history of teetotalism, \"the pledge\" and the temperance movement.  Traditions of abstinence on certain church holidays, such as Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, have been an important part of our social and religious history.  These practices are now in relative decline and our laws must be updated to reflect that.  I am not for one moment undermining the validity or importance of fast and abstinence for those who wish to practice it, but I am deeply conscious of the growing secularisation and multi-religious nature of Irish society, the increasing separation of church and State and our obligations as legislators to meet the needs of an evolving society.<\/p> <p>I am not here today to promote the drinks industry.  It can do a good job of that itself.  I am here to promote tourism, the Irish public house and the citizen's right to choose without the interference of the State.  To say that this legislation is overdue is an understatement. The Licensed Vintners Association, representing Dublin publicans, and the Vintners Federation of Ireland have been campaigning on this issue for years and I applaud them for their patience, which I hope will be rewarded.<\/p> <p>I read recently that there are now Irish pubs in over 40 countries and that the Irish pub is a highly successfully global commodity, a gold mine for owners all over the world trading on the Irish reputation for hospitality, culture and good craic.  Their success is not just due to the stout and whiskey for which Ireland is also renowned, but to their unique Irish characteristics.  The authentic Irish pub, the ones in this country, are honeypots for tourists and having them closed on Good Friday makes no moral or commercial sense.  In fact, there is a curious irony in the fact that one could drink in an Irish pub anywhere in the world on Good Friday except for Ireland.  Irish pubs are an intrinsic part of our national heritage.  They are much more than a place to purchase alcohol.  Pubs are important third spaces, places which are not home and not work, which are inherently democratic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017041200002#HH00800","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1491989400,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
