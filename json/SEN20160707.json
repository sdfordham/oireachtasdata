It is a very important issue for parents and pupils in the constituency of Limerick City.<\/p> <p>I want to clarify a number of points with the Minister.  The two schools in question are for the Dooradoyle, Raheen and Mungret area to be based in Mungret, and the greater Castletroy area.  They are known as the Limerick city environs south west for Dooradoyle, Raheen and Mungret, and Limerick city environs east and the greater Castletroy area.<\/p> <p>The need for these schools was highlighted in a report on the configuration and development of post-primary school provision for Limerick city and parts of its environs from 2014 to 2024 which was completed for the Department in 2014.  The report identified a need for two new schools in the Dooradoyle, Raheen and Mungret area to be based in Mungret, and the greater Castletroy area.  In the Dooradoyle, Raheen and Mungret area it showed an expected population increase of 5,400 up to 2022 and for Castletroy an extra 3,600 in population.  Specifically, it stated that there was a need over the next ten years for an extra 1,700 post-primary places in Limerick city and its environs and these two areas were identified.  The Department document, Arrangement for Patronage in the Establishment of New Post Primary Schools, refers to demographics.  The two areas requiring two new secondary schools were the Dooradoyle, Raheen and Mungret area, and the greater Castletroy area.<\/p> <p>The closing date for applications from patrons was Wednesday, 8 June.  How many potential patrons applied and who were they?  What is the timeframe for the consideration?  When will the announcement be made?  What are the criteria for the selection of the patron?  It is extremely important that the needs of children and their parents, living in the areas identified in the report completed for the Department in 2014 are catered for.  Those areas are Dooradoyle, Raheen and Mungret, and the greater Castletroy area.  They were the areas that had huge growth in the population of school-going children giving rise to the need for schools to be located in those areas.<\/p> <p>Can the Minister confirm the proposed sites for these two new schools in Mungret and Castletroy?<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What sites have been identified and where does the Minister expect them to be?  When are the schools expected to be opened?  We understand that the two schools will each cater for 600 pupils and it is extremely important that parents are given certainty about the building programme.  We understand that Mungret will be opening in September 2017 and that the school to be located in the greater Castletroy area will open in September 2018.  Living in Castletroy, I am aware that we have a fine school in Castletroy College, but there is a clear need for another school to cater for the increasing number of school-going children coming up.  Preference forms were provided whereby parents had to indicate to the Department which patron they preferred.  It made no reference to the school that the particular student or pupil was attending.  I hope there will be such a reference as it would give a clear indication of the need within the schools in the areas of Dooradoyle, Raheen, Mungret and Castletroy.<\/p><p>Finally, who will be making the recommendation?  It is something parents and pupils are entitled to certainty on.  The wishes of parents living in the areas to which I refer must be given weight and taken on board in terms of the criteria being considered as to who will be appointed patron and the type of school it will be.  The Minister might just provide clarity in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070700002#A00600","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467883800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Senator O'Donnell for raising the matter of these two schools.  He has outlined a great deal of the relevant information himself.  A demographic assessment was published in 2015 and at that stage nine new schools were announced to be opened in 2017 and 2018, including two in Limerick.  One was announced for 2017 for Limerick city and its south-west area at Mungret and the other for 2018 serving the Limerick city environs to the east, including Castletroy.  Each school will provide approximately 600 post-primary places to add to the provision.<\/p> <p>As the Senator said, we invited applications for patronage in April with a closing date of 8 June.  Parental preferences for each patron together with the extent of diversity currently available in the area will be the key to decisions made in the process.  We seek to ensure that there is diversity in the offer looking at what is already available in the area and then parental preferences.  In this regard, prospective patrons were requested to submit with their applications a parental preference template in which parents had been requested to indicate a preference for their children to be educated through that patron's school model and also whether the preference was for instruction through the medium of Irish or English.  The closing date was 8 June.  I do not have the full list of patrons that have submitted their applications although I am sure I could provide that for the Senator.  The system is that applications from the prospective patrons are now being assessed and an assessment report will be prepared for the consideration of the new schools establishment group.  The group, which is independent, adjudicates on applications.  It will submit a report with recommendations to me for consideration and final decision.  I will announce the patronage of the school following the completion of this process.  The patronage assessment report will be published on my Department's website.<\/p> <p>The Senator raised an issue as to the catchment within which the assessment of parental preference occurs.  My understanding is that it is the planning area as defined by the Department.  These are broad areas of which are 310 throughout the country.  Any parent within that catchment is generally assessed.  I note the Senator's concern that the views of people in the immediate area must be taken into account.  Obviously, they will be.  However, my understanding is that no greater weighting is afforded to someone in the immediate parish as opposed to someone in the next parish as long as he or she is within the planning area.  Those who live outside the planning area do not have their views taken into account.  I have seen cases where patrons in their enthusiasm have gone way beyond the planning area and collected parental preferences which are not taken into account.  It is strictly based on the preference of those living in the area specified when the call for patronage was made.  It is done in accordance with the invitation.<\/p> <p>Regarding the accommodation of the schools, my Department works closely with local authorities under the memorandum of understanding on school site acquisitions to identify suitable sites for school development.  Work on the acquisition of permanent sites for the schools is under way.  Subject to the necessary statutory approvals, it is my Department's intention to acquire land at Mungret which is currently in the ownership of Limerick City and County Council for the purpose of providing permanent accommodation for the new post-primary school to serve the Limerick city and environs south west area.  My officials are liaising with officials in the local authority to progress this site acquisition.  With respect to the new post-primary school to serve Limerick City and environs east area, my Department has requested Limerick City and County Council to assist under the memorandum of understanding with the identification and procurement of a suitable property to serve as the permanent location for the school.  Officials from the local authority have identified a number of potential site options and these are now being assessed technically to establish their suitability.  Once the assessment phase is completed, it is anticipated that negotiations with the relevant landowner will commence.<\/p> <p>Major construction projects to provide the buildings for the two post-primary sites in Limerick are included in my Department's six-year construction programme scheduled to proceed to tender and construction in 2018 and 2019 to 2021, respectively.  We are proceeding with due haste on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070700002#B00200","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1467883800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I have two quick questions.  The demographics report to which the Minister referred and which was published in 2015 specifically recommended that one school should be provided in the Mungret-Dooradoyle-Raheen area and that a second school should be provided in the greater Castletroy area.  That was based on the demographics in those particular locations.  It is very important that extra priority be given to the parents and pupils living in the immediate areas of those schools.  That was the basis under which the building of the schools was recommended.  We cannot have a situation where schools are built and pupils living in the immediate area are not given preference and priority in terms of being able to be educated in their own localities.  It is very important for the Minister to look at that matter.

There is no way a parent living closer to the school is given a greater priority than a parent further from the school if they are both within the area.

In 2010 the National Coal Miners Group secured agreement that the Department of Health would extend disablement benefit to former miners suffering from the prescribed occupational disease pneumoconiosis, commonly known as black lung disease.  Since this review was established in 2010, when I strongly lobbied on behalf of the coal miners, hundreds of miners have applied for disability arrears under this scheme.  This does not just apply to Arigna but also to those who worked in the Castlecomer, Ballingarry and Rossmore mines.  The Arigna mine is adjacent to the three areas of north Roscommon, Leitrim and south Sligo.<\/p> <p>I pay tribute to the former Minister, Deputy Eamon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, for his work with the cross-party committee.  He was very helpful in ensuring these miners were included and we have worked very hard together.  Many of these men were formerly Arigna miners and, unfortunately, they have suffered severe health-related illnesses due to working long hours in the mines.  As one can imagine, they had to work in very difficult conditions underground, with resulting health consequences.  Legislation, such as that in place in the UK, was not in place here to protect these miners.<\/p> <p>I understand that, to date, over &euro;1 million in State disablement benefit arrears has been paid out to former miners nationwide, almost half of which has been paid to Arigna miners.  The Minister might confirm these figures and also outline to the House how many applicants are still awaiting moneys and how many applications have still to be processed, if any.  I hope no applicant is currently facing avoidable delays.  At one stage, the official average waiting time between submission of application and receipt of arrears was six months, and longer in many cases.  At this stage, sufficient staffing resources should be in place in the disablement benefit section of the Department to ensure any outstanding claims are expedited.<\/p> <p>Recognition of the plight of the miners would not have come except for the sterling work of many people, including former Roscommon county councillor, Charlie Hopkins, who became a very strong advocate of the National Coal Miners Group.  I want to pay tribute to Mr. Hopkins, the National Coal Miners Group and all who have campaigned on the miners' behalf.  Living only a short distance from Arigna in the vicinity of north Roscommon, south Sligo and Leitrim, I know many of the men who worked hard in the mines all their lives to provide for their families.  I want to recognise their vital contribution to the local economy for many years.<\/p> <p>I hope all those who still meet the criteria under the scheme will receive payment as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070700002#C00200","speaker":"1424"},{"type":"speech","time":1467883800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Feighan for raising this important issue.  Disablement benefit is one of the payments available from my Department under the occupational injuries scheme and may be payable as a single lump sum or regular pension, depending on the extent of the injury or effect of the disease.  Eligibility is not limited to miners or to any particular occupation.  It is a social insurance benefit and, therefore, any person may qualify for it if they work, or worked, and pay, or paid, PRSI at class A, B, D, J or M, and lose physical or mental ability because of an accident at work, a commuter accident on a direct route between home and their workplace or a prescribed disease contracted as a result of their work.  The level of payment depends on the assessed degree of loss of physical or mental faculty.  A prescribed disease is a disease that has developed because of the type of work a person does and also includes any condition resulting from this disease.<\/p> <p>Since 2010, my Department has received a total of 247 claims for disablement benefit from former Arigna miners in respect of a variety of diseases and injuries.  Of these, 89 have been awarded, 81 were found to be ineligible and 77 are still under investigation.  In regard to the total of 81 cases that were found to be ineligible, some of the common reasons for ineligibility are, for example, claims for occupational asthma which have not been made within the statutory limit of ten years of leaving the relevant employment, and, similarly, in respect of occupational deafness, the claim must be made within five years of leaving the relevant employment.  In addition, former miners who ceased mining employment prior to 1 May 1967, when the legislation for occupational injuries came into effect, are not covered under the scheme for injuries or diseases originating before that date.  In a majority of the total of 77 outstanding cases, my Department is waiting for additional information or evidence to be supplied by the claimant in support of their claim.  A small number are awaiting a medical assessment by the Department's medical assessor.

While it is hard to recruit doctors at the moment, not only in the health service but also in social protection, nine have come through interview and although they have not all accepted the post yet, we hope they will.  I can assure the Senator these cases will be prioritised.<\/p> <p>I had the opportunity to visit Arigna many years ago, accompanied by Councillor John McCartin, and Councillor Charlie Hopkins may have been with us as well.  It is a fascinating place and a very interesting part of our industrial history, and particularly interesting to see how mining was done in those days.  They really were hardy men.  It was old-fashioned mining where the miner would effectively climb into a crevice with a hammer and start to dig into the coal seam.  It is also a very important place for our political history because it was one of the few places where the red flag flew in the 1920s, under the Arigna Soviet, which was established for a period at that time - a very controversial thing to do in 1920s Ireland.  That is not discussed in great detail in the museum there, although perhaps that has changed since I visited.  I thought it would be an interesting addition to the visitor facility.

I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, who sends his apologies for not being able to attend.  I understand the type of issue the Senator is dealing with, as I have dealt with a similar one in my constituency.  I know how difficult it is for the individual affected and their family.  The Senator will appreciate, however, that I am not in a position to comment on the case of any individual patient, even when some personal details are already in the public domain.<\/p> <p>The HSE, as the principal provider and budget holder in respect of public health services, is obliged to use the resources available in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.  This requires it to make difficult decisions to ensure the finite resources at its disposal are used to best effect.  Soliris is an ultra-orphan medicine manufactured by Alexion Pharma and licensed for the treatment of two rare blood disorders.  The drug is not licensed for the treatment of Degos disease by either the European Medicines Agency or the US Food and Drug Administration.  The licensing of pharmaceutical medicines is a matter for the Health Products Regulatory Authority in Ireland and the European Medicines Agency in the European Union.  It is not in the power of the Minister for Health to licence any pharmaceutical product, regardless of whether it has already been approved for use within the European Union.  It is appropriate that such matters are dealt with by expert and impartial authorities established for this purpose.<\/p> <p>In early 2015 the HSE decided to fund the provision of Soliris for sufferers of two specific conditions for which it had been licensed.  At an individual cost of over &euro;400,000 per patient per year, the drug is expected to cost the HSE approximately &euro;8 million in 2016.  Given these substantial costs, the director general of the HSE has put in place formal procedures to ensure each case in which Soliris is used is the subject of clear advance authorisation.  These arrangements would not permit the drug to be used for the treatment of a condition beyond the terms of the marketing authorisation and where evidence of clinical benefit has not been demonstrated.<\/p> <p>It is open to a drug&rsquo;s manufacturer at any time to submit an application to the European Medicines Agency to have a product licensed for use for a specific indication.  Once the drug is approved by the European Medicines Agency, the manufacturer can, if it wishes, submit an application for pricing and reimbursement to the HSE.<\/p> <p>It should be noted that there is no provision in legislation for the approval of compassionate access programmes for specific groups of patients with an unmet medical need.

Thankfully, the majority of the older style Victorian hospitals are now closed and the focus of mental health services is on treating people in the community as close to their homes as possible.  In the 1980s, 24-hour supervised residences were opened to accommodate service users who had resided in the old-style psychiatric hospitals, many for long periods.  Accordingly, these residences are their homes.  It is recommended that such homes be confined to having no more than four residents.  However, 40% of the residences inspected by the Inspector of Mental Health Services in 2015 had more than 13 beds.  It is important to note that these service users are particularly vulnerable, as many of them have been living with long-term mental health difficulties within institutional settings for most of their lives.  However, rather than benefiting from a move to community care, they have, in essence, been forgotten and abandoned by the modern health system which has simply moved from larger to smaller institutions.<\/p> <p>Crucially, we do not know how many people are living in these conditions or how many of these residences there are.  In its 2015 annual report the Mental Health Commission stated there was a fundamental issue with identifying precisely the number of residences, as well as the number of people living in them.  Despite repeated discussions with the HSE, no agreement has been reached on the issue.  Additionally, the commission is concerned that some of these residences are too large, have poor physical infrastructure, are institutional in nature and lack individualised care plans.  Under the Mental Health Act 2001, the inspector can visit these facilities and report on his or her findings.  A service can be requested to provide a quality improvement plan.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, under current legislation, these facilities are not subject to regulation by the Mental Health Commission.  This means the Mental Health Commission has no statutory powers over them, unlike inpatient units, which the Mental Health Commission can close down if they breach certain standards of care.  The expert group established to review the Mental Health Act 2001 made the following recommendation:<\/p><blockquote>The new Act should give the Mental Health Commission specific powers to make standards in respect of all mental health services and to inspect against those standards.  The standards should be made by way of regulations and the regulations should be underpinned by way of primary legislation.<\/blockquote><p>In 2015, the Mental Health Commission inspected 20 24-hour supervised residences.  The 2007 HSE report on accommodation for people with disabilities, Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion, recommends that home sharing arrangements should be confined to no more than four residents in total and that those sharing the accommodation have, as far as possible, chosen to live with the other three people.  Some 55% of HSE mental health service 24-hour supervised residences inspected in 2015 had more than ten beds and 40% had more than 13 beds.  According to these inspections, only six out of 20 residences inspected were described as in good decorative order, comfortable and homely.  A number of residences were institutional in function and environment.  For example, chairs were lined up against the walls in a row, bedrooms were devoid of personal possessions, shower facilities were locked, residents were not allowed to lock their wardrobes or bedroom doors.<br\/><br\/>Only seven, 35% of the residences, had exclusively single bedrooms while 12 had double bedrooms, ten of which had no provision for individual privacy.  One residence had two four-bed rooms.  The inability to provide residents with a single room impacts on their privacy and dignity.  With reference to one of the residences, the inspector reported that the overall state of the residence was poor.<br\/><br\/>It is recommended that all residents have a yearly medical assessment.  In ten of the 20 residences inspected in 2015, the residents had a six-monthly medical check with their GPs, in six residences there were annual medical checks, while in four the residents did not attend a scheduled medical check and attended a GP only if they became unwell.  In 14 residences it did not appear that the residents were means tested for charges, and each resident paid the same charge.<br\/><br\/>In summary, the Mental Health Commission stated that many of the residences inspected were too big, in poor condition and institutional.  There was limited multidisciplinary input in over 50% of the residences inspected.  Some residents had no care plans or any meaningful activity to occupy them during the day.  Many 24-hour supervised residences were failing to provide opportunities for the optimal recovery and rehabilitation of their client populations, as outlined for them in A Vision for Change, which has been in operation for ten years.  Recovery in this context reflects the belief that it is possible for all services users to achieve control over their lives, recover self-esteem and move towards building a life where they can experience a sense of belonging and participation.  The guiding principles relevant to the housing needs of individuals with mental health difficulties should include citizenship, equity of access, community care including specialist mental health support, co-ordination of support and inclusiveness.  The provision of community residential care for vulnerable mentally ill people, who may not be in a position to articulate their wishes, must be on an equal basis with other citizens and such provision should be a priority.<br\/><br\/>In 2008, the HSE conducted an evaluation, in accordance with the guidance for value for money and policy reviews, of the efficiency and effectiveness of long-stay residential care for adults within the mental health services.  The report found wide variations in resource allocation, a significant minority of clients were deemed to be inappropriately placed, low levels of discharges from long-stay residential services to lower level supports and a lack of consistent understanding of or approach to rehabilitation among the residences.  I have more to say, but given that I must conclude, I will send it to the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070700002#D00500","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467883800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>The Senator will have to write a letter.

I thank the Senator for her detailed analysis of many problems that exist.  There is widespread acknowledgement that there are many problems that must be addressed.  Mental health continues to be a priority for the Government.  It is reinforced by the fact that funding is increasing and we have given a commitment to continue to increase it.  This will be paramount to how we can progress and address many of the issues the Senator raised.<\/p> <p>The Mental Health Commission Annual Report 2015 reflects the widely accepted need to further develop a community based mental health service, with a prevention and recovery focus, as outlined in A Vision for Change, which, as the Senator said, is ten years old.  Given that it was to be reviewed after seven years, we need to get moving on it.  The Mental Health Act 2001 provides that the inspector of mental health services visits, inspects and reports on every approved centre at least once every year.  The inspector may also inspect any other service where mental health services are being delivered under the direction of a consultant psychiatrist.<\/p> <p>The Report of the Expert Group on the Review of the Mental Health Act 2001 was published last year.  The group recommended the Mental Health Commission develop a risk-based approach to inspection to ensure maximum effectiveness and efficiency in the use of scarce resources.  The group was in broad agreement that inspections of approved centres should be proportionate, based on risk and take place at least once every three years.  Annual inspections may be required if the risk profile merits such scrutiny.  This would allow for community services to be registered and inspected at reasonable intervals using a risk-based system starting with all community mental health teams.  Work on the general scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act 2001 and to include the recommendations I have mentioned is under way in my Department.  I will take the Senator's suggestions and would welcome working with her on any of those.<\/p> <p>In the context of ongoing development of community mental health teams, the HSE continues to promote prevention and recovery initiatives and enhanced service user engagement across the mental health services.  This has been reinforced by my decision to commence a process of policy review for mental health, guided by research into international evidence and best practice in these areas.  We should focus not just on mental illness but on health, well being and many other factors that contribute to it.  Six approved mental health centres achieved full compliance with all regulatory requirements in 2015.  While 55 centres were found to be non-compliant to varying degrees, 82% of these findings were small issues rated as having a low to moderate risk of recurrence, which can and, hopefully, will be addressed in the very near future.  I have urged the maximum effort on the part of all non-compliant centres to meet the necessary requirements in 2016 and in this respect I welcome the introduction of the Mental Health Commission Judgement Support Framework to guide and assist approved centres to comply with the commission&rsquo;s regulations, rules and codes of practice and to promote improved quality of services through a transparent inspection process.  In light of the fact that it will take time and funding to improve it, we must give as much support as possible to the services to try to ensure they are as compliant as possible.<\/p> <p>Funding for mental health in 2016 has increased from the 2015 outturn of &euro;785 million to &euro;826 million, an increase of &euro;41 million, which includes the &euro;35 million ring-fenced.  This funding is used to develop the priorities for 2016, which includes improved counselling services across both primary and secondary care, continued development of community mental health teams, improved 24-7 response and liaison services, which needs to be a priority, psychiatry of later life, perinatal mental health, and two new mental health clinical programmes, namely, ADHD in adults and children and dual diagnosis of those with mental illness and substance misuse.<\/p> <p>The Department of Health sanctioned the HSE to commence expenditure, and I have signed off on this for approximately &euro;22 million of this year&rsquo;s funding for new developments.  It is expected that sanction in respect of the remainder of the funding will be signed off in the coming weeks<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070700002#E00300","speaker":"1337"},{"type":"speech","time":1467883800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

Early diagnosis of autism, in particular, and other medical problems is crucial in order that children can progress.  A number of medical conditions are being diagnosed earlier and an early diagnosis gives children a better start at school.  Waiting times for assessment are a big issue in many of our constituencies.  The average waiting time should be three months, but in many cases it is much longer.  Speech and language therapy is important because if the problems are nipped in the bud before children go to primary school, they will not have the development issues they might have.  They will also be on the same level as their peers if there are early interventions.  Disability services are being reconfigured and one of the main issues is the recruitment of occupational and speech and language therapists.  In 2014 the previous Government announced the allocation of moneys to provide 275 additional therapists, including 88 speech and language therapists.  At the end of October last year, only 27 additional speech and language therapists had been recruited.  I looked for a section 13 report on the assessment of needs for occupational and speech and language therapists.  The last report I found had been completed in 2007.  Section 13 of the Disability Act 2005 provides for an annual report to be given to the Minister on needs identified in an area and the future allocation of speech and language therapists.  If a more recent report has been published, I ask the Leader to provide it for the House.

Yesterday I visited a school in Mullagh, Galway, that has a very big problem in that it is being asked to send children to schools in different parishes because they are 100 m. closer to a school over the parish boundary than they are to the one they want to attend.  There are serious issues in this regard and in the way in which the Department is very rigidly imposing the school transport directives.

I am very concerned about the issues surrounding repossessions in the State and the way they are being handled, and I have raised this on many occasions.<\/p> <p>Surely there are questions as to why the Defence Forces had to get involved in such a situation.  The Animal Health and Welfare Bill came before these Houses under the last Administration, during which time we went into an awful lot of detail about the health and welfare of animals.  To see five animals shot in Monaghan, on foot of some form of repossession, is extremely worrying, and we should have an explanation as to what exactly happened in this situation.  I want us to have a specific debate on the whole area of repossessions.  Again, in Galway in the last week there have been more than 100 repossession hearings in the courts.  This is happening in courts across the country.  There do not seem to be any moves whatsoever to try to resolve these issues for people finding themselves in these situations.  There are also serious questions about the way banks, the legal profession, etc., are handling all these matters.  I call for that debate on repossessions to be held as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070700002#H00300","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1467883800,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I was honoured to be selected yesterday as the chairperson of the Oireachtas cross-party group on alcohol harm, which is an informal group seeking to progress legislation and policy that can reduce alcohol harm in Ireland, with a particular emphasis on the implementation of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  Yesterday we had our first briefing, which highlighted the impact of harmful parental drinking on children in Ireland.  There was a great turnout at the event and it was fantastic to see such huge interest.  We were honoured to have such speakers as the chief executive of the ISPCC, Grainia Long; the head of advocacy at Barnardos, June Tinsley; the chief executive of the Children's Rights Alliance, Tanya Ward; and Suzanne Costello from Alcohol Action Ireland.<\/p><p>As many Members may know, I hear daily from family members impacted by a loved one's alcohol, drug or gambling problem.  Families all over Ireland are devastated by alcohol misuse and the most vulnerable person within the family unit is the child.  Children living with parents who drink in a harmful manner are among the most vulnerable in society.  The wide range of harms caused to children as a result of harmful drinking in the home is known as &quot;hidden harm&quot; as the harm is often not visible in public and largely kept behind closed doors.  These vulnerable children can suffer in silence.  They do not know where to turn for help and the impact of harmful parental drinking has a deep and long-lasting impact on their lives.<\/p><p>The voice of Irish children was heard on this issue when the ISPCC national children consultation surveyed almost 10,000 children aged between 12 and 18 years on the effects of parental alcohol use on their lives.  The findings from this survey show that one in 11 young people said that parental alcohol use affected them in a negative way.  These negative effects include emotional impacts, abuse and violence, impacts on family relations, changes in parental behaviour and neglect.  Some children who took part in this survey commented:<\/p><blockquote>It worries me; I can't get on with my life as I am taking care of my mum. <br \/><br \/>When they get drunk, they don't know what they are doing.  It's embarrassing.  I hate it.<br \/><br \/>I have to mind my sister while my [mam] looks for my father in the pub.<\/blockquote> <p>We need to address the impacts of parental drinking by introducing measures to protect children from alcohol harm in the home.  It is imperative that we ensure the best possible start in life for every child and effective prevention of alcohol harm and provide early intervention.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill is evidence-based legislation that aims to reduce our high levels of alcohol consumption in Ireland and can therefore play a key role in helping to break the negative cycle of harmful parental drinking that causes so many problems for children.  The Bill contains a provision for structural separation of alcohol products in mixed retail outlets, such as supermarkets and convenience stores, which will mean they can no longer be displayed like everyday or ordinary products, such as bread or milk.<\/p><p>I also acknowledge all the great work that Alcohol Action Ireland has done on this issue over the last few years.  It is a privilege to work alongside them.  I look forward to continuing to work with them in the future and I look forward to moving forward with this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070700002#H00400","speaker":"1408"},{"type":"speech","time":1467883800,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I rise today to raise the issue of the Admissions Bill, as published yesterday by the Minister for Education.  I understand that the Bill will come before this House in due course but I wish to raise a matter of concern.<\/p> <p>There seems to be a level of confusion regarding the processes surrounding the Bill and that some of the issues would be dealt with in the committee, according to the Minister, or a committee being set up within a committee.  The committees appear to deal with some issues surrounding admissions to schools, while other issues will be dealt with by legislation.<\/p> <p>There is also confusion as to whether the Minister intends to tackle the school tie issue, by which some schools in the State insist on keeping their intergenerational, hierarchical bloodline in place to demand priority be given to children of past pupils, which of course discriminates against those who are from outside the area or those of a family background of parents who possibly did not attend secondary school.<\/p> <p>I ask the Leader to facilitate a discussion in this House with the Minister, understanding, of course, that the legislation will come before this House in due course.

I welcome the Minister's announcement yesterday that 233 people have been appointed to the Passport Office to deal with the backlog.  I urge members of the public to check their passports in good time in respect of renewals.  There is a facility where a passport holder can sign up to receive an alert three months before a passport is due for renewal.  However, in many cases, there is a need for a passport to be renewed six months before its expiration date, so it makes common sense that the alert should be six months before a passport is due for renewal.  Nowadays with technology, every passport holder should receive an automatic alert.

I understand they were five limousine heifers about 18 months old.  This appears slightly over the top.  When cattle get excited, it takes a while for them to settle down.  Having been born and reared on a farm, there are ways and means in which cattle can be handled.  I ask the Leader for a report on that particular incident.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust.  Along with other Members, I attended a briefing by Colin and Eithne Bell from Newry.  Three years ago, they lost a son in Australia in tragic circumstances and his body had to be repatriated.  At that time the people of Newry fundraised.  Arising from that incident, the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust was born.  Since then, 197 bodies have been repatriated by that trust.  When I speak of a trust, I am speaking of a husband and wife, Colin and Eithne Bell, and their children.  I commend them on the work they do in a voluntary capacity.<\/p> <p>I will give Members some idea of the work the trust does.  In November 2015 the bodies of eight young Irish people had to be flown home to their families, which involved a huge cost.  The service provided by the trust is invaluable and cannot be quantified.  However, the need for the service has increased and the trust has got to a point where it needs help.  It has opened an office but is under financial pressure and is seeking funding of approximately &euro;50,000 per annum towards the running of the office.

In this case, I understand the animals were destroyed because they had TB or some other related disease and meat from then had to be prevented from entering the food chain.  Therefore it was a public health matter regardless of who made the decision.  Let us not jump to conclusions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070700002#K00700","speaker":"1420"},{"type":"speech","time":1467883800,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Let us ask the Minister to clarify.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070700002#K00800","speaker":"1377"},{"type":"speech","time":1467883800,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Exactly.

One of the big problems with passports is that one has to send back one&rsquo;s existing passport with an application for a new one.  I recently encountered the case of a young girl who had to travel abroad for a year as part of her college education and consequently was not in a position to send back her passport.  Despite this, she sent it back within the 21-day period by express post but she could not get it back.  Therefore, if we are to propose changes concerning the passport system, there ought be a provision whereby a photocopy of the existing passport or document of that nature could be sent back rather than the full passport.  It is a mess at present, including because of what is happening with Brexit.  If we are to consider this, we need to overhaul the whole system.<\/p><p>A number of councils around the country brought to my attention the fact that the new tenant purchase scheme in some local authority areas contains a clause that does not allow a tenant to purchase the house if the local authority deems it to be under-occupied.  If a mother and father in their 50s whose children have moved out want to buy the family home, they cannot do so in certain areas.  Everybody likes to have his or her own home.  In some local authority areas, tenants are being prevented from buying their home.  This is unfair.  I have never seen it before with a tenant purchase scheme.<\/p><p>I would like the matter to be brought to the attention of the Minister and for the relevant section of the new tenant purchase scheme to be amended to allow all tenants who meet all the other relevant criteria to be allowed to purchase their house without being told there are not enough people living in it to permit them to do so.  Many tenants who were not able to afford to participate in a tenant purchase scheme in the past but whose circumstances have improved on getting employment would be prevented from buying the family home, and they would see it lost.  The family house is the family home and it is where people like to meet and congregate.  The arrangement needs to be changed where it is being implemented by local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070700002#K01000","speaker":"1387","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467883800,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I agree with what Senator Landy said.  The regulation seems to be very difficult.  I encountered a case in which a local authority deems that, because the social welfare income of two retired people on the old age pension is inadequate, they may not purchase their house with the support of family members.  The decision is being made on the basis of income rather than family support.  The local authority is saying it is not prepared to sell the house, in which the couple has lived for over 40 years.  They are now being denied the right to buy it.  The regulation is wrong in such circumstances.<\/p> <p>The Minister should come to the House to explain to us why it is so difficult for people to purchase, particularly where they have paid rent for a house all their lives and are now in a position to buy.  Those affected would have been able to buy ten years ago if there had been a tenant purchase scheme in existence.  We should certainly examine this matter.<\/p> <p>There is a presentation being made in Buswells Hotel this morning by booksellers and members of their representative organisation.  There is now to be just one central tendering process for the purchase of books for libraries.  Many of the people involved in this area believe they will go out of business because of the new process being introduced.  The likelihood is that the contract could very well go to an organisation outside the country.  There are jobs at risk.  It is not appropriate to have one central tendering process for the purchase of books.  It causes a problem for those who produce and publish their own books.  Many Irish authors may be excluded under the process.  This is a matter that should be taken up with the Minister for Education and Skills or another relevant Minister to determine why we are now moving towards one central tender for the entire country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070700002#L00200","speaker":"1409"},{"type":"speech","time":1467883800,"counter":95,"content":"<p>I wish to follow up on the points made by the previous Senator.

The Government is currently planning a blanket, State-wide tender for book stocking across libraries in September 2016.  The result will obviously have a considerable economic impact on small bookshops, in addition to specialist Irish library suppliers, be they of children&rsquo;s books, fiction or otherwise.

He is clearly a Minister who is very much on top of his brief.  I hope we have him here regularly.  Logically, we would have him here regularly.  Particularly on the subject of broadband, he was very comprehensive in his comments.  Mobile phone coverage is a considerable issue throughout the country.  The current mobile and voice data obligations are based on population and do not result in universal coverage.  ComReg imposes a population coverage requirement of 70% for companies to fulfil their licence obligations.  This requirement allows them to leave out the more sparsely populated areas and more isolated communities where communication is clearly a significant issue, especially for SMEs.  I accept that we just had the Minister in but this is an issue we need to track regularly.  I welcome the fact that Deputy Bernard Durkan has organised presentations in the Audiovisual Room on broadband and mobile phone coverage.  He has agreed that all the providers will come here again in a few months.

The frameworks are being designed where they are looking at it in gross terms, so all the contracts combined, which could in some cases be 100 or more contractors, suppliers or small family businesses.  If there appears to be a small saving to the overall State they lose the contracts to, in a lot of cases, large multinationals.  A lot of them provide employment here, but some may not be.  There is a loss of jobs throughout Ireland, aside from the social dimension.<\/p><p>Senator Warfield spoke about local libraries.  A local bookseller would provide books relevant to that local area.  If it is, for instance, in Limerick City and County Council, someone may be providing books that are relevant to local historians in Limerick.  That would be unique to Limerick Library.  That whole intellectual knowledge would be lost.  This is about the design of the frameworks, about finding a methodology where local contractors can retain the contracts.  They have to go up for tender in the normal way, but at least they should be able to tender.  At the moment they are not.

Before I reply, on yesterday's Order of Business Senator Paddy Burke raised the EU Council's decision on the EU-Canada free trade agreement.  For the information of the House, the agreement can or may be applied on a provisional basis once the Council has agreed and the European Parliament has given its assent.  Member states will then have to ratify the agreement.  That means that the agreement would be brought to the Oireachtas for ratification following the conclusion of procedures by the Council and the European Parliament.  Members will be aware of that from yesterday.<\/p> <p>On this morning's Order of Business, I thank Senator Ardagh for raising the very important issue of speech and language therapy.  She is correct in that early diagnosis and intervention is critical.  There are commitments in the programme for Government to review the provision of services to children with additional needs.  There is a cross-sectoral team of officials from the Department of Health, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and the Department of Education and Skills meeting with the HSE this Friday to proceed and move matters forward.  One of the key agenda items for that meeting is speech and language therapy and the provision of services.  I will seek further information for the Senator on that.  It is a topic we will come back to because it is one we need to highlight in this House.  I understand the issues she raises.  There has been investment in the services and recruitment of staff.  There is a deficit and further work needs to be done.  I would be happy to move that on for her as I am with her on that.<\/p> <p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of the Attorney General.  That is not a matter for the House.  I do not want to dwell on it but she is the law officer to the Government.  Her advice is given in a considered manner, rather than as a cavalier approach.<\/p> <p>Labhair an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Clochartaigh mar gheall ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; bruscair.

Is d&oacute;igh liom freisin go mbeidh s&eacute; ag caint leis an Seanad&oacute;ir.<\/p> <p>Senators &Oacute; Clochartaigh, Gallagher, Mulherin and Coghlan raised the incident in Monaghan.  I do not have all the information but the information I have to hand is that members of the Defence Forces were asked to carry out this exercise, if I can use that term, which was the destruction of five animals --- the killing of them --- on a farm in County Monaghan out of concern for health and safety, and for public safety.  The operation was carried out at the request of the official assignee responsible for the herd, in conjunction of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Defence Forces, in keeping with official protocol.  The carcasses were removed and not included in the food chain.  I will seek to get more information for Members if that is what they want, but that is the information I have.<\/p> <p>I would be happy to have a debate on school transport at the earliest convenience.  I again thank Senator Black and acknowledge her work regarding alcohol, highlighting misuse of alcohol and the effect it has on children.  The all-party committee on health in the last Oireachtas brought forward the pre-legislative scrutiny of the public Sale of Alcohol Bill, which is coming before the House again in the autumn.  I am sure we can address it then.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in raised the schools admissions policy.  The Bill will be before the House.  There will be an opportunity for him to discuss it with the Minister.  To facilitate the passage of the Bill, perhaps we will arrange a briefing for Members and the Cathaoirleach.<\/p> <p>Senators O'Mahony and Landy raised the important issue of passports.  I welcome the allocation of new staff.  The issue of a reminder notice is one we should pursue with the Department.<\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher raised the very important issue of repatriation.  I, too, join with him in sympathising with Colin and Eithne Bell and pay tribute to them for the work they are doing.  I know there is discussion around the issue of repatriation of bodies.  Again, perhaps it is something we can work on together.  It is an issue that affects many of our families and communities.  Dealing with the death of a loved one is a source of huge stress, and then the bureaucratic nightmare of trying to get a body home is heartbreaking on top of the bereavement.  We can certainly take that up with the Minister and the Department.<\/p> <p>Senator Ray Butler raised the North-South interconnector.  I am not going to get into a debate about the Wombles, but we can have the Minister into the House regarding the interconnector issue.  I hope, in keeping with the new politics, Members opposite will be able to work with Senator Butler to ensure we have an outcome in keeping with the mood of the people in that area.  The oral hearing is ongoing.  I attended it one day as part of the Seanad campaign, so I saw at first hand the tension and anxiety of residents in that part of the country.<\/p> <p>Senator Wilson raised the death of S&eacute;amus Mac G&eacute;idigh.  He was a broadcaster of high repute.  He was a man of integrity in the promotion of Irish language and culture.  He had the listeners to his local radio station enthralled with his commentary.  We send our sympathies to his wife Dolores and his family on his untimely death.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Tim Lombard for raising the scourge of Japanese knotweed.  He will be aware that in his own area of Minane Bridge there is a very impressive company, Japanese Knotweed Ireland Limited, dealing with it, which has been in contact with many of us on this issue.  It is something on which we need a national strategy.  I would be happy to get the Minister to come to the House on that.<\/p> <p>Senator M&aacute;ire Devine raised the issue of psychiatric nurses, of which the Government recognises the importance and the serious issues that have been raised in this dispute.  It is important to say that there is a mechanism the State uses to resolve industrial disputes.  That should be used at all times.  In saying that, there is also the issue of maintaining services with staffing that is safe so we fill the vacant posts in the mental health service.  Recruitment of people is taking place in a variety of places and positions in mental health.  The former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, was a strong advocate on behalf of mental health services.  I am sure that the present Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will be as well.  It is important that the new posts are filled.  As the Senator is aware, 1,500 new posts have been approved since 2012 and 1,150 have been filled.  The issue needs to be addressed and I hope the mechanisms in place can be used to do that.<\/p> <p>Senator Feighan raised UK-EU relations regarding the fuel allowance.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, will be here next Tuesday to discuss issues around social protection.  He can perhaps address that issue as part of that.<\/p> <p>Senators Clifford-Lee and Noone raised the very important issue of the forthcoming auction in Christie's of the Beit collection in Russborough House.  I will be in communication with the Minister after the Order of Business today.  It is important that every avenue should be used not to have paintings sold and leave our jurisdiction, or even to go into private hands.  I hope we can address that.<\/p> <p>Senator Landy with Senator Colm Burke raised the new tenant purchase scheme.  I would be happy to get the Minister to come to the House to discuss that.  It is important that we have a resolution to it.<\/p> <p>Senators Colm Burke, Kieran O'Donnell and Warfield raised the issue of books, procurement and the tendering process.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I share very much the views expressed by the Senators.  Today is not just about the books, but is also about the importance of the public procurement process and the need for Ireland as a small island nation to recognise the importance of those small, family-run businesses providing services and products to a multiplicity of State agencies.  They should be allowed to continue to tender in a real way and not just cosmetically.  The framework process is one that needs to be changed and I am very happy that the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, should come to the House to discuss it.  Hopefully, he will be here on foot of the summer statements next week.  It is important to have a debate on this and, as such, I will try to facilitate one before the summer recess.  To assist Members, it would be useful if there could be a Commencement matter on it also.  I think that would find universal, cross-party support.  If the rules of the House allow, there should be a joint Commencement matter from Senators to get that on the agenda as well.  It is important.<\/p><p>Senator Maria Byrne raised the issue of the M7 and eFlow tags.  That is something the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, must address.  The Minister was instrumental in his previous existence in having the toll bridge on the M50 switched to the EazyPass system.  I hope we can address that matter.  I am not sure if the Senator is referring to the toll at Portlaoise, but as someone who uses the M7, I note that a tag would be important to facilitate speedier commuting times.<\/p><p>Senator Noone raised the issue of communications.

I am glad to see him in the Chamber.  <\/p><p>Let me explain the context of the amendment.  It arises from a concern I expressed on Second Stage about the extension of powers of seizure and detention of goods to officers of the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and the Chief Bureau Officer.  I said we needed to scrutinise these provisions very carefully to ensure adequate safeguards were provided for parties whose goods would be seized.  We should all be aware that it represents a very significant expansion of powers and a break from the current regime under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 which requires High Court supervision in the seizure and detention of goods.  We should be conscious of the current provisions in the 1996 Act for the granting of an interim order which only empowers the High Court to permit the detention of goods for 21 days.  Section 3 of the Bill purports to extend that power to the Chief Bureau Officer.  There is, of course, importantly, recourse for an aggrieved party to go to the High Court to contest this, but, nonetheless, it places, perhaps, an unfair onus on an aggrieved party and does not allow for automatic High Court or any court supervision of the powers of seizure and detention.<\/p><p>As I said on Second Stage, I accept absolutely the need for the Bill which we are supporting.  However, we want to ensure it is sufficiently robust to withstand any challenge.  We are concerned about the lack of an obligation on the CAB to use the existing court order regime where it gathers sufficient evidence during the 21 day period to go to court before its expiry.  As I see it, the problem is that the Bill does not place any obligation on the CAB to curtail the 21 day period.  It seems the default position will be, if section 3 is to be used, for goods to be held for 21 days before the normal provisions of the 1996 Act kick in and before the CAB goes the High Court for an interim order or an interlocutory order.  <\/p><p>The purpose of the amendment is to insert a new subsection (8) which reads: &quot;Where property is seized and detained ... an application to the Court for an interim order or an interlocutory order in respect of the property shall be made by the bureau officer concerned as soon as he or she has enough evidence to make such an application&rdquo;.  As I said previously, it is similar to the power of detention under the Criminal Justice Act 1984 where the Garda is obliged to release or charge somebody once it has sufficient evidence one way or another, without waiting necessarily for the expiry of the maximum period of detention for which it is allowed to keep a person.  We are putting forward the amendment as a suggested mechanism to ensure there an additional safeguard would be in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070700002#W00800","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1467883800,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ivana Bacik for her contribution on the amendment.  The Bill, as initiated, contains sufficient safeguards for affected persons against any potential abuse of the new seizure and detention powers.  Persons can apply to the court to have an authorisation revoked and to do so need only undermine any one of the four grounds on which the Chief Bureau Pfficer must rely.  It is also the case that failure by the CAB to make an application to the court for an interim order or an interlocutory order before the expiry of the 21 day period will open the door to a compensation action by the owner of the property.<\/p><p>The Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 has been litigated to the nth degree, as the Senator knows, by criminals who have been convicted of some of the most heinous crimes at considerable expense to the taxpayer.  The High Court and the Supreme Court have been tied up in such cases for lengthy periods.  That is as it should be.  Everybody, either guilty or innocent, is entitled to access the courts to ensure his or her rights are fully vindicated.  I know that there are provisions elsewhere in law that require persons to be charged without delay when the Garda has sufficient evidence to do so.  That is only correct.  The person concerned will be prosecuted for a criminal offence and his or her liberty may be at stake.  It is important that such matters be placed in the hands of the courts without delay.  I am afraid, however, that the amendment would open the door to litigation based on procedural arguments that would tie up the CAB and the High Court in a potentially endless discussion on when the CAB had enough evidence to make an application.  It has to be borne in mind that when conducting an investigation and, in particular, when making an <i>ex-parte <\/i>application to a court, investigators are bound to be fair and make reasonable efforts to seek and consider exploratory evidence.  Forcing the CAB to cut that process unduly short might in itself render the overall process unfair.<\/p><p>My officials have consulted the CAB about this proposal and it has expressed strong concerns that it would render the entire process unworkable.  In that light, I ask the Senators not to press the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070700002#W00900","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1467883800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I am grateful to his officials for engaging with me on this issue and indicating they would engage with the CAB on this amendment.  The Minister of State said they had done so.<\/p> <p>We support the Bill absolutely.  On Second Stage we all expressed our strong condemnation of the dreadful events of recent weeks and months, the shootings and the extent to which organised crime had permeated different communities.  It goes without saying we want to support the efforts of law enforcement agencies in tackling organised crime, in particular through the mechanisms for the seizing of the proceeds of crime.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, there are people who will be affected by this legislation who may not themselves be directly engaged in criminal activity.  Clearly, everyone has a right to be deemed innocent.  Subsection 1B states: \"A person who has possession or control of property which is the subject of an authorisation, or who is affected by an authorisation...\".  I believe that acknowledges there may be entirely innocent parties who are unwittingly caught up in this.  I gave a hypothetical scenario on Second Stage of a business owner whose premises is being used unknown to the owner in order to store proceeds of crime.  CAB may, in good faith, as it is entitled to do, go in and freeze those assets for 21 days under this legislation but that may have a hugely adverse affect on somebody who is running a legitimate business, the premises of which happen to be used in this way.  Given that somebody in such a situation will have to go to the High Court, with all the additional legal costs that may entail, I question whether that is a sufficient remedy in this scenario.<\/p><p>There is currently High Court supervision first, so the High Court first sees whether goods can be seized.  The point we are making is that we want to ensure there is a sufficient safeguard and that the 21 days will not automatically run without some sort of scrutiny at some point.  It is important the legislation is robust enough to withstand challenge.<\/p><p>I agree with the Minister there has been extensive litigation and challenges to the 1996 Act precisely because it was such a departure from our normal due process rules, and the courts have acknowledged this, while upholding the legislation.  As the Minister said earlier in the debate, as a result we have this very finely crafted balancing exercise in the 1996 Act to ensure it withstands all the challenges that come to it.  I want to make sure this amending Bill, with its very significant expansion of powers for CAB officers, will fit within that constitutional framework and not be found to tip the balance in any way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070700002#W01000","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467883800,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I accept Senator Bacik's point that there is a dramatic expansion of powers but I believe this is proportionate.

As far as I know, that report has never been made.  However, it was indicated by the then Minister, Mr. Shatter, and by CAB in 2013, two years after the working group was established, that CAB had conducted an analysis of its cases and found that after two or three years, and definitely after four years, very little happens in regard to confiscation orders.  It indicated it wanted the retention period brought down to at least four years, if not lower.  On that basis, we have put forward this amendment.

I appreciate the motivation behind the proposed amendment, which is well-intentioned.  It would be great if CAB could deprive criminals of the proceeds of crime without delay.  However, Senators will recall that the Minister in her Second Stage speech emphasised the critical balance of the Proceeds of Crime Act, which operates a as a piece of civil law.  The Supreme Court has found the Act does not amount to criminal proceedings.  The special provisions of the Act are possible to maintain because they amount to civil proceedings.  Any additions to the Act, therefore, must not tip the balance of the Act so that they become criminal proceedings.<\/p> <p>It is for that reason that I want to emphasise the care that has been taken to ensure this Bill is not only constitutionally sound but is also sustainable in the special civil context of the Proceeds of Crime Act.  The Attorney General's advice has been sought on the proposal to reduce the waiting period for a disposal order from seven years on a number of occasions over the years.  In 1999 and in 2003 the then Attorneys General advised against the reduction of the seven-year period.  The Senator will recall that former Chief Justice Keane described the Act as \"unquestionably draconian\".  The seven-year period has been seen as an important counterbalance to the Act's draconian nature and one that prevents it from being seen as a penal measure.  The advice of the Attorney General has been sought once again in the context of the current Bill and the proposed amendment.  I am advised that in the absence of a clearly demonstrated need for and justification of a reduction to four years, it is too risky to do so as it would jeopardise the proportionality of the legislation.<\/p> <p>As was said on Second Stage, the Proceeds of Crime Act has served us well for 20 years.  It has been tested again and again in the courts.  We must be sure that any changes to this carefully honed legislative tool do not blunt or break it.  I would, therefore, ask the Senator not to press the amendment.<\/p> <p>In addition to that fundamental point about the proportionality of the Act overall, there are practical questions concerning how such a reduction in the period would apply to existing cases and what transitional provisions might be required.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=07\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If I have not convinced Senators of the risks inherent in reducing the waiting period, I would at least ask that they not press the amendment today but pursue the question as part of the medium-term review of the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070700002#X01900","speaker":"1277","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467883800,"counter":145,"content":"<p>We will press the issue as part of the medium-term review.

The sentiments expressed today and in the amendments indicate that we are all approaching this from a sincere point of view in that we want to get the legislation right.  In the past 24 hours, I have engaged with some of the Minister of State's officials to try to refine the Bill.  While I appreciate the nature of Standing Orders, I encourage the Minister of State and his officials to reflect on the sentiments expressed in the previous amendments.<\/p> <p>We are dealing with criminals who are preying on society and living lavish lifestyles while routinely destroying the communities that we all care for, come from and have the privilege to represent.  There is an urgency in the core elements of the Bill and we do not intend in anything we do to try to delay or impede its passage.  I support the seizure of criminals' assets and the transfer of same simply and directly to the communities most affected by the gangsters.  This investment of assets would and should be direct, smooth and, where possible, unhindered by bureaucracy.  We want to see the people most affected by these criminals benefitting from the seized assets.  We need a review of the current system in order to achieve a direct line of funding via the seized assets for communities in need.  The direct line approach is also appropriate in circumstances where, for example, assets are seized in either Irish jurisdiction, North or South.  Assets should not be frozen while awaiting a legal challenge by criminals.  They should be transferred to the areas where the crimes were committed.  I am concerned that, in the midst of the difficult and sometimes damaging situations addressed by this legislation, we not lose sight of this opportunity.  Following implementation by the Minister of State's colleagues in the North, I am aware of community groups, organisations, projects and programmes benefitting from directly seized criminal assets.  We should consider this issue, tease it out and examine best practice as the Bill and subsequent reviews proceed.<\/p> <p>In terms of the broader societal and criminal justice issues, those who are responsible for the crimes on our streets and for torturing our communities must be tackled swiftly and in compliance with human rights legislation.

A range of initiatives needs to be taken.  The Minister of State is in agreement, as has the justice committee generally been in the past.  We must consider a multidisciplinary approach rather than just criminal justice measures.  An initiative to ring-fence the proceeds raised from this sort of civil forfeiture legislation would also be a way of tackling disadvantage.  We all accept that this is the type of issue that might best go forward to the wider review of the legislation that the T&aacute;naiste mentioned on Second Stage.

I am not suggesting for one moment that the mid-level criminals that the Bill is designed to hurt avail of this revolving door system to the same degree as those who might be described as petty criminals but we must be aware of the fact that the bottom feeders or petty criminals are a part of the criminal fraternity that is managed by the dons whose activities we are seeking to limit.  I refer to them as &quot;dons&quot; because how they are behaving is akin to how mafiosi behaved previously in that they shoot people within the criminal fraternity who do not do what they ask them to do.<\/p><p>We must move to zero tolerance of crime.  We must openly demonstrate that crime, regardless of its level, does not pay.  We must hit the criminals where it hurts, that is, in their pockets.  The Bill sets out to do that.  Hitting criminals in their pockets means closing off all avenues available to them to launder their ill-gotten gains.  Many view this Bill as going after drug barons, those who are behind the shootings about which the House sadly hears too much, but there are others operating in society's criminal underbelly.  We need to hit them.  We need to deal with fuel laundering, cigarette smuggling and crimes involving precious jewellery.  We need to deal with the criminals that no one ever gets to hear about or see.  I am referring in particular to the pimps who run sex operations throughout the country.  I have anecdotal evidence of pimps who bring tens of thousands of euro to betting shops or bookies and request that the money be divided equally across all races or gambling activities on that day.  In this way, they clean their money.  Some of the large gambling institutions in this country are far from such and are actually banks.  These criminals operate them as their banks.  Criminals leave tens of thousands of euro on deposit with the large gambling institutions in question.  When they need a few bob, they draw money out.  When they have money, they chuck it onto the table and ask that it be stuck on every favourite for the day.  In this way, they accumulate significant amounts of money.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

There have been problems with it.  The purpose of the amendment is to limit the illegal banking activities that are happening through the gambling world where one can take, for example, &euro;1,000 and turn it into &euro;800 of clean money.  We must stop this.<\/p><p>People's lives are suffering as a result of the criminals operating on the underbelly of society about which most decent people know nothing.  Nobody gets shot or injured, that we are aware of.  However, I am mindful of one piece of anecdotal evidence.  The criminal involved is now a guest of Her Majesty in a UK prison.  He brought in young women from eastern Europe, brought them to houses in the midlands and beat them to a pulp until they saw prostitution as something that was a worthy escape from what they were suffering.  He made tens of thousands of euro on the backs of these poor girls, brought it to betting shops and cleansed it.  This is why I have proposed the amendment.<\/p><p>One cannot walk across the road to AIB or into an insurance company, stockbroker or high quality car dealer or jewellers and throw &euro;40,000 on the table without somebody asking where one got it.  However, one can do it in a betting shop.  One can walk into a bookie's, put down tens of thousands of euro, walk out the door, and nobody other than the staff will ever know one did it.  Nobody will question where the money came from, and one walks out of the place clean.  I am not sure many people in the country know this is happening.  I am not sure many people who live in the leafy suburbs of the various well-off places in Ireland are aware that people are doing this in their areas.  However, I believe the anecdotal evidence has strong supporting evidence, if we only look for it, and if so, we must tackle these people.<\/p><p>I will go one step further.  Over the past few days it has come back to me.  I have been contacted from outside the House by a person who said I should go further and call for the Criminal Assets Bureau to go into these large institutions today and freeze all accounts until it is established where the money came from.  If what I am being told is true, we are not talking about thousands of euro but potentially millions of euro in illegal money sitting in accounts that are, allegedly, betting accounts.  If it is true, we have a much bigger problem on our hands than I thought when I first put down the amendment.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070700002#Y01300","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1467883800,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this very important issue and giving me a chance to outline the proposed approach to the gambling sector's potential vulnerability to being used to launder the proceeds of crime.

A review being carried out under the aegis of the anti-money laundering steering committee, chaired by the Department of Finance and involving all relevant State agencies including my Department, the Garda and the Revenue, will examine the inherent risks in this area, the specific threat factors in this jurisdiction and measures that may mitigate such risks.  It will also consider the supra-national risk assessment of the sector carried out by the European Commission.  Based on the results of the review, we will determine what the necessary measures to reduce the risks in this area may be and what legislative or other measures may be required.  The deadline for the transposition of the directive is May 2017, and work on the review has already commenced.  I hope the Senator will understand that the amendment would not be feasible before the completion of the review in mid-2017.<\/p> <p>It is also best that any legislative requirements be considered as part of the law regulating gambling, or the transposition process for the anti-money laundering directive rather than the Proceeds of Crime Acts.

Again, having engaged with the Minister of State's officials on it since Second Stage, it may well be the case that this issue can be addressed through the sexual offences Bill itself when it comes back before us, as I hope it will very soon.

However, the amendment, as the Senator knows, would disapply proceeds of crime legislation to conduct which, as it stands, is not criminal.<\/p> <p>Under current law neither the payment for sexual services nor the receipt of payment for providing such services is a criminal offence.  I understand, of course, that the intention is to provide in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 for an offence of payment for sexual activity with a prostitute and that this was a subject of considerable debate in this House, the justice committee and elsewhere.  While that Bill was passed by this House earlier this year, it has not yet been enacted, and it is a matter for both Houses to pass that legislation.<\/p> <p>While I know that the processes in the sexual offences Bill are generally well supported in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, it is a matter for the D&aacute;il to conclude its work in this regard.  I have some difficulty, therefore, with introducing provisions in this legislation relating to the proceeds of crime arising from conduct that is not currently criminal.  In my view, it is not appropriate to introduce a provision which pre-empts the work of the other House, a point to which the Senator herself has alluded in her comments.<\/p> <p>That said, this amendment requires further consideration for a number of reasons.  The objectives of criminalising the purchaser of sexual services outlined during debate on the sexual offences Bill in this House and in the report of the joint Oireachtas committee, which recommended criminalising the purchase of sexual services, include reducing both push and pull factors.  I am concerned that this amendment could have negative implications for persons who offer sexual services and could offer an opportunity for those who would exploit the law and exploit those who are vulnerable.<\/p> <p>For instance, the exemption of the purchase of sexual services from criminal conduct for the purpose of proceeds of crime could lead to sex workers being pressurised into holding moneys as seemingly legitimate fronts for pimps, traffickers and other organised criminals.  It might also make it more difficult for CAB to pursue proceeds of crime held by pimps or traffickers.  For instance, CAB could have to show derivation from trafficking-related prostitution as distinct from non-trafficking-related prostitution.  These matters all need be considered further.<\/p> <p>It is also the case that while the amendment would disapply the proceeds of crime legislation to money obtained by a person who offers sexual services, that money would still be the proceeds of criminal conduct for the purposes of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010.  To attempt to exempt the purchase of sexual services in that respect could have potential effects on international obligations and on the regulatory system for money laundering prevention and detection and, again, the potential for sex workers to be used as seemingly legitimate fronts for holding money for pimps and traffickers.<\/p> <p>We could consequently have a situation whereby, if this amendment is accepted and the offence of purchasing sexual services introduced, money obtained from providing such services would be the proceeds of criminal conduct under money laundering legislation but not under the proceeds of crime legislation.  In addition, aside from the fact that I would have difficulty introducing a provision into law which anticipates the outcome of further legislative deliberations, it is my view that effectively exempting moneys derived from the purchase of sexual services from the proceeds of crime would, for the reason outlined, be fraught with difficulty, contrary to policy objectives and unadvisable.  I therefore ask that the Senators not press the amendment but I have listened to what Senator Bacik has said very carefully, and the matter will have to be considered in further discussions on the other legislation to which she refers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2016070700002#AA00400","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1467883800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.
