The purpose of the annual NHQRS Report is to use easily accessible information to develop a better understanding of whole health system performance. The mechanism was established to provide a broad overall picture of the quality of our health services.  It is intended to demonstrate to individual hospitals and other health service providers the importance of examining their own data in order to improve the services they provide. It must however, be understood that the performance and quality of a service cannot be measured by one indicator alone.  This is why the report presents an  analysis of a range of indicators that reflect different parts of the services and allows progress and priorities in the health system to be identified.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the NHQRS is not intended to act, and was not designed to act, as a performance measurement tool. There are already a variety of existing measures in the broad healthcare sphere that have been put in place to drive improvements in patient safety, including the work undertaken by the Health Information and Quality Authority. Similarly, it is not intended to provide detailed comparative analysis for particular health questions. In relation to the particular figures provided in the NHQRS report, I would note that care must be exercised when considering them given the variation in the numbers of cases that individual hospitals, in particular smaller units, may deal with.  Other issues, for example the quality of the data collected, or patients attending one service being more unwell and consequently presenting with more complex needs than those attending other services, can also influence the final outcome.<\/p>  <p>  However, I recognise that there are areas identified where further room for improvement exists. In particular, considerable variation can be seen between counties in rates of hospitalisation for common chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, diabetes and heart failure. Identifying this variation is a first step to addressing the reasons why this variation exists and to improving it.  For example, the information on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is already informing requirements in Primary Care and the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee Guideline being developed by the HSE Clinical Programme for the management of this disease.<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, rather than initiating enquiries, the intent of the report would be for any apparent anomalies which come to light to prompt further research into their possible causes; in the first instance, that is the responsibility of individual hospitals which are required, under the National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare, to provide safe and effective care and treatment to patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200060#WRA01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":27,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200060#WRA01850"},{"type":"question","counter":28,"qnumday":21,"qnumall":"[20987\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200060#WRA01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to improve psychiatric services at acute and at community level in counties Carlow and Kilkenny.","asker":"1248","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":29,"content":"<p>The HSE Carlow\/Kilkenny Mental Health Service delivers Mental Health services across a broad range of primary and community based services, together with specialised services for children and adolescents, adults and older people.

The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. <\/p>  <p>  The HPV vaccine protects girls from developing cervical cancer when they are adults.  It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.   <\/p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.<\/p>  <p>  By January 2016, over 200 million doses of Gardasil had been distributed worldwide.  In Ireland over 580,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and over 200,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the statutory regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  This is done by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.  <\/p>  <p>  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  <\/p>  <p>  In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  The outcome of the review found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  <\/p>  <p>  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.

However, per capita figures represent one of a number of metrics that can be used to develop a view of drugs spending in Ireland. For example, aggregate spending on the GMS, Drugs Payment Scheme, and Long Term Illness scheme has reduced since 2009, despite an increase in numbers with eligibility and the introduction of more expensive new medicines, such as new oral anticoagulants.<\/p>  <p>  According to OECD data for 2014, the last year for which full figures are available, expenditure on prescription and over-the-counter medicines accounted for just over 14 percent of overall health expenditure in Ireland. Although this was higher than several other EU countries, including Denmark, Finland, and Belgium, it was lower than Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, and significantly lower than Greece or Hungary.<\/p>  <p>  OECD data on pharmaceutical prices is based on list prices of products. Such data does not consider the actual commercially confidential discounted prices in place, and therefore has limitations. In addition, expenditure on medicines in hospitals is excluded in the OECD statistics. Many expensive speciality medicines are provided in primary care settings in Ireland, meaning that Ireland's spend per capita is over-stated relative to EU countries in which these medicines are supplied mainly through hospitals. <\/p>  <p>  The prices of medicines vary between countries for a number of reasons, including different prices set by manufacturers, different wholesale and pharmacy mark-ups, different dispensing fees and different rates of VAT.

Under a Framework Agreement, signed in 2014, the HSE, Department of Health and IMO are currently engaged in a comprehensive review of the GMS and other publicly funded health sector contracts involving GPs. A number of service developments have already arisen out of this process including the implementation in 2015 of a universal GP service for all children under 6 years and all persons aged 70 years and over.  In addition, a cycle of care for asthma for children under 6 years, and a cycle of care for diabetes for medical card and GP  cardholders were also introduced last year.  More recent developments in 2016 were the enhanced support framework for general practices services in rural areas and the revised list of special items of service that can be provided by GPs.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2016, the Government has also provided for the extension of GP care without fees to all children aged under 12 years in the latter part of 2016.  This extension is subject to negotiation and will be implemented in the context of a new GP contract. In addition, the Programme for Partnership Government, commits to the introduction of free GP care for all under-18s, subject to negotiations with GPs and noting the need for additional GPs to support the additional workload. <\/p>  <p>  I have recently met with GP representative bodies to discuss the future development of general practice and I have assured them of the Government's commitment to developing primary healthcare services for all our citizens and the key role of general practice in that context. In order to ensure that the potential benefits of an enhanced integrated  primary healthcare sector can be realised and supported by a new contract for general practice services, I am currently considering a number of options around this process, including the possibility of broader consultations with stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government emphasises the need to focus on enhancing primary healthcare services including building up GP capacity, increasing the number of therapists and other health professionals in primary care.  The number of GP contract holders has been increasing incrementally in recent years, from 2,258 at the end of 2010 to  2,469 at end the May 2016.

To date 133 people living with dementia have benefitted under the funding allocated from the National Dementia Implementation Programme at an average cost of &euro;1,000 per package per week.  There are currently 85 people with dementia in receipt of an Intensive Home Care Package.  In addition to the Intensive Home Care Packages the HSE will continue to provide mainstream home help and routine Home Care packages to people with dementia whose needs have been assessed as requiring these supports and within available resources.  Up to 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from Intensive Home Care Packages over the lifetime of the implementation programme. <\/p>  <p>  It is Government policy that, wherever possible and appropriate, people should be cared for in their own homes and communities, and the National Dementia Strategy specifically restates this commitment to those living with dementia. <\/p>  <p>The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2016 provides for a target of 10.4 million Home Help Hours to support about 47,800 people.

In 2013, the Government approved and published a strategy for developing eHealth capability in the Irish health system called the eHealth strategy for Ireland, 2013.  <\/p>  <p>This strategy sets out a number of objectives and a road map for the delivery and implementation of eHealth to the benefit of both the citizen and the economy. The Government eHealth strategy draws heavily on and incorporates many aspects of the work done by the EU Task Force set up in 2011 to look at the potential for eHealth and its context in cross border health care resulting in the EU eHealth Action Plan 2012-2020, Innovative Health Care for the 21st   Century. <\/p>  <p>  Amongst the key objectives of the eHealth strategy was the setting up within the HSE, of an entity called eHealth Ireland to implement the strategy, the recruitment of a Chief Information Officer and the setting up of an Office of the Chief Information Officer, reporting to the Director General of the HSE. The CIO has been in place since late 2014 and eHealth Ireland is operating under his leadership. A Knowledge and Information Plan setting out the implementation objectives for eHealth was published in spring 2015. <\/p>  <p>  The eHealth strategy also highlights the potential of cross border collaboration on eHealth and in particular the considerable experience of eHealth deployment in Northern Ireland. It highlighted an all-island opportunity for eHealth. Northern Ireland was a focus of attention amongst a number of case studies on eHealth implementation in the strategy. My Department has been engaged since 2013 in sharing and learning from Northern Ireland&rsquo;s experience in this area. There is also engagement by HSE in eHealth initiatives in the context of the INTERREG Programmes and other opportunities such as Horizon 2020. The HSE and the Northern Health and Social Care Trust are progressing the implementation of cross border Radiotherapy services.  This will be facilitated by the deployment of technology to ensure that the relevant patient data is available where the patient is being treated on either side of the border.  I understand that officials from HSE will be partaking in a workshop with their counterparts from Northern Ireland shortly on the eHealth agenda in both parts of the island.  <\/p>  <p>  The eHealth strategy also called for the setting up of an eHealth ecosystem to develop eHealth linkages and stakeholder engagement including patient engagement similar to one already working in Northern Ireland and several other jurisdictions. The eHealth Ireland Ecosystem has been operating for over a year and is very useful platform to provide stakeholder engagement on a range of issues as well as economic connectivity for the SME community in Ireland. In addition, in the context of the implementation of the eHealth strategy, the HSE has set up an eHealth Ireland Advisory Committee comprised of a number of academic, technology and healthcare experts whose role is to support and guide implementation of the eHealth Strategy through the implementation of the Knowledge and Information Plan. <\/p>  <p>  Interoperability of computer systems is a major challenge facing the implementation of eHealth whether within health care services or in the context of cross border health services. A key component needed for delivery of successful eHealth solutions is the adoption of a standards based approach to the implementation of ICT systems. The Health Information and Quality Authority have developed a range of standards to support eHealth. My Department is also actively engaged with the EU eHealth Network which was established in 2011 to pursue solutions to interoperability and standardisation between Member States. Under the auspices of the eHealth Network, the Joint Action to Support the eHealth Network (JASEHN) has been established.  My Department is actively involved in a number of related work streams of the Joint Action, whose overall aim is to provide the optimum environment, both technical and legal, to allow for interoperability of health care systems in the context of cross border services. As part of the HSE eHealth work, the Office of the CIO has established an Enterprise Architecture Unit dealing with interoperability and standards based in many instances on EU related work on summary care records and ePrescribing. The eHealth Ireland team have created a clinically focused function that is known as a Chief Clinical Information Officers Council. This function takes lessons learnt from other jurisdictions globally and ensures that technology is deployed with clinical engagement and leadership.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Electronic Health Records, the Office of the Chief Information Officer has recently submitted a detailed business case for a national electronic health record programme for Ireland. My Department is currently evaluating how this might be progressed particularly in delivering an EHR in the context of the work being planned for the New Children&rsquo;s Hospital which aspires to be the first digital hospital facility in the country. In developing a national electronic health record programme we must build on the progress to date in ICT deployment but also the lessons learnt from other jurisdictions in developing an optimum solution for Ireland. This programme, if progressed, will require a substantial investment in ICT. It also offers the opportunity for re-configuration of services with the potential of a safer, patient centred and more integrated approach along with significant efficiencies.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to say that since 2013 and the publication of the eHealth strategy for Ireland substantial progress is being made in furthering the eHealth agenda and I look forward to further progress, particularly in regard to electronic health records. The capital programme for health care ICT has been increased from &euro;40m in 2014 to &euro;55.0m in 2015 and 2016. The new eHealth structures are progressing well with the planned rollout of new health care ICT infrastructure and solutions across the health services including key clinical systems such as a new national laboratory information system (LIMS), maternal and new born information system (MN-CMS) the Medical Oncology Clinical Information System (MOCIS) due to go live in the next 12 months. MOCIS will provide digital support for prescribing and administration of chemotherapy treatments. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the eReferrals Programme has delivered a solution to provide electronic referrals between primary and acute hospitals using the Health Link facility. To date 48 hospitals have been connected and the programme is working well. Other work that is being progressed is in the area of ePrescribing. The HSE are currently evaluating work done across various regions on ePrescribing and a National ePharmacy programme has been established to develop the components for a business case for a national ePrescribing solution. Further work is required to develop and define a  national drugs file as a key building block for a national ePrescribing solution.  The progress achieved to date on eHealth and specifically ePrescribing can be followed up on the eHealth Ireland website www.eHealthIreland.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The delivery of digital health care services and the rollout of an electronic health record (EHR) will require a further robust legal framework to ensure confidentiality and security of patient data consistent with the new EU data protection regulation, Regulation (EU) 2016\/679. Two current legislative initiatives by my Department are intended to support eHealth amongst other issues.  The Health Identifiers Act, 2014 is providing a legal basis for a robust system of identifiers in the health sector and the Health Information and Patient Safety Bill, currently being drafted, includes provisions to support interoperability.  My Department is currently examining the appropriate information framework that will provide the optimum environment to support eHealth and the deployment of electronic health records in the future. The health care delivery system straddles both the public and private domains and requires a robust information governance environment to ensure the right information about the right patient is available securely, in the right place and at the right time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200061#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Expenditure","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200061#WRB01650"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[20949\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200061#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the way he proposes to cut the costs of medication to the State and to the general public.","asker":"1222","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":521,"qnumall":"[20785\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200061#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the measures being taken to reduce the cost of drugs for patients here; and to estimate the amount he believes can be saved by the Health Service Executive in 2016 through reduced drug prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":75,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 521 together.<\/p>  <p>The Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to examine opportunities for leveraging purchasing power either through national or European initiatives and for making greater use of effective but less costly medicines.

These reviews involve an examination of key governance processes and documents, including obtaining confirmation that internal financial controls and formal written financial procedures are in place in these organisations. Six of these reviews are currently underway.  The outcomes of the reviews will both inform the HSE&rsquo;s relationship with the agency concerned and any further enhancement of the HSE&rsquo;s overall governance framework.<\/p><p>The HSE provides funding in return for services to some 40 agencies under Section 38 of the Health Act.  The HSE also provides funding to a much wider group of generally smaller agencies under Section 39.  In relation to Section 38 there are some forty agencies delivering services ranging in size from the Daughters of Charity with an annual budget of just over &euro;2 million to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital with a budget of almost &euro;357 million.  Section 38 agencies have played a very important role in the development of our health and social care services.  Some agencies delivering services under Section 38 arrangements are amongst the very best we have in terms of the quality of care provided and the systems of governance employed.  However, there is a requirement for all such agencies to continually review their governance processes in order to ensure these are sufficiently robust.  <\/p><p>The HSE has taken significant steps to enhance its system for performance oversight of Section 38 agencies.<\/p><p>The HSE has a formal national governance framework which governs grant funding provided to agencies under section 38 of the Health Act 2004.

A person who contravenes these Regulations is guilty of an offence.   Medicines which have a high potential to be misused are controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation.

This governance framework seeks to ensure the standard, consistent application of good governance principles which are robust and effective to ensure that both the HSE and the grant-funded agency meet their respective obligations. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE requires that all grant aided non-statutory agencies submit their annual audited accounts to the HSE.  As part of its annual audit plans, the Internal Audit Division of the HSE conducts audits of a number of agencies each year, several audits are currently in progress.  Such audits generally focus on the systems of internal controls operated by the funded agencies, and compliance with the HSE Service Level Agreement (SLA).  The scope is distinct from the statutory annual audit of accounts carried out by the external auditors of the agencies.  In addition, a number of Internal Audits have been conducted into the HSE&rsquo;s own management processes and controls over the funding and monitoring of services provided by non-statutory agencies.<\/p>  <p>  An Annual Compliance Statement (ACS) process is in place whereby the Board Chairs of each Section 38 agency are required to certify on an annual basis that they are compliant with the necessary governance requirements or in cases where they are not compliant, they are obliged to explain why that is the case.  In addition, and in order to provide external\u00a0assurances to the HSE, it was decided that a review of governance at Board and Executive level in all Section 38 Providers, to be conducted by external consultants, would be undertaken.  The purpose of these reviews is to establish the level\/standard of governance in place in these organisations and to confirm independently that the governance practices and procedures accord with those set out in their respective Annual Compliance Statements. <\/p>  <p>  These reviews involve an examination of key governance processes and documents, including obtaining confirmation that there are internal financial controls and that formal written financial procedures are in place in these organisations.

In announcing the Programme, the Government recognised the importance of addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  However, as indicated in previous responses to parliamentary questions, the pace of the relocation programme in Ireland and across the European Union has been hampered by significant operational delays and technical issues due to the sheer numbers involved and other logistical difficulties that have arisen at the 'hotspot' locations in Italy and Greece.  <\/p>  <p>  A team of officials from my Department, including the Director of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, travelled to Greece last month to meet with Irish embassy officials and relevant Greek authorities both to signal Ireland's tangible willingness to assist and to identify ways of addressing the obstacles that have arisen.

As part of its multi-disciplinary assessment of the needs of separated children in its care, the possibility of family reunification is also examined. <\/p>  <p>  I continue to work proactively with my colleagues in Europe to ensure that Ireland and the European Union responds comprehensively to all aspects of the ongoing migration and refugee crisis.

The IASIO report that even for some individuals in active and consistent addiction, criminal justice interventions such as imprisonment can provide periods of stability that allow the TEO  and other services to provide a meaningful intervention for that person.

In cases where the governing document submitted with an application for registration is not acceptable, I understand that the Regulator will assist the applicant organisation with re-drafting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200070#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Strength","counter":497,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200070#WRL01100"},{"type":"question","counter":498,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[21274\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200070#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of appointed detectives in each Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na division at the present time and for the same date in each of the years 2011 to 2015, in tabular form.","asker":"1296","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":499,"content":"<p>The Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and Districts.

In that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a point highlighted by the Garda Inspectorate in their third report entitled &quot;Policing in Ireland - Looking Forward&quot; in which they stated that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation for it in Ireland.<\/p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that community policing is the embodiment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, providing a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations.  It commits the Government to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">to<\/font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000 as well as doubling the Garda Reserve and increasing the number of civilian staff so as to free-up Garda&iacute; for front-line policing.

I welcome in particular the proposal to establish local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute;  from across a range of areas to work with the community to prevent and detect crime.  The CPTs will take proactive measures to prevent crime from happening in the area. This will entail a combination of crime prevention advice, targeting and disrupting criminals through operations and patrols, and where possible diverting people from committing crime.  I also welcome the proposal to establish Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders.  The implementation of these initiatives has started and will be rolled out nationwide. <\/p><p><b>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Community Garda&iacute;  31 May 2011 &ndash; 2016<\/b><table><tr><th>DIVISION<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015<\/th><th>2016<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>DMR SOUTH CENTRAL<\/td><td>94<\/td><td>84<\/td><td>47<\/td><td>60<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>37<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR SOUTHERN<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>59<\/td><td>54<\/td><td>50<\/td><td>50<\/td><td>52<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR NORTHERN<\/td><td>84<\/td><td>85<\/td><td>68<\/td><td>67<\/td><td>64<\/td><td>57<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR WEST<\/td><td>92<\/td><td>81<\/td><td>71<\/td><td>65<\/td><td>68<\/td><td>62<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR NORTH CENTRAL<\/td><td>148<\/td><td>143<\/td><td>138<\/td><td>150<\/td><td>135<\/td><td>112<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DMR EAST<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>30<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WICKLOW<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LOUTH<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>21<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>17<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MEATH<\/td><td>17<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>11<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LEIX\/OFFALY<\/td><td>19<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILDARE<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WEXFORD<\/td><td>24<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>WATERFORD<\/td><td>64<\/td><td>53<\/td><td>49<\/td><td>51<\/td><td>46<\/td><td>44<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KILKENNY\/CARLOW<\/td><td>114<\/td><td>107<\/td><td>102<\/td><td>98<\/td><td>94<\/td><td>89<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY<\/td><td>103<\/td><td>101<\/td><td>92<\/td><td>84<\/td><td>79<\/td><td>76<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CORK CITY<\/td><td>32<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>24<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CORK NORTH<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CORK WEST<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>KERRY<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>LIMERICK<\/td><td>78<\/td><td>68<\/td><td>62<\/td><td>60<\/td><td>56<\/td><td>53<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CLARE<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>GALWAY<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>18<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON\/LONGFORD<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MAYO<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>20<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>SLIGO\/LEITRIM<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>DONEGAL<\/td><td>39<\/td><td>27<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>22<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CAVAN\/MONAGHAN<\/td><td>10<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>8<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>TOTAL:<\/td><td>1,115<\/td><td>1,052<\/td><td>932<\/td><td>905<\/td><td>832<\/td><td>785<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200070#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":503,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200070#WRL01700"},{"type":"question","counter":504,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[21277\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200070#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the exact legal relationship that exists with respect to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assisting in the execution of receivership or repossession orders; if he deems it appropriate that garda&iacute; are involved in assisting recouping debts owed to banking or other financial institutions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":505,"content":"<p>As the Deputies are aware, I have no role in relation to executing court orders.

Of this sum, Revenue's Offshore Assets Group, whose remit is to investigate the use of offshore accounts to evade or avoid tax, accounts for &euro;1,022m of that sum.\u00a0 The Group has, in the course of its work, made extensive use of the suite of powers available to Revenue. Use was made, in particular, of information on offshore transactions obtained from financial institutions on foot of orders granted by the High Court pursuant to section 908 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. <\/p>  <p>  While historically, Revenue's efforts in this space were set against a backdrop of bank secrecy and lack of exchange of information between tax administrations, the international climate over the past decade has changed and continues to change fundamentally. Legislation has been enacted enabling a number of key initiatives for the sharing of information with overseas tax administrations. These include the OECD's Common Reporting Standard, involving over 100 jurisdictions; the EU's Directives on Administrative Cooperation; and the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) initiative.<\/p>  <p>  Most recently, revelations in early April 2016 by way of a set of leaked documents to the media from the files of the Panamanian-based law firm Mossack Fonseca have provided an unprecedented amount of information which has again focussed worldwide debate on offshore structures and how countries are going to respond. In that regard, Revenue is actively engaging with the OECD Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Collaboration (JITSIC) Network to agree concrete actions that tax administrations can take in response to this information. <\/p>  <p>  While effective cooperation between countries -\u00a0as reflected in the offshore financial information that the various Automatic Exchange of Information agreements will provide -\u00a0is essential in tackling this worldwide problem, it is both necessary and desirable that domestic legislation governing Revenue powers is kept under constant review to ensure that\u00a0it continues to be fit for purpose. In that regard, any recommendations from Revenue for increased powers are carefully considered.\u00a0 As indicated in my response to Parliamentary Question 10831\/16 of 18 May 2016 discussions are ongoing between my officials and those in Revenue in relation to Revenue powers in the context of the next Finance Bill. <\/p>  <p>  I have also indicated to the Chairman of Revenue that I am committed to supporting any new legislative changes that he feels are needed to tackle tax evasion using offshore structures or accounts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200072#WRN01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fiscal Compact Treaty","counter":588,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200072#WRN01050"},{"type":"question","counter":589,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[21244\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200072#WRN01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is reviewing the impact of the fiscal compact rules which curtail and delimit necessary capital investments and which have serious consequences in the context of the fall-out of the British decision to exit the European Union; if he will ensure that such rules are amended in the context of this new scenario; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":590,"content":"<p>The budgetary and debt rules contained in the Fiscal Compact arise from the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union. These fiscal rules, which are aligned with the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), are intended to promote budgetary discipline and were given domestic legal effect through the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 following the passage of a constitutional referendum in May 2012 in which the Irish people supported accession to the Treaty. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, this Treaty was agreed following complex negotiations and it has been ratified by 26 countries in accordance with their own constitutional requirements. Accordingly, any attempt to renegotiate the Treaty would be very difficult. As referred to above, the fiscal rules in the Treaty are aligned with the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), which has direct application through a number of EU regulations. Changes to these regulations would have to follow the normal EU approach starting with a proposal from the Commission before consideration by Member States and the European Parliament. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the SGP fiscal rules provide for certain flexibilities particularly with a view\u00a0 to encouraging public investment.\u00a0\u00a0Specifically the rules allow for certain leniency with regard to the pace of required structural\u00a0 budgetary adjustment if spending on\u00a0 capital investment can be shown to qualify for either the investment clause\u00a0 or the structural reform clause. Both of these provisions are subject to strict conditions which Ireland has not\u00a0been eligible to utilise to date but, this is kept under review.\u00a0 In addition, in the context of the expenditure benchmark for instance,\u00a0to avoid penalising Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) expenditure increases, such investment is averaged over a four year period under the expenditure benchmark.\u00a0 This means that an increase in GFCF only uses one quarter of the fiscal space that an equivalent current expenditure increase would use in the first year. This treatment contributed to the additional &euro;5.1 billion in cumulative capital expenditure over the 2017   2021 period set out in the recently published Summer Economic Statement. <\/p>  <p>  While it is difficult to secure changes to the rules, I must point out that Ireland is constantly exploring how permitted flexibility can be optimised\u00a0and seeking to improve the implementation of the SGP, specifically on how the Commission implements the fiscal rules. In light of this, a number of proposals from Ireland to improve the application of the fiscal rules have been successfully adopted by the Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Any decision in the future to explore the possibility of using these flexibilities will require a quantitative demonstration of the economic rationale for such a case.\u00a0\u00a0Ultimately the decision to grant flexibility and the determination of eligibility would however be made by the European Commission.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In the short-term, the recent British decision to exit the European Union is not expected to have a significant impact on our budgetary plans for the forthcoming year.

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.<\/p>  <p>  The estimated cost of reversing the decision to withdraw qualification allowances from post-1 February 2012 entrant teachers is approximately &euro;16 million per annum.

With regard to the institute of technology sector, the Strategy recommended significant reforms to position the sector to meet national strategic objectives.  In particular, the Strategy recommended consolidation within the sector and a pathway of evolution for those consolidated institutes of technology, to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria and to apply to become technological universities.<\/p><p>Consortiums who have applied:<\/p><p>As part of the implementation of the Strategy, the Higher Education Authority in 2012 published a four-stage process and criteria for applicant groups of institutes of technology wishing to apply to become technological universities.<\/p><p>The designation process consists of four stages as follows &ndash;<\/p><p>- an expression of interest,<\/p><p>- the preparation of a plan to meet the criteria,<\/p><p>- an evaluation of the plan, and<\/p><p>- an application for designation.<\/p><p>There are currently four consortia engaged with the process to become designated as TUs.

There was strong engagement in the process by both parties. This facilitation process has been an important building block in terms of building trust between the parties and in developing a strong working relationship between the Presidents and Chairs of both institutions. As part of this process, the Presidents of the two institutions, have jointly developed an initial work-plan to support the development of a joint TU proposal.<\/p><p>Future Funding for landscape re-configuration in the Higher Education sector:<\/p><p>It is recognised that these changes to the landscape of Irish higher education carry some up-front additional costs and the Higher Education Authority (HEA) has provided for a fund to support HEIs with these costs.  In terms of additional financial support, having regard to the benefits that will arise for the institutions, students and the higher education system more generally, the HEA has provided funding in 2013, 2014 and 2015 to provide some support to institutions involved in the TU process, the details of which are set out for each consortium below.<\/p><p>In relation to 2016, the HEA have ring-fenced a level of funding to support costs arising from the continuation of landscape reform projects as part of the implementation of the National Strategy for Higher Education.

The other &euro;11.6m is in respect of the general 2% annual ESF pre-financing received for 2016 and will be reimbursed as a payment application under the ESF will not be made in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Work on the designation of the relevant ESF authorities, including the provision of a national computerised accounting and information system for EU funds to meet the 2014-2020 functionality requirements is continuing.  However, it should be noted that the reimbursement of this pre-financing will not result in any loss of EU monies to the Exchequer, as the full allocations will still be available for drawdown and it is expected that the funding will be fully drawn down during the programming period. Furthermore, as the activities concerned are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer there is no resulting reduction or delay in the funding available to those activities.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), my Department has successfully applied for co-financing support under the 2014-20 funding round for 3 programmes, in respect of which the Commission has forwarded financial contributions of &euro;4.4m. The Andersen Ireland EGF programme ended in May and my Department will submit a final report and expenditure statement to the European Commission by mid-November.  The Lufthansa Technik Airmotive Ireland EGF programme ends in September while the PWA International EGF programme runs to next June. Where the actual expenditure on a programme falls short of the programme allocation, the co-financing received is reimbursed proportionally. It is difficult to accurately forecast final expenditure on EGF programmes as public beneficiary bodies generally fund the cost of EGF measures from national budgets and subsequently submit expenditure declarations\/claims during and more often following completion of the programmes.  However, the average expenditure across the 7 previous Irish EGF programmes was 60% of the programme allocations.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p><p>By way of clarification the SCPA was created in 2001 as a temporary measure to  provide service to schools (assessment only) in advance of full provision of NEPS personnel and where a NEPS psychologist was not available to provide the full service.  Schools availing of SCPA contracted individual assessment from a panel of private practitioners organised and paid for by NEPS.<\/p><p>Historically service was provided on an either\/or basis (i.e. either NEPS assigned Psychologist or SCPA).<\/p><p>Schools catered for, at this stage, by allowing access to the SCPA were advised of the limit of such access which was set at 2% of school enrolment (i.e. 1 assessment per 50 pupils enrolled).<\/p><p>This limit was set, the Deputy will understand, to allow management by NEPS of the overall process and it was open to school to raise the necessity of additional assessments with their local NEPS office where urgent need dictated.<\/p><p>From the start of the 2013\/14 academic year and based on a staffing complement of 173 w.t.e., NEPS assigned a psychologist to all mainstream schools in order to provide the full advisory &amp;amp; support service.  This has meant that NEPS psychologists have taken on additional schools and pupil numbers which is supported by the use of SCPA where the psychologist deems appropriate.<\/p><p>I can inform the Deputy that the NEPS model of service, in line with best international practice for educational psychology services, is a needs-based as opposed to a diagnosis-led model. The needs of children and adolescents in schools present on a continuum from mild to severe and transient to enduring. The NEPS model of service is a tiered one that focuses on addressing this <\/p><p>continuum of need.  At one level, NEPS psychologists seeks to build the capacity of schools (at a systemic level) to support all pupils on this continuum of need, by promoting the use of universal preventative and early intervention approaches.  At another level NEPS psychologists consult with teachers to build their capacity to identify the emerging need of some pupils <\/p><p>and put in place appropriate, workable interventions to address those needs.<\/p><p>At a final level, NEPS psychologists work directly with pupils with greatest need, and through assessment, consultation and review inform individualised interventions to address those needs.  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.<\/p><p>NEPS psychologists conduct planning meetings with schools, at least annually, whereby work within the school is structured and prioritised by means of a dynamic collaborative process of planning and review. Work agreed extends not only to assessment bur also to consultation, advice, on-going complex casework and training.<\/p><p>There are, of course, physical limits to the amount of time which the NEPS psychologist provides to their assigned schools in any given year but the NEPS model of service is oriented at structuring responses to the various levels of need presenting and at supporting appropriate individualised intervention by all players with the highest level of input directed at those with the greatest need.<\/p><p>My Department, over the course of recent economic difficulties, has not only maintained psychologist staffing levels within NEPS, but has increased them by some 10% since late 2008, to 165 whole time equivalent psychologists currently employed. While the numbers of psychologists have steadily increased over the past ten years despite expenditure constraints, the numbers of pupils enrolled in school has also grown rapidly.  Currently processes are in train to continue to raise this number to some 173 whole-time equivalents.<\/p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits that we will invest additional resources in the National Educational Psychological Service to ensure earlier intervention and access for young children and teenagers and to offer immediate support to schools in cases of critical incidents.  The Programme commits to bring the total number of NEPS psychologists to 238 from <\/p><p>the current sanctioned limit of 173.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200073#WRO03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Psychological Assessments","counter":663,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200074#WRP00150"},{"type":"question","counter":664,"qnumday":236,"qnumall":"[20631\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200074#WRP00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the average number of educational assessments carried out by the National Educational Psychology Service and the scheme for the commissioning of private psychological assessments, by school, for each of the years 2006 to 2016 to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The State Claims Agency (SCA), who manage such cases on behalf of the State, was mandated to offer out of court settlements in current and future litigation where the circumstances of the cases come within the terms of the European Court judgment and are not statute barred.  In this regard, the SCA has made settlement offers which have been accepted in 6 cases.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently, in July 2015, the Government approved proposals to offer ex-gratia payments up to a maximum of &euro;84,000 to those who initiated legal proceedings in cases of school child sexual abuse against the State but who subsequently discontinued their claims against the State where, similarly, the circumstances of the claims come within the terms of the ECtHR judgment and where the claims were not statute barred prior to the proceedings being discontinued.<\/p>  <p>  It was decided that such payments would be offered to those persons whose cases were not statute barred prior to their proceedings being discontinued and where the person can demonstrate that their circumstances involved sexual abuse of a school child by a primary or post-primary school employee in respect of whom there was a prior complaint of sexual abuse to a school authority (including an authority of a school in which the employee had previously worked) prior to the issue of the Department of Education guidelines on Child Protection to primary and post-primary schools in 1991 and 1992 respectively.<\/p>  <p>  As noted in the Department's press release of 28th July, 2015 persons who believe that their cases come within the criteria can contact the SCA and provide supporting evidence.  It is not possible to assess at this stage how many cases in this category will satisfy these criteria.  Where there is a disagreement between the SCA and the individual as to whether their circumstances come within the terms of the ECtHR judgment, provision will be made for the application to be reviewed by an independent assessor.  In offering these settlements, the State will not be covering the liabilities of the perpetrators, school managers or patrons or other co-defendants.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of implementing the ECtHR judgement in the O'Keeffe case, Ireland is obliged to file bi-annual action plans with the Council of Europe outlining the steps being taken to implement the ECtHR judgment - these action plans are in the public domain and can be accessed on the Council of Europe's website.  The next (the 5th) Action Plan is due to be submitted on 28th July 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The submissions made by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Child Law Clinic of University College Cork to the Council of Europe were made under Rule 9 (2) of the Rules of the Committee of Ministers for the supervision of the execution of judgments and of the terms of friendly settlements.  Rule 9 (2) states that 'The Committee of Ministers shall be entitled to consider any communication from non-governmental organisations, as well as national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights, with regard to the execution of judgments under Article 46, paragraph 2, of the Convention.

ASTI's decision to withdraw from these hours means that the union has repudiated the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  In opting to withdraw from the LRA, ASTI members are also opting to forego a series of benefits and protections, as communicated by my Department previously.

The EU VAT Directive does not make provision for a reduction in the VAT rate to e-books.  Any changes to VAT rates outside of what is currently permitted by the EU VAT Directive must be negotiated at EU technical working groups and ultimately agreed by the EU Council of Finance Ministers.  The EU Commission recently published an Action Plan on the future of VAT \"Towards a single EU VAT Area - Time to decide\", which sets out the Commission's pathway for modernising the VAT system and contains a proposal in 2016 to remove VAT obstacles to cross-border e-commerce including e-publications and in 2017 there is a proposal to look at VAT rate policy across the EU.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan's proposals may offer Member States more flexibility in the future in determining VAT rates applicable to goods and services.

The specific YEI funding allocation for Ireland of &euro;68m is matched by equal amounts from our ESF allocation and from the Exchequer, giving an overall allocation of &euro;204m. <\/p><p>The rules governing the ESF provide for initial pre-financing of EU support at 1% (or 1.5% for Member States under financial assistance in 2014 and 2015) of the full programme support, payable for each year from 2014 to 2016, together with annual pre-financing of 2% was payable in 2016.  However, in order to mobilise faster YEI actions on the ground, the initial pre-financing of the YEI EU support was exceptionally increased to 30% in 2015.  Accordingly Ireland has received &euro;23.5m YEI pre-financing to date.<\/p><p>The Regulations providing for the exceptional increase specified that where a Member State did not submit an interim payment application by 23 May 2016 for at least 50% of the additional pre-financing amount, that the Member State must reimburse the Commission the total YEI pre-financing contribution.  The ESF regulations provide that annual prefinancing for any year in which an interim payment application is not made in that year must also be reimbursed.<\/p><p>As work on the designation of the relevant ESF authorities, including the provision of a national computerised accounting and information system for EU funds to meet the 2014-2020 functionality requirements, is continuing, Ireland did not comply with the requirement to submit an interim YEI payment application by the due date.  In accordance with the relevant Regulations, the &euro;19.8m additional pre-financing received and currently held in a Suspense Account, is due to be reimbursed to the Commission.  My Department is liaising with the Commission in this regard.  Similarly, as it is not intended that there will be a YEI application made this year, the annual prefinancing for 2016 will be reimbursed also, as set out in the following .<\/p><p>However, it should be noted that the reimbursement of these amounts will not result in any loss of EU monies to the Exchequer, as the full YEI allocation of &euro;68m to Ireland will still be available for drawdown before year-end 2018, and it is expected that this funding will be fully drawn down.  Furthermore, as the activities concerned are fully funded up-front by the Exchequer there is no resulting reduction or delay in the funding available to those activities.<\/p><p>Table YEI Pre-financing Position<table><tr><th>Category of Funding <\/th><th>Amount Received<\/th><th>Amount to be reimbursed <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2014&ndash;2016 Initial Pre-financing <\/td><td>&euro;2,385,089.67<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Additional Pre-financing<\/td><td>&euro;19,762,171.51<\/td><td>&euro;19,762,171.51<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016 Annual Pre-financing<\/td><td>&euro;1,362.908.38<\/td><td>&euro;1,362.908.38<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200075#WRQ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":743,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200076#WRR00200"},{"type":"question","counter":744,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[20882\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200076#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of an application for capital funding for additional accommodation for a school (details supplied); when he will make a decision on the application for funding for additional accommodation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":745,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department has recently conveyed grant approval to the school authority, in question, for the provision of additional classroom accommodation including universal access toilet facilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200076#WRR00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Autism Support Services","counter":746,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200076#WRR00500"},{"type":"question","counter":747,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[20888\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200076#WRR00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if there is no legislative requirement on schools to provide special classes for children with autism spectrum disorder; his plans to remedy this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":748,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that this Government is committed to ensuring that all children with Special Educational Needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.<\/p><p>Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of Special Needs Assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.<\/p><p>There are approximately 14,000 students with ASD in the school system.<\/p><p>- 63% are educated in mainstream classes<\/p><p>- 23% are educated in special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools; and<\/p><p>- 14% are educated in special schools<\/p><p>In respect of children with ASD who cannot be accommodated in mainstream education, they may be enrolled in special classes or special schools where more intensive and supportive interventions are provided.<\/p><p>The Deputy will also be aware that it is the role of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) to make appropriate arrangements to establish special classes in schools in communities where the need for such classes has been identified.<\/p><p>Progress in developing this network has been significant and in addition to the special school placements there are currently over 1,000 special classes throughout the country at primary and post primary level of which 765 are for children with Autism.

In discussions prior to the adoption of the 2007 Tyre Regulations, it was made clear that this was the last opportunity for the tyre industry to embrace environmental compliance and take responsibility for the waste it produces.  If the required improvement did not happen, it was made clear to the tyre industry that the system would be reviewed and replaced with a full Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) model.  As part of a wider review of producer responsibility arrangements completed in 2014, the structural and environmental effectiveness of all aspects of the current system for managing waste tyres was assessed.  The results of this examination were stark.  The report, published for consultation in November 2013 and in final form in April 2014, found:<\/p><p>- a non-compliance rate with the Tyre Regulations of 46%,<\/p><p>- a lack of consistent and accurate data,<\/p><p>- that the current system was not tracking data flows well, and<\/p><p>- between 25% and 50% of waste tyres were not accounted for, with widespread illegal dumping.<\/p><p>Following extensive discussions with the tyre industry through the establishment of a Tyres Working Group, the then Minister announced the decision to establish a full PRI scheme for Tyres and Waste Tyres in Ireland on 3 0 January 2015.

The model that is being introduced will formalise a charge that tyre retailers already apply, but which does not currently go towards the cost of managing the waste in all cases, as it is supposed to.  It is absolutely right and fair to provide a system that ensures that the existing levy is properly directed in the future, so that the consumer does not pay twice - once at the point of purchase and again, when the taxpayer has to meet costs incurred by local authorities for the clean-up of illegally dumped tyres.<\/p><p>My Department is in the process of drafting the regulations to underpin the new PRI scheme.

Ministerial consent was given to a budget of &euro;614m including VAT for this purpose.  I understand from Irish Water that the expected capital expenditure by August 2016 will amount to &euro;465m, which will deliver circa 870,000-880,000 meter installations.  As such, savings of about &euro;148m will accrue on the capital metering programme.

Within this context, Irish Water has made initial proposals to my Department on the potential use of savings on the domestic metering programme to include work on priority non-domestic meters upgrades and the urgent provision of strategic water and wastewater infrastructure to enable priority development lands to be serviced where housing provision can most effectively contribute to resolving the current housing deficit.  This re-orientation of funding requires Ministerial consent and regulatory approval from the Commission on Energy Regulation, processes for which have commenced. <\/p><p>Future phases of the metering of domestic premises will be prioritised along with other investment needs based on cost benefit assessment and policy considerations relating to the future decisions on billing and charging.

Reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance apply to jobseekers under 26 years of age.<\/p>  <p>  This is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.  To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If a young jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.<\/p>  <p>  Youth unemployment rose rapidly in the recession to over 30% in 2012.  According to the Quarterly National Household Survey for Quarter 1 2016, youth unemployment continues to fall in line with the overall recovery and now stands at 16.9%. <\/p>  <p>  The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that all young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed.  The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs, through earlier and enhanced engagement processes.<\/p>  <p>   Reserved places on a number of programmes and youth-oriented variants of existing schemes have also been rolled out.  Overall, young people took up just over 19,000 Youth Guarantee-related programme places in 2015.  These numbers exclude an estimated 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.<\/p>  <p>  Other EU and OECD countries adopt a similar targeted approach in terms of young jobseekers receiving a reduced social welfare payment.  Unless every effort is made to encourage and support our young people to engage in education and training there is a risk that they may drift into welfare dependency.  This needs to be avoided at all costs as welfare dependency will have severe long term consequences for those affected and for the economy as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200080#WRV03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Back to Education Allowance","counter":977,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200080#WRV03350"},{"type":"question","counter":978,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[21037\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200080#WRV03400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the masters degree courses covered under the back to education allowance scheme; and if the rules on this scheme changed in the past year.","asker":"1250","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":979,"content":"<p>The objective of the back to education allowance scheme (BTEA) is to assist those who are distant from the labour market to acquire the necessary education to improve their chances of becoming independent of the social welfare system.

Supports in relation to housing and the provision of financial supports, including the rent supplement scheme currently supporting some 54,000 recipients at a cost of &euro;267 million in 2016, are a key priority as evidenced by the early implementation of this Government commitment. <\/p>  <p>  The rent supplement scheme is subject to satisfying certain eligibility criteria and conditions as set out in legislation.  I can confirm that guidance has recently issued to officers regarding the implementation of the increased rent limits.  In general, rent supplement should not be paid where the rent to be supported is above the relevant and appropriate maximum limit. However, in view of the ongoing difficulties in the rented market, the Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach where rents may exceed the maximum limits.  This ensures that people at risk of homelessness through the loss of their tenancy continue to be supported under the rent supplement scheme. <\/p>  <p>  Departmental Staff have also been advised that in keeping with the concerns over the general lack of alternative rentable housing stock, whereby a person seeks an increase on their existing rent supplement payment due to a previously undeclared top up payment, the additional top up payment may be considered referencing the new limits.  If the additional top up brings the overall claim higher that the appropriate revised rent limit, staff are directed to previous guidance to prevent tenancy loss where there are reasonable grounds to do so.  Each case will be considered on an individual basis with the primary focus on the accommodation needs of the person or family.  <\/p>  <p>   The increased rent limits, combined with the continued flexible approach provided by my Department will provide for increased security for persons seeking support under this scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  I refer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question regarding the payment of rent supplement to residents in Parnell Estate.  The legislation governing rent supplement provides that the scheme may not be payable where the person beneficially entitled to the rent under the tenancy is a housing authority.  Officials in my Department are engaging with those in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government regarding this matter so that an appropriate resolution is found. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200082#WRX02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":1046,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200082#WRX02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1047,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[20658\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200082#WRX02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of extending social protection entitlements to self-employed persons; if there is a timeframe on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1048,"content":"<p>Providing a supportive environment for enterprise and employment is fundamental to achieving the partnerships aim of job creation.<\/p>  <p>  In particular, the role of entrepreneurs and the self-employed will be central to this ambition.  The new programme agreed with our partners in Government contains a commitment to introduce an improved PRSI scheme for the self-employed.  In addition, we will also ensure that the Earned Income Tax Credit available to the self-employed will match that available to employees, over a number of budgets.  This process commenced in Budget 2016 with the introduction of a &euro;550 tax credit for the self-employed.<\/p>  <p>  I want to ensure that appropriate sustainable supports are available to the self-employed in the event of certain contingencies arising.

The Group found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  In this regard the Group recommended that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points, payable on a compulsory basis only. <\/p>  <p>  Funding the extension of social insurance coverage for the self-employed will also have to take account of the most recent Actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund published in 2012.

This compares very favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.

These include that the person must be aged 66 or over and have at least 520 paid contributions, i.e., a minimum of 10 years.  Such PRSI contributions are paid by workers and their employers into the Social Insurance Fund, which funds the State pension (contributory) and other benefits, along with a subvention from the Exchequer when necessary.  Provided a person satisfies all the relevant conditions, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), the minimum personal rate of which is &euro;93.20, and the maximum personal rate of which is &euro;233.30. <\/p>  <p>  There is no fixed amount of paid and\/or credited contributions required which will qualify a person for a full-rate State pension (contributory).  The total amount of contributions a person will require also depends upon the duration over which they made these contributions, as both of these figures are used to calculate a person&rsquo;s &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions, upon which their rate of entitlement is based.  Since the contributory pension was introduced in 1961, the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; contributions test has been used in calculating the level of pension entitlement, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (from their entry into insurable employment up to the year prior to their reaching State pension age). <\/p>  <p>  The State assists those with caring roles to qualify for a State pension (contributory).  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  Given the valuable nature of the State pension (contributory), those who qualify under the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme still need to fulfil the eligibility requirements for that scheme, and have at least 520 paid contributions over the course of their working lives. <\/p>  <p>  I have no plans to expand the eligibility of the State pension (contributory) to include people who have no paid PRSI contributions.  However, the Deputy should note that where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200083#WRY04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1112,"content":"<p>Question No. 389 answered with Question No. 373.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Household Benefits Scheme","counter":1113,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200083#WRY04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1114,"qnumday":390,"qnumall":"[20843\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200083#WRY04700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the cost to the Exchequer of reinstating the household benefits package, including the telephone allowance, to all recipients of carer's allowance and carer's benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1115,"content":"<p><b><\/b>The household benefits package (HHB) comprises the electricity or gas allowance, and the free television licence.

There may be instances whereby a personal advisor recommends the enhancement of client&rsquo;s qualifications e.g. to learn new skills in a work area that is rapidly changing such as IT development.<\/p>  <p>  In general, and JobPath is not an exception, job-seekers are not allowed to participate in two employment activation supports at the same time.  Given the need to manage the allocation of places effectively, my Department does not facilitate or encourage jobseekers to leave one scheme early in order to take up a place on another scheme. Participation in other schemes remains an option once a person completes their JobPath engagement.<\/p>  <p>  JobPath is a payment by results model and all initial costs are borne by the companies.  JobPath is so structured that the companies will not be able to fully recover their costs until they place sufficient numbers of jobseekers into sustainable jobs.  It is not intended to publish the individual payments to the JobPath companies as these are commercially sensitive and to do so would place the State at a disadvantage both in terms of the contracts now in place and any future procurement that may be undertaken.<\/p>  <p>  The JobPath contracts provide that a person should not have to travel more than 60 minutes in normal circumstances to attend an appointment.  Where a person has transport difficulties the JobPath company can assist the person with travel arrangements including the reimbursement of reasonable travel costs. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200084#WRZ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Labour Activation Projects","counter":1129,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200084#WRZ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1130,"qnumday":395,"qnumall":"[20895\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200084#WRZ01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of labour activation participants in the Cork South Central constituency in each of the years 2013 to 2016 to date by scheme in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1287","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1131,"content":"<p>Information relating to a claimant&rsquo;s address is not currently coded to the geographical location of the address.

If a young jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.<\/p>  <p>  The review of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rates for young persons under 26 years of age will examine the effectiveness of the reduced rates in encouraging young jobseekers to avail of education, training, employment programmes and opportunities.  As part of a wider effort to encourage and promote research based on my Department&rsquo;s administrative data, we have recently provided data on all JA claims since 2007 for persons aged under 28 years to researchers from the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.  They intend to look specifically at the impact of changes in rates on the duration of young people&rsquo;s claims, and on the subsequent employment experience of young people after exiting from unemployment.  It is hoped that their analysis will have preliminary results before the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring my Department identifies effective measures to incentivise and support young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  The best way to do this is through engagement processes and by incentivising them to avail of educational and training opportunities, thereby enhancing their employment prospects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200085#WRAA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Supplementary Welfare Allowance","counter":1167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200085#WRAA00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1168,"qnumday":409,"qnumall":"[21271\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200085#WRAA00900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reasons for the considerable drop in payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, formerly the community welfare officers budget; and if there has been a change in policy to initiate the drop in payments.","asker":"1362","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1169,"content":"<p>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is considered as the &quot;<i>safety net<\/i>&quot; within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.<\/p><p>SWA can consist of a basic primary weekly payment and\/or a weekly\/monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses a person may not be able to meet, including rent, travel and heat.  In addition, under the SWA scheme, my Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  An Urgent Needs Payment (UNP) is a once-off payment made to persons who would not normally qualify for SWA but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or an alternative is not available at that time.  I understand that the focus of the Deputy&rsquo;s question is the drop in payments under the ENP scheme since 2008.<\/p><p>The Government has provided &euro;30.3 million for the ENP and UNP schemes in 2016. In line with all SWA schemes, the overall reduction in the Live Register and general improvement in the economy has reduced recourse to the ENP scheme.  Expenditure on the ENP\/UNP schemes decreased from a peak of &euro;82 million in 2008 to &euro;30 million in 2014, with a provisional outturn of &euro;31m in 2015.  Year to date expenditure in 2016 would suggest an outturn in line with the previous 2 years suggesting that expenditure under the scheme is stabilising at some &euro;30 million.<\/p><p>In terms of Departmental policy, in 2012 a working group made up of staff from the Community Welfare Service reviewed the existing ENP guidelines with a view to, in so far as possible, achieve standardisation and consistency of treatment of applications across the country.  This review has been used as a basis for revised guidelines that issued to staff in 2012 and 2013.  These guidelines provide maximum recommended amounts for specific items such as white goods, furniture and prams.  The Department reviewed these guidelines in 2015 and no changes were provided to the recommended amounts.<\/p><p>In 2012, guidance issued to staff in relation to payment of ENPs in respect of the &ldquo;kit out&rdquo; of accommodation provided by a housing authority, to limit payments to cases where the accommodation is either built or purchased by the local authority.  These provisions also apply to accommodation provided by voluntary housing bodies.<\/p><p>These guidelines assist Departmental staff administering the scheme and do not affect the discretion available to officers in issuing an ENP to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise.<\/p><p>While expenditure under the scheme has reduced in recent years, the scheme is demand led and continues to provide assistance to those with exceptional needs taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200085#WRAA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme Eligibility","counter":1170,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200085#WRAA01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1171,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[21336\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200085#WRAA01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"why a person (details supplied) has had a mortgage interest supplement ceased as of March 2016 when the payment is not being discontinued until 1 January 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1172,"content":"<p>Recently a review of the mortgage interest supplement (MIS) of the person concerned was undertaken and it was ascertained that the interest portion of the mortgage repayment was &euro;6.32 per month or &euro;1.45 per week.<\/p><p>Under the scheme provisions only the interest portion of the monthly mortgage repayment can be considered for MIS and as applicants are liable for the first &euro;32.00 per week of any interest payable, the person concerned has no continuing entitlement to MIS.<\/p><p>The person concerned was informed of their right to appeal this decision to the Social Welfare Appeal&rsquo;s office and is currently engaged in that process.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200085#WRAA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":1173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200085#WRAA01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1174,"qnumday":411,"qnumall":"[21373\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200085#WRAA01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"why a person (details supplied) has not been registered for credited contributions over the past number of years despite requesting to be so and what is required to have these recorded.","asker":"1225","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1175,"content":"<p>An application for credits has been received and a decision to backdate credits has been approved.

Last week saw the new Government&rsquo;s 100th day in office, and so the transition is still in its early phases.  I welcome the positive steps that the new Government has taken to date which have signalled their intention to bring peace and reconciliation, democratic reforms, and development and economic growth to all its people.<\/p>  <p>  At present, Ireland&rsquo;s trade links with Myanmar are limited.  In 2014, total merchandise trade was valued at &euro;2.51 million.  As the economy grows, we expect that there will be opportunities to forge new trade and economic links between both countries.  This will take time, however, as the country stabilises after many years of poor governance, economic stagnation and conflict.<\/p>  <p>  The Ambassador of Ireland to Myanmar visited the country most recently in June, when he met with a number of Irish business persons based or working in Yangon.  Useful discussions were held on the opportunities to do business in Myanmar, and the Ambassador will continue to visit the country regularly.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the work of my Department, Enterprise Ireland is actively promoting trade links in the region through its Singapore office.  In recent years only small number of Enterprise Ireland client companies have been trading with Myanmar.  Enterprise Ireland will continue to explore opportunities as the market develops and in response to increasing interest from its client companies.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently no trade agreements in place between Ireland and Myanmar.  As a member of the European Union, trade agreements with third countries are negotiated by the EU on Ireland&rsquo;s behalf.  Trade between the EU and Myanmar has been increasing since 2013 under the Everything but Arms  scheme which removed sanctions, with the exception of arms, and reinstated trade preferences.<\/p>  <p>  In recent months, the EU has signalled a strong intention to further enhance engagement with Myanmar.  To this end a Joint Communication between the European Commission and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy was published in June, entitled: 'Elements for an EU strategy vis-&agrave;-vis Myanmar\/Burma: A Special Partnership for Democracy, Peace and Prosperity'.  On 20 June, I attended a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, where we welcomed the Joint Communication, which lays out a plan for coherent, ambitious and forward-looking EU engagement and intensified cooperation with the country to overcome the significant challenges it faces.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Communication includes specific measures to enhance trade and economic engagement with Myanmar.

The conclusion of this agreement is expected to provide further economic opportunities and contribute to sustainable growth.

However, all peace processes are unique, and what is said must be understood in context.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear to all that a final agreement in the Middle East can only be reached in direct talks between the parties. Only they can make the deal.  However, by &lsquo;direct&rsquo; Mr. Netanyahu also implies that there should be no international presence in the talks, only the two parties.  The Palestinians have made clear that they need an international presence, because they are by far the weaker party and as a guarantee that the talks will be serious.<\/p>  <p>  Mr. Netanyahu makes his remarks knowing that important preconditions for Israel have already been met earlier in the process.  The mainstream Palestinian movement represented in the PLO and the Palestinian Authority have recognized and accepted the existence of Israel, occupying more than three quarters of historic Palestine, and have renounced armed struggle.  Nonetheless, Mr. Netanyahu does also sometimes add new preconditions himself.<\/p>  <p>  On the Palestinian side, they have not demanded prior recognition by Israel of a Palestinian state. They have however insisted that they can only enter negotiations if these are going to be a genuine attempt to reach peace, and not just a process for its own sake.  They have also demanded that seizure of Palestinian land, and construction of settlements, cannot continue while talks proceed.  When this demand has been refused they have sought alternative confidence building measures, such as release of prisoners.<\/p>  <p>  These Palestinian demands &ndash; preconditions or confidence building measures, depending on one&rsquo;s perspective &ndash; arise from the political necessity of reassuring their people that, in entering negotiations with Israel, they are not simply being strung along to occupy time, while the seizure of their land continues unabated.<\/p>  <p>  Regrettably, experience has shown that these fears are justified.  Mr. Netanyahu is now leading his fourth government, and international confidence in his commitment to a genuine peace negotiation is low.

While progress has been made in these discussions with the Association of Garda Sergeants &amp;amp; Inspectors in terms of addressing issues of mutual concern\u00a0this has not unfortunately been the case in respect of the Garda Representative Association (GRA) who formally withdrew from these discussions.  As of now the GRA remain outside the LRA.  The members of the GRA have exercised their democratic mandate and this right to do so\u00a0is respected.  However the decision not to become party to the LRA has consequences for the members of the GRA. <\/p>  <p>  In particular, with effect from 1 July 2016, the members of the GRA are subject to an increment freeze under the relevant Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest legislation.  No-one wishes to impose an incremental freeze on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or indeed on any public servant but it is the law.  We must also be fair to the vast bulk of public servants who have accepted the LRA and are co-operating with its terms. <\/p>  <p>  This group includes the Associations representing Superintendents and Chief Superintendents\u00a0in An the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The other Garda representative body, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI) have decided to re-ballot their members with a recommendation to accept the LRA.  The AGSI members will not be subject to any increment freeze while that ballot is in progress. <\/p>  <p>  In the context of discussions with AGSI aimed at addressing their concerns it is important to note that it was possible to find a basis to advance the relevant issues pertinent to the parties concerned.  A similar prospect should be realisable\u00a0with the\u00a0GRA but this will require them to engage\u00a0in discussions on matters of mutual concern with the official side through the normal channels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200087#WRCC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Supervisors","counter":1290,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200088#WRDD00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1291,"qnumday":453,"qnumall":"[21161\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200088#WRDD00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his views on correspondence (details supplied).","asker":"1221","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":1292,"content":"<p>I understand that Unions representing CE Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors have sought the provision of Exchequer funding to implement a Labour Court recommendation relating to the provision of a pension scheme dating back to 2008.

These interventions include ensuring that all campaigns and interventions targeting those most at risk of negative sexual health outcomes will be inclusive with regard to the diversity of sexual experiences and identities;  developing and maintaining positive prevention, access to condoms, testing, targeted education and outreach; and identifying and establishing links with other relevant strategies, particularly those relating to vulnerable and at-risk groups, to ensure their sexual health needs are addressed.  <\/p>  <p>  The Sexual Health Action Plan for 2015 - 2016 identified 18 priority actions across clinical services, education, communications and governance \/ structures. These actions aim to enhance sexual health prevention and treatment services at both population level and also address issues specific to men who have sex with men. The Action Plan commits to the development of a further Action Plan for 2017 - 2020 to complete the implementation of the Strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200092#WRHH02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Psychological Services","counter":1498,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200092#WRHH02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1499,"qnumday":523,"qnumall":"[20787\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200092#WRHH02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the amount of funding available to recruit new psychologists and counsellors in 2016 in order to develop psychological services for persons under 18 years of age; and the timeframe for the delivery of these services.","asker":"1349","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1500,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

The report of the Review was published in July 2015.  The Review included a general examination of the operation of the Scheme, and also looked at the price of long term residential care in public, voluntary and private nursing homes.  <\/p>  <p>  The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme, and the NHSS Review provided that the NTPF would review its approach to pricing with a view to:<\/p>  <p>  -  Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative cost for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;<\/p>  <p>  -  Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and<\/p>  <p>  -  Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.<\/p>  <p>  However, the NTPF has no role in setting or negotiating prices for public facilities, and it was considered important that this system also be examined to ensure that value for money is being achieved to the maximum extent possible. <\/p>  <p>  While the HSE is already engaged in a comprehensive exercise to review and streamline the operation and cost structures of public facilities, the Department of Health will also work with the HSE in conducting a Value for Money Review of public nursing home costs to identify more fully the factors that may be increasing costs and any areas that require correction.<\/p>  <p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009 provides that the components that make up the cost of care in public residential facilities must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, and the HSE have complied with this requirement.  There is no legal obligation under the Act for the HSE to publish the public cost of care.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past number of years the cost of care for public nursing homes under the Scheme as published on the HSE website was not updated by the HSE as the costs of public long stay and short stay care services were being reviewed.

Recognising that human health, animal health and ecosystem health are inextricably linked, &lsquo;One Health&rsquo; seeks to promote, improve and defend the health and well-being of all species by enhancing cooperation and collaboration between physicians, veterinarians, other scientific health and environmental professionals and by promoting strengths in leadership and management to achieve these goals.<\/p>  <p>  The European Union at both Council and European Parliament levels supports a Community Strategy against AMR having regard to the 'One Health' concept.  The Commission's 2012 AMR 5-year action plan has recently been revised through Council Conclusions on the next steps under a &lsquo;One Health&rsquo; approach to combat AMR, adopted at the Council's Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) meeting on 17th June last.  Ireland has continued to support the EU drive to combat AMR and contributed to discussions on the new Council Conclusions.  The Council calls on Member States to have in place before mid-2017 'a national action plan against Antimicrobial resistance based on the One Health approach and in line with the objectives of the WHO Global Action Plan'. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the serious and increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance and the requirement for a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to health issues, the Department of Health&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) established a high level National Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee in 2014 to address this issue.  The Committee meets Ireland&rsquo;s requirements to have an Intersectoral co-ordinating mechanism for addressing AMR at European level, including the development of a national action plan against AMR as required of Member States in the WHO's Global Action Plan against AMR (2015).<\/p>  <p>  The Committee has a clear role and mandate across the human and animal health sectors.  Committee membership consists of representatives of both Departments and of the relevant HSE and veterinary specialist agencies, including other relevant bodies with a remit across the two sectors; membership is representative of major stakeholders.  The Committee meets bi-annually and its last meeting was in April 2016.  The Committee's work plan for 2016 includes development of a national action plan against AMR and work, which includes ongoing engagement with all relevant stakeholders, both Committee member and others.  This work is continuing and the Committee is scheduled to meet again in late 2016 to assess progress on this major agenda item.<\/p>  <p>  The prevention and control of healthcare associated infections (HCAIs) and AMR has been a significant patient safety and public health priority for the Department of Health Ireland for numerous years.

Their recommendations are based on the epidemiology of the disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests. NIAC recommended that the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.<\/p><p>I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  Anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services.  The HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.  My Department is aware that representatives from REGRET have already met with the HSE and I hope to be in a position to meet with them in the near future.<\/p><p>The HSE provides information for parents about diseases, the vaccines to prevent them and side effects to allow them to choose whether or not to give consent to vaccination.  All vaccination information provided to parents is prepared from the available licensed documentation for each vaccine, the Summary of Products Characteristics and Patient Information Leaflet.  The information booklets include information on the most common adverse events that can occur after each vaccination.  The information is presented in clear simple language and approved by the National Adult Literacy Agency so that it can be understood by all adults as the average reading age in Ireland is 12 years of age.  Parents are also given contact details for their local immunisation office and advised to speak to a member of the school immunisation team if they have any further questions.  Should parents require additional information about vaccines the immunisation leaflet refers to the HSE&rsquo;s national immunisation website ().  The national immunisation website has been accredited by the World Health Organisation for credibility, content and good information practices. <\/p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the statutory regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  In November 2015 the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine.  The review which the HPRA participated in, specifically focused on rare reports of two conditions, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome associated with heart rate increase.  The outcome of the review found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions examined.  On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency stating that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200095#WRLL02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":1633,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200095#WRLL02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1634,"qnumday":572,"qnumall":"[21089\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200095#WRLL02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive an appointment to see an early intervention team.","asker":"1239","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1635,"content":"<p>As the issue raised by the Deputy relates to an individual case, this is a service matter for the Health Service Executive.

The SA comprises two Parts: Part 1 sets out the detailed terms and conditions which attach to the release of the funding to Providers and Part 2 (the Schedules) sets out inter alia the annual amount of funding to be released and the quantum of services to be provided for that funding.  (In some instances, there may be a number of sets of Schedules per individual Provider).  Part 1 generally covers a four-year period; however, the Schedules are renewed annually by local Service Managers with each Provider to reflect the funding for the year in question and the quantum of services to be provided for same.  <\/p><p>Providers in receipt of less than &euro;250,000 are required to sign a Grant Aid Agreement (GA) which also sets out the terms and conditions which attach to the release of the funding to these Providers.  These GAs are entered into on an annual basis.  <\/p><p>The following initiatives have been taken to strengthen the system of oversight for Section 38 and 39 Providers.<\/p><p>The HSE Compliance Unit was established in late 2014 to provide programmatic oversight of the arrangements in place with voluntary agencies funded by the HSE for the provision of health and personal social care services.<\/p><p>A key element of this oversight are the Service Arrangements Part 1 &amp;amp; Part 2, which underpin the HSE's relationship with the Service Providers and in this context, a comprehensive review of the SA documentation (Parts 1 and 2) was conducted in 2014\/2015 to further strengthen the governance with Providers.  This review involved input from all relevant internal stakeholders and also an extensive engagement took place with representative bodies from the voluntary sector.<\/p><p>As a result of this review, some key changes, as set out below; have been incorporated into the revised SAs (Part 1) to enhance the governance elements of these documents:<\/p><p>- Additional requirements in respect of Internal Audit, Finance, Governance Arrangements and information requirements;<\/p><p>- Requirement to submit an Annual Compliance Statement in respect of the Provider&rsquo;s governance;<i>(Currently applies to Section 38 Providers &ndash; see below)<\/i><\/p><p>- A clause which enables the HSE to appoint an individual to, in specific circumstances, assist and provide guidance to the Board of a Provider organisation;<\/p><p>- A detailed mechanism to deal with performance issues which includes the appointment of a manager by the HSE in exceptional circumstances to manage the services in a HSE-funded organisation;<\/p><p>- Requirement for a Provider to request the consent of the Executive where the Provider proposes to re-organise or restructure its organisation;<\/p><p>- Requirement that a Provider shall give 12 months notice where the Provider does not wish to provide services or receive funding;<\/p><p>- Option of mediation between the HSE and the Provider as part of the dispute resolution process.<\/p><p>These changes were occasioned by inter alia an Internal Audit report, Public Sector Pay Policy, various Circulars and other matters that have emerged with Providers in the intervening period since the last documentation review.<\/p><p>The Annual Compliance Statement (ACS) process referred to above is an important element of the oversight process and requires the Board Chairs of each Section 38 Service Provider to certify on an annual basis that they are compliant with the necessary governance requirements or in cases where they are not compliant, they are obliged to explain why that is the case. The ACS process currently applies to Section 38 agencies, however from November 2016, this will be rolled out to Section 39 agencies as well. In addition, as part of the ongoing development of the Compliance Process, and in order to provide external assurances to the HSE, it was decided that a review of governance at Board and Executive level in all Section 38 Providers, to be conducted by external consultants, would be undertaken. The purpose of these reviews is to establish the level\/standard of governance in place in these organisations and to confirm independently that the governance practices and procedures accord with those set out in their respective ACSs. These reviews involve an examination of key governance processes and documents, including obtaining confirmation that there are internal financial controls and that formal written financial procedures are in place in these organisations.

The UK is by far our largest trading partner.\u00a0 Last year we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products.  This included more than &euro;1.1 billion in beef products, which comprises approximately 50% of Irish beef exports.  Ireland is also the UK&rsquo;s largest destination for its food exports - worth &euro;3.8 billion last year.  This bilateral trade takes place on the basis of harmonised EU rules on animal and public health and labelling, without complex certification, quota limits or customs duties and tariffs.  And it is underpinned by the vital support of the CAP budget, to which the UK is a significant net contributor. <\/p>  <p>  Given these linkages, and as the UK is a net food importer, both countries have a strong interest in maintaining a close agrifood trading relationship.  In addition, the resilience of the Irish agrifood sector, and of the beef sector in particular, is well recognised, and this, together with the strong commercial relationships built up over years of trading, will help us to negotiate our way though the challenges ahead. <\/p>  <p>  It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of the UK&rsquo;s decision depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations may take up to two years, and perhaps longer, and over that period existing arrangements will continue to apply. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department has engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result, and has published a summary of the key actions we will now take to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision.<\/p>  <p>  The most immediate concerns for agrifood exporters centre on Euro-Sterling exchange rates.  It should be noted that the fall in the value of Sterling against the Euro, while significant, is not unprecedented.  Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern.  In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result.  The Bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions regarding potential risks.  Actions by ECB and other global actors will be monitored closely. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I asked Bord Bia to provide practical guidance to SMEs to assist them in dealing with marketing challenges arising in the short term, and last week it announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses.  These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, the provision of consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement, and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness.  Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland.   <\/p>  <p>  The other areas in which potential impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector.<\/p>  <p>  However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure is completed.\u00a0 In the meantime, and as part of our overall contingency planning, I have established a dedicated unit in my Department to work on all of the issues that I have mentioned.  I have also convened a consultative committee of stakeholders, which met for the first time last week, to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed.  In addition, I am ensuring that my Department is keeping in touch with the relevant agencies through a contact group established under the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee.

With regards solely to beef my predecessor, Minister Coveney, was proactive in supporting the traditional trade of live cattle between the North and South and met on a number of occasions with his counterpart in Northern Ireland, Minister Michelle O&rsquo;Neill MLA.  He also signed a joint letter to the three UK retailers which stock Irish beef asking them to consider a new mixed label for animals born, reared or slaughtered in both jurisdictions on the island.  Minister O&rsquo;Neill also approved a voluntary beef label in Northern Ireland for cattle born in the Republic of Ireland, raised in the Republic of Ireland and\/or Northern Ireland, and slaughtered in Northern Ireland.  This label would have facilitated the sale of beef from animals born in the South and slaughtered in the North.  However no retailers expressed an interest in using this label on their products as there is a commercial preference at UK retail level, for a simple origin labelling process bearing the name of a single country of origin only.

In 2015 Ireland exported an estimated &euro;2.2 billion, or approximately 500,000 tonnes of beef, to almost 80 countries around the globe.  Food Wise 2025 acknowledged that there is a rising global population together with the growing middle classes in a number of rapidly growing economies and changing dietary patterns to incorporate increased protein consumption.  Taken together these provide a great opportunity for increasing the exports of high quality, safe and sustainably produced Irish beef.<\/p><p>As a member of the European Union, Ireland already has full market access to the 27 other EU Member States for beef and other commodities produced.  Therefore Ireland has ready market access to a population of over 500 million inhabitants, which indeed is one of the many benefits that comes with being a Member of the EU.  The majority of Irish beef exported is to other EU Member States. According to Bord Bia, in 2015 some 52% of Irish beef exports went to the UK and 36% went to other EU markets.  Recent events in markets close to home have highlighted once again the importance of diversifying our international beef markets.  As an exporting country, accessing new markets is crucial to the long-term sustainability of our beef sector.<\/p><p>The balance of our beef exports was to non EU markets including the USA, Middle East, Philippines, Hong Kong, Ghana and Switzerland among others.  These Third Country markets are increasingly an important alternative outlet for the industry.  My Department engages on an ongoing basis with many Third countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia, the meat industry, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the European Commission on various market access issues.  My Department continues to push strongly for market access to other Third Countries.<\/p><p>In 2015 Ireland had some notable successes including becoming the first EU Member State to gain beef access to the USA, having a BSE ban lifted by the Chinese authorities and negotiating an extension to our market access to the Philippines, where we are now the second largest supplier of beef.  More recently beef markets in Canada, Oman and the Maldives have also been opened.  Significantly our access to the US market was recently further extended to incorporate manufacturing beef, as a testament to our beef production and regulatory systems.  It is expected that similar extended beef access to Saudi Arabia will be achieved shortly.  We are currently in the process of trying to secure beef access to other third countries including,<i>inter alia<\/i>, China, South Korea, Israel, Ukraine and Vietnam.  It is my intention to continue to focus on developing as many third country markets as possible in order to provide exporters as many commercial opportunities as possible in a competitive global marketplace. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200105#WRVV02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Industry Development","counter":2043,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200105#WRVV02100"},{"type":"question","counter":2044,"qnumday":716,"qnumall":"[21365\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200105#WRVV02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on his efforts in developing the Irish seafood industry and the wider marine sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1364","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2045,"content":"<p>Our seafood industry has been on a sustained growth path in recent years, with sales growing to &euro;890 million in 2015.  Current FAO estimates are that growth in world consumption of fish will require an extra 40 million tonnes of seafood by 2030.  Ireland can capture a significant share of this global seafood opportunity with the right strategy and supporting investment.  FoodWise 2025 recognised this opportunity for the growth of our seafood industry and set out a strategy to realise that growth potential by focussing on the key areas of sustainability, added value, processing scale, human capital, increasing raw material supply and developing our markets.<\/p>  <p>  In January this year, a new &euro;240 million development programme for Ireland&rsquo;s seafood sector was launched &ndash; the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme.  That Programme will be the primary tool to address the 6 key areas identified in FoodWise.  I was delighted to announce in June the first tranche of &euro;4.3 million in grants to 51 aquaculture and seafood processing enterprises under the EMFF Programme. <\/p>  <p>  Under that Programme, I am making available &euro;30 million to kick-start growth in our aquaculture sector, which has been stagnant for too long.  In December, we published Ireland&rsquo;s first National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development, targeting growth in output of 45,000 tonnes by 2023, aided through 24 specified initiatives.  To complement those efforts, my Department is working to deliver up to 200 licence determinations this year and will initiate a review of aquaculture licensing procedures, as recommended in FoodWise.<\/p>  <p>  All of these efforts focusing on aquaculture, together with efforts to attract landings of fish by foreign vessels, will help increase the supply of raw material to our growing processing industry to convert to added value consumer foods, food ingredients and functional foods.  I will be making available &euro;33 million Government funding through the EMFF Programme to support the further development of our processing sector through enhanced scaling and value adding.  FoodWise recognises that we need to reduce the level of seafood product which is exported in commodity form from its present 70% level to below 50%.  Adding value to seafood products will make a huge difference to the economic activity and levels of employment in our coastal communities.   <\/p>  <p>  These efforts are being supported through &euro;2 million investment in 2016 by Bord Bia in promoting Irish seafood internationally and assisting our producers to find and grow markets.  They are being supported by a commitment within the seafood sector to sustainability, with 32 Irish seafood companies fully verified as members of Origin Green, and a further 16 applications in the pipeline.  Between them, these companies will account for in excess of 80% of total seafood export values. <\/p>  <p>  In these many initiatives to implement the FoodWise strategy and in our financial commitment through the EMFF Programme, Government is clearly stepping up to the challenges and striving to grow our seafood industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200105#WRVV02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Wise 2025 Strategy","counter":2046,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200105#WRVV02400"},{"type":"question","counter":2047,"qnumday":717,"qnumall":"[21366\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200105#WRVV02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on the progress of the Food Wise 2025 strategy, including progress on the actions detailed therein; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2048,"content":"<p>Food Wise 2025, the new ten year strategy for the agrifood sector published in July last year, replaced Food Harvest 2020.

The UK is by far our largest trading partner.\u00a0 Last year we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products.  This included more than &euro;1.1 billion in beef products and almost &euro;970 million in dairy products.  Ireland is also the UK&rsquo;s largest destination for its food exports - worth &euro;3.8 billion last year.  This bilateral trade takes place on the basis of harmonised EU rules on animal and public health and labelling, without complex certification, quota limits or customs duties and tariffs.  And it is underpinned by the vital support of the CAP budget, to which the UK is a significant net contributor. <\/p>  <p>  Given these linkages, and as the UK is a net food importer, both countries have a strong interest in maintaining a close agri-food trading relationship.  In addition, the resilience of the Irish agri-food sector is well recognised, and this, together with the strong commercial relationships built up over years of trading, will help us to negotiate our way though the challenges ahead. <\/p>  <p>  It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of the UK&rsquo;s decision depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations may take up to two years, and perhaps longer, and over that period existing arrangements will continue to apply. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department has engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result, and has published a summary of the key actions we will now take to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision.<\/p>  <p>  The most immediate concerns for agri-food exporters centre on Euro-Sterling exchange rates.  It should be noted that the fall in the value of Sterling against the Euro, while significant, is not unprecedented.  Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern. In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result.  The Bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions regarding potential risks.  Actions by ECB and other global actors will be monitored closely.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I asked Bord Bia to provide practical guidance to SMEs to assist them in dealing with marketing challenges arising in the short term, and last week it announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses.  These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, the provision of consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement, and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness.  Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland.   <\/p>  <p>  The other areas in which potential impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector.<\/p>  <p>  However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure is completed. \u00a0In the meantime, and as part of our overall contingency planning, I have established a dedicated unit in my Department to work on all of the issues that I have mentioned.  I have also convened a consultative committee of stakeholders, which met for the first time last week, to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed.  In addition, I am ensuring that the response of the relevant agencies is fully co-ordinated through a contact group established under the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee.  And of course, the Department will continue to feed into the central Contingency Framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200105#WRVV03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Exports","counter":2055,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200105#WRVV03300"},{"type":"question","counter":2056,"qnumday":720,"qnumall":"[21369\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200105#WRVV03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of his efforts in gaining market access for Irish beef in the United States of America; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":2057,"content":"<p>I was delighted to announce last week the decision of the US authorities to extend their approval for Irish beef to include manufacturing beef\/beef intended for grinding (BIFG).  This marks the culmination of over a year of intensive work between my Department and its US counterparts on a range of technical matters.  The new US decision paves the way for industry to undertake the steps necessary to trade to commence.  In relation to market access for the USA, Ireland had initially received a major reputational boost in 2015 as the first EU Member State to gain access to the US market for beef and six plants are currently approved to export. By the end of December 2015 approximately 1,800 tonnes of beef, with an estimated value of &euro;14 million, had been exported from Ireland to the US.  This represents an exceptionally strong start to this trade considering that the first exports only went in March 2015 and some of the plants were only approved for export in September.  That amount looks likely to be surpassed in 2016, as by the end of June, almost 1,200 tonnes had been exported.<\/p>  <p>  The recent announcement by the US on our enhanced access is a huge endorsement of Irish beef and our production and regulatory systems.

The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services. <\/p><p>The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention and includes the townland of Ballinkillen, Bagnelstown, Co\u00a0Carlow. \u00a0The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county including County Carlow.<\/p><p>Members of the public can view whether their premises in\u00a0County\u00a0Carlow are in the BLUE or AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.<\/p><p>The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map\u00a0should email the Department, quoting their Eircode to\u00a0<i>broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.<\/i><\/p><p>Currently, over\u00a0750,000 premises are the focus\u00a0for \u00a0the\u00a0procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire ('PQQ') and Project Information Memorandum.\u00a0\u00a0On 5 July, I announced that my Department\u00a0has also identified a further\u00a0170,000 premises which are currently market BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map and which are unlikely to get access to services.  The intention is\u00a0to undertake further analysis on these additional premises with a view to including them\u00a0in the formal procurement process. <\/p><p>I\u00a0also\u00a0announced\u00a0that the Department has now moved to the next stage in the procurement process.\u00a0 In this Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase,\u00a0three\u00a0qualifying bidders have been invited to meet with the Department to commence the formal dialogue process.  The qualifying bidders will shortly be furnished with a draft contract, with detailed specifications for a quality and affordable high speed broadband network. <\/p><p>Following the ITPD stage, which will take a number of months, the Department will issue\u00a0final tender documentation to bidders.\u00a0\u00a0When final tenders have been submitted\u00a0a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots\u00a0as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy.  The Department will then enter into formal\u00a0contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s), prior to awarding a contract(s).\u00a0 <\/p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional,\u00a0Rural and\u00a0Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.<\/p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government also commits\u00a0to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.\u00a0 In this regard, Minister Humphreys\u00a0is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200106#WRWW01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Programmes","counter":2093,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200106#WRWW01550"},{"type":"question","counter":2094,"qnumday":732,"qnumall":"[20575\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200106#WRWW01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the amount of pre-financing by programme his Department has applied for with regard to the current phase of EU funding programmes;

The two models are:<\/p><p>- Commercial Stimulus (or &lsquo;Gap Funding&rsquo;) &ndash; the private sector finances, designs, builds, owns and operates the network, with contractual obligations to the Department. <\/p><p>- Full Concession &ndash; the private sector finances, designs, builds and operates the network with contractual obligations to the Department.\u00a0 Those assets funded by the State are handed back to the State after 25 years.  Commercial assets that support the NBP infrastructure would however remain in private ownership.<\/p><p>Both Models will deliver the same network, with the same service specifications and controls, for 25 years.  In both models, the winning bidder(s) will be subject to stringent contract provisions to ensure that the network delivers quality, affordable high speed broadband to all parts of Ireland that cannot access services. <\/p><p>The Department has completed detailed costings, down to every individual premise in the Intervention Area and, on that basis, has modelled the likely cost of each ownership model.  It would not be\u00a0appropriate\u00a0to publish the expected cost of building the network or the likely cost to the State while\u00a0a major public\u00a0procurement process is underway.  I do not intend therefore to indicate the overall estimated Exchequer funding parameters.  Ultimately, the costs will depend on the price that bidder(s) quote in the tender process.  I can however confirm the following based on the cost modelling completed to date:<\/p><p>- The Full Concession Model is estimated to cost 50 &ndash; 70% more in nominal terms that the Commercial Stimulus Funding model;<\/p><p>- In the Full Concession Model, the full cost of the project would be likely to go on the Government&rsquo;s Balance Sheet, and the commercial sector input would likely be regarded as Government debt;<\/p><p>- Having the entire project on the Government&rsquo;s Balance sheet would impact the general Government deficit by approximately &euro;1bn more than the Commercial Stimulus Model.  This would also reduce the available capital spend for other key investment projects by up to &euro;600m over the next six years. <\/p><p>In addition to the funding implications of the Full Concession Model, I am advised that this model could take at least 6 months longer to negotiate a contract, than with the Gap funding model.<\/p><p>On 29 September 2015, the Government's 6 year Capital Plan, <i>Building on Recovery<\/i>, was published.  It\u00a0includes an allocation of &euro;275m for the National Broadband Plan (NBP).  This allocation provides the <i>initial<\/i>stimulus required to deliver the Government's intervention and it is expected that further funding will be available\u00a0over the lifetime of any contract(s).  Funding of &euro;75m is committed through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). <\/p><p>The current procurement schedule aims to\u00a0have a contract(s) in place by June 2017.  There are numerous stages in the procurement process and each stage is dependent on a number of factors, including the complexities that may be encountered during the process. <\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s priority is to deliver this network as quickly as possible.  Given that both ownership models will deliver the same product and services for the next 25 years, and that regulation can be strengthened to provide safeguards for consumers from year 26 onwards, the Government has chosen the Commercial Stimulus model as the optimum approach for the National Broadband Plan intervention.\u00a0 The decision on ownership has allowed the procurement phase to move to the next stage, where three bidders have qualified and been invited to participate in formal dialogue with the Department.

Apart from the significant losses to the Exchequer arising from cases of so called bogus self-employment, the practice has serious implications from an employment rights perspective.  In this respect it is important that individuals are correctly designated as regards employment status, so that those who ought to be designated as employees are not deprived of employment rights.  This is particularly the case for vulnerable workers who may not feel in a position to object to certain arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has a well-resourced and proactive labour inspectorate, which now forms part of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and there are already existing mechanisms in place to tackle this issue.  Inspections are undertaken on the basis of risk analysis which identifies certain sectors, as a result of complaints received and on a routine basis. Where the WRC inspection service receive complaints in relation to bogus self-employment or bogus sub-contracting, they are forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners and\/or the Department of Social Protection (Scope Section) for investigation either solely by the recipient, or jointly with the Workplace Relations Commission. <\/p>  <p>  In most cases it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed. Where there is doubt in relation to the employment status of an individual the relevant Departments and Agencies will have regard to the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals.

Its principal function is, once each year, to examine the national minimum hourly rate of pay and to make a recommendation to the Minister respecting the rate, ensuring that all decisions are evidence based, fair and sustainable, and do not create significant adverse consequences for employment or competitiveness.<\/p><p>The Commission submitted its first report in July 2015. Its recommendation to increase the minimum wage from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.15 per hour was accepted by Government and the increase came into effect on 1 January last.<\/p><p>The Commission&rsquo;s second report on the national minimum wage is due to be submitted to the Minister by 19 July 2016.<\/p><p>The 2015 Act allows the Minister to request the Commission to examine and report its views and recommendations on such matters, related generally to the functions of the Commission under the Act, as are specified in that request.  Such request must be made to the Commission by the end of February each year. This new provision was invoked, in order to obtain a better understanding of the impact of the national minimum wage on younger people. The Commission has been asked to examine the appropriateness of the sub-minima rates as currently provided for in the National Minimum Wage Acts with regard in particular to their impact on youth unemployment rates and participation in education.  This report is due by the end of October 2016. This new provision has also been used to ask the Commission to report on the preponderance of women on the national minimum wage. In order to obtain a better understanding of the composition and profile of this group and the underlying causality, the Commission was requested to examine this issue in more detail and report its views as to the underlying reason for this position and make any recommendations it considers appropriate.  This report is also due by the 31st of October this year.<\/p><p>The Summer Economic Statement repeats the Government's support for an increase in the minimum wage to &euro;10.50 per hour over the next five years and put in place mechanisms that mitigate the impact on employers in order to protect lower paid jobs taking into account the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission. The independence of the Low Pay Commission is firmly established in the National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Act 2015. It can only operate within that statutory remit and make recommendations to the Minister in accordance with the criteria that are clearly and explicitly set out in the 2015 Act. <\/p><p>The Commission met on 7 occasions while it had interim status. Since its establishment on a statutory basis it has met on 11 occasions. Members of the Commission have also met with a range of interested parties since February 2015. 4 such meetings took place in Galway, Dublin (X2) and Monaghan. <\/p><p>An allocation of &euro;500,000 was provided for the Commission in 2015, broken down on a pay (&euro;270,000) and a non-pay (&euro;230,000) basis.  Expenditure in 2015 was &euro;250,600 - &euro;155,500 (pay) and &euro;95,100 (non-pay). &euro;474,000 has been allocated to the Commission for 2016 broken down on a pay (&euro;244,000) and a non-pay (&euro;230,000) basis.  <\/p><p>Information relating to member fees and expenses to date is set out below:-<table><tr><th>Fees<\/th><th>Expenses<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;81,937.56<\/td><td>&euro;11,364.03<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Not all Commission members are in receipt of fees, a number of members have waived their entitlement to fees and expenses.

The trader is obliged to ensure that only such a measuring instrument is used for trade and that it is correct and verified at all times.  Re-verification must be carried out after the instrument has been repaired, re-calibrated or failed inspection.  The process of re-verification involves establishing that the instrument complies with regulations, in particular, testing for accuracy against applicable measurement tolerances and the application of tamper evident seals.<\/p><p>In order to ensure sufficient resources are available for traders to keep their instruments in compliance, Legal Metrology have authorised private operators, subject to specific conditions, under Section 12 of the 1996 Act, to undertake verifications at the request of the instrument owner.  To monitor compliance, NSAI Legal Metrology Inspectors, operating out of seven offices countrywide, carry out inspections of bin weighing systems on refuse trucks on the basis of risk-based enforcement.  <\/p><p>There are approximately 750 bin trucks operating in the country of which 299 have been verified and sealed to date. NSAI understands that approximately 15% of waste company customers are currently on a pay by weight price plan. Details of inspections undertaken for the years 2014 to 2016 to determine the verification status of bin weighing systems in trade use are given below in table 1. <\/p><p>From 1July Legal Metrology is putting in place an inspection regime that will inspect the performance of bin weighing systems used for pay by weight purposes. NSAI Legal Metrology continues to review its enforcement strategy on the basis of inspection information allocating resources as necessary to the areas of highest risk.<\/p><p><b>Table 1.<\/b>Inspections of Bin Weighing Systems<table><tr><th><div>Year<\/div><\/th><th><div>Instruments Inspected<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><div>2014<\/div><\/td><td><div>28<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2015<\/div><\/td><td><div>52<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><div>2016*<\/div><\/td><td><div>54<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table>*Up to and including 8 July<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200111#WRBBB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1272"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":2304,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200111#WRBBB00950"},{"type":"question","counter":2305,"qnumday":804,"qnumall":"[21132\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200111#WRBBB01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the efforts she is making to promote Mullingar, County Westmeath, as an enterprise hub considering the large and underutilised IDA park, its central location and skilled workforce.","asker":"1369","askee":"1247"},{"type":"question","counter":2306,"qnumday":805,"qnumall":"[21135\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200111#WRBBB01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the action she is taking to source alternative industry for Mullingar, County Westmeath, considering her recent visit to the IDA park and the loss of 90 jobs in the region at a company (details supplied).","asker":"1369","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":2307,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 804 and 805 together.<\/p>  <p>On the Deputy&rsquo;s invitation, I visited Mullingar in late June where I met with the local Chamber of Commerce and visited the IDA Business Park. The same day I also visited nearby Castlepollard where Enterprise Ireland client company, Mergon International, celebrated the launch of their global innovation centre.<\/p>  <p>  In County Westmeath, there are sixteen IDA Ireland client companies employing approximately 2,300 people. Given the recent global economic environment, the existing foreign direct investment (FDI) client base has performed consistently and retained its presence in the county. In 2015, 212 new FDI jobs were created in the county as a whole.   <\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland actively engages with its existing client base to support them in growing their business to retain jobs and expand their existing footprint in the region. An example of this is Patterson Pumps, who in September 2015 announced a 30-person expansion at the opening of its new manufacturing facility.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that Mullingar suffered some bad news recently with the announcement by Imperial Tobacco of the loss of jobs in the area.

Irish firms will also benefit from the recognition of product standards and certification, thus saving on &lsquo;double testing&rsquo; on both sides of the Atlantic.  These are some of the benefits of the trade deal with Canada as well as providing new market opportunities in many sectors for Irish firms.  <\/p>  <p>  In May this year, the Council had an exchange of views on the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and the process towards signature and provisional application of the agreement.

The Commission published their proposals for signature, conclusion and provisional application on the 5th July 2016 which are available on the European Commission Register of Documents.  The proposal is for CETA to be a mixed agreement.<\/p>  <p>  At the last EU Council of Trade Ministers on 13th May 2016, I made Ireland&rsquo;s approach clear, that based on our assessment of its provisions, we viewed CETA as a mixed Agreement, in terms of EU and Member State competency.  In view of the position taken by Ireland and other Member States I note that the Commission have now decided to submit CETA to the Council for decision as a mixed agreement.  This means that each Member State will be required to ratify the agreement under its own procedures.  The Oireachtas will be part of the final decision on ratification.  It will now be a matter for the Council and the European Parliament to decide on the signature, conclusion and provisional application of CETA.  <\/p>  <p>  Provisional application is provided for in the EU&rsquo;s Free Trade Agreements.  This means that those areas where the EU has full competence may be applied immediately once the Agreement comes into force.  It is an important mechanism that allows companies and consumers to benefit from a trade agreement at an early stage.

There are now 30 CCCs, as Limerick City and Limerick County CCCs have amalgamated, as have Waterford City and Waterford County and North and South Tipperary. Each committee has a distinct legal identity and board of directors. City and County Childcare Committees receive funding from my Department for the operations of the Committee, allowing each one to employ staff and implement actions contained in its strategic plan, which is approved by my Department to reflect national policy objectives.

It is also my understanding that my Department advised the CCC Chairpersons of the requirement to implement reductions to CCC staff salaries aligned to the agreed Local Authority pay scales.<\/p><p>In 2012, my Department and Pobal conducted a review of funding allocations to the CCCs under a Revised Allocations Framework. The rationale for the Revised Allocations Framework was to implement a more balanced allocation of available funding and also to implement further required savings of 8% in the overall CCCs' budget over the two years 2013\/2014. The analysis of funding allocations indicated that a number of CCCs, when compared with each other, had allocations that appeared to be disproportionate to their population and service profiles. The review resulted in a reduction in the funding to some CCCs in the years 2013\/2014. The relevant CCCs were informed by my Department of this reduction and the rationale and methodology used to arrive at this decision. <\/p><p>Under the Revised Allocations Framework, each CCC was weighted with a combination of 4 variables: <\/p><p>1.

(% of DCYA contracted services 2011\/2012) x 0.35;<\/p><p>4. (% Pobal-HP Deprivation Resource Allocation Model) x 0.15<\/p><p>The result was a relative percentage weighting for each CCC area. The weighting was compared to the percentage of funding each CCC was allocated in 2012 in order to identify those CCCs that were relatively underfunded and to inform funding allocation options and implications.

General Practitioners (GPs) are in a good position to identify indicators of abuse, and they are one of a number of professionals who might be expected to make referrals to Tusla.  Children First states that where someone has reasonable grounds for suspecting a child is being, or has been, abused, they are expected to immediately inform Tusla in accordance with the standard reporting procedure, unless doing so might endanger the child.<\/p>  <p>  A report, which is described as a \"referral\" when it is received by Tusla, can be made verbally over the telephone, in person or, preferably in the case of professionals, using the standard reporting form.  Tusla does not have a role in the supply of information from the person making the referral prior to receiving it.  A referral is then assessed by Tusla through a process of screening, preliminary enquiry, and, if appropriate, an initial assessment.  Approximately half of all referrals will not proceed beyond the initial assessment stage, although they may be referred to family support services or other State agencies when appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla does not capture data on the source of referrals in the manner requested by the Deputy.  Child Welfare and Protection services received 41,599 referrals in 2013, 43,630 referrals in 2014, and provisional figures for 2015 show that there were 43,596 referrals.  The most recent breakdown on the source of referrals available was published in Tusla's Review of Adequacy 2014.  Referrals from General Practitioners accounted for 1,276 in 2014 and 1,064 in 2013.<\/p>  <p>  Where a referral meets the threshold for a social work service, it is then referred to as an open case and a social worker is allocated to work with the child and their family.  Should the situation warrant it, Tusla may consider applying for an order under the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, and this may involve a supervision or a care order.  In some open cases, a voluntary care arrangement may be considered.  Only a minority of children involved in open cases will need to be received into care.<\/p>  <p>  At present, there are no consequences under the Children First guidelines for not reporting a reasonable concern about a child.  This does not exclude the possibility of  complaint being made to the relevant professional body in a particular case.  The Children First Act 2015 puts elements of the Children First Guidelines (2011) on a statutory footing.  Amongst other things, the commencement of the relevant sections of the Act will provide for mandatory reporting of child abuse using defined thresholds by key professionals, including GPs.  Preparations by the Department and Tusla for the full implementation of the Children First Act 2015 are underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200112#WRCCC00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":2346,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200112#WRCCC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":2347,"qnumday":821,"qnumall":"[20749\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200112#WRCCC01300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the securities in place to encourage early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme providers to take up the scheme with regard to the duplication of services in one area; the frequency with which needs assessments are carried out; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1287","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":2348,"content":"<p>The objective of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  Approximately 96% of pre-school children have accessed the (ECCE) scheme over the last number of years, demonstrating both good supply and good take-up across the country.  In Budget 2016, my Department announced a significant expansion to pre-school provision under the ECCE programme.  This expansion will see the number of children benefitting from the Programme rise from around 67,000 to around 127,000 in a given programme year.  Children&rsquo;s entitlement to ECCE will increase from 38 weeks currently for all children, to an average of 61 weeks (ranging from 51 to 88 weeks depending on date of birth and age starting school).<\/p>  <p>  The measure is being introduced from September 2016 in order to provide the early years sector with the time to build capacity to meet the increased demand.  As the increased demand for the Programme is not expected to peak until April 2017, this timeframe should allow pre-school providers to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional demand.  In response to the expansion of ECCE announced in Budget 2016, my Department has initiated a number of actions to support the development of capacity in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  1. The City\/County Childcare Committees (CCCs) carried out an analysis of capacity within the Early Years sector to inform whether there was a need to develop additional capacity within the sector.  I am reasonably satisfied that there will be sufficient capacity in the system to meet the September intake.  My Department will continue to work intensively and proactively with any CCCs who identify a concern re supply for the remainder of 2016 and into early 2017.<\/p>  <p>  2. A higher level of capitation (HC) is paid to ECCE services which are led by staff with degrees (minimum Level 7) and three years&rsquo; experience in the sector.  This higher level of capitation was introduced based on international evidence that the most effective way of improving quality of services was through a more qualified workforce.  My Department has altered ECCE&rsquo;s rules to allow for higher capitation to be payable to services on a room by room basis.  This would allow services with two rooms, but only one graduate, to still receive higher capitation for one of the rooms.  This assists services in expanding capacity and incrementally increasing the number of graduates in their employment.<\/p>  <p>  3. My Department has worked closely with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to consider planning issues for services wishing to expand their service.  Earlier this year the DOECLG issued a circular to all Local Authorities asking them to assist early years providers with the their planning queries and the pre-planning consultation phase in so far as possible.<\/p>  <p>  4. As part of Budget 2016, my Department announced the introduction of an Early Years Capital Programme with total funding of &euro;4 million available.  This funding was targeted at early years pre-school providers that are making alterations to their services to accommodate increased numbers of children.  To ensure the maximum number of grant approved providers can avail of funding, my Department has sought and received sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure to increase the funding available by &euro;2.5m, representing an increase of 60%, to &euro;6.5m.  Successful applicants were notified of their grant allocation last week.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that there is already additional capacity in the early years sector to cope with some of the increased demand.  I am aware that every year a significant number of new pre-school providers apply to participate in this Programme.  This increased demand for, and additional investment in, free pre-school provision should encourage a greater numbers of applicants.  It is clear that more capacity will be required.  Officials in my Department continue to work closely with the City and County Childcare Committees and the Voluntary Childcare Organisations in relation to provision of services under this, and other, Childcare Programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200112#WRCCC01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"After-School Support Services","counter":2349,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200112#WRCCC01450"},{"type":"question","counter":2350,"qnumday":822,"qnumall":"[21144\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071200112#WRCCC01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will maintain an after-school literacy programme for vulnerable children (details supplied) under the Childhood Development Initiative; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":2351,"content":"<p>The Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme is a joint prevention and early intervention initiative led by my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies.
