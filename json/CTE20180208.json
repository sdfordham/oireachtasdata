Apologies have been received from Deputy McDonald.<\/p> <p>  Are the minutes of our meeting of 1 February agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Next on our agenda is an issue that I wish to discuss arising from the minutes.  Representatives from the National Shared Services Office appeared before us last week.  It is the body that manages the payroll and pension payments of what we all understood to be the majority of the public service, excluding HSE staff, garda&iacute; and teachers.  The figure cited in the relevant chapter regarding non-returned salary overpayments to public servants was &euro;4.6 million.  That is the figure we all saw - and by which we went - in the chapter when the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was published last year.  Towards the end of that meeting, I asked about the up-to-date figure for the end of 2017.  Matters became vague at that point.  The witnesses told us that new organisations had come in during 2017 and that the figures for the end of 2016 would not be comparable with those for the end of 2017.<\/p> <p>  When I consulted the Comptroller and Auditor General, we established that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection had not been under the National Shared Services Office in 2016 but that it was in 2017 and had had a significant influence on the &euro;4.6 million figure.  I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to prepare a chart for us showing the total figure of uncollected salary overpayments across all Departments at year-end.<\/p><p>He went through the 900 pages of his appropriation accounts report and at the end of every Vote he came up with the figures, which were scattered throughout the 900 pages of his report.  A document was submitted to us yesterday.  I asked that it be circulated yesterday evening because I only saw it yesterday and it is highly relevant.  In addition, I asked him about the other Votes that were not intended to be under the National Shared Services Office, which mainly included teachers and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> The position now is that there are overpayments reported in the appropriation accounts for Votes which the National Shared Services Office provide, namely, human resources, payroll and pensions administration.  The actual figure on the schedule submitted to us across all Departments is &euro;7.5 million.  They are the public Departments.  We were talking about &euro;4.6 million, but in addition to that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#A00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Is that the same year the Chairman is talking about, 2016?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#B00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Yes, across Departments.  In addition to that, because I was conscious of the fact that the Department of Education and Skills, the teachers, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were not included in that figure, I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General about it.  He said that in regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, prisons, education and Army pensions, there is another &euro;8 million in uncollected overpayments in respect of salaries and pensions in those Departments.  The total figure on the schedule we got last night now comes to &euro;15.633 million of uncollected overpayments of salaries and pensions across all Departments.  That is three times higher than the figure we spent several hours discussing last week.  Everything that was said here last week was correct and accurate.  All I am saying is that it just was not the full picture.  There was nothing said that was not accurate.  It twigged with me at the end of the meeting that there was probably a lot not in here, so the &euro;15.633 figure is the full picture and that schedule has been supplied to members today.<\/p> <p>  I want to go through the key figures in that schedule that were not discussed the last day.  The reason I am doing it is because it is totally relevant to last week's meeting.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will come back with an exact report.  The first one I want to highlight is the Office of the Revenue Commissioners where there are uncollected overpayments of &euro;1.512 million in respect of 1,000 people, which is an average of &euro;1,414 per person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Chairman-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#B00400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Just let me finish putting the facts on the record and we will discuss it then because the full picture did not emerge the last day.<\/p> <p>  We then have the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which has &euro;3.2 million in uncollected overpayments.  That is an average of &euro;2,177 per person.  The total figure for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na supplied by the Comptroller and Auditor General last night is &euro;1.8 million, which is an average of &euro;1,711 per case.  The figure for the Department of Education and Skills, which deals with teachers' and non-teachers' pay and pensions, is &euro;5.7 million but I do not have the figure for the exact number of people involved.<\/p> <p>  In addition to that &euro;15.633 million, I do not see the Health Service Executive, HSE, mentioned, which accounts for one third of the public service.  The figure is probably over &euro;20 million.  We will first write to the HSE for the equivalent figures.  I will call Deputy Kelly shortly, but will the Comptroller and Auditor General explain the reason the HSE is under the Department of Health and that Department does not include the HSE overpayments?  It appears that other agencies under Departments are not included either.

In terms of what happened, essentially we extended the chain for giving instructions for what is the appropriate pay.  The National Shared Services Office has two wings to it.  One is the human resources, HR, and pension administration function and then there is the actual payment function.  Some organisations are managed by the National Shared Services Office in terms of a HR and pension administration function, but not all of their payroll is included.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, DEASP, is the big one in that regard, and it has substantial payments.<\/p> <p>  A further complication is that the HR function being done by the National Shared Services Office on behalf of DEASP identified some overpayments.<\/p><p>There is a figure within the &euro;4.5 million relating to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, but that is not only for overpayments but the closing off of cases.

For those that are engaged with national shared services the total is &euro;7.5 million, as mentioned in the Chapter.

For example, the Department of Justice and Equality is covered but An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Army Pensions are not; the Department of Health might be covered but the HSE is not, and the Department of Education and Skills is covered but teachers and third level institutions are not.  This tells us something about the shared services system, irrespective of the overpayments.  Why did we set up this service and then not use it?  It is not only the Oireachtas but many other organisations and agencies that are not covered.  We need further information in regard to the move to shared services from a value for money perspective.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned that we do not have the full picture.  Everybody could come before the committee and tell us only part of the story but what we need is the full picture.  There are issues arising out of last weeks' meeting that we now need to interrogate further on the basis of the information that has been uncovered, which is frustrating for the committee.

One of my objectives in doing the Chapter was to surface this issue.  The figure for the Department of Education and Skills is substantial.  We have reported previously on overpayments to teachers.  The point was made last week that in a large payroll administration there will be overpayments from time to time.  It is not news that there is some level of overpayment in any organisation.  The difficulty was that with the introduction of shared services there appeared to be an increase across the board in the overpayments that we being recorded.  That is why I decided to focus on what was happening in national shared services.  The framework that we were using for analysing it could be used by any of the State bodies, including the HSE or the Department of Education and Skills in regard to the teachers' payroll, to review their own systems and to identify ways that they could prevent overpayments occurring so that the minimum necessary amount of overpayment is incurred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#C01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Has any analysis been undertaken of the likely saving if some of these organisations moved to shared services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#C01300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518080400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Almost all of the target groups to be brought within national shared services are in now, particularly those under the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.

We made clear in our letter to Apple that we would not discuss the merits of that case but it referenced the case as its reason for not wanting to come.  <br\/><br\/>Ryanair wrote back and said it had an extensive programme with union recognition and does not have the management resources available to come in and talk to us.  <br\/><br\/>Kerry Group said it is a large company but is not in a position to attend.  <br\/><br\/>Glanbia has sent a detailed, helpful letter to our committee in our consideration of the matter.  It gives an example of how a large multinational, which Glanbia is, interacts with the Revenue Commissioners.  I ask people to read that letter.  It highlights what it considers the excellent Revenue online service.  It says it is part of the large cases division.  It highlights the fact there is a nominated person in the Revenue to deal with all of Glanbia's affairs, which it finds most helpful.  The letter is from Siobh&aacute;n Talbot, who is the group managing director.  Talking about the way it deals with Revenue, she says: &quot;In fact we consider that this should be part of Ireland's offering to attract foreign direct investment i.e. make it known that Ireland has a best-in-class tax administration including both efficient online systems (e.g. ROS) and availability of senior revenue personnel to resolve technical issues promptly and efficiently.&quot;  That is praise of the Revenue Commissioners from Glanbia.  She says from her dealings with other countries, the Irish Revenue is top of the class.  We want to say that.  She has given us useful information that we will consider as part of our report.  <br\/><br\/>Pfizer has written to us.  It said &quot;Pfizer appreciates Ireland's commitment to the 12.5% corporate income tax rate.&quot;  It thinks that is quite important.<br\/><br\/>GlaxoSmithKline wrote to us and discussed its availability to come in.  <br\/><br\/>Google said it is not in a position to attend.  <br\/><br\/>Cement Roadstone said it is part of the Revenue's large case division and has direct dealings with the Revenue, which it highlights in a positive way.  <br\/><br\/>Some of them have replied with particular comments that we will take on board.  Deputy Cullinane had asked about that.  We discussed GlaxoSmithKline briefly in private session last week.  I thank it for its acceptance of the invitation and for making contact with the secretariat to make the necessary arrangements.  While it is an offer we may take up at some point in the future, in our current examination it would not be representative of the multinational sector to only have one company in.  I propose we write to GlaxoSmithKline to thank it and formally communicate our decision.  We will agree not to invite it in at this time.  We are not saying we will not invite it in but just not immediately.  <br\/><br\/>There are a couple of letters there.  We will be holding a private session next week with Brian Keegan, the director of Chartered Accountants Ireland, who will give a briefing to the committee on this area and it will be followed by public engagement with Mr. Keegan on the morning of 22 February.  Mr. Keegan has considerable expertise in this field and he will assist the committee and the public in our understanding by way of that attendance at the public meeting.  We will be completing our examination of that topic with a further engagement from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners on the afternoon of 22 February.  We will have an impartial expert here on the morning and a wrap-up session with Revenue and the Department of Finance to deal with the issues that will emerge in the public briefing session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#D02900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>There has been a spotlight on Ireland for some time now in terms of corporation tax.  Some of it is good and some of it not so good in terms of the perception of how corporation tax is applied in Ireland.  We have the European Commission's judgment on Apple.  Generally there has been what I would regard as a very negative interpretation of how the Irish tax code applies to multinationals.  I have my own concerns as a citizen and a public representative.  We were trying to establish as a Committee for Public Accounts how multinationals see our tax code, how they interact with it and Revenue so we can learn from it and do a report on the back of it.  It is disappointing that all but one have not taken up the opportunity to come before the committee.  I do not know whether that says more about them or us; I would say it says more about them.  We should commend the one company that was in a position to come to us.  Notwithstanding the companies sending us information that may or may not be useful to us, what we were looking for was these companies to come.  We cannot compel them.  Their attendance was requested on a voluntary basis to help us understand how they interact with the tax code as an organisation.  These companies make a lot of money here.  They are very profitable companies.  Some of their interactions with the tax code can cost the taxpayer money.  In my view, we had a duty to follow up on it and I commend the Chairman for taking it on as an initiative.  We cannot compel them to come.  It says something about the multinationals that operate here that they were not prepared to come before the Committee of Public Accounts to help us understand how they, as companies, interact with the tax code.  It is not good from their perspective and I want to put that on the record.  I commend GlaxoSmithKline as the one company that was prepared to come in and talk to us.  It should also be noted that many of the companies that have refused to come before the Committee of Public Accounts appeared before similar committees in Wales, England, the US and other parts of Europe.  They have form in attending similar committees in different countries but were not in a position to come to this committee in this State.  People can make up their own minds on that when they consider it is the one country in which they would not attend at the committee despite the controversy around how multinationals operate here.  It speaks volumes for them and it is disappointing that they have decided not to take the opportunity to come before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#E00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I was going to make a very similar point.  It has not just been picked out of thin air.  The request came on foot of a chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and its purpose was to better understand the interaction.  It means we have to assume things because we do not have available information that we can draw from through engagement with the companies.  It means our assumptions may or may not be right.  It is actually quite useful for us to know what their engagement is like with Revenue.  There could have been other things we could have found out that would give a better public understanding, as well as a better understanding for the committee of how this works.  The fact the sustainability of corporate taxes has been highlighted is important for us because understanding what exactly is going on might inform future policy.<\/p><p>That may or may not be to the advantage of some multinationals in the future so it is disappointing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#E00300","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Were ten invitations sent out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#F00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Ten or 11.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#F00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I counted ten here.

I missed out on the Kerry Group.  The Chairman might come back.  I am just making my point and I will not take up too much time.  Could the Chairman tell me what the Kerry Group said?  Again, it has been put in perspective.  This arose from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report regarding corporation tax and what appeared to be a huge variation in the level of tax collected.  Arising from that variation, we were looking to engage with multinationals.  A thumbs up to a committee is not a good way to deal with a public accounts committee.  It is literally a thumbs up.  If companies are proudly paying their taxes, as we all must, they should have no fear of coming before us.  Some of them might have written very positive letters and told us that but it would be nice to hear that and engage with them.  GlaxoSmithKline is one exception and has been rightly praised.  I visited Cardiff with a member of the committee and we know well that they appeared before the committees in England.  I cannot remember whether it was England or Wales.  Perhaps they did not like the experience there.<\/p> <p>  What I was told there was that what had come out with regard to Ireland was seriously questionable.  I do not want to repeat that as gospel.  That was what was said to us, so serious questions must be asked.  I would have thought that at the very least, those companies associated with Ireland, although they are much bigger, like Cement Roadstone, would proudly come before us.  Mr. Ryanair has an opinion on me as a cyclist and on lots of things and I would have thought he would have jumped, or maybe flown, at the opportunity to speak to us here about tax matters.  The way the Chairman phrased it was very general.  We were not going into specifics so I must say that I am really disappointed.  I suppose it is pointless to ask them to reflect - multinationals do not seem to reflect - and come back to us but for the record, this is a golden opportunity to come before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#F00600","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>For the record, the Kerry Group said that \"in relation to the subject matter of your invitation, we do not believe we have anything specific to add to your enquiries in relation to the Irish Revenue Commissioners administration of corporate tax.\"  The letter goes on to say that the Kerry Group had a diary problem.

That is agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 1059 is correspondence from Mr Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, dated 31 January 2018, providing a response to queries on management of claims by the State Claims Agency and the principle of open disclosure.  This is something to which we should return when the NTMA appears before us with its financial statements, which it normally has in the first half of the year.  This is a very important letter because according to the NTMA, the estimated liability at the end of 2017 was &euro;2.662 billion.  It is overwhelming.<\/p> <p>  I want to highlight a few items in Mr. Breen's letter because it is an issue about which everyone talks.  First of all, he is very critical of the legal profession representing clients.  This letter says that sometimes things take time but that this can happen where the settlement demands made by the plaintiff's lawyers are significantly overstated.  Mr. Breen goes on to say that the State Claims Agency has direct experience where solicitors acting on behalf of plaintiffs have originally demanded a multiple of two or three times the figure they eventually settled for.<\/p> <p>  He instances one case where a claim was put in for &euro;26 million in compensation and settled for &euro;12 million.  He goes on to say that there are occasions where faced with the individual plaintiff's law firm whose settlement demands were excessive, the only way the State Claims Agency can discharge its duty to the taxpayer is to take the case to court.  He is quite scathing about certain members of the legal profession.  He does not name them.<\/p> <p>  He goes on to talk about the Legal Services Regulation Act 2016, which provides for the making of regulations to introduce pre-action protocols.  They have not been implemented.  The letter states that the State Claims Agency has on its own initiative pioneered the introduction of interim payments in the form of periodic payment orders in 74 cases since 2010 but that out of the 74 cases, 15 plaintiffs did not proceed with them after a short period of time and asked for their lump sum because of the lack of a legislative basis backing up periodic payment orders system.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Breen highlighted the fact that most of the claims involving almost &euro;2 billion are in respect of clinical negligence claims while the others are general claims and that a total of 9,956 claims were active at the end of 2017 totalling &euro;2.662 billion.  There are 2,976 clinical cases with an average estimate of &euro;666,000 to deal with each of them based on its figures.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Breen then goes on to the issue of open disclosure.  I just stopped reading at this stage.  The letter states that there were reports in 2008, 2009 and 2013; a review in 2014; and training for staff in 2015.  On and on it goes.  We have not seen any result from open disclosure yet.  I am highlighting those points because it would take too long to read the letter and just noting and publishing it would not do the public a service because it needs to know the extent of involvement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#F01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I raised this last week or the week before because I do not think I have ever seen a situation where people have come out of a court having settled and talked about the payment securing the future of a child.  There is a crossover between inadequate public services and the cases that are taken.  It is almost a self-fulfilling prophecy when one has that kind of contingent liability.  When one looks at the case where the plaintiff settled for &euro;12 million having originally sought &euro;26 million and one looks at the contingent liability, one can see that built into that will be the kind of costs about which we are talking, which are legal costs, that would be more properly spent on services.  If there was open disclosure, probably a very sizeable amount of that would be very significantly reduced and we might avoid the trauma of people having to spend years in the courts.  We need to do a piece of work on this.  It is too big an issue to just leave to a very good and full response from the NTMA.  It is as much about process as it is about value for money.  Given that it is the dominant one, I suspect we will probably need to get in the Department of Health with regard to moving to the open disclosure approach.<\/p><p>It is not enough just to look at the financial side of it.

We have put quite a spotlight on this sector and published a report.  Subsequently, we had a number of independent - I use that word advisedly - examinations into a number of issues.  Outstanding is the Thorn review in Limerick.  We have subsequently received new information that was on the front pages of some newspapers at the weekend that the university, potentially, misled the Committee of Public Accounts and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I want to hear from the comptroller if that is a fact.  I do not always believe what I see in the newspapers but I want it clarified at least.<\/p> <p>  We have two reports which are still outstanding from the HEA on spin-out companies and intellectual property.  We were told that the global one looking at policy, governance and whether changes needed to be made was to be published in January but we are now into February and it has not happened.  The report on Waterford IT has been with legal advisers since last December and has still not been published.  We are waiting for these reports so that the committee can do its work.<\/p> <p>  There seems to be a lot there but, looking at the work programme, none of it is scheduled up to April.  Funding in the third level sector was described as the \"wild west\" by a committee member before and we were trying to establish whether that was the case, whether good governance was in place and whether improvements could be made.  We have done a report, but that was only the start of our work.  There are a lot of reports and information we need from the HEA and that is not even to get onto the education and training board for Kildare-Wicklow, which falls under remit of the Department of Education and Skills.  We need to give that some attention.<\/p> <p>  My second point on the work programme is that I have consistently asked for RT&Eacute; to come before the committee.  We have just spent the last 15 minutes talking about multinationals that are not compelled to come before the committee.  We asked them to do so and they have refused.  We have not asked RT&Eacute; to come before the committee even though &euro;170 million of taxpayers' money is given to it.  It is one third of the line Department's funding, but the Accounting Officer was not even able to answer basic questions on it when he was before us.  I have specific concerns about allegations of bogus self-employment.  I have met senior staff in RT&Eacute; who are concerned and persons from a trade union representing journalists to discuss this issue, which appears to be a problem within the organisation.<\/p> <p>  There is another issue I want the committee to raise which has implications for Revenue.  While they are not doing anything wrong, senior broadcasters in RT&Eacute; are availing of the opportunity which is available to them to set up companies into which their salaries, or fees, are paid.  That was previously the case with hospital consultants and we dealt with it.  That process allows those broadcasters to reduce the amount of tax they pay.  They do not pay PAYE or PRSI but rather corporation tax.  We saw problems in relation to hospital consultants.  Are there similar problems here?  I cannot say and I am not making any allegations.  It is certainly worth examining as is bogus self-employment.<\/p> <p>  Another issue people have relates to the &euro;170 million, which was established to be the majority of the money.  I ask that this be prioritised.  I have raised it gently in the past and I am being a bit more assertive on this occasion.  It is important and the issues need to be examined.<\/p> <p>  On the third level sector, I cannot understand why the reports have still not been published by the HEA.  I am getting a little exasperated that we are getting letters from it, including letters sent to me personally from the head of the HEA, stating the reports would be published in January.  In fact, they were originally supposed to be published last October but were delayed.  While legal may be looking at some elements of some of them, two or three months is an extraordinary amount of time for them to be in the hands of legal within the HEA.  Can we follow those up again?  Once we know where they are at, we need to come back next week and put a focus on it.<\/p> <p>  I want to hear from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General specifically whether it was misled by the University of Limerick rather than to take that second or third hand from a newspaper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#H00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I will call the members first and then we will come back to the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#H00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I will be brief as Deputy Cullinane has more or less listed the issues I have.  Our work programme needs to change a little bit.  A lot of things are too pushed out.  Getting on to the universities and colleges, I have serious concerns about the evidence given here by the HEA and the manner in which that was done.  I also have concerns about the way reports and investigations are being done.  Timelines are not being met.  Why is that?  It compounds the issues we reported on in our initial report on the third level sector.  There are various reports and we need the Comptroller and Auditor General to verify whether they are accurate.  There are other reports on private consultants which are also of concern.  We still have outstanding questions regarding a number of universities and colleges.  I have continuously raised issues on CIT to which I have not received full answers.  UCC is signing a major contract to sponsor a concert hall in Cork and it is frightening to think it has not learned any lessons.  The whole issue on third level colleges is to get the answers we were promised and finding out if further information was kept from the committee and, possibly, the Comptroller and Auditor General and dealing with all of that.  We need to wrap that up in a nice bow in the committee, not let it drift further.<\/p> <p>  Through various forums and in the D&aacute;il, I raised the following matter a long time ago and it has now been followed up by others.  I refer to evidence given here by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on IT contracts.  I have read the transcript of the evidence a number of times and it raises serious concerns.  We spoke about this earlier.  The Comptroller and Auditor General referenced Accenture and the contracts there.  It is obvious that this did not transpire or come out through this forum notwithstanding very detailed questions, most of which, I note, were from Deputy MacSharry.  We have to get to the bottom of this soon because it is a very serious issue.<\/p> <p>  I support Deputy Cullinane on the issues with regard to RT&Eacute;.  It is very much in the public interest that we deal with those.

I remember when the head of the Revenue Commissioners appeared before the finance committee and came here the next day.  We asked him about company structures being set up and he said the Revenue is very clear that it never looks through the eyes of a company onto its employees.  That has never happened.

At times we think we should change the law if it is believed what is going on is not acceptable.  If, like me, someone has a strong social conscience, he or she might be concerned that this is State money going into RT&Eacute; or these agencies, but the point I am making is that what they are doing is fully legal.  What many of the multinational companies do is also legal.  We have heard this morning about overpayments and that we have to get value for money, but the head of Revenue is telling us that a presenter in RT&Eacute; whose only client is RT&Eacute; can set up a company to be paid on his or her own behalf in order to plan his or her income and that it is perfectly legal to do so.  We have to be clear - that is the reality under the tax code.  Perhaps there are other ways in which we might progress and we should change many of these things.  That is a point worth making.  Our job is to highlight where the State is not receiving value for money and go through Votes forensically, at which we have been doing a great job.  Sometimes, however, there are laws which have to be changed and there are great arguments for so doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#H00900","speaker":"1369","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>We always expected that we would have to come back to the university sector and there is now far more reason to do so.

I had intended to address some of the issues raised by the whistleblowers about the Thorn report and with which they were not happy.  It would be kind to the Higher Education Authority to state it was less than impressive when its representatives were before the committee.  The very fact that we are still waiting for some significant responses is very disappointing.  I hope to see that issue included in the work programme soon.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Peter Burke's point, I do not disagree that some of the things being done are fully legal, but they are only fully legal for a certain portion of the population.  It is very useful for us to understand what is going on in what could be described as bogus self-employment.  If everybody were to do that, we would not be here because there would be no money to run services.  We need to understand this.  I see absolutely no reason we would not look at the issue in the same way as we try to look at the issue of corporation tax, that is, by looking at one particular organisation, in this case the national broadcaster, in order to gain an understanding.  The issue is not unique to one sector.

We ahad a very extensive discussion about recognising the independence of RT&Eacute;.  It is the national broadcaster and none of us wants to ask questions about the type of programmes it produces and why.  That is entirely a matter for it.  There is, however, merit in the committee looking at these issues - there are two separate issues - because there are potential implications for Revenue. The first is that of bogus self-employment.  This is where casual work and short-term contracts are being offered to workers when permanent contracts were once in place.  That is becoming more of the norm than the exception in RT&Eacute;.  The concern is being expressed by staff within the company.  It is a separate issue from the other point about whether persons on high salaries are setting up companies.  I have made the point that this is a perfectly legal structure, but the point has also been made that persons on a salary of &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 a year are not in a position to set up such companies.  They are for those on big salaries.  Whether they are hospital consultants or presenters in RT&Eacute; on six-figure salaries, the reality is that it is happening and legal, but there is a cost to the Exchequer.  We cannot assume that because something happened in one area it happened in another, but we did see in the case of hospital consultants all sorts of expenses being claimed which potentially should not have been claimed and further reduced their tax liabilities.  We have a responsibility on behalf of taxpayers to probe this area to ensure there is value for money if we are the ones who are signing off on it.  <\/p> <p>  There are many other related issues.

The Dormant Accounts Fund is managed by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which collects the dormant balances from the institutions.  The holders or beneficiaries of accounts that have been declared dormant have the right subsequently to reclaim their money at any time and the NTMA repays funds as required from reserves.  Responsibility for disbursements from the fund transferred to the Minister for Rural and Community Development in July 2017 from the then Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Prior to June 2016, responsibility for the disbursement system was with the then Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. <\/p> <p>  Figure 1 in the report document shows the movements in the Dormant Accounts Fund since it commenced operations in 2003.  There was an initial transfer into the fund of &euro;172 million.  Net transfers to the fund were an average of almost &euro;26 million a year between 2004 and 2016.  What is perhaps most striking is the trend increase in the fund&rsquo;s net assets position, which increased from &euro;132 million at the end of 2010 to &euro;259 million at the end of 2016.  Net assets include an amount set aside in a reserve fund to meet potential future claims for repayment of balances in dormant accounts; the provision was just over &euro;76 million at the end of 2016.  Figure 1 shows the increase that has occurred since 2010 in the net assets figure.<\/p> <p>  Amendments made to the dormant accounts legislation in 2012 require the relevant Minister to set up a disbursement scheme for a period of up to three years.  The scheme must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  A disbursement scheme covering the period December 2013 to November 2016 was approved by Government in December 2013.  The scheme set out guiding principles and the priority areas for disbursements.  A statutory review of the disbursement scheme was due within three years of the scheme being adopted, that is, by December 2016.  This review had not been carried out at the time of the examination.  Also under the Acts, annual action plans for the disbursement of funds must be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas indicating the spending Departments, the proposed recipients of grant funding, the programmes or projects to be supported and the proposed amounts of funding.  While action plans were presented for 2014 and 2016, no plan was presented for 2015. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure of funding allocated to Dormant Accounts Fund measures may be made over one or more years.  Planned expenditure for a given year is provided for in the relevant Department's annual Estimates.  The examination found that implementing Departments significantly underspent on programmes relative to what was planned.  In total, they incurred dormant accounts programme expenditure of just under &euro;29 million for the period 2012 to 2016.  This represented only 44% of the total amount made available for spending in the relevant estimates for the same period.  The level of underspend for all implementing Departments ranged from 5% to 94%, as shown in Figure 2 in the report document.  In Figure 2, for each of the implementing Departments there are two bars.  The lighter coloured one is the amount provided in the Estimate and the darker one is the amount that was actually spent.  It also indicates the percentage of total funding made available but not spent.<\/p> <p>  A lack of preparedness appears to have been the main factor causing the underspending.  Delays in implementing projects and delays in having a disbursement scheme or action plan in place were cited by Departments as the main reasons for this.  A low level of uptake for some schemes was another cause cited for the underspend.  The report provides further detail on the pattern of underspending on a Department-by-Department basis. <\/p> <p>  Pobal manages certain Dormant Accounts Fund measures on behalf of some Departments.<\/p><p>In the period from 2012 to 2016 Pobal administered 29 measures, disbursing a total of &euro;10.2 million.  It received fees of &euro;2.55 million in the same period for providing this service, the cost of which was met from the fund under the terms of the legislation.  The fee expense was equivalent to 27% of the amount disbursed.  The National Treasury Management Agency and Departments administering their own measures bear the administration costs in their own budgets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I am joined by my colleagues from the Department, Mr. Fergal Costello, principal officer, finance unit; Mr. Kenneth Jordan, principal officer; and Mr. Eddie Forsyth, assistant principal officer, rural strategy division.  Also in attendance are Ms Deirdre Kearney, community and voluntary supports division, and Mr. William Hughes, finance unit.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, the Department of Rural and Community Development was established in July 2017.  Statutory responsibility for the Dormant Accounts Fund was transferred to the Minister for Rural and Community Development at the time.  The legislation governing the Dormant Accounts Fund provides a framework for the disbursement of funds for measures targeted at socially, economically and educationally disadvantaged persons and people with a disability.  Under the Dormant Accounts Act 2012 and following the transfer of functions, the Minister for Rural and Community Development is responsible for the administration of the processes by which the Government approves programmes and projects to which funding may be disbursed from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  In real terms, this involves the development of three-year disbursement schemes and the subsequent preparation of annual action plans to give effect to the disbursement scheme.<\/p> <p>  Under the 2012 Act, the Minister is required to make a disbursement scheme for a period not exceeding three years.  The disbursement scheme sets out guiding principles for disbursements and specifies priority areas under the aforementioned headings of economic and social disadvantage, educational disadvantage and persons with a disability.  The 2012 Act also provides that the Minister shall prepare an action plan at least once a year to give effect to the disbursement scheme.  Actions plans contain details of programmes and projects to be funded under the scheme and set out the maximum amount proposed for disbursement to each programme or project set out in the action plan.  There is also a further requirement in the 2012 Act that the Minister shall prepare an annual report on the disbursement of moneys from the Dormant Accounts Fund.<\/p> <p>  Since its inception in 2001, the fund has seen a number of transfers of responsibility.  Most recently, in 2012 the Dormant Accounts Board was dissolved and its statutory functions were transferred to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  In 2016 these functions transferred again to the then Minster for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  As I noted, the functions transferred to the Minister for Rural and Community Development in July 2017.  The Department of Rural and Community Development is, therefore, now responsible for co-ordinating the preparation and administration of the disbursement scheme and the annual action plans across government.  In undertaking these functions the Department fully recognises the importance of the Dormant Accounts Fund to the provision of programmes and projects aimed at disadvantaged groups.  For example, the 2017 action plan commits funding to support youth and community projects through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and to invest in community sport and physical activity hubs through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We want to ensure disbursement schemes and action plans are progressed in an efficient and effective manner and that we maximise the positive social impact of the fund.<\/p> <p>  With direct regard to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, it raises a number of issues relating to the operation of the scheme, including levels of disbursement and compliance with statutory requirements.  It recommends that the statutory review of the 2013 disbursement scheme be carried out to identify how well the scheme was implemented and how future disbursement schemes can be designed to ensure the objectives set out for the fund are met.  The report states the review should consider the reasons for the low level of disbursements; whether allocating funds to measures which do not fully use the resources prevent other programmes from being funded; and how the available funding can best be applied.  The response of the Department of Rural and Community Development provided in September 2017 states the Department is committed to reviewing all aspects of the administration of the dormant accounts disbursement scheme as part of its forthcoming work programme and that the review will consider the issues detailed in the report.<\/p> <p>  Based on the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, it is clear that the scheme is not operating in a manner which maximises the impact of the fund for those groups at which the funding is targeted.  We are fully committed to completing the planned review in 2018.  The review which is commencing will analyse the issues raised in the report, identify the administrative and other changes necessary to ensure more efficient and effective operation of the scheme and make proposals for how the changes will be implemented on completion of the review.  We have provided a copy of the draft terms of reference in the briefing material circulated to members.  <\/p> <p>  I look forward to assisting the committee in its detailed examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

Despite this, Mr. McCarthy did not refer to any figure and the document does not feature a single euro symbol.

Again, there is no reference to figures or money, although I note there is a reference to money towards the end of page 5 when a figure of &euro;40 million is mentioned.

It does not involve an implication or an expectation that all the money will be spent in that year.  For example, we got a commitment in December 2014 for Garda youth diversion projects, and clearly it would have been impossible to spend any of that money in December 2014.  We work in partnership with non-governmental organisations, NGOs, which means we have a choice between expanding existing services, giving additional funding to NGOs with which we are already partnered and, alternatively, going out and inviting expressions of interest.  Whatever we choose to do, we have a duty to assess applications properly and make sure we are getting value for money.

I would like to put this in perspective.  Last night, I took a phone call from an organisation in Connemara, Teagmh&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g, which has just received a letter from the local ETB - I keep calling it the VEC - to tell it that it is going to close.  This is a special centre for children who drop out of school and it has been told it is going to close.  I am looking at massive amounts of funds here.  I just heard about  it last night and I am going to get more details on it.  Last year, all the politicians in Galway were called to a meeting because the youth federation, or an organisation like that, was about to close due to a lack of money.  Two weeks ago, we got a call about an essential service where access takes place in time.  It is about to close at the end of March.  Various social enterprise ideas are coming forward.  One example involves repairing bicycles.  It cannot get a leg in to get help.  That is just the background.  I have mentioned a minute sample.  Comhlachas na gComharchumainn, which represents all the co-operatives in the Gaeltachts and islands throughout Ireland, has made presentations to all of us.  It is struggling to exist.  There is something seriously wrong here.  I do not wish to blame Mr. McCarthy individually.  Is there any feedback?  Is there any mechanism?  We will take the co-operative movement.

It gives a whole new meaning to \"dormant\".  At least some people can get money out of that account even if they come back but this seems to be more dormant than the dormant account the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, manages.  We will be doing a periodic report.  I do not think this system works.  I do not think it needs a review.  There has been &euro;25 million sitting there for years with nothing happening, with organisations crying out for it which serve the most deserving groups of people in society with regard to people with economic and social disadvantage, educational disadvantage and persons with disabilities.  That &euro;25 million has been sitting there for nine years and the witnesses do not even know its position.  That is woeful.<\/p> <p>  One of the problems, though not caused by the witnesses since they are the people administering it, is that the chart from the Comptroller and Auditor General indicates that there are schemes being administered by ten different Departments.  That is on page 105, chart 7.3 in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government had a major underspend, as did the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Health, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs which spent only 6% of what was approved, the Department of Education and Skills which spent 25%, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection which spent half of it, and the Prison Service which spent only a fraction of it.  It is no wonder that this system does not work when it is spread across ten different Departments.  There is a fund managed by the NTMA and it is a good idea to have it.  The witnesses make a provision to have some money to go back.  They engaged Pobal to administer it, having come up with the policy, and then there are different schemes across ten different Departments.  How could anybody know where to go for this money?  It is no wonder it is lost in the system.<\/p> <p>  I have to contrast this.  How much has the Department of Rural and Community Development paid out over the years?  Some &euro;275 million.  We have to look at this with regard to value for money and good public administration.  We all look at what we call the sports capital programme.  It hands out that type of money every time there is a round.  The applicants know what to do.  It is well publicised.  They get their forms in.  The level of detail they have to get in is extraordinary.  There is a sunset clause and the Department, without having to go to Pobal or ten other Departments, is able to administer it, make sure it functions properly, get the documentation in after approval is given and pay for the works when they are done, subject to audit, verification and so on.  That system works well.  This system is not working at all.  The Department would be better off asking the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport if it would second half a dozen staff to the Department of Rural and Community Development, and getting rid of Pobal and the ten different Departments.  It is not just a question of the three people.  They are probably busy drawing up schemes and policy statements for ten different Departments, and ten Departments are drawing up schemes to implement it.  It is the worst level of duplication across Departments that I have encountered in my time as Chairman here.  None of it is the witnesses' fault.  They inherited this last year.  I would be of a mind, when we are issuing our interim report, to state that the system as it operates has to be called to a halt.  It is not transparent.  It is all over the place.  Nobody can follow it.  The Department even has trouble following it.  There is money as much as nine years old with no sunset clause.  We all have sight of one Department or another which would administer a scheme of this scale and nature with its hand tied.<\/p> <p>  Maybe people will utterly disagree with me but I am amazed at how poorly this system operates.  I have no confidence that it will be any better next year.  This matter of calling it a timing difference and aligning funding coming from the Dormant Account Fund versus the annual Estimates is, as just mentioned, something done by the Department I just mentioned.  It gets an Estimate for a programme and we know it will be a couple of years before some of the funding will be drawn down for the sports capital programme.  There is a prototype in the public service of how to administer a fund like this.  One of our jobs is, when we find something working well, to try to replicate it in other areas which do similar work in a very cumbersome manner.  This is designed to be cumbersome.  It involves ten different Departments and ten different types of scheme and there is probably a variety of different schemes within those Departments.  It would be impossible for people to deal with.  Without going into further detail, I think the witnesses understand our frustration.  Deputy Burke started on the matter and other people have spoken on it.  I do not think this system is working well and the public service is capable of getting a far more streamlined and effective service to deliver the money.  When we are back in our constituency clinics tomorrow, we will all have people from groups suffering from economic and social disadvantage, educational disadvantage, and persons with disability, coming to us to seek funds.  If we tell them that there is &euro;25 million which has not been spent for those years, they will give out to us and ask if we are not doing our job.  Our job is to highlight when we see that a system is broken.  It is almost irredeemable in its current format.  I stress that it is not an issue for the NTMA side of the house.  It is probably doing its end of it fine.  The rest of the system is not working and there is a simple way to make it work in the interests of the citizens that we should be serving.<\/p> <p>  That was a bit of a speech as well as a question.  I call Deputy Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#T01900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":558,"content":"<p>The witnesses made a statement earlier that a scheme may never have got off the ground and never reached the level of activity or uptake envisaged.  I think that goes to the heart of the matter.  This is not designed for the kind of uptake and profile of how things happen at community level.  My understanding is that it is so cumbersome to apply for that there are people and organisations that looked at it and simply dismissed it.  These are not organisations that do not need money or where &euro;1 million would not make a difference.  There could be 25 such organisations around the country if that was the case.  How many of the years we are talking about are years when the troika was here?  We were told that we were bankrupt.  People scrapped for every single shilling.  Some of those communities were among the most impacted.<\/p><p>This is not designed for the people it is supposed to benefit.  How many people from disadvantaged communities said this would work for them and this is what they needed?  I am not saying there should not be oversight and good accounting for things.  However, much of our community exists in a very informal way.  Some organisations have to exist in that kind of informal environment, yet we are looking at a very rigid system where it is difficult to access funding for worthwhile things.  Some of projects brought forward do not get the uptake because they are not what the community requires.  If they were in place and the community required them, it would use them.  It tells us something about who is designing the system for whom.<\/p><p> If there is going to be a redesign, the witnesses will have to engage the communities that are going to be the benefices of this scheme in that design.  It has to be designed in such a way that it is flexible enough for people to engage with it and not spend a lot of administrative time they do not have applying for it or drawing it down.  There is a big deficiency.  I agree with the Chairman about it not just being a review but a redesign.  I do not think Pobal can be blamed for administering a scheme it did not design.  The administration of it should be flexible enough.<\/p><p> I want to ask about a few of the schemes.  There was about &euro;500,000 of an underspend in the community-based model for people with dementia.  Has that been spent?  In respect of training and support services for homecarers, there was &euro;500,000 but up to 2016, nothing was spent.  Has that been spent?  On the Arts in Education initiative, &euro;50,000 was drawn down from &euro;280,000.  Has the rest of it been drawn down?<\/p><p> I refer to &euro;1 million allocated to establish a monitoring programme under the Department of Justice and Equality.
