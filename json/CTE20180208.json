Apologies have been received from Deputy McDonald.<\/p> <p>  Are the minutes of our meeting of 1 February agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Next on our agenda is an issue that I wish to discuss arising from the minutes.  Representatives from the National Shared Services Office appeared before us last week.  It is the body that manages the payroll and pension payments of what we all understood to be the majority of the public service, excluding HSE staff, garda&iacute; and teachers.  The figure cited in the relevant chapter regarding non-returned salary overpayments to public servants was &euro;4.6 million.  That is the figure we all saw - and by which we went - in the chapter when the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was published last year.  Towards the end of that meeting, I asked about the up-to-date figure for the end of 2017.  Matters became vague at that point.  The witnesses told us that new organisations had come in during 2017 and that the figures for the end of 2016 would not be comparable with those for the end of 2017.<\/p> <p>  When I consulted the Comptroller and Auditor General, we established that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection had not been under the National Shared Services Office in 2016 but that it was in 2017 and had had a significant influence on the &euro;4.6 million figure.  I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to prepare a chart for us showing the total figure of uncollected salary overpayments across all Departments at year-end.<\/p><p>He went through the 900 pages of his appropriation accounts report and at the end of every Vote he came up with the figures, which were scattered throughout the 900 pages of his report.  A document was submitted to us yesterday.  I asked that it be circulated yesterday evening because I only saw it yesterday and it is highly relevant.  In addition, I asked him about the other Votes that were not intended to be under the National Shared Services Office, which mainly included teachers and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> The position now is that there are overpayments reported in the appropriation accounts for Votes which the National Shared Services Office provide, namely, human resources, payroll and pensions administration.  The actual figure on the schedule submitted to us across all Departments is &euro;7.5 million.  They are the public Departments.  We were talking about &euro;4.6 million, but in addition to that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#A00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Is that the same year the Chairman is talking about, 2016?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#B00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Yes, across Departments.  In addition to that, because I was conscious of the fact that the Department of Education and Skills, the teachers, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were not included in that figure, I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General about it.  He said that in regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, prisons, education and Army pensions, there is another &euro;8 million in uncollected overpayments in respect of salaries and pensions in those Departments.  The total figure on the schedule we got last night now comes to &euro;15.633 million of uncollected overpayments of salaries and pensions across all Departments.  That is three times higher than the figure we spent several hours discussing last week.  Everything that was said here last week was correct and accurate.  All I am saying is that it just was not the full picture.  There was nothing said that was not accurate.  It twigged with me at the end of the meeting that there was probably a lot not in here, so the &euro;15.633 figure is the full picture and that schedule has been supplied to members today.<\/p> <p>  I want to go through the key figures in that schedule that were not discussed the last day.  The reason I am doing it is because it is totally relevant to last week's meeting.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will come back with an exact report.  The first one I want to highlight is the Office of the Revenue Commissioners where there are uncollected overpayments of &euro;1.512 million in respect of 1,000 people, which is an average of &euro;1,414 per person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Chairman-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#B00400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Just let me finish putting the facts on the record and we will discuss it then because the full picture did not emerge the last day.<\/p> <p>  We then have the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which has &euro;3.2 million in uncollected overpayments.  That is an average of &euro;2,177 per person.  The total figure for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na supplied by the Comptroller and Auditor General last night is &euro;1.8 million, which is an average of &euro;1,711 per case.  The figure for the Department of Education and Skills, which deals with teachers' and non-teachers' pay and pensions, is &euro;5.7 million but I do not have the figure for the exact number of people involved.<\/p> <p>  In addition to that &euro;15.633 million, I do not see the Health Service Executive, HSE, mentioned, which accounts for one third of the public service.  The figure is probably over &euro;20 million.  We will first write to the HSE for the equivalent figures.  I will call Deputy Kelly shortly, but will the Comptroller and Auditor General explain the reason the HSE is under the Department of Health and that Department does not include the HSE overpayments?  It appears that other agencies under Departments are not included either.

In terms of what happened, essentially we extended the chain for giving instructions for what is the appropriate pay.  The National Shared Services Office has two wings to it.  One is the human resources, HR, and pension administration function and then there is the actual payment function.  Some organisations are managed by the National Shared Services Office in terms of a HR and pension administration function, but not all of their payroll is included.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, DEASP, is the big one in that regard, and it has substantial payments.<\/p> <p>  A further complication is that the HR function being done by the National Shared Services Office on behalf of DEASP identified some overpayments.<\/p><p>There is a figure within the &euro;4.5 million relating to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, but that is not only for overpayments but the closing off of cases.

For those that are engaged with national shared services the total is &euro;7.5 million, as mentioned in the Chapter.

For example, the Department of Justice and Equality is covered but An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Army Pensions are not; the Department of Health might be covered but the HSE is not, and the Department of Education and Skills is covered but teachers and third level institutions are not.  This tells us something about the shared services system, irrespective of the overpayments.  Why did we set up this service and then not use it?  It is not only the Oireachtas but many other organisations and agencies that are not covered.  We need further information in regard to the move to shared services from a value for money perspective.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned that we do not have the full picture.  Everybody could come before the committee and tell us only part of the story but what we need is the full picture.  There are issues arising out of last weeks' meeting that we now need to interrogate further on the basis of the information that has been uncovered, which is frustrating for the committee.

One of my objectives in doing the Chapter was to surface this issue.  The figure for the Department of Education and Skills is substantial.  We have reported previously on overpayments to teachers.  The point was made last week that in a large payroll administration there will be overpayments from time to time.  It is not news that there is some level of overpayment in any organisation.  The difficulty was that with the introduction of shared services there appeared to be an increase across the board in the overpayments that we being recorded.  That is why I decided to focus on what was happening in national shared services.  The framework that we were using for analysing it could be used by any of the State bodies, including the HSE or the Department of Education and Skills in regard to the teachers' payroll, to review their own systems and to identify ways that they could prevent overpayments occurring so that the minimum necessary amount of overpayment is incurred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#C01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Has any analysis been undertaken of the likely saving if some of these organisations moved to shared services?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#C01300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1518080400,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Almost all of the target groups to be brought within national shared services are in now, particularly those under the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.

We made clear in our letter to Apple that we would not discuss the merits of that case but it referenced the case as its reason for not wanting to come.  <br\/><br\/>Ryanair wrote back and said it had an extensive programme with union recognition and does not have the management resources available to come in and talk to us.  <br\/><br\/>Kerry Group said it is a large company but is not in a position to attend.  <br\/><br\/>Glanbia has sent a detailed, helpful letter to our committee in our consideration of the matter.  It gives an example of how a large multinational, which Glanbia is, interacts with the Revenue Commissioners.  I ask people to read that letter.  It highlights what it considers the excellent Revenue online service.  It says it is part of the large cases division.  It highlights the fact there is a nominated person in the Revenue to deal with all of Glanbia's affairs, which it finds most helpful.  The letter is from Siobh&aacute;n Talbot, who is the group managing director.  Talking about the way it deals with Revenue, she says: &quot;In fact we consider that this should be part of Ireland's offering to attract foreign direct investment i.e. make it known that Ireland has a best-in-class tax administration including both efficient online systems (e.g. ROS) and availability of senior revenue personnel to resolve technical issues promptly and efficiently.&quot;  That is praise of the Revenue Commissioners from Glanbia.  She says from her dealings with other countries, the Irish Revenue is top of the class.  We want to say that.  She has given us useful information that we will consider as part of our report.  <br\/><br\/>Pfizer has written to us.  It said &quot;Pfizer appreciates Ireland's commitment to the 12.5% corporate income tax rate.&quot;  It thinks that is quite important.<br\/><br\/>GlaxoSmithKline wrote to us and discussed its availability to come in.  <br\/><br\/>Google said it is not in a position to attend.  <br\/><br\/>Cement Roadstone said it is part of the Revenue's large case division and has direct dealings with the Revenue, which it highlights in a positive way.  <br\/><br\/>Some of them have replied with particular comments that we will take on board.  Deputy Cullinane had asked about that.  We discussed GlaxoSmithKline briefly in private session last week.  I thank it for its acceptance of the invitation and for making contact with the secretariat to make the necessary arrangements.  While it is an offer we may take up at some point in the future, in our current examination it would not be representative of the multinational sector to only have one company in.  I propose we write to GlaxoSmithKline to thank it and formally communicate our decision.  We will agree not to invite it in at this time.  We are not saying we will not invite it in but just not immediately.  <br\/><br\/>There are a couple of letters there.  We will be holding a private session next week with Brian Keegan, the director of Chartered Accountants Ireland, who will give a briefing to the committee on this area and it will be followed by public engagement with Mr. Keegan on the morning of 22 February.  Mr. Keegan has considerable expertise in this field and he will assist the committee and the public in our understanding by way of that attendance at the public meeting.  We will be completing our examination of that topic with a further engagement from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners on the afternoon of 22 February.  We will have an impartial expert here on the morning and a wrap-up session with Revenue and the Department of Finance to deal with the issues that will emerge in the public briefing session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#D02900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>There has been a spotlight on Ireland for some time now in terms of corporation tax.  Some of it is good and some of it not so good in terms of the perception of how corporation tax is applied in Ireland.  We have the European Commission's judgment on Apple.  Generally there has been what I would regard as a very negative interpretation of how the Irish tax code applies to multinationals.  I have my own concerns as a citizen and a public representative.  We were trying to establish as a Committee for Public Accounts how multinationals see our tax code, how they interact with it and Revenue so we can learn from it and do a report on the back of it.  It is disappointing that all but one have not taken up the opportunity to come before the committee.  I do not know whether that says more about them or us; I would say it says more about them.  We should commend the one company that was in a position to come to us.  Notwithstanding the companies sending us information that may or may not be useful to us, what we were looking for was these companies to come.  We cannot compel them.  Their attendance was requested on a voluntary basis to help us understand how they interact with the tax code as an organisation.  These companies make a lot of money here.  They are very profitable companies.  Some of their interactions with the tax code can cost the taxpayer money.  In my view, we had a duty to follow up on it and I commend the Chairman for taking it on as an initiative.  We cannot compel them to come.  It says something about the multinationals that operate here that they were not prepared to come before the Committee of Public Accounts to help us understand how they, as companies, interact with the tax code.  It is not good from their perspective and I want to put that on the record.  I commend GlaxoSmithKline as the one company that was prepared to come in and talk to us.  It should also be noted that many of the companies that have refused to come before the Committee of Public Accounts appeared before similar committees in Wales, England, the US and other parts of Europe.  They have form in attending similar committees in different countries but were not in a position to come to this committee in this State.  People can make up their own minds on that when they consider it is the one country in which they would not attend at the committee despite the controversy around how multinationals operate here.  It speaks volumes for them and it is disappointing that they have decided not to take the opportunity to come before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#E00200","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I was going to make a very similar point.  It has not just been picked out of thin air.  The request came on foot of a chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and its purpose was to better understand the interaction.  It means we have to assume things because we do not have available information that we can draw from through engagement with the companies.  It means our assumptions may or may not be right.  It is actually quite useful for us to know what their engagement is like with Revenue.  There could have been other things we could have found out that would give a better public understanding, as well as a better understanding for the committee of how this works.  The fact the sustainability of corporate taxes has been highlighted is important for us because understanding what exactly is going on might inform future policy.<\/p><p>That may or may not be to the advantage of some multinationals in the future so it is disappointing.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#E00300","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Were ten invitations sent out?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#F00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Ten or 11.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#F00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I counted ten here.

I missed out on the Kerry Group.  The Chairman might come back.  I am just making my point and I will not take up too much time.  Could the Chairman tell me what the Kerry Group said?  Again, it has been put in perspective.  This arose from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report regarding corporation tax and what appeared to be a huge variation in the level of tax collected.  Arising from that variation, we were looking to engage with multinationals.  A thumbs up to a committee is not a good way to deal with a public accounts committee.  It is literally a thumbs up.  If companies are proudly paying their taxes, as we all must, they should have no fear of coming before us.  Some of them might have written very positive letters and told us that but it would be nice to hear that and engage with them.  GlaxoSmithKline is one exception and has been rightly praised.  I visited Cardiff with a member of the committee and we know well that they appeared before the committees in England.  I cannot remember whether it was England or Wales.  Perhaps they did not like the experience there.<\/p> <p>  What I was told there was that what had come out with regard to Ireland was seriously questionable.  I do not want to repeat that as gospel.  That was what was said to us, so serious questions must be asked.  I would have thought that at the very least, those companies associated with Ireland, although they are much bigger, like Cement Roadstone, would proudly come before us.  Mr. Ryanair has an opinion on me as a cyclist and on lots of things and I would have thought he would have jumped, or maybe flown, at the opportunity to speak to us here about tax matters.  The way the Chairman phrased it was very general.  We were not going into specifics so I must say that I am really disappointed.  I suppose it is pointless to ask them to reflect - multinationals do not seem to reflect - and come back to us but for the record, this is a golden opportunity to come before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#F00600","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":110,"content":"<p>For the record, the Kerry Group said that \"in relation to the subject matter of your invitation, we do not believe we have anything specific to add to your enquiries in relation to the Irish Revenue Commissioners administration of corporate tax.\"  The letter goes on to say that the Kerry Group had a diary problem.

That is agreed.<\/p> <p>  No. 1059 is correspondence from Mr Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, dated 31 January 2018, providing a response to queries on management of claims by the State Claims Agency and the principle of open disclosure.  This is something to which we should return when the NTMA appears before us with its financial statements, which it normally has in the first half of the year.  This is a very important letter because according to the NTMA, the estimated liability at the end of 2017 was &euro;2.662 billion.  It is overwhelming.<\/p> <p>  I want to highlight a few items in Mr. Breen's letter because it is an issue about which everyone talks.  First of all, he is very critical of the legal profession representing clients.  This letter says that sometimes things take time but that this can happen where the settlement demands made by the plaintiff's lawyers are significantly overstated.  Mr. Breen goes on to say that the State Claims Agency has direct experience where solicitors acting on behalf of plaintiffs have originally demanded a multiple of two or three times the figure they eventually settled for.<\/p> <p>  He instances one case where a claim was put in for &euro;26 million in compensation and settled for &euro;12 million.  He goes on to say that there are occasions where faced with the individual plaintiff's law firm whose settlement demands were excessive, the only way the State Claims Agency can discharge its duty to the taxpayer is to take the case to court.  He is quite scathing about certain members of the legal profession.  He does not name them.<\/p> <p>  He goes on to talk about the Legal Services Regulation Act 2016, which provides for the making of regulations to introduce pre-action protocols.  They have not been implemented.  The letter states that the State Claims Agency has on its own initiative pioneered the introduction of interim payments in the form of periodic payment orders in 74 cases since 2010 but that out of the 74 cases, 15 plaintiffs did not proceed with them after a short period of time and asked for their lump sum because of the lack of a legislative basis backing up periodic payment orders system.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Breen highlighted the fact that most of the claims involving almost &euro;2 billion are in respect of clinical negligence claims while the others are general claims and that a total of 9,956 claims were active at the end of 2017 totalling &euro;2.662 billion.  There are 2,976 clinical cases with an average estimate of &euro;666,000 to deal with each of them based on its figures.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Breen then goes on to the issue of open disclosure.  I just stopped reading at this stage.  The letter states that there were reports in 2008, 2009 and 2013; a review in 2014; and training for staff in 2015.  On and on it goes.  We have not seen any result from open disclosure yet.  I am highlighting those points because it would take too long to read the letter and just noting and publishing it would not do the public a service because it needs to know the extent of involvement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#F01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I raised this last week or the week before because I do not think I have ever seen a situation where people have come out of a court having settled and talked about the payment securing the future of a child.  There is a crossover between inadequate public services and the cases that are taken.  It is almost a self-fulfilling prophecy when one has that kind of contingent liability.  When one looks at the case where the plaintiff settled for &euro;12 million having originally sought &euro;26 million and one looks at the contingent liability, one can see that built into that will be the kind of costs about which we are talking, which are legal costs, that would be more properly spent on services.  If there was open disclosure, probably a very sizeable amount of that would be very significantly reduced and we might avoid the trauma of people having to spend years in the courts.  We need to do a piece of work on this.  It is too big an issue to just leave to a very good and full response from the NTMA.  It is as much about process as it is about value for money.  Given that it is the dominant one, I suspect we will probably need to get in the Department of Health with regard to moving to the open disclosure approach.<\/p><p>It is not enough just to look at the financial side of it.

We have put quite a spotlight on this sector and published a report.  Subsequently, we had a number of independent - I use that word advisedly - examinations into a number of issues.  Outstanding is the Thorn review in Limerick.  We have subsequently received new information that was on the front pages of some newspapers at the weekend that the university, potentially, misled the Committee of Public Accounts and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I want to hear from the comptroller if that is a fact.  I do not always believe what I see in the newspapers but I want it clarified at least.<\/p> <p>  We have two reports which are still outstanding from the HEA on spin-out companies and intellectual property.  We were told that the global one looking at policy, governance and whether changes needed to be made was to be published in January but we are now into February and it has not happened.  The report on Waterford IT has been with legal advisers since last December and has still not been published.  We are waiting for these reports so that the committee can do its work.<\/p> <p>  There seems to be a lot there but, looking at the work programme, none of it is scheduled up to April.  Funding in the third level sector was described as the \"wild west\" by a committee member before and we were trying to establish whether that was the case, whether good governance was in place and whether improvements could be made.  We have done a report, but that was only the start of our work.  There are a lot of reports and information we need from the HEA and that is not even to get onto the education and training board for Kildare-Wicklow, which falls under remit of the Department of Education and Skills.  We need to give that some attention.<\/p> <p>  My second point on the work programme is that I have consistently asked for RT&Eacute; to come before the committee.  We have just spent the last 15 minutes talking about multinationals that are not compelled to come before the committee.  We asked them to do so and they have refused.  We have not asked RT&Eacute; to come before the committee even though &euro;170 million of taxpayers' money is given to it.  It is one third of the line Department's funding, but the Accounting Officer was not even able to answer basic questions on it when he was before us.  I have specific concerns about allegations of bogus self-employment.  I have met senior staff in RT&Eacute; who are concerned and persons from a trade union representing journalists to discuss this issue, which appears to be a problem within the organisation.<\/p> <p>  There is another issue I want the committee to raise which has implications for Revenue.  While they are not doing anything wrong, senior broadcasters in RT&Eacute; are availing of the opportunity which is available to them to set up companies into which their salaries, or fees, are paid.  That was previously the case with hospital consultants and we dealt with it.  That process allows those broadcasters to reduce the amount of tax they pay.  They do not pay PAYE or PRSI but rather corporation tax.  We saw problems in relation to hospital consultants.  Are there similar problems here?  I cannot say and I am not making any allegations.  It is certainly worth examining as is bogus self-employment.<\/p> <p>  Another issue people have relates to the &euro;170 million, which was established to be the majority of the money.  I ask that this be prioritised.  I have raised it gently in the past and I am being a bit more assertive on this occasion.  It is important and the issues need to be examined.<\/p> <p>  On the third level sector, I cannot understand why the reports have still not been published by the HEA.  I am getting a little exasperated that we are getting letters from it, including letters sent to me personally from the head of the HEA, stating the reports would be published in January.  In fact, they were originally supposed to be published last October but were delayed.  While legal may be looking at some elements of some of them, two or three months is an extraordinary amount of time for them to be in the hands of legal within the HEA.  Can we follow those up again?  Once we know where they are at, we need to come back next week and put a focus on it.<\/p> <p>  I want to hear from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General specifically whether it was misled by the University of Limerick rather than to take that second or third hand from a newspaper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#H00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I will call the members first and then we will come back to the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#H00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I will be brief as Deputy Cullinane has more or less listed the issues I have.  Our work programme needs to change a little bit.  A lot of things are too pushed out.  Getting on to the universities and colleges, I have serious concerns about the evidence given here by the HEA and the manner in which that was done.  I also have concerns about the way reports and investigations are being done.  Timelines are not being met.  Why is that?  It compounds the issues we reported on in our initial report on the third level sector.  There are various reports and we need the Comptroller and Auditor General to verify whether they are accurate.  There are other reports on private consultants which are also of concern.  We still have outstanding questions regarding a number of universities and colleges.  I have continuously raised issues on CIT to which I have not received full answers.  UCC is signing a major contract to sponsor a concert hall in Cork and it is frightening to think it has not learned any lessons.  The whole issue on third level colleges is to get the answers we were promised and finding out if further information was kept from the committee and, possibly, the Comptroller and Auditor General and dealing with all of that.  We need to wrap that up in a nice bow in the committee, not let it drift further.<\/p> <p>  Through various forums and in the D&aacute;il, I raised the following matter a long time ago and it has now been followed up by others.  I refer to evidence given here by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on IT contracts.  I have read the transcript of the evidence a number of times and it raises serious concerns.  We spoke about this earlier.  The Comptroller and Auditor General referenced Accenture and the contracts there.  It is obvious that this did not transpire or come out through this forum notwithstanding very detailed questions, most of which, I note, were from Deputy MacSharry.  We have to get to the bottom of this soon because it is a very serious issue.<\/p> <p>  I support Deputy Cullinane on the issues with regard to RT&Eacute;.  It is very much in the public interest that we deal with those.

I remember when the head of the Revenue Commissioners appeared before the finance committee and came here the next day.  We asked him about company structures being set up and he said the Revenue is very clear that it never looks through the eyes of a company onto its employees.  That has never happened.

At times we think we should change the law if it is believed what is going on is not acceptable.  If, like me, someone has a strong social conscience, he or she might be concerned that this is State money going into RT&Eacute; or these agencies, but the point I am making is that what they are doing is fully legal.  What many of the multinational companies do is also legal.  We have heard this morning about overpayments and that we have to get value for money, but the head of Revenue is telling us that a presenter in RT&Eacute; whose only client is RT&Eacute; can set up a company to be paid on his or her own behalf in order to plan his or her income and that it is perfectly legal to do so.  We have to be clear - that is the reality under the tax code.  Perhaps there are other ways in which we might progress and we should change many of these things.  That is a point worth making.  Our job is to highlight where the State is not receiving value for money and go through Votes forensically, at which we have been doing a great job.  Sometimes, however, there are laws which have to be changed and there are great arguments for so doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#H00900","speaker":"1369","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":143,"content":"<p>We always expected that we would have to come back to the university sector and there is now far more reason to do so.

I had intended to address some of the issues raised by the whistleblowers about the Thorn report and with which they were not happy.  It would be kind to the Higher Education Authority to state it was less than impressive when its representatives were before the committee.  The very fact that we are still waiting for some significant responses is very disappointing.  I hope to see that issue included in the work programme soon.<\/p> <p>  On Deputy Peter Burke's point, I do not disagree that some of the things being done are fully legal, but they are only fully legal for a certain portion of the population.  It is very useful for us to understand what is going on in what could be described as bogus self-employment.  If everybody were to do that, we would not be here because there would be no money to run services.  We need to understand this.  I see absolutely no reason we would not look at the issue in the same way as we try to look at the issue of corporation tax, that is, by looking at one particular organisation, in this case the national broadcaster, in order to gain an understanding.  The issue is not unique to one sector.

We ahad a very extensive discussion about recognising the independence of RT&Eacute;.  It is the national broadcaster and none of us wants to ask questions about the type of programmes it produces and why.  That is entirely a matter for it.  There is, however, merit in the committee looking at these issues - there are two separate issues - because there are potential implications for Revenue. The first is that of bogus self-employment.  This is where casual work and short-term contracts are being offered to workers when permanent contracts were once in place.  That is becoming more of the norm than the exception in RT&Eacute;.  The concern is being expressed by staff within the company.  It is a separate issue from the other point about whether persons on high salaries are setting up companies.  I have made the point that this is a perfectly legal structure, but the point has also been made that persons on a salary of &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 a year are not in a position to set up such companies.  They are for those on big salaries.  Whether they are hospital consultants or presenters in RT&Eacute; on six-figure salaries, the reality is that it is happening and legal, but there is a cost to the Exchequer.  We cannot assume that because something happened in one area it happened in another, but we did see in the case of hospital consultants all sorts of expenses being claimed which potentially should not have been claimed and further reduced their tax liabilities.  We have a responsibility on behalf of taxpayers to probe this area to ensure there is value for money if we are the ones who are signing off on it.  <\/p> <p>  There are many other related issues.

The Dormant Accounts Fund is managed by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which collects the dormant balances from the institutions.  The holders or beneficiaries of accounts that have been declared dormant have the right subsequently to reclaim their money at any time and the NTMA repays funds as required from reserves.  Responsibility for disbursements from the fund transferred to the Minister for Rural and Community Development in July 2017 from the then Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Prior to June 2016, responsibility for the disbursement system was with the then Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. <\/p> <p>  Figure 1 in the report document shows the movements in the Dormant Accounts Fund since it commenced operations in 2003.  There was an initial transfer into the fund of &euro;172 million.  Net transfers to the fund were an average of almost &euro;26 million a year between 2004 and 2016.  What is perhaps most striking is the trend increase in the fund&rsquo;s net assets position, which increased from &euro;132 million at the end of 2010 to &euro;259 million at the end of 2016.  Net assets include an amount set aside in a reserve fund to meet potential future claims for repayment of balances in dormant accounts; the provision was just over &euro;76 million at the end of 2016.  Figure 1 shows the increase that has occurred since 2010 in the net assets figure.<\/p> <p>  Amendments made to the dormant accounts legislation in 2012 require the relevant Minister to set up a disbursement scheme for a period of up to three years.  The scheme must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  A disbursement scheme covering the period December 2013 to November 2016 was approved by Government in December 2013.  The scheme set out guiding principles and the priority areas for disbursements.  A statutory review of the disbursement scheme was due within three years of the scheme being adopted, that is, by December 2016.  This review had not been carried out at the time of the examination.  Also under the Acts, annual action plans for the disbursement of funds must be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas indicating the spending Departments, the proposed recipients of grant funding, the programmes or projects to be supported and the proposed amounts of funding.  While action plans were presented for 2014 and 2016, no plan was presented for 2015. <\/p> <p>  Expenditure of funding allocated to Dormant Accounts Fund measures may be made over one or more years.  Planned expenditure for a given year is provided for in the relevant Department's annual Estimates.  The examination found that implementing Departments significantly underspent on programmes relative to what was planned.  In total, they incurred dormant accounts programme expenditure of just under &euro;29 million for the period 2012 to 2016.  This represented only 44% of the total amount made available for spending in the relevant estimates for the same period.  The level of underspend for all implementing Departments ranged from 5% to 94%, as shown in Figure 2 in the report document.  In Figure 2, for each of the implementing Departments there are two bars.  The lighter coloured one is the amount provided in the Estimate and the darker one is the amount that was actually spent.  It also indicates the percentage of total funding made available but not spent.<\/p> <p>  A lack of preparedness appears to have been the main factor causing the underspending.  Delays in implementing projects and delays in having a disbursement scheme or action plan in place were cited by Departments as the main reasons for this.  A low level of uptake for some schemes was another cause cited for the underspend.  The report provides further detail on the pattern of underspending on a Department-by-Department basis. <\/p> <p>  Pobal manages certain Dormant Accounts Fund measures on behalf of some Departments.<\/p><p>In the period from 2012 to 2016 Pobal administered 29 measures, disbursing a total of &euro;10.2 million.  It received fees of &euro;2.55 million in the same period for providing this service, the cost of which was met from the fund under the terms of the legislation.  The fee expense was equivalent to 27% of the amount disbursed.  The National Treasury Management Agency and Departments administering their own measures bear the administration costs in their own budgets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

I am joined by my colleagues from the Department, Mr. Fergal Costello, principal officer, finance unit; Mr. Kenneth Jordan, principal officer; and Mr. Eddie Forsyth, assistant principal officer, rural strategy division.  Also in attendance are Ms Deirdre Kearney, community and voluntary supports division, and Mr. William Hughes, finance unit.<\/p> <p>  As the committee is aware, the Department of Rural and Community Development was established in July 2017.  Statutory responsibility for the Dormant Accounts Fund was transferred to the Minister for Rural and Community Development at the time.  The legislation governing the Dormant Accounts Fund provides a framework for the disbursement of funds for measures targeted at socially, economically and educationally disadvantaged persons and people with a disability.  Under the Dormant Accounts Act 2012 and following the transfer of functions, the Minister for Rural and Community Development is responsible for the administration of the processes by which the Government approves programmes and projects to which funding may be disbursed from the Dormant Accounts Fund.  In real terms, this involves the development of three-year disbursement schemes and the subsequent preparation of annual action plans to give effect to the disbursement scheme.<\/p> <p>  Under the 2012 Act, the Minister is required to make a disbursement scheme for a period not exceeding three years.  The disbursement scheme sets out guiding principles for disbursements and specifies priority areas under the aforementioned headings of economic and social disadvantage, educational disadvantage and persons with a disability.  The 2012 Act also provides that the Minister shall prepare an action plan at least once a year to give effect to the disbursement scheme.  Actions plans contain details of programmes and projects to be funded under the scheme and set out the maximum amount proposed for disbursement to each programme or project set out in the action plan.  There is also a further requirement in the 2012 Act that the Minister shall prepare an annual report on the disbursement of moneys from the Dormant Accounts Fund.<\/p> <p>  Since its inception in 2001, the fund has seen a number of transfers of responsibility.  Most recently, in 2012 the Dormant Accounts Board was dissolved and its statutory functions were transferred to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  In 2016 these functions transferred again to the then Minster for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  As I noted, the functions transferred to the Minister for Rural and Community Development in July 2017.  The Department of Rural and Community Development is, therefore, now responsible for co-ordinating the preparation and administration of the disbursement scheme and the annual action plans across government.  In undertaking these functions the Department fully recognises the importance of the Dormant Accounts Fund to the provision of programmes and projects aimed at disadvantaged groups.  For example, the 2017 action plan commits funding to support youth and community projects through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and to invest in community sport and physical activity hubs through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We want to ensure disbursement schemes and action plans are progressed in an efficient and effective manner and that we maximise the positive social impact of the fund.<\/p> <p>  With direct regard to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, it raises a number of issues relating to the operation of the scheme, including levels of disbursement and compliance with statutory requirements.  It recommends that the statutory review of the 2013 disbursement scheme be carried out to identify how well the scheme was implemented and how future disbursement schemes can be designed to ensure the objectives set out for the fund are met.  The report states the review should consider the reasons for the low level of disbursements; whether allocating funds to measures which do not fully use the resources prevent other programmes from being funded; and how the available funding can best be applied.  The response of the Department of Rural and Community Development provided in September 2017 states the Department is committed to reviewing all aspects of the administration of the dormant accounts disbursement scheme as part of its forthcoming work programme and that the review will consider the issues detailed in the report.<\/p> <p>  Based on the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, it is clear that the scheme is not operating in a manner which maximises the impact of the fund for those groups at which the funding is targeted.  We are fully committed to completing the planned review in 2018.  The review which is commencing will analyse the issues raised in the report, identify the administrative and other changes necessary to ensure more efficient and effective operation of the scheme and make proposals for how the changes will be implemented on completion of the review.  We have provided a copy of the draft terms of reference in the briefing material circulated to members.  <\/p> <p>  I look forward to assisting the committee in its detailed examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

Despite this, Mr. McCarthy did not refer to any figure and the document does not feature a single euro symbol.

Again, there is no reference to figures or money, although I note there is a reference to money towards the end of page 5 when a figure of &euro;40 million is mentioned.

It does not involve an implication or an expectation that all the money will be spent in that year.  For example, we got a commitment in December 2014 for Garda youth diversion projects, and clearly it would have been impossible to spend any of that money in December 2014.  We work in partnership with non-governmental organisations, NGOs, which means we have a choice between expanding existing services, giving additional funding to NGOs with which we are already partnered and, alternatively, going out and inviting expressions of interest.  Whatever we choose to do, we have a duty to assess applications properly and make sure we are getting value for money.

I would like to put this in perspective.  Last night, I took a phone call from an organisation in Connemara, Teagmh&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g, which has just received a letter from the local ETB - I keep calling it the VEC - to tell it that it is going to close.  This is a special centre for children who drop out of school and it has been told it is going to close.  I am looking at massive amounts of funds here.  I just heard about  it last night and I am going to get more details on it.  Last year, all the politicians in Galway were called to a meeting because the youth federation, or an organisation like that, was about to close due to a lack of money.  Two weeks ago, we got a call about an essential service where access takes place in time.  It is about to close at the end of March.  Various social enterprise ideas are coming forward.  One example involves repairing bicycles.  It cannot get a leg in to get help.  That is just the background.  I have mentioned a minute sample.  Comhlachas na gComharchumainn, which represents all the co-operatives in the Gaeltachts and islands throughout Ireland, has made presentations to all of us.  It is struggling to exist.  There is something seriously wrong here.  I do not wish to blame Mr. McCarthy individually.  Is there any feedback?  Is there any mechanism?  We will take the co-operative movement.

It gives a whole new meaning to \"dormant\".  At least some people can get money out of that account even if they come back but this seems to be more dormant than the dormant account the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, manages.  We will be doing a periodic report.  I do not think this system works.  I do not think it needs a review.  There has been &euro;25 million sitting there for years with nothing happening, with organisations crying out for it which serve the most deserving groups of people in society with regard to people with economic and social disadvantage, educational disadvantage and persons with disabilities.  That &euro;25 million has been sitting there for nine years and the witnesses do not even know its position.  That is woeful.<\/p> <p>  One of the problems, though not caused by the witnesses since they are the people administering it, is that the chart from the Comptroller and Auditor General indicates that there are schemes being administered by ten different Departments.  That is on page 105, chart 7.3 in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The Department of Environment, Community and Local Government had a major underspend, as did the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Health, the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs which spent only 6% of what was approved, the Department of Education and Skills which spent 25%, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection which spent half of it, and the Prison Service which spent only a fraction of it.  It is no wonder that this system does not work when it is spread across ten different Departments.  There is a fund managed by the NTMA and it is a good idea to have it.  The witnesses make a provision to have some money to go back.  They engaged Pobal to administer it, having come up with the policy, and then there are different schemes across ten different Departments.  How could anybody know where to go for this money?  It is no wonder it is lost in the system.<\/p> <p>  I have to contrast this.  How much has the Department of Rural and Community Development paid out over the years?  Some &euro;275 million.  We have to look at this with regard to value for money and good public administration.  We all look at what we call the sports capital programme.  It hands out that type of money every time there is a round.  The applicants know what to do.  It is well publicised.  They get their forms in.  The level of detail they have to get in is extraordinary.  There is a sunset clause and the Department, without having to go to Pobal or ten other Departments, is able to administer it, make sure it functions properly, get the documentation in after approval is given and pay for the works when they are done, subject to audit, verification and so on.  That system works well.  This system is not working at all.  The Department would be better off asking the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport if it would second half a dozen staff to the Department of Rural and Community Development, and getting rid of Pobal and the ten different Departments.  It is not just a question of the three people.  They are probably busy drawing up schemes and policy statements for ten different Departments, and ten Departments are drawing up schemes to implement it.  It is the worst level of duplication across Departments that I have encountered in my time as Chairman here.  None of it is the witnesses' fault.  They inherited this last year.  I would be of a mind, when we are issuing our interim report, to state that the system as it operates has to be called to a halt.  It is not transparent.  It is all over the place.  Nobody can follow it.  The Department even has trouble following it.  There is money as much as nine years old with no sunset clause.  We all have sight of one Department or another which would administer a scheme of this scale and nature with its hand tied.<\/p> <p>  Maybe people will utterly disagree with me but I am amazed at how poorly this system operates.  I have no confidence that it will be any better next year.  This matter of calling it a timing difference and aligning funding coming from the Dormant Account Fund versus the annual Estimates is, as just mentioned, something done by the Department I just mentioned.  It gets an Estimate for a programme and we know it will be a couple of years before some of the funding will be drawn down for the sports capital programme.  There is a prototype in the public service of how to administer a fund like this.  One of our jobs is, when we find something working well, to try to replicate it in other areas which do similar work in a very cumbersome manner.  This is designed to be cumbersome.  It involves ten different Departments and ten different types of scheme and there is probably a variety of different schemes within those Departments.  It would be impossible for people to deal with.  Without going into further detail, I think the witnesses understand our frustration.  Deputy Burke started on the matter and other people have spoken on it.  I do not think this system is working well and the public service is capable of getting a far more streamlined and effective service to deliver the money.  When we are back in our constituency clinics tomorrow, we will all have people from groups suffering from economic and social disadvantage, educational disadvantage, and persons with disability, coming to us to seek funds.  If we tell them that there is &euro;25 million which has not been spent for those years, they will give out to us and ask if we are not doing our job.  Our job is to highlight when we see that a system is broken.  It is almost irredeemable in its current format.  I stress that it is not an issue for the NTMA side of the house.  It is probably doing its end of it fine.  The rest of the system is not working and there is a simple way to make it work in the interests of the citizens that we should be serving.<\/p> <p>  That was a bit of a speech as well as a question.  I call Deputy Murphy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018020800002#T01900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1518080400,"counter":558,"content":"<p>The witnesses made a statement earlier that a scheme may never have got off the ground and never reached the level of activity or uptake envisaged.  I think that goes to the heart of the matter.  This is not designed for the kind of uptake and profile of how things happen at community level.  My understanding is that it is so cumbersome to apply for that there are people and organisations that looked at it and simply dismissed it.  These are not organisations that do not need money or where &euro;1 million would not make a difference.  There could be 25 such organisations around the country if that was the case.  How many of the years we are talking about are years when the troika was here?  We were told that we were bankrupt.  People scrapped for every single shilling.  Some of those communities were among the most impacted.<\/p><p>This is not designed for the people it is supposed to benefit.  How many people from disadvantaged communities said this would work for them and this is what they needed?  I am not saying there should not be oversight and good accounting for things.  However, much of our community exists in a very informal way.  Some organisations have to exist in that kind of informal environment, yet we are looking at a very rigid system where it is difficult to access funding for worthwhile things.  Some of projects brought forward do not get the uptake because they are not what the community requires.  If they were in place and the community required them, it would use them.  It tells us something about who is designing the system for whom.<\/p><p> If there is going to be a redesign, the witnesses will have to engage the communities that are going to be the benefices of this scheme in that design.  It has to be designed in such a way that it is flexible enough for people to engage with it and not spend a lot of administrative time they do not have applying for it or drawing it down.  There is a big deficiency.  I agree with the Chairman about it not just being a review but a redesign.  I do not think Pobal can be blamed for administering a scheme it did not design.  The administration of it should be flexible enough.<\/p><p> I want to ask about a few of the schemes.  There was about &euro;500,000 of an underspend in the community-based model for people with dementia.  Has that been spent?  In respect of training and support services for homecarers, there was &euro;500,000 but up to 2016, nothing was spent.  Has that been spent?  On the Arts in Education initiative, &euro;50,000 was drawn down from &euro;280,000.  Has the rest of it been drawn down?<\/p><p> I refer to &euro;1 million allocated to establish a monitoring programme under the Department of Justice and Equality.

The commitment agreement signed with me in April 2017 binds Eir to that commitment.<\/p> <p>  Some media and other commentary in respect of the Eir 300,000 deployment is misinformed.  State aid rules would not allow me to invest taxpayers' money in areas where commercial companies have high-speed broadband infrastructure or are building this infrastructure.  From a state aid rules perspective, the Eir 300,000 network must be treated in a manner similar to other high-speed broadband infrastructure in place at the outset of the procurement process.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make it clear that this commitment agreement was not a decision by Government as it was a private decision for Eir to decide where to invest.  However, the procurement process and state aid rules allow for a commitment agreement to bind a commercial company to its private plans.<\/p> <p>  While state aid guidelines envisage clear milestones being set out in commercial plans, the commitment agreement considerably exceeds those guidelines as it includes not only milestones for delivery but robust monitoring and enforcement provisions as well.  In fact, the Commission has been impressed by the extent of this agreement and believes it is a template for other countries to follow.<\/p> <p>  I hope it is clear from my statement to the House last night that it is not the case that the commitment agreement in some way determined where Eir's high-speed broadband infrastructure was to be built.  It was always a matter for commercial companies.  The commitment agreement provides strong assurance that planned infrastructure would be built.  The commitment agreement set out clearly the quarterly milestones to be achieved.<\/p> <p>  Another narrative that has emerged is that the procurement process is overly-onerous and complex.  Of course this is an onerous and complex process as we will be spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers' money to deliver a future-proofed high-speed broadband network.<\/p> <p>  I have endeavoured to ensure maximum openness and transparency for Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, our national Parliament and the public in respect of the national broadband plan procurement process while respecting the need to protect the integrity of the process itself.<\/p> <p>  As committee members are aware, I have held three special information sessions for Deputies and Senators in respect of the NBP on three occasions in the past ten months, including an information session to provide an update following the withdrawal of Eir from the procurement process.  This week I have supplied each Deputy and Senator with a copy of the letter I received from Richard Moat informing me of this decision.  I also supplied a copy of my response.  Yesterday evening, ahead of a statement to the House I circulated an updated comprehensive briefing document.<\/p> <p>  While I cannot and should not be involved in the day-to-day detail of the procurement process, I have been briefed at major milestones by the NBP procurement team.  Additionally, at every important stage or point of decision the NBP procurement team could not proceed without my approval or Government approval.<\/p> <p>  In July 2015, the Government approved the publication of the draft intervention strategy.  In December 2015, the Government approved the revised intervention strategy following public consultation and analysis of industry investment proposals.  At that time, the Government also approved commencement of the procurement process.  In July 2016, the Government approved adoption of a commercial stimulus ownership model.  In April 2017, the Government noted my intention to sign a commitment agreement with Eir on the 300,000 deployment and to finalise the map for the intervention area for the remainder of the procurement process.  Finally, last December, the Government approved my intention to bring forward heads of a Bill to provide certainty with regard to conditions of access to existing infrastructure for the national broadband plan and noted my update on the procurement process.<\/p> <p>  These decision points included detailed rationale, risk analysis and background updates.  Government decisions were made on an informed basis.  In this way, strong State oversight of the project was maintained.  The remaining bidder, enet-SSE, has already identified its final issues for discussion with the procurement team.  The list was submitted some weeks ago while competition remained in the process.  I am confident the solutions identified will provide a future-proofed network that will deliver new technologies and speeds as they arise with the best possible value for the taxpayer.<\/p> <p>  The NBP procurement team are still in dialogue with enet-SSE.  They are confident that the process can continue to move through the final stages and deliver a solution for rural Ireland in a prompt and effective manner.  There is no sense in stopping the clock now.  We are all agreed on the policy and the initiative.  I welcome the opportunity to work together in the final push to deliver for our communities and rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#B00300","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":642,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.

What guarantee can you give, Minister, that the contract price will be fair and reasonable now that only one consortium remains?  Previously, you allowed Eir to roll out high-speed broadband to an additional 300,000 homes at their own expense.  Those households are widely regarded to be the easiest to connect to the network, with the remaining 540,000 being the most difficult.

I do not see any merit in putting a roadblock in the way of this process at this late stage.  I accept there is sufficient oversight and that each milestone has to be approved by the Department officials, the Minister and the Government on the recommendation of the project team.  The concern of the members of the public is when they will get broadband.  They hear about review groups or committees within committees.  We are very familiar in this House with the multitude of groups, committees and taskforces, which are effectively talk shops galore.  On this hugely significant venture it is essential that we have decisions, action, an implementation of the policy and that we get on with the job.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions.  Regarding the process, it happens in business every other day that people put in quotations as part of a bidding process and, for whatever reason, they feel free to withdraw.  That is the way business works.  Obviously, the decision by Eir to withdraw was a calculated business decision.  That is for it to make.  Regarding the remaining contender, I get the sense that we are within roughly six months of decisions being made.  Can the Minister clarify the timescale involved in the decision making process he has in place?  In that process, are we near the stage where we will get into exclusive negotiations with one bidder?  I presume, in a process like this, that a time will come when the Minister will indicate a preferred bidder and progress the process from that point.  In this instance, we are left with one remaining bidder.  Has the pricing structure been agreed already with that remaining bidder?  What the Joe Soap on the street wants to know is if there is one bidder remaining and if the pricing structure is not agreed, is it not the case that they can charge what they want?  I would like to know where we are in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#C00200","speaker":"1240"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":645,"content":"<p>To clarify, I believe members were circulated with a note in advance.

Nobody here needs to be reminded that for many people it is of extraordinary seriousness.<\/p> <p>  There are three fundamental questions about which people are concerned.  They want to know if they will get broadband, when they will get it, and if it will break the taxpayers because of what happened.  Those are the fundamental questions, and everything else is a subset of those questions.  I ask those three questions of the Minister but also by what process is he confident that SSE-enet are tied into a pricing structure?  They have stated a pricing structure, and I sincerely hope it is correct.  The Minister says they will be tied in because of what they put in at procurement stage and that that must hold.  How does he propose to secure that?  How does he propose to ensure that SSE-enet maintain their social mandate and go out immediately to the less commercially profitable areas?  Will we have a control over that process?  Will the Minister go through his projected timeframe again because that is the one aspect people want to know about, as well as the running cost?  If we were to have a hierarchy of concern the first concern is that people get broadband.  Will the Minister deal again with the timeframe?

They relate to the value for money question the Chairman asked and the questions from Deputy Lowry and Senator O'Reilly on the pricing structure and so on.<\/p> <p>  On the question as to whether enet will withdraw from the process, I have spoken with one of the key investors in this, David McCourt, who I believe is from Deputy Dooley's part of the country.  He is the chair of enet.  He is also the chief executive of Granahan McCourt, which is a major capital investor in this area.  Both SSE and enet believe that, for them, this particular project is very much a role model project so they can secure similar types of project across Europe and the globe.  As members know, the Scottish Government has announced it will replicate what we are doing here in terms of bringing high-speed broadband to the islands and highlands.  The state of New York is looking at doing something similar to what we are doing here.<\/p><p>The German programme for government, agreed yesterday, is also looking at bringing high-speed broadband to rural communities.  The company feels it has an opportunity there as well.  It is committed not just to bringing in high-speed broadband but to use it as a test bed to deliver high-speed broadband to other parts of the world.<\/p><p> I was in Limerick yesterday where we opened a new facility for a company called 4site, which has increased the number of people it employs by 20.  It has been working with SIRO for the past number of years on its fibre build-out.  It has developed a map of the infrastructure build-out for fibre networks in the towns around Ireland.  It has secured a major contract in the UK and is in negotiations to secure other contracts in the United States.  4site has done this and enet-SSC intends to do it on a bigger scale.  The decision of Eir to pull out - regardless of whether it was associated with the build of 300,000 - is a commercial decision for the company.  Eir is the only body that can comment in that regard.  There has been speculation but I have given members the letter I received from the company, as well as my response.<\/p><p> Senator O'Reilly asked if people will get broadband.  Yes, they will.  Every single home, farm and business will get access to high-speed broadband.  There is unanimity across the House, as well as in this committee, on the need to do this regardless of who is in Government.  The question is when people will get broadband.  When this Government was formed, five out of ten premises in Ireland had access to high-speed broadband.  Today, it is seven out of ten and by the end of the year it will be eight out of ten.  By 2020 it will be at least nine out of ten and it may be higher.  Soon after that, I expect we will complete the work.<\/p><p> Based on the Eir build we are expecting a build-out of 40,000 premises in this quarter.  I expect that the consortium, once it has got up and running and addressed some of the teething difficulties, will get up to a similar momentum quite quickly, taking approximately three years.  In Cavan, Monaghan, Roscommon and Clare there are some very isolated locations that may take a bit longer to deliver but we expect the vast bulk of the country to be covered in the three-year build-out.<\/p><p> I was asked how we maintained the social mandate to get broadband to rural areas quickly.  This is about bringing high-speed broadband to 542,000 homes, the last homes to get it and the most isolated homes in Ireland.  There is a State subsidy to make sure it happens.  The build-out will be defined in two ways.  One way is based on the commercial plan of the company itself, which has stated that it is easier to build from a location outwards.  The Department of Rural and Community Development is also engaging with local authorities across the country and with regional action groups.  I am determined that this will happen in every county together.  Roscommon will not be first, just because it has the highest percentage of people who need the service, and Monaghan will not be second just because it is second on the list.  Every county will start together, as has happened with the Eir deployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#C02400","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":668,"content":"<p>Is it possible for one of the officials to tell us if the remaining bidder is tied into a pricing structure?

Has the remaining bidder provided a technical solution and a price to roll out high-speed broadband to 542,000 homes across the State?  On 30 January, Eir pulled out of the process.  I think this is a game-changer, following the decision of Vodafone and ESB to pull out last September.  Mr. Richard Moat, the chief executive of Eir, wrote to the Minister and the Minister has provided an awful lot of information to the committee in the past number of days.  Despite the fact that there is a lot of information, however, we do not have many answers.  In the second paragraph of his letter, Mr. Moat said the decision to exit the NBP process was driven by a range of commercial, regulatory and governance issues that had been repeatedly highlighted over the past 18 months and that this had been consistently noted in discussions on 30 August 2017 and in his correspondence of 17 July 2017.<\/p><p>Is the Minister prepared to publish the notes of the meeting of 30 August 2017 and correspondence between himself and Eir on 17 July?  This would be helpful for us in understanding more clearly the decisions of Eir.<\/p><p> In the past 18 months, I have repeatedly asked the Minister to publish a timeline, a notional date, Gantt chart or project time to which he is working that sets out the best estimate for signing the contract?  Following from that, will he indicate when the work to roll out the infrastructure will begin and when all 542,000 homes will have broadband?  While I accept that delays will occur from time to time, thus far, we have had 19 months of delays in the process.  The Minister regularly informs me that it is better to get this right than stick to a specific deadline.  Now that I and others are seeking to assist him at this juncture, he has suddenly expressed deep concern about the potential for delays.  Against what notional timeline is he measuring these delays because he has not yet published anything about it?<\/p><p> On the issue of whether he has confidence in the process, at a press conference after the withdrawal of Eir from the process, the Minister stated, when pressed by a journalist on the potential for the process to fail, that there was contingency planning and a plan B in place.  It would be helpful if he were to publish this plan B.  Does he accept that the purpose of the intervention of Opposition parties is to achieve the same result as the Minister seeks to achieve, namely, the roll-out of high-speed broadband to 542,000 homes?  He must also have doubts as otherwise he would not have a plan B.  The Minister and I share the same doubts.  I want to call time on the process if there is a fatal flaw that will lead to its collapse.  If so, it would be better if we identified now rather than trundling headlong into a roadblock in 12, 18 or 24 months' time and being forced to revert to plan B.<\/p><p> I do not want to get into a discussion about Enet but I will raise a couple of points with the Minister.  Rather than refusing to answer questions on this matter, the Minister stated the company is well funded and capitalised, has significant experience and is rolling out broadband to beat the band up and down the highways and by-ways of the United States.  On other occasions, he juxtaposed these claims with a comment Enet needs this project as a test bed and means of improving its credentials to win contracts all over the world.  This somehow indicates that he has the company over a barrel because it needs the project more than he does.  What is the position?  Does Enet have considerable experience which it can bring to the table or does the company view this project as a test bed and some kind of loss leader which will allow it to develop its credentials and move to the next stage?  As I stated, it would be helpful if the Minister could answer some or all of those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#D02100","speaker":"1274","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":689,"content":"<p>I will ask the Minister to respond after Deputy Stanley makes his contribution.

While I agree with him to some extent, sometimes when one is on a journey, it does no harm to check the map to ensure one does not wind up in the wrong destination or in a cul-de-sac.  This is the scenario we must avoid.<\/p> <p>  The nearest the Minister has come to outlining a timeline was his statement that he expected the project to take approximately three years.  In 2016 and 2017, the Minister outlined dates by which he hoped to have the procurement process completed.  The 542,000 households and premises in the State, including 25,000 in Laois-Offaly, which do not have access to broadband are anxious to know when the procurement process will conclude.  The Minister has 80 officials and experts working with him.  He must have a date in his mind.  Surely Members of the Oireachtas, who have been elected to represent their constituents and parties, are entitled to know when the Minister believes the procurement process will be completed.  At that point, will it take three years to bring the project to completion or, as the Minister stated, to bring broadband to almost every house?<\/p> <p>  While I do not wish to discuss in detail the history of the process, the Minister and I both know that Enet did not have the necessary firepower.  According to the information available to me, the company has only secured significant financial backers in the past year and is relatively small.  I do not want to detract from Enet which is probably an excellent company and I wish it well, nor am I having a go at the Minister.  I have thought about this issue in private moments.  When buying or selling I have never bargained with anybody where only one option was available, especially if the other party believed he held all the cards.  I have never been able to adopt that position.  If the Department can do so in this case, well and good.  Does the Minister have a plan B in the event that Enet withdraws from the process at this point?  If so, will he outline it briefly?<\/p> <p>  On State involvement, which some of the bidders strongly favoured at one stage, we already have the metropolitan area networks and what is known as backhaul fibre.  The map I have with me shows an extensive network of fibre that was installed across the country, some of it under public private partnerships.  It runs in straight lines to Bantry, Galway and radiates throughout the State similar to the spokes of a wheel.  We also have an extensive ESB network with electricity poles in every laneway.  As a former employee of the ESB, my view is that the company's decision to pull out of the game impaired the process.  The metropolitan area networks are in place in 91 towns throughout the State.  The ESB network, the backhaul network and the metropolitan areas network together amount to an extensive infrastructure network in which the State invested heavily.  Does this not lend itself to having the State control the main infrastructure?<\/p> <p>  I asked the Minister a question last night in the D&aacute;il Chamber but the procedure for questions in the House does not lend itself to an exchange of views.

This impairs the rest of the process and I contend that it was not necessary to allow them to do this.

During my discussion with Mr. Moat on 30 August, he provided me with an update on the Eir build-out to the 300,000 premises and I can provide the Deputy with a copy of that presentation.  Two others issues came up at that meeting.  Mr. Moat raised the issue of the ComReg pricing structure for fibre-to-the-cabinet.  He pointed out to me that if this pricing structure remained in place, it would jeopardise future investment that would take place in the country because companies, including Eir, but not exclusive to Eir, would not get the opportunity to get a return on the investment they put in.  I  pointed out to Mr. Moat that this was a regulatory matter, that it was an issue for ComReg and, as I have said before, the appropriate mechanism to deal with that is through the committee because ComReg is answerable to the committee and not answerable to me.  The other issue I raised with Richard Moat was one raised in the House in the past few days, namely, the gap in the build-out in respect of the 300,000 premises.  Deputy Sean Sherlock mentioned a location where the fibre was very close to some houses with 12 poles on one side and 12 poles on the other side and asked whether those houses would be part of the final 542,000 premises.  The answer is they will.  During the discussion I had with Richard Moat on 30 August, I raised a number of issues and gave the example of my own primary school, Ardkeenan national school just outside Athlone in County Roscommon, where the Eir fibre roll-out turned at the cross roads about 1 km from the school.  I pointed out that there were a number of community buildings and clusters of homes in the vicinity.  At another location in Kiltoom, with the exception of five houses, every house along the road was left out.  I made the point that Eir should review this process, particularly where it had not already built out and had only started the build-out at that stage.  He agreed that would make sense and that it would make sense at the design stage to try to deal with those issues.  I gave a commitment to him, with his agreement, that I would ask the broadband officers across the country to identify these particular anomalies, compile a list and submit them to his office.  He agreed that he would ask his team to have a look at that list.  This information was submitted towards the end of last year - I am not sure of the date - but Eir is working on that issue at present.  Let me double check the figures in this regard.  Eir has passed 121,000 of the 300,000 to which it committed, but it has also passed another 11,000 homes that were not part of that number.  These are the types of anomalies that had been raised.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Dooley raised the letter of 17 July, and subject to any redaction needed, I am happy to have that letter released.<\/p> <p>  Both Deputies Dooley and Stanley asked for my best estimate on timing.  The reason I have been very hesitant about putting dates out in the public arena is that everyone present has been embarrassed and frustrated by company press releases promising they would bring broadband to A, B, and C by a certain date but not mentioning the year.  We are still waiting in some of those locations for the broadband.  I did not want a situation where members of the public would be told they would get broadband by one date only then to be given a different date, thereby making a joke out of the system.  It is a complex procurement process. <\/p> <p>  The timeline we were looking at, up to 30 January, was that we expected to have the preferred bidder by September and that I would be in a position to go to the Cabinet in that month and name the preferred bidder in that process.  As for whether we can truncate that, I think we can truncate it a little and it is my intention to try to ensure we can.  There would be a time lag from naming the bidder to actual construction because the preferred bidder would have to negotiate with the banks.  I know the European Investment Bank, whose representative I met in Dublin within the past fortnight, is anxious to engage and has been engaging with both Eir and enet-SSE.  Some other investors are looking at bankrolling this project as well and they can now engage at a much earlier stage.  That is the reason I have made the point that it will mean shovels on the ground more quickly because we can definitely truncate the second part of the process.  I do not know the best estimate on time because the team accompanying me today were to be talking with the consortium this week, but they have been tied up with me on Tuesday, Wednesday and today and will be dealing with me and with broadband next Tuesday and Wednesday.  Subject to that work, they will be engaging with enet-SSE quite soon.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Dooley has raised the issue of a 19-month delay.  As the procurement process has been under way for 25 months, there was never any intention that this procurement process could be done in six months.  That was never envisaged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#F01400","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":709,"content":"<p>For clarity, the programme for Government refers to June 2017 for the signature of a contract with a bidder.

If I miss one please let me know.  Several questions have been asked about plan B.  In all procurement processes, particularly where there are services to be rolled out over a prolonged period, all viable options for delivery are considered.  The current procurement process for the roll-out of the national broadband plan, NBP, in the State intervention area has been a very robust process with strong risk management throughout, with all scenarios and eventualities having been considered.  The process is entering its final stages, with the remaining bidding consortium having reaffirmed its commitment to a successful conclusion of that process.  It would be imprudent to pre-empt the outcome of the current discussions and potentially prejudice it by publicly deliberating on other options for alternative delivery mechanisms at this time.  That was a note given to me on that subject for obvious reasons.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Dooley asked me whether enet has the experience.  As I have said consistently throughout this process, what we are doing to bring high-speed broadband to isolated rural communities has never been done anywhere in the world.  Vint Cerf, one of the founders of the internet came to this city last July and said we were the global leaders in this respect and that were we to succeed, we would be setting the global benchmark for delivering high-speed broadband in rural areas.  Since we have started this process, the state of New York in the United States of America, has decided to go down a similar road.  Recently, the Scottish Parliament and Government decided to do the same and yesterday there was public coverage of the German Government's decision to go down this road.  That is why this is a test bed.  We are the first to do it.  I gave the example of 4site, which has used the challenges it faced with SIRO in building out the fibre network.  No one else has built out a fibre network to the home.  We are the first to do this on a large scale.  It has been done in some cities, in patches of areas.  That is why 4site is expanding and winning contracts on a global scale and that is why enet believes there is a huge opportunity here.  It has experience.  SSE owns 15,000 km of fibre and manages 16 data centres in the United Kingdom.  Granahan McCourt is involved in several electricity companies and has used electricity infrastructure to provide fibre in certain parts of the United States as well.  Enet manages much of the publicly-owned fibre in this country.<\/p> <p>  That brings me to Deputy Stanley's question about the backhaul map because this is something about which I know an awful lot.  I was very much involved in having that map developed in the first place.  There had been a bizarre situation in this country whereby the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is at the time, the metropolitan area networks, MANs, and the Irish Rail network each had fibre networks, independently controlled by semi-State companies, but all ultimately owned by the taxpayer.  I have definitely been raising this issue for at least 15 years on the floor of the House if not longer - including during Deputy Eamon Ryan's time in the Department - and have been stating that we should bring all those State-owned fibre networks under the control of one semi-State agency.  It did not happen.  Enet has done that, except for the ESB network.  It is my intention to have an overall holding company to have all that fibre and to manage the day-to-day running of the NBP once the contracts are signed.  Legislation is promised in this area.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanley spoke about an auction.  It is not an auction.

David McCourt has said publicly in interviews that enet cannot revisit what has been agreed.  I will ask the officials to come back with the detail of that.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanley is right that minimum speeds have been a concern for me.  There are people in this city, quite close to where we sit, who have very poor or no broadband.  There are pockets like this throughout the country.  My commitment is to bring high-speed broadband to every single home and premises across Ireland, not just rural but urban as well.  We feel the most effective way to deal with that is to have a universal service obligation so that the incumbent, or whoever is providing the network, would be legally obliged if there are one or two homes or premises that do not have access to it, to ensure they are provided with it.  Over the past 12 months, the team and I have been negotiating in Brussels a provision to allow each member state to introduce a universal service obligation for a minimum standard on high-speed broadband.  That was agreed in December.  Initially, that will probably be at 30 Mbps, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day.  Quite quickly, that will increase to 100 Mbps and as demand changes it will go up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#G00700","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":719,"content":"<p>What about the companies and the services that are already there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#G00800","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":720,"content":"<p>That will oblige existing operators to improve their offering to meet that minimum standard as and when it is required.

The Irish Farmers Association had publicly endorsed Eir in this regard in advance of its formal approach to me on it and I made it crystal clear to Eir that I was not prepared to alter the map on a promise.  I needed a detailed commitment agreement because we had all got promises from Eir and Eircom in the past about fibre-to-the-cabinet that did not happen and if we were going to alter the map, I said I needed a binding commitment on that and that is how the commitment agreement came about.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#G00900","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":721,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Lawless and then I will call Deputy Ryan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#H00100","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":722,"content":"<p>I will group a number of questions together but I hope to get answers to each one.

I recently spoke about some of my constituents in Kildare North, which is on the Dublin border and is 30 km from Leinster House, who cannot get it.  The western parts of Dublin cannot get it, never mind the west coast of Ireland.  Therefore, what is the best-case scenario?  I mean if everything goes smoothly, everyone is singing and dancing, everything is up to scratch and we hit the ground running in a way that, as the Minister said himself, is even better than had Eir not pulled out, that is, if we hit the ground with the shovels in hand.

The Minister might revert on the first question.  My third question relates to who owns the infrastructure.  Is it retail or wholesale?  Let us say it is enet, which it appears to be, barring some uncertain and unknown development.  If it is enet, good luck to it.  On the infrastructure that is built out and the kit provided to the homes in the intervention areas, will enet be the only option for broadband in those areas or will there be a wholesale package that Vodafone, Imagine or Eir could plug into to sell it on to the customer?<\/p><p>I also mentioned my fourth question in the House the other day.  We are all examining the possibility of having fibre to the home and realise that it is the gold standard, as it delivers up to 1,000 Mbps.  Is there now an argument for a phased approach?  Have technologies such as fixed wireless been considered at any point?  We can already get 70 Mbps with fixed wireless already.  I have worked with it in Kildare.  We have done this through the private sector in many places in Kildare where they could not get alternatives.  The minimum standard in the national broadband plan is 30 Mbps.  If I was living in a home in an intervention area and, depending on the answer to the first question, waiting five or ten years to get it, I might be very happy to get fixed wireless as an interim solution.  It might be possible to roll that out relatively cost efficiently and quickly.  Might that be considered as an interim measure in some of those areas which are at the end of the queue?  Even if things go swimmingly well, they might otherwise be waiting several years to get it.<\/p><p>We have spoken about procedures already today and what can and cannot be done.

I believe in the separation of powers and, in particular, I believe in Article 28.4, which provides that the Government is accountable to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in all its actions.  I was a little bit taken aback when I came out of a vote this afternoon to see as a headline on the website of <i>The Irish Times <\/i>that the Government will ignore the vote of the D&aacute;il.

The Minister said that this was a matter for the Oireachtas committee.

Eir had made the approach on previous occasions.  As the Minister said, it was public in terms of Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and others.  In the correspondence, the Minister says that it was not a political decision but a commercial decision.  He said that he could not interfere under state aid rules and had to just accept it.  The state aid rules argument falls apart because he is saying that he cannot subsidise what would be a commercial venture but by taking out those 300,000 we have now clearly seen, with the loss of the two bidders, that it is not a commercial proposition.  It could not be argued under state aid rules that including those was an unwarranted subsidy because the commercial case for this is now clear.  I do not know if it said it publicly but it is common knowledge that the reason the ESB pulled out is that once those 300,000 premises went, the commercial case vanished.  Therefore, it was not a European Union state aid rules reason and it was not a commercial reason but a political decision to take out those 300,000 houses.  Previously it had been refused and the Minister changed the political response by saying it would be allowed.  To say to us that it was great because we got a promise that they would be delivered or that there would be commitments around it is not really the issue because it appears as though withdrawing those 300,000 houses from the scheme has undermined it.  Therefore, when did Eir first approach the Department looking to take out the 300,000?  What was the Department's response and what changed last April to allow it happen?<\/p> <p>  The scheme was designed so that we would have two awards with two different contract areas.  What was the reasoning for that?  While this would mean there would be competitive tenders and difficult technologies and solutions might be tried, I presume one of the main reasons is that it would allow performance to be tested.  It would be a useful way of testing performance.  How will we now test performance?   Eir will still be providing all the poles on which enet's fibre will hang.  How will we know whether the delivery is up to speed?   We cannot look at upstate New York or Germany or wherever else the Minister mentioned because the Irish countryside is different to New York's.  How are we to know?  How will we have a control on Eir?  It might say that the poles are fine and no investment is needed in new poles.  How is anyone to know?  What performance test do we have if we do not have two separate roll-outs as originally designed?<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister explain the agreement where Eir gets &euro;20 a pole?

The Deputy asked about Enet and whether it is a retail or wholesale operation.  Enet is a wholesale operation and this contract is for a wholesale operator.  The entity that wins this cannot retail the product.  The intention, and I do not see why it could not become the reality, is for the range of existing commercial operators retailing to the public providing an offering on that.  That is the most likely outcome.  From my discussions with people in the industry, I know they are anxiously awaiting this because they believe there are major opportunities for them.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about a phased approach in the build-out of fibre versus fibre to the home.  This was a technology-neutral competition and there was a competitive tender dialogue process to formulate the best long-term solution.  It was the right way to go.  The national broadband scheme brought 3G mobile services to rural areas but the day it went live, it was obsolete because technology had moved on.  In this process we are bidding to get a solution that meets the requirements for the next 25 years and beyond.  It is a question I asked of Mr. Vint Cerf when I invited him to Dublin during the summer.  I was concerned that in five years there could be some fabulous solution that is even better than fibre but Mr. Cerf made it quite clear to me there is nothing faster than light.  At that stage there was commercial roll-out of 10,000 Mbps using fibre.  I understand from some of the experts in the field now that one can even get up to 40,000 Mbps.

I am sure the Minister is aware that the Irish people pay the third highest prices for broadband in the European Union.  Only Luxembourg and Malta pay more than we do.<\/p><p>We rank 22nd in terms of the quality of connection so we have one of the highest costs to the public and a really poor service.  I believe this is largely due to the monopoly activity of private sector operators in the market coupled with a history of weak regulation by the Irish State.  The national broadband plan was an admirable and visionary plan but the State has been led a merry dance by private sector operators.  I hope I am wrong but my prediction is that based on what has happened, what is happening and the direction the Minister seems intent on taking this, for the next 25 years the Irish people will continue to be fleeced on broadband prices.  <br\/><br\/>With regard to the process, originally, there was a map of the country with blue and orange areas.  We were told that the blue areas, which were generally the urban areas, were already covered by private operators and would be completely filled in by private operators by the end of 2016.  That is what it said on the Department's web page.  That then changed.  I looked it up the other day when I heard that Eir had pulled out.  It no longer says that urban areas will be covered by commercial operators by 2016.  It talks about where commercial operators are delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high-speed broadband services so there are no dates anymore.  So now the test for urban areas is that some private operator must have stated that it has a plan to deliver to that area.  I will read out a response from Eir to a Fianna F&aacute;il councillor in Greystones about an estate in Greystones in a blue area.  Eir stated there were no plans at that stage of which it was aware to deliver enhanced broadband to this area.  We have gone from the private operators getting this finished by 2016 to the private operators at least being obliged to have a plan to do this at some point in the future to the private operators, or at least Eir in this case, writing to a public representative saying it has no plans to do this.  That is what is happening on the ground today.  <br\/><br\/>We then got the news last year that what Eir had actually done was go through the country on a house-by-house level so anyone who pulls up the national broadband plan will see all of these light blue areas, the 300,000 premises that Eir will do.  They are not big geographic chunks.  Eir has gone up roads.  It has gone up this road and that road.  Interestingly, we will have to connect a lot of the bit that is left through Eir.  My understanding is there is now a big fight happening because Eir wants to charge a heap of money for the bit that is left, that is, for those data to go over the bit Eir said it is going to do.  My understanding of reports at the time was that Eir running away with these profitable bits increases by several hundred million euro the cost to the State because we are left with the least profitable and most expensive pieces.  I do not know whether Eir will do it but it appears it can now sit like a troll on a bridge and demand rent from every consumer who must pass over its network and indeed demand rent for the poles, which it has been doing for many years.  <br\/><br\/>The result of all of this is that, obviously, we have one bidder left so by definition, this is no longer a competitive tender process.  There is no competitive tension left in this at all.  Eir has taken a big chunk of it - the profitable piece - and it appears enet will do the other piece so what is essentially happening is that we are moving from a monopoly network, which means the Irish people have been screwed for years on price and we all know this, to several localised monopolies, one of which is owned by Eir.  I will read from an article in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>on this matter.  I would be interested in getting the Minister's thoughts.  The article stated that Eircom had racked up &euro;4.1 billion of gross debt through five ownership changes in 13 years - and, of course, we have just had another ownership change - before it was forced into the State's largest ever examinership filing in 2012 resulting in &euro;1.8 billion of its borrowings being written off and a band of its most senior lenders led by US investment giant Blackstone seizing control of the business.  The article states:<\/p><blockquote>In the interim, the company, or what was left of it, has had many owners who, as short-term investors do, asset stripped with abandon.  The company was entangled in almost insurmountable debt.  Its broadband service, especially in rural areas but in many suburban areas too, was - and often still is - hopelessly inadequate despite being among the most expensive in Europe.  <\/blockquote><p>In an article in <i>Silicon Republic<\/i>, John Kennedy states that &quot;needless to say, it came to naught, and what followed was a decade of asset-stripping by various owners of post-IPO Eircom; failed and dashed investments in a promised brave new age of deregulation.&quot;  So that company has just taken ownership of these 300,000, and in my opinion, has been allowed to do so by the Government.  That is very worrying.  The Minister's response has been that this is great news because it is accelerating the connection to houses but he never talks about price.  That is Eir.  <br\/><br\/>The second monopoly provider is enet.  I am not alleging that enet has done anything wrong but I am alleging that the Government is doing something wrong because in the past hour, I received a response from the Department to a parliamentary question I tabled.  It specifically concerned the FOI request that Gavin Sheridan submitted.  What Gavin Sheridan sought was the concession agreement between enet and the Government.  In other words, the Irish people already pay enet to operate a fibre network that was put in the ground with European money many years ago specifically to deal with rural areas that the market would not get to - in other words, a small version of what the Minister is about give enet now.  I submitted a parliamentary question to say I was very perplexed by this because Gavin Sheridan put in his FOI request asking to see the concession agreement and the Department refused.  Mr. Sheridan then appealed the decision to the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and the commissioner told the Department it needed to release the information because it is public interest and does not violate commercial sensitivity.  The Department, or the Government, took the extraordinary step of appealing that to the High Court, which ruled in Gavin Sheridan's favour and said there is public interest to be served and commercial sensitivity does not cover this.  The High Court ordered the Department to release the concession agreement - enet's agreement with the State - to Gavin Sheridan.  The Department then took the extraordinary step of appealing the High Court's decision to the Court of Appeal, which, coincidentally, is not scheduled until February next year - long after enet will have signed up to its new contract.<br\/><br\/>I submitted a parliamentary question to the Department a few days ago in which I asked how many FOI requests had been received by the Department since 2010 and of those, how many it had brought to the High Court or Court of Appeal.  How often in the past eight years has the Department gone to court to stop anyone finding anything out?  The Minister probably will not be surprised to find out that the answer is that of the 799 FOI requests submitted to his Department over the past eight years, the Department has gone to court once and that was to protect the enet concession agreement.  Does the Minister think there is a case to answer here where he and this Government have gone to court once after receiving over nearly 800 FOI requests over eight years to protect an existing agreement between the State and enet, which the court has ruled the Department needs to release?  Yet the Minister is asking Parliament and the Irish people to trust him in signing up to an even bigger version of the same contract with enet.  Does the Minister think that is reasonable?  In the context of asking Parliament and the Irish people to trust that the Minister will do a great deal with enet, will he now obey the order of the High Court and release that information to Gavin Sheridan so that we can see what is happening?  Does he accept that creating these monopolies constitutes a serious risk to the future pricing for Irish business and domestic consumers over the coming years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#J01500","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":749,"content":"<p>There are a number of questions there from Senator Lombard and Deputy Donnelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#K00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":750,"content":"<p>As Deputy Donnelly knows, I cannot comment on stuff that is before the courts.  There are probably questions over whether it should be discussed here but I will come back to that in a minute.<\/p><p> I can inform Senator Lombard that in the commitment agreement it signed with me, Eir gave a commitment to deliver broadband to approximately 179,000 premises before the end of this year.  It has said in the correspondence that is in the possession of the joint committee that it will fulfil that commitment agreement and will deliver on the 300,000 homes and premises by the end of the year.<\/p><p> The Senator also asked about the roadblocks that are ahead.  I have been trying to pre-empt many of these roadblocks through the mobile phone and broadband task force.  Many of the roadblocks will arise during the physical roll-out of the infrastructure.  We have done a great deal.  We have appointed a broadband officer in each local authority.  We are currently considering whether to ramp that up to a broadband office in each local authority.  We have streamlined the licensing process.  We have a uniform standard for road reopening and reinstatement.  We have completed ducting across the country on the Transport Infrastructure Ireland national road network.  I do not know whether there will be other roadblocks.  I hope not.  I am very engaged with the industry.  We are trying to deal with these issues in a proactive manner.<\/p><p> Deputy Lawless, who has proposed legislation in this area, also raised a number of issues.  I am quite happy to try to facilitate any proposals that deal with the roadblocks as we draw up the infrastructure access legislation and bring it through the House.<\/p><p> I was asked whether EU approval is needed.  Approval is required from the perspective of State aid.  We have been very engaged with the European Commission throughout this process.  As I said in my opening remarks, the Commission believes the commitment agreement we have with Eir could and should be replicated by other member states.  The Commission is quite impressed by the standard we have achieved in this respect.  Maybe I will ask my officials to come back to the committee on this in further detail because they deal with the Commission on a regular basis.  The reason for the detailed level of engagement with the Commission is to ensure this can quickly go through the formal process of State aid approval.  Our objective is to get moving on it quite quickly.<\/p><p> Deputy Donnelly raised the issue of cost versus service in the context of weak regulation.  It is absolutely the case that cost versus service is an issue.  The Deputy is aware that these issues are regulated.  I am quite happy to look at any recommendations that will come from the committee regarding regulation in this area.  I think there is legislation coming forward on ComReg and on regulation in general.  We are quite happy to look at any constructive suggestions that may be made in this regard.  As I said earlier, I advise and encourage the committee to invite representatives of ComReg to come before it so that these questions can be put to them.<\/p><p> Deputy Donnelly spoke about the blue, amber and light blue areas.  As he knows, I have encouraged colleagues formally, informally and on the floor of the House to raise anomalies within the blue area.  I emailed the offices of all Deputies to ask them to highlight anomalies within the blue area.  A number of colleagues did so and I thank them for their input.  The individual who is responsible for the map is Mr. Pat Neary, who is sitting beside me.  Maybe he can go into further detail when he gets an opportunity to do so in a few minutes.  We have changed from dark blue to amber any area or house that was not getting or would not get a minimum of 30 Mbps.  As I said earlier, our intention is to bring high-speed broadband to every home and business in Ireland, both urban and rural.  The gaps will have to be addressed.  We have made provision within the contract to allow for that.  We also believe the universal service obligation will deal with many of these areas.<\/p><p> Deputy Donnelly suggested that the light blue area has been compiled on a house by house basis.  I can inform him that it has been done on an postcode by postcode basis.  I refused to sign the commitment agreement until I got a list of postcodes across the country to which Eir was committing to provide high-speed broadband.  I did not want to say we were going to do 300,000 because people would have wanted to know whether we were going to do 150,000 in Laois while other places were left high and dry.  We have a list that has been compiled on the basis of postcodes.  Just over 300,000 postcodes were presented to us.<\/p><p> It will not be the case that people will have to pay for the data over that fibre.  It will be part of the whole procurement process.  I will ask the officials who are with me to deal with that in a few minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018020800002#K00300","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1518100800,"counter":752,"content":"<p>I want to make sure I understand the Minister correctly regarding the light blue areas that Eir will now own.

I did not want to see people having to wait to for responses to freedom of information requests to get information.  I know that a number of colleagues have had individual briefings on this issue and other issues within my Department.  That is my approach.
