Having considered the file the DPP advised that the file did not warrant prosecution of any individual. Thereafter GSOC considered and decided against launching any investigation of matters which may constitute indiscipline.<br\/><br\/>The Report by GSOC also contained a series of recommendations related to informant handling procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, oversight of those procedures, as well as intelligence handling and information exchange between GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br\/><br\/>At the time my predecessor sought the observations of the Garda Commissioner on the Report and its recommendations.  In response, the Garda Commissioner pointed that following the putting in place of a code of practice for the management of Covert Human Intelligence Sources many of the recommendations made by GSOC were already incorporated into Garda procedures. The Commissioner also emphasised that informants are clearly instructed that they may not commit crimes or act as <i>agents provocateur.<\/i><br\/><br\/>I should emphasise that there has been, since 2010, an independent, external oversight mechanism in place to ensure compliance with the code of practice.  The current holder of this appointment is Mr Justice Thomas Smyth, former judge of the High Court. Mr Justice Smyth's report for 2012 has been published and I am currently making arrangements to publish his reports for 2013 and 2014. I am pleased to note that the Judge has indicated that he received full cooperation from relevant members of An Garda Siochana in compiling his report and he records substantial compliance with the code of practice by An Garda Siochana.<br\/><br\/>I should mention that the recent Inspectorate report makes a number of recommendations in relation to the handling of information and these will be addressed.<br\/><br\/>A Memorandum of Understanding, Protocols and Agreement on Operational Matters, agreed by the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) has been in place between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC since the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in 2007. However, a new Memorandum of Understanding, Protocols and Agreement on Operational Matters has been agreed between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC and was signed by the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission on 23rd September, 2013.  The Memorandum of Understanding agrees protocols for operational matters between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC, including the provision of information to GSOC by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br\/><br\/>There is continued ongoing co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC to address any issues that arise during the course of an investigation. A working relationship is maintained between the two organisations with regular formal and informal meetings between senior management representatives. In addition, the Garda Commissioner has established a dedicated office (GSOC Liaison Office) to process and monitor all such requests and ensure that all correspondence with GSOC is attended to in a timely manner.<br\/><br\/>In the context of Garda oversight generally, the Deputy will be aware that I recently introduced the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014.  The main purpose of the Bill  is to amend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to expand the remit and powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC). The Bill will bring the Garda Commissioner within the remit of GSOC for the first time. It will also ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides information sought by GSOC for an investigation as soon as practicable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800053#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Misconduct Allegations","counter":10,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800053#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":11,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[41132\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800053#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress achieved to date by the independent review panel convened by her to examine allegations of Garda misconduct.","asker":"1190","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":12,"content":"<p>The Deputy is referring to the mechanism established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which have been made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, to the Taoiseach, or to other public representatives, with a view to determining to what extent and in what manner further action may be required in each case.

Section 20 of the 2005 Act provides that the Minister may, following consultation with the Garda Commissioner, determine and revise priorities for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in performing its functions under the Act and section 22 of the Act requires the Garda Commissioner each year to prepare a Policing Plan and, in so doing, to have regard <i>inter alia<\/i>to the priorities determined by the Minister.<br\/><br\/>The policing priorities I have drawn up for 2015 focus in particular on strengthening the ability of the Garda&iacute; to meet the varying needs of different local communities, supporting the needs of victims of crime, targeting domestic and sexual violence as well as maintaining the fight against serious organised crime and ensuring a more efficient use of Garda personnel and other resources.  These priorities also focus strongly on the policing and security elements of the Government's broader programme of criminal justice reform. These priorities have been communicated to the interim Garda Commissioner and will inform the 2015 policing plan which will be submitted to me for approval in the coming weeks before it is laid before the houses of the Oireachtas.<br\/><br\/>As regards the question of additional funding, it is of course the case that significant additional funding has been provided for the Garda vote in 2015, including to allow for ongoing additional recruitment and procurement of additional Garda vehicles.  I have also clearly signalled  in recent days my intention to support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their efforts to address particular deficits identified in the recent Garda Inspectorate report on crime investigation.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that the issues raised in the report are widespread, varied and far-reaching and, when taken together with the review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Haddington Road agreement, will demand significant structural reform within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The issue of additional funding will be addressed within that context. I am working with Minister Howlin to secure the necessary and early investment in upgrading Garda technology to bring outdated paper based practices into the 21st century and I look forward, too, to the significant contribution to this process by the policing authority which is to be established shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800053#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Inspectorate Reports","counter":16,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800053#WRA01150"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[43783\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800053#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide a response to the report of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate into the investigation of serious crime; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, last week I published the report of the Garda Inspectorate on Crime Investigation and welcomed its analysis as providing the foundation stone for the future development of a 21st century policing service for Ireland.  The report rightly acknowledges the dedication and commitment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and indeed notes that many of the issues raised had been identified in other comparable police forces. We should bear in mind too that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na day in day out has considerable success in bringing offenders to justice and keeping our communities safe.  Nevertheless, as I said on its publication, its findings raise serious concerns and represent a highly challenging analysis of Garda processes and systems.<br\/><br\/>The Report will play an important role in the overall justice reform programme underway, including the establishment of an independent Police Authority, strengthening the powers of GSOC, and the open competition for the recruitment of the Garda Commissioner.<br\/><br\/>Implementation of this programme is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform, chaired by An Taoiseach, and this Committee will also now take on a role in overseeing delivery of the reforms recommended by the Inspectorate.<br\/><br\/>There will also of course be a central role for the new Police Authority and Garda Commissioner in implementing the identified reform.  Ahead of the establishment of the Policing Authority, I intend to hold discussions with Josephine Feehily, the Chairman-designate, on the establishment of an effective implementation framework to oversee delivery of reforms in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, along the lines recommended by the Inspectorate.<br\/><br\/>The incoming Garda Commissioner, who is due to be appointed shortly following an open competition, will also be central in driving implementation of many of the reforms arising from the Inspectorate&rsquo;s analysis.  In advance of this appointment, I have already welcomed the decision of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to establish an Implementation Steering Group to immediately focus on the implementation of the short<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">, <\/font>medium and long-term recommendations in the Report, and a programme of Risk compliance and Continuous Improvement Teams which will be introduced in each region to support a revised focus on professional standards and to tackle any weaknesses identified in the Inspectorate's report.  I have also asked the Acting Commissioner for an overall response to the Report and its recommendations.<br\/><br\/>In addition, upon publication of the Report I set out a further comprehensive series of measures being taken to address the issues identified by the Inspectorate including:<br\/><br\/>- plans for the necessary and early investment in upgrading Garda technology to bring outdated paper based practices into the 21st century<br\/><br\/>- new Garda measures to improve consistency and accuracy of data<br\/><br\/>- a review of the report by the CSO to see whether and to what extent it may have implications for the crime statistics which that Office produces<br\/><br\/>- an expert group to be chaired by the CSO to examine its recommendations, including in relation to crime counting and detection rules, with a view to introducing new national standards<br\/><br\/>- measures to improve supports for victims, including victims of domestic and sexual violence.<br\/><br\/>It is clear from the Report that developments in systems and processes in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have not kept pace with developments in broader society and police forces globally.  The Report's analysis has been welcomed by Government and we are determined to act on it.  I can assure the Deputy that we will work to equip An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to meet all of the challenges of 21st century policing, and to put the needs of victims first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800053#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Misconduct Allegations","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800053#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[43825\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800053#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will provide an update on the special barristers panel review of a case (details supplied); the time frame as to when the panel will report back; if the panel or her Department plan to contact the person in relation to the details of the case under review; if she will respond to correspondence and questions submitted some time ago by the person's legal representative for which there has been no reply to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>The Deputy is referring to the mechanism established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which have been made to me as Minister for Justice and Equality, to the Taoiseach, or to other public representatives, with a view to determining to what extent and in what manner further action may be required in each case.

It is a pity that those who have questions to answer in relation to her mistreatment have acted in stark contrast, evading and distorting.<br\/><br\/>I have spoken about the issues arising with my Northern Ireland counterpart, Justice Minister David Ford, and we will be discussing the matter further later this week in the context of a ministerial meeting in the framework of North-South co-operation on criminal justice matters to see whether there are any additional actions that we might usefully consider.<br\/><br\/>Whatever the circumstances, it is never easy for victims of rape and sexual abuse to come forward with their complaints and to speak out, and when they do they deserve to be listened to and to be treated with sensitivity and respect.  Victims of abuse in this jurisdiction can report sexual offences to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have clear and long-standing guidelines in place for dealing with such complaints which are strongly focused on adopting a sensitive approach to the complainant.  The Garda&iacute; will investigate any complaints of sexual offences reported to them where it is in their jurisdiction to do so, and they work closely with the health and other social services and with services such as the Rape Crisis Centre in dealing with such complaints.<br\/><br\/>In this jurisdiction there is 24-hour helpline for victims of sexual violence which is operated by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre that is staffed by highly trained people.

I encourage any victims of sexual violence to use these avenues to come forward.<br\/><br\/>It is not now nor has it ever been acceptable for anyone to seek to suppress the reporting of sexual offences to the appropriate authorities or to seek to protect rapists or sex abusers.  Whenever these brutal crimes occur they need to be investigated thoroughly and in accordance with the law.

An overpayment will arise where, in accordance with Part 11 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, a revised decision is made by a Deciding Officer on a claimant&rsquo;s entitlement resulting in a retrospective reduction in their entitlement.  In deciding whether or not the decision should have retrospective effect, Deciding Officers are required to have regard to the facts relevant to the decision on entitlement.  Founding their decision on facts will ensure that the deciding officers&rsquo; actions can result in the Department pursuing all debts.  Customers who have been overpaid have a liability to refund the overpayment (Section 338 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005 (as amended) refers.  <\/p><p>  When a revised decision is made, the claimant is notified and given the opportunity to appeal the decision within 21 days.  Once the right of appeal has been exercised (or not) the Department will then consider the recovery of the overpayment.  <\/p><p>  A debt to the Department of Social Protection may comprise of a single overpayment or a number of overpayments.  Once an overpayment has been assessed, and the person has been notified, any correspondence thereafter seeking recovery would refer to the total amount of debt owed.  Therefore, the Department does not have the information requested by the Deputy regarding the number of persons who have been contacted in 2014 regarding scheme overpayments which were assessed against them prior to 2008.<\/p><p>  When seeking to recover an overpayment, the rate of recovery proposed will be the maximum repayment that the person can afford in order to recover the overpayment as quickly as possible.  Although the Department is empowered to deduct 15% of the weekly personal rate payable in respect of an overpayment without the customer&rsquo;s consent, an officer may, nevertheless, ask the customer to repay the debt at a higher rate, where it is considered that they have the ability to pay.  If the customer does not consent, then a deduction of more than 15% cannot be implemented.  Similarly, an officer can consider deducting less than 15% in certain circumstances.  Once a deduction is put in place it is not recorded if this was as a result of the customer&rsquo;s agreement or in accordance with Section 13 of the Social Welfare Act, 2012 which allows for a deduction of an amount up to 15% of the weekly personal rate payable to a customer without the customer&rsquo;s consent.<\/p><p>  A social welfare debt will not become statute barred for recovery.  It remains with a debtor for all future entitlement payments, and can be collected thereafter from any remaining estate.  There is no statute of limitations preventing the Department recovering its debts by deduction from entitlements.  Effective debt recovery is seen as an important measure to safeguard public expenditure.  Where someone has been overpaid social welfare it is important that this money is recouped.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800054#WRB02400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":102,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800054#WRB02450"},{"type":"question","counter":103,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[43862\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800054#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the options available in respect of a person (details supplied) in view of the fact that their appeal to backdate carer's allowance was refused; and if further information provided by the applicant will be considered.","asker":"1048","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":104,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an Appeals Officer, having fully considered all of the available evidence, decided to disallow the appeal of the person concerned by way of a summary decision.

As at 14 November 2014, a total of 35,167 internships have commenced with 6,676 participants currently on a JobBridge placement, and 2,078 internship posts currently advertised on the JobBridge website.<\/p><p>  In County Mayo, there have been a total of 935 internships since the scheme commenced.  Of this, 198 are currently on a placement, with 737 internships completed at this point in time.  A total of 218 of these interns progressed into employment, either with their host organisation or another organisation on completion of their JobBridge placement.<\/p><p>  Progression into employment on completion of an internship understates the impact of the scheme as many people use their work experience to apply for and secure employment in the months immediately following the internship.  In this regard, an independent evaluation of JobBridge found that 61% of individuals who have participated in the scheme have progressed into employment within five months of completing their internship placements.  A total of 45.2% of these were in full-time permanent employment, 9.3% were in part-time permanent employment, 35.0% were in full-time temporary employment and 10.5% were in part-time temporary employment. The majority of these have progressed to employment with their host organisations, while the remainder took the skills and experiences gained during their internship to employment in the wider labour market. This high level of progression into employment exceeds that of similar schemes across Europe. <\/p><p>  I am confident that JobBridge will continue as a positive activation programme, and that the scheme will display similar progression rates into employment, into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800055#WRC00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":120,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 138 and 139 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800055#WRC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[44094\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800055#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason a new application for dietary allowance is required in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare when a previous application was granted upon appeal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>The person concerned has been in receipt of a dietary allowance since 01 September 2012.

This year a bonus of 25% will be paid in early December to all long-term welfare recipients including all pensioners and carers. This will cost over &euro;63 million and is in recognition of the position of vulnerable households.<\/p><p>  There will be an increase in the living alone allowance of &euro;1.30 per week from January, bringing the rate up from &euro;7.70 to &euro;9 for pensioners and people with disabilities.  The living alone allowance is a payment made to pensioners and people with disabilities who live alone and was last increased in 1996.  In Budget 2015 the household benefits scheme, the fuel allowance scheme and the free travel pass were also maintained.<\/p><p>  The overall concern of the Government in Budget 2015 and previous Budgets has been to protect the primary social welfare rates. Expenditure on pensions is the largest block of expenditure in the Department, representing about a third of overall expenditure.  Because of demographic changes the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.  The savings generated by reductions in secondary benefits were essential to maintain core weekly payments.<\/p><p>  The adjustments made to the household benefits package in recent years have made it much easier for customers to switch to cheaper energy suppliers, without the loss of any credits they may have built up.  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance provided annual savings of &euro;48 million and meant that the Department was able to retain the other elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence. These are valuable supports for recipients.

Previously, these profits were exempt from Income and Corporation Tax.<br\/><br\/>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that figures for the profits earned from the provision of stallion stud services were required to be returned in Income Tax and Corporation Tax returns from the tax year 2008 onwards. The figures from returns are as set out in a table for the tax years 2008 to 2012, the most recent available.<br\/><br\/><b>Profits earned from the provision of stallion stud services<\/b><table><tr><th>Tax Year<\/th><th>Income Tax Returns &euro;m<\/th><th>Corporation Tax Returns &euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2008*<\/td><td>1.1<\/td><td>0.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>0.5<\/td><td>4.0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>0.7<\/td><td>2.3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>0.7<\/td><td>2.2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>0.7<\/td><td>6.4<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>*These figures do not include fees and profits that were exempt prior to 1 August 2008.<br\/><br\/>In interpreting these figures it is important to bear in mind that they are profits as opposed to the total fees earned by an owner. Income Tax and Corporation Tax are charged on profits or gains rather than gross fee income. In calculating the profits or gains, stallions are treated as stock in trade which means that income from stud fees and profits or gains on the sale of the stallions are fully taxable in the hands of both corporate and individual owners.<br\/><br\/>In computing profits, a write-off over 4 years of the &quot;initial value&quot; of the stallion is allowed as a deduction for tax purposes. This reflects the fact that some stallions have a short nomination life and also takes into account that the majority of stallions are unsuccessful at stud. The impact of the deduction on taxable profits during the write-off period is directly related to the success, or otherwise, of the stallion. Without this provision the cost of a stallion would, under normal rules, only be allowed as a deduction upon its disposal or death.<br\/><br\/>As stallion related profits or gains are aggregated with all other incomes for the purposes of Income and Corporation Tax calculations, it is therefore not possible to specify the separate Income or Corporation Tax yield from these activities. All taxpayers, both individual and corporate, can have a number of sources of income, and can avail of a variety of different deductions and reliefs, which affect the final tax liability. In addition, the profit figures shown above may be reduced by capital allowances or losses to which that taxpayer may be entitled. Therefore, it is not possible to infer from these figures the amount of tax that is generated solely from the taxation of these profits or gains.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy has also asked for the amount of income associated with the top ten stallion operations. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, to ensure the confidentiality of Revenue's taxpayer information, it would not be appropriate for the Commissioners to reveal the profits of the top ten cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800056#WRD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800056#WRD03100"},{"type":"question","counter":174,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[43896\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800056#WRD03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the impact for the development of an Irish knowledge development box of reports that the UK and Germany have agreed to phase out their respective patent box tax incentives;

This trend has continued, and the early opening ensures that there is no build up of queues and consequent delays once the doors open. <\/p><p>  As with any modern service provider, the Deputy will appreciate that good business practice requires Revenue to constantly review the delivery of services to ensure that they can facilitate peaks and troughs in demand levels, as well as changing customer preferences for the way in which they wish to carry out their transactions with Revenue. Revenue will therefore continue to monitor and evaluate customer demands in relation to the CRIO. The Deputy can be assured that a flexible and responsive approach will be taken in the event of changes in demand levels. However, Revenue is confident that the service that the Office currently provides is meeting the current demand level from customers in the Dublin area who wish to carry out their business on a face-to-face basis with Revenue.<\/p><p>  The key objective of the Central Revenue Information Office (CRIO, is the provision of a best-practice, speedy and efficient service for customers. The Office therefore has a range of state-of-the-art systems in place to facilitate a high quality service. For example, the CRIO has:<\/p><p>  - a reception area that deals very quickly with callers who have non-transactional enquiries, such as basic information requests. The enquiries of some 66% of callers to the CRIO are dealt with in this area;<\/p><p>  - the availability of computers whereby customers can carry out their transactions on a self-service basis. CRIO staff are available to provide guidance on the use of Revenue's self-service systems, PAYE Anytime and the Revenue On-line Service (ROS), if required by customers;<\/p><p>  - a modern electronic queue management system that ensures that queuing times are kept to a minimum for those customers who need to proceed to the counter;<\/p><p>  - counter facilities that allow many customer transactions to be carried out on-the-spot;<\/p><p>  - a dedicated team of experienced expert staff who can deal with the wide range of enquiries received in the Office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800057#WRE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Application","counter":190,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800057#WRE01200"},{"type":"question","counter":191,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[44016\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800057#WRE01350","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of persons who availed of the rent-a-room tax relief scheme in 2013.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":192,"content":"<p>Section 216A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997,\u00a0provides an exemption from income tax to individuals who let a room or rooms in their sole or main residence, known as rent-a-room relief.

Where the owner is aged 70 or over for the whole of a tax year the rate continues at 5%. The existing 6% rate also continues in all cases where the value of the ARF\/vested PRSA is greater than &euro;2 million.<\/p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information provided to them in the context of the tax paid on these deemed or imputed distributions does not include information on the value of the ARFs and\/or vested PRSAs out of which the distributions are deemed to arise or on the age profile of the beneficial owners of these funds. \u00a0Moreover, details of tax paid on actual withdrawals from ARFs or vested PRSAs are not separately collated. There is therefore no basis on which a reliable estimate of the impact on the Exchequer of the change mentioned in the question could be compiled. <\/p><p>  The deemed or imputed distribution measure which was introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2006 is designed to encourage draw downs from ARFs and vested PRSAs so that they are used, as intended, to fund a stream of income in retirement in the same way as a retirement annuity, for which ARFs and vested PRSAs are supposed to operate as a more flexible alternative. The measure, in itself, is not intended to nor does it give rise to significant tax revenues as it does not apply to actual draw-downs from ARFs and vested PRSAs which are taxed in the normal way. By way of indication, the amounts received by the Revenue Commissioners from tax paid on imputed distributions has averaged about &euro;4 million per annum in the period 2007 to 2013.<\/p><p>  I should also say, however, that to the extent that the change in the imputed distribution rate to 4% will result in reduced actual draw downs\u00a0 by affected ARF or vested PRSA owners, that any consequent reduction in tax revenue from this source will be offset to some extent by the increased tax revenue from the beneficial owners of Approved Minimum Retirement Funds (AMRFs) who can avail from next year of the option (also introduced in Finance Bill 2014) to access up to 4% of the value of assets in those funds, subject to tax at the marginal rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800057#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":200,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800057#WRE02200"},{"type":"question","counter":201,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[44055\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800057#WRE02350","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 233 of 21 October 2014 in which the consideration relating to trees growing on the land saleable under wood continues to be regarded as income arising from a trade and not capital gains, if he will indicate whether such income is considered under his proposed change in the income averaging period from three to five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":202,"content":"<p>The taxation of clear-felling profits earned from the forestry sector was examined in the recently published Agri-tax review.<br\/><br\/>Profits or gains from the commercial occupation of woodlands are tax exempt for the purposes of income and corporation tax.

Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.<br\/><br\/><b>Group B: &euro;30,150 - <\/b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.<br\/><br\/><b>Group C: &euro;15,075 -<\/b>applies in all other cases.<br\/><br\/>Any prior gifts or inheritances received by a child from their parents since 5 December 1991 are aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on the current benefit.<br\/><br\/>In addition to these tax-free thresholds, a number of exemptions and reliefs from CAT are provided in CAT legislation.<br\/><br\/>Section 82 exempts certain receipts from Capital Acquisitions Tax.<br\/><br\/>Under section 82(2), <b>normal<\/b>and <b>reasonable<\/b>payments made by a disponer, during his or her lifetime, for the support, maintenance or education of his or her children (including the\u00a0 children of a civil partner), or to a person to whom the disponer stands in loco parentis, or to a dependent relative of the disponer, are exempt from CAT. <br\/><br\/>The exemption, as it stands, applies to children without any age restriction and the test in relation to what is normal and reasonable is determined by the circumstances of the disponer.  There is evidence that the exemption is being used to provide significant sums tax-free to adult children far in advance of the intention of the exemption.<br\/><br\/>The proposed amendment to section 82(2) in the Finance Bill is intended to ensure, where there is the need to make provision for support, maintenance or education of children, that the exemption is confined to payments made to minor children and to children under the age of 25 years who are in full-time education. <br\/><br\/>It is appropriate to note that this exemption is additional to the CAT tax-free threshold available to a child (currently &euro;225,000). \u00a0The tightening of the rules also does not affect the small gift exemption under which anyone can receive gifts of up to &euro;3,000 in any year from any other individual.  Adult children can therefore receive up to &euro;6,000 a year from parents without any CAT implications.<br\/><br\/>Section 82(4) currently provides a similar exemption for normal and reasonable payments made to an orphaned child or to an orphaned child of a civil partner<b><\/b>for support, maintenance or education, after the death of their parents, from a trust set up by the parents during their lifetime.  However, the legislation currently confines this exemption to <b>minor orphaned children<\/b>.<br\/><br\/>The second proposed amendment to this section extends the exemption to orphaned children up to the age of 25 years who are in full-time education, thus ensuring that children of living parents and orphaned children are treated equally for Capital Acquisitions Tax purposes.<br\/><br\/>I have also introduced an amendment to section 82 at the Committee Stage of the Bill.  This amendment expressly ensures that the exemption applies to a child, regardless of age, who is permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity.  This amendment addresses many of the concerns raised concerning the amendment to Section 82.<br\/><br\/>As stated, the purpose of the amendment is to ensure fairness in the application of the Gift Tax rules and to ensure that high net worth individuals do not claim exemption for valuable gifts of capital to their children by reference to the exemption provision in section 82 that is only intended to apply to normal and reasonable payments for the support, maintenance or education of children. <br\/><br\/>Finally, Revenue has stated categorically that it has no intention of pursuing people over routine, normal expenditure within families.  Suggestions have been made in the media that the amendment will result in the Revenue Commissioners attempting to attribute a value to the provision of bed and board by parents to children over 25 who continue to reside with them.  This is not the intention of the legislation and this suggestion may have caused needless concern to people.

The restructuring of the credit achieves such an outcome.<\/p><p>  The person who cares for the child for most of the year is entitled to the credit in the first instance.  Agreement as to who will be the primary carer of a child is a matter for the parents or guardians.  However, only the primary carer is entitled to the credit. <\/p><p>  There is no specific tax credit for children in the tax code.  Therefore, married or cohabiting couples are unable to avail of any additional credit to assist them in the financial maintenance of their children.\u00a0 In certain cases, such couples may need to maintain two households due to the location of employment, for example.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that where a primary carer is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting they would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one).  This is because the child is being cared for, in the main, in a family unit which includes two adults.  In such circumstances the primary carer cannot relinquish the credit to a secondary carer.  For the same reasons it follows that a secondary carer who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting, would not be entitled to the new credit (or indeed the former one) regardless of the marital status of the primary carer.<\/p><p>  As regards the potential of this change to interfere with the level of maintenance payments, if such reasoning were to be applied, then any general tax increase, as a result of an adjustment in tax credits, rates or bands could lead to similar situations.\u00a0 Ultimately, maintenance payments are a matter for parents and if necessary, the courts to decide. It is not possible, and indeed would not be appropriate, for the tax code to take account of every possible variable.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, as a result of an amendment which I brought forward at Committee Stage of Finance Bill (No.2) 2013, a principal carer who is entitled to the credit and who does not wish to avail of it can choose to surrender it.\u00a0 A secondary carer may then make a claim for the credit, provided that the qualifying child resides with him or her for not less than 100 days in the tax year.\u00a0 However a principal carer may not relinquish the credit for a number of reasons.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that the tax credit in its current form is working as intended and I have no plans to change it at this time.<\/p><p>  As regards tax relief for maintenance payments and other costs incurred by separated fathers, the position is that maintenance payments in respect of children are not taxable in the hands of the children or the receiving spouse.\u00a0 The effect of this is that the payments are treated in the same way as if the taxpayer was providing for the child out of his or her after-tax income.\u00a0 This is in line with the tax treatment of all other parents, where the cost of maintaining their children is not tax deductible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800058#WRF03200","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates","counter":250,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800058#WRF03300"},{"type":"question","counter":251,"qnumday":188,"qnumall":"[44238\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800058#WRF03400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there is sufficient regulation of variable interest rate mortgages; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":252,"content":"<p>At the outset, I must confirm to the Deputy that the lending institutions in Ireland -\u00a0including those in which the State has a shareholding -\u00a0are independent commercial entities.

Only the repair works such as those at Fahamore are covered under the allocation.  The programme of works the Council submitted to the OPW detailing how it proposes to spend the total allocation of &euro;1,226,920 included &euro;3,000 for works at Fahamore.

To be classified as a Community Hall, the premises needs to be used for purposes which are not for profit or gain and involve participation by inhabitants of the locality generally and are used for purposes which are of a recreational or otherwise of a social nature.  Many sports clubs\/organisations achieve exemption from rates of their property under this provision. <br\/><br\/>However, the Valuation Act, 2001 specifically excludes from this provision, the premises of a club registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904. Therefore, the premises of such a registered club are rateable, which essentially means that clubs that sell alcohol are rateable.\u00a0 This provision currently has the effect of making the entire premises occupied by the club rateable and not just that part of the premises normally used for the sale of alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0This is because the sale of alcohol is a commercial activity and a registered sports club is competing with other commercial licensed premises, all of which are rateable.<br\/><br\/>The Government recently announced that\u00a0we\u00a0will be\u00a0proposing an amendment to the Valuation (Amendment)(No.2) Bill 2012 which is currently progressing through the Seanad\u00a0that will\u00a0ease the rates burden for many local sports clubs.\u00a0<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">\u00a0<\/font>The proposed amendment would mean that Community Sports Clubs will only be liable for rates on buildings that are used for the generation of income.  Buildings that are used for the sale of alcohol or food, retail outlets etc. will be rated but buildings that are used for community sport will be exempt.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>In proposing this amendment,\u00a0we are\u00a0conscious of situations where local sports clubs can be in competition with commercial operators.

These matters are dealt with in the credit policy, which is agreed by the MFI Board.<br\/><br\/>I have commenced a review of the operation of the Microfinance Loan Act.  The purpose of the review is to enhance the uptake and impact of the fund <br\/><br\/>My officials have been actively engaged in discussions with stakeholders, representative organisations, the various banks, the credit union movement, Microfinance Ireland and the Local Enterprise Office on the review. <br\/><br\/>A range of topics have been raised during these discussions which included, <i>inter alia<\/i>, removal of the requirement of a rejection from the bank, an automatic referral system for rejected bank applications, loan terms, loan limits and improved promotional and marketing opportunities. <br\/><br\/>My officials are currently holding their final meetings as part of the review process, and a report will be finalised as expeditiously as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800060#WRH01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Directives","counter":328,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800060#WRH01850"},{"type":"question","counter":329,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[43870\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800060#WRH01900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a broadcast programme (details supplied) in relation to the difficulties posed by the lack of enforcement of the posted workers directive and legal loopholes in the transposition of the directive across all member states of the European Union; and if his Department has examined the allegations made in relation to the actions of the Irish registered company named in the programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1190","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":330,"content":"<p>The issues raised in the programme in question relate primarily to the manner in which EU rules governing the posting of workers operate in practice.  In this respect the Deputy may be aware that in May of this year the EU&rsquo;s Council of Ministers adopted a new Directive designed to better enforce the EU rules on the posting of workers and so provide more robust safeguards to protect the rights of posted workers and to prevent social dumping.  The Directive also aims to ensure fair competition between service providers and to improve co-operation and co-ordination between the relevant authorities of Member States.  The Directive is due to be transposed by June 2016.  A decision on the manner of transposition of the Directive has not yet been taken.  My Department will engage in a public consultation on the transposition of the Directive early in the new year.<\/p><p>  The Directive will provide significantly enhanced protection for workers being posted to Ireland and for those employees of Irish companies being posted to other Member States to fulfil contracts secured by their company.  When workers are being posted to Ireland, in future, our National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) will have to be informed of the identity of the service provider, the number of workers being posted, the duration of the posting, as well as details of the location and nature of the services to be provided.  There will also be a designated contacted person from the service provider to liaise with NERA and appropriate records will have to be maintained for inspection.  These provisions will greatly enhance the role of NERA in ensuring vulnerable workers are not exploited and Irish employment law is fully respected.  Similar provisions will have to be in place across the E.U. which will significantly enhance enforcement.<\/p><p>  Of equal importance, Irish companies will be protected from unfair competition on the domestic market by ensuring foreign service providers cannot unfairly undercut nationally determined terms of employment.  It also provides for more effective co-operation between national authorities like NERA in the area of enforcement.<\/p><p>  With respect to the Irish company that featured in the programme, I can confirm that NERA has co-operated fully, within the limits of its remit, with the relevant French authorities in respect of requests for assistance in relation to investigations in that jurisdiction.  NERA will continue to offer assistance, within its remit, to the French authorities and to the relevant authorities of other Member States that may seek its assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800060#WRH02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Rehiring","counter":331,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800060#WRH02050"},{"type":"question","counter":332,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[44119\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800060#WRH02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of staff that are drawing down retirement pensions from the public sector or Civil Service and that have been brought back on contract work or temporary contracts to work in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

They pull together all the players &ndash; other Government Departments and Agencies - to support everyone with a good business idea and strengthen the enterprise sector in the local area.  The LEOs are the first port of call in terms of advice, direction, training and, in certain circumstances, grant support for anyone who wishes to start or expand a business.  Contact details for the LEOs are available at .<br\/><br\/>The LEOs themselves provide a range of financial and non-financial supports to help enterprises at start-up or during business expansion phases.  It should be noted that the LEOs generally only grant assist enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector, which over time can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland portfolio.  However, there are other potential supports available and the LEO staff can advise appropriately.  <br\/><br\/>For example, the LEOs can advise clients about the Department of Social Protection Back to Work and the Short-Term Enterprise Allowance (EA) Schemes, and the JobsPlus Scheme.  The EA Schemes are aimed at encouraging people getting certain social welfare payments to become self-employed by allowing them to retain a percentage of their social welfare payment for specified periods.  The JobsPlus Scheme is an incentive aimed at encouraging and rewarding employers who offer employment opportunities to the long term unemployed, with grants up to &euro;10,000 available to qualifying employers to offset wage costs where they engage jobseekers from the Live Register.<br\/><br\/>In addition, any business can use the LEOs as a gateway to accessing finance from Micro Finance Ireland (MFI), which offers support in the form of loans of up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people with viable business propositions that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by the banks.  The Fund available to MFI has a significant entrepreneurship focus and is open to anyone with a viable business proposal.

Ireland is committed to meeting this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy.\u00a0 It is expected that approximately half of the 16% target will be met by energy from biomass.  While the development of the bioenergy sector can lead to both economic and environmental benefits in addition to contributing to reaching our renewable energy targets, there are particular benefits to the rural economy.\u00a0 The SEAI and the Irish BioEnergy Association commissioned report - <i>Economic Benefits from the Development of BioEnergy<\/i><i>in Ireland to meet 2020 Targets<\/i>- found that a very significant proportion of the employment generated in both the construction and operation of the bioenergy facilities and infrastructure will be in rural Ireland. <br\/><br\/>The proposed new Rural Development Plan (RDP) 2014-2020 provides for some &euro;4 billion in European and national funds for investment in our agri-food industry and the rural economy over its lifetime.\u00a0 One of the principal objectives of the draft RDP is to support the more sustainable management of natural resources.  The proposed suite of measures in the new RDP, which is currently being examined by the EU Commission, includes a separate Bioenergy Scheme to support the establishment of willow and miscanthus crops for use in renewable energy production.  Support under this measure is particularly aimed at overcoming barriers related to high set up and development costs associated with growing energy crops which are considered a carbon-neutral fuel. The proposed measure will provide grant aid to facilitate the establishment of energy crops and will be paid in respect of ground preparation, seed purchase and planting costs.  In addition to the Bioenergy Scheme, other potential investments in renewable energies can be considered under the LEADER element of the RDP where local development strategies seek to address the cross-cutting issue of climate change.<br\/><br\/>My officials are at present engaged in intensive bilateral discussions with the Commission with a view to reaching early agreement on a range of informational, technical and policy matters.  Pending formal approval of the draft RDP, my Department will continue to examine the best approach to supporting the bioenergy sector.<br\/><br\/>However, the vast bulk of biomass in this country is, and will continue to be, provided by the forestry sector.  After wind energy, wood fuel is the largest contributor to renewable energy generation in Ireland. In 2013, 33% of the roundwood harvested in the Republic of Ireland, or over one million cubic metres, was used for energy generation.  The Department&rsquo;s draft forestry programme covering the period 2014 &ndash; 2020 recognises the need to increase the supply of biomass in order to meet renewable energy targets. <br\/><br\/>My Department also provides information on wood availability and location through the national roundwood forecast system and supports the Wood Fuel Quality Assurance Scheme run by the Irish Bioenergy Association.<br\/><br\/>Over the last year my Department has worked closely with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in developing the recently published draft Bioenergy Plan. The draft plan (available at ) is to be subject to Strategic Environmental and Appropriate Assessment, including public consultation, which will inform the shape of the finalised plan.\u00a0 <br\/><br\/>The plan sets out the broader context for the development of energy from biomass, and the current status with regard to the range of policy areas that must be coordinated in order to create the conditions necessary to support the sustainable development of this sector.  The plan also identifies the necessary next steps to be taken by various government departments, agencies and State bodies in this regard. <br\/><br\/>In terms of bioenergy's role in meeting Ireland's renewable energy targets, the draft plan recommends the continuation of the most significant biomass policy currently in place which is the REFIT schemes.  Furthermore, the analysis underpinning the plan is that an additional bioenergy-focused measure in the heat sector represents the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals.  Therefore, the Plan also recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources including biomass. The RHI scheme, once designed, will require State Aid approval from the European Commission and further Government approval.

Consequently, Immigration Officers performing immigration control duties at airports in the State do not know where passengers have travelled from when such passengers present at immigration control desks. It is, therefore, necessary for Immigration Officers to establish where passengers have arrived from, and in order to do this, an Immigration Officer may ask passengers questions with a view to establishing their nationality and port of embarkation. Once satisfied that a person is a citizen of the Common Travel Area (CTA) and that such person has travelled from the United Kingdom, the Immigration Officer will make no further requirement of that person. <\/p><p>  In circumstances where a person, who is a national of the jurisdictions that form the Common Travel Area, and who has travelled from within the CTA and is not in possession of a passport, an Immigration Officer, in compliance with their duties under immigration legislation, is duty-bound to ask questions designed to establish that the person is a national of the jurisdictions that form the CTA and has travelled from within the CTA and as such is entitled to benefit from its immigration arrangements.<\/p><p>  For the sake of completeness, I should add that border entry practices in the UK for CTA arrivals vary considerably from place to place. For example, in some UK regional airports, police officers on occasion seek identity documents for passengers from this jurisdiction. In other cases, evidence of having boarded an aircraft in Ireland is sought.<\/p><p>  In recent years, personnel at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) and in the UK immigration authorities have detected abuses within the Common Travel Area. Movements of illegal persons, suspected human trafficking, illegal immigration and substantial levels of social welfare fraud are among the consequences of such abuse. The cooperation of all passengers arriving in the State, including Irish and UK citizens who have travelled from the UK, greatly enhances the ability of Immigration personnel, both here and in the UK, to prevent and detect illegal immigration and associated criminality. <\/p><p>  It should be noted that in fulfilling their duties at the frontiers of the State members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilise a range of legislative provisions. In particular, such officers will, where necessary, enforce the provisions at section 33 of Air Navigation &amp;amp; Transport Act, 1988, which states, an authorised officer, in the interest of the proper operation or the security or safety of an aerodrome, or the security or safety of persons, aircraft or other property thereon, may require any person on an aerodrome to:<\/p><p>  - give his name and address and to produce other evidence of his or her identity;<\/p><p>  - state the purpose of his being on the aerodrome;<\/p><p>  - account for any baggage or other property which may be in his possession.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800063#WRL02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Services Regulation","counter":452,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800063#WRL02300"},{"type":"question","counter":453,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[43755\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800063#WRL02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position in relation to legal requirements by solicitors in respect of terms of wills and probate (details supplied).","asker":"998","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":454,"content":"<p>The legal requirements in relation to the terms of wills and probate are generally subject to the provisions of the Succession Act 1965 and, as the Deputy will appreciate, it would not be appropriate for me, as Minister, to interpret or otherwise provide what would amount to legal advice on particular matters arising in that regard.  Moreover, the circumstances of each case may vary as between someone who has made a will and someone who has died without having done so, and in relation to the legal standing of that person or of a potential beneficiary. I am also aware that other parties concerned in the settling of a deceased's estate such as the banks, financial institutions and the Revenue Commissioners, will have parallel requirements to ensure this is carried out in an orderly fashion in each particular case. <br\/><br\/>It is my understanding, from inquiries made by my Department, that the Probate Office does not determine when a Grant of Representation needs to be extracted in the estate of a deceased person. Where moneys are held in financial institutions it is for that institution to indicate whether or not they require a grant in order to pay the monies over to the legal personal representative of the estate. Some financial institutions will pay out small amounts of money but the monetary amount in question appears to vary from institution to institution.  As far as I can ascertain, therefore, there is no regulatory requirement for a solicitor, when drafting a will, to advise the testator that probate may be required if the amount distributed exceeds a specific threshold.\u00a0 Rather, it would seem that such thresholds tend to arise under the administrative requirements of financial institutions in releasing funds of deceased customers.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the above, should a client have concerns about the conduct of a solicitor in dealing with matters relating to wills or probate, then he or she may wish to make a complaint under the Solicitors Acts 1954-2011. Under the Acts the Law Society is the designated regulatory body for solicitors in the State and complaints should be made within that legislative framework. An aggrieved client wishing to make such a complaint under the Solicitors Acts should contact the Law Society directly. Much of the relevant information, including the Society&rsquo;s contact details, is to be found on the website including guidance on how to make a complaint.  The independent Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal is a further route of redress for anyone who is unhappy with the legal services they received from a solicitor. The Tribunal deals with allegations of serious misconduct and may be accessed directly by members of the public. The website provides guidance in this regard. A request for a review of a decision of the Law Society in relation to a complaint made may also be made at a later stage to the Independent Adjudicator ().<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800063#WRL02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":455,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800063#WRL02600"},{"type":"question","counter":456,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[43764\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800063#WRL02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the position in relation to the closure of a Garda station (details supplied) in County Galway; if its current capacity following the opening of the new Garda divisional headquarters in Murrough, County Galway, will be maintained; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1108","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":457,"content":"<p>The formulation of proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda stations is a matter, in the first instance, for the Garda Commissioner in the context of her annual policing plans, as provided for in section 22 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.<\/p><p>  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the allocation of Garda resources, including accommodation and personnel, is subject to ongoing analysis and review to ensure that the best use is made of available resources.

The report rightly acknowledges the dedication and commitment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and indeed notes that many of the issues raised had been identified in other comparable police forces. <br\/><br\/>The Report will play an important role in the overall justice reform programme underway, including the establishment of an independent Police Authority, strengthening the powers of GSOC, and the open competition for the recruitment of the Garda Commissioner. <br\/><br\/>Implementation of this programme is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform, chaired by An Taoiseach, and this Committee will also now take on a role in overseeing delivery of the reforms recommended by the Inspectorate. <br\/><br\/>There will also of course be a central role for the new Police Authority and Garda Commissioner in implementing the identified reform.  Ahead of the establishment of the Policing Authority, I intend to hold discussions with Josephine Feehily, the Chairman-designate, on the establishment of an effective implementation framework to oversee delivery of reforms in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, along the lines recommended by the Inspectorate.<br\/><br\/>The incoming Garda Commissioner, who is due to be appointed shortly following an open competition, will also be central in driving implementation of many of the reforms arising from the Inspectorate&rsquo;s analysis.  In advance of this appointment, I have already welcomed the decision of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to establish an Implementation Steering Group to immediately focus on the implementation of the short<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">, <\/font>medium and long-term recommendations in the Report, and a programme of Risk compliance and Continuous Improvement Teams which will be introduced in each region to support a revised focus on professional standards and to tackle any weaknesses identified in the Inspectorate's report.  I have also asked the Acting Commissioner for an overall response to the Report and its recommendations.<br\/><br\/>In addition, upon publication of the Report I set out a further comprehensive series of measures being taken to address the issues identified by the Inspectorate including:<br\/><br\/>- plans for the necessary and early investment in upgrading Garda technology to bring outdated paper based practices into the 21st century;<br\/><br\/>- new Garda measures to improve consistency and accuracy of data;<br\/><br\/>- a review of the report by the CSO to see whether and to what extent it may have implications for the crime statistics which that Office produces;<br\/><br\/>- an expert group to be chaired by the CSO to examine its recommendations, including in relation to crime counting and detection rules, with a view to introducing new national standards;<br\/><br\/>- measures to improve supports for victims, including victims of domestic and sexual violence. <br\/><br\/>It is clear from the Report that developments in systems and processes in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have not kept pace with developments in broader society and police forces globally.  The Report's analysis has been welcomed by Government and we are determined to act on it.  I can assure the Deputy that we will work to equip An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to meet all of the challenges of 21st century policing, and to put the needs of victims first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800063#WRL04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Policing Authority Establishment","counter":472,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800063#WRL04300"},{"type":"question","counter":473,"qnumday":260,"qnumall":"[41138\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800063#WRL04400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her views on putting an independent mechanism in place to deal with the selection of the proposed new policing authority board; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"956","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":474,"content":"<p>The establishment of the Independent Policing Authority is a major element of the comprehensive programme of justice reform which is being delivered by the Government.

The Bill is, therefore, a key component of the Government's strategy to bring greater transparency to legal costs and to reduce their burden on consumers and enterprise. <br\/><br\/>The Bill makes extensive provision, in Part 10, for a new and enhanced legal costs regime that will bring greater transparency to how legal costs are charged by legal practitioners, along with a better balance between the interests of legal practitioners and those of their clients. Legal practitioners, whether solicitors or barristers, will be obliged to provide more detailed information about legal costs from the outset of their dealings with clients. This will be in the form of a Notice written in clear language which must be provided when a legal practitioner takes instructions. Among other things, the Notice must, as set out in section 117 of the Bill, disclose the costs that are involved, or, where this is not reasonably practicable, the basis upon which such costs are to be calculated. A cooling-off period is to be allowed for the consideration of costs by the client. When there are any significant developments in a case which give rise to further costs, the Bill provides that a client must be duly updated and given the option of whether or not to proceed with the case in question. In addition, the Bill sets out that it will not be permissible for legal practitioners to set fees as a specified percentage or proportion of damages payable to a client from contentious business and that it will no longer be permissible for barristers to charge junior counsel fees as a specified percentage or proportion of Senior Counsel fees.<br\/><br\/>An aggrieved client also has the option of applying for the taxation of disputed legal costs by the Office of the Taxing-Master.  Under the Legal Services Regulation Bill the current functions of the Taxing-Master will be taken over by the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator. The Bill sets out, for the first time in legislation, a series of Legal Costs Principles. These are contained in Schedule One and enumerate the various matters that may be taken into account in the adjudication of disputed legal costs. The Bill also provides for the establishment of a public Register of Determinations which will disclose the outcomes and reasons for decisions made by the Legal Costs Adjudicator.<br\/><br\/>In addition, the Bill seeks to achieve greater flexibility in the legal-services market, more competition and improved access to justice and will pave the way for the introduction of new business structures for legal practitioners which will enable cooperation across a range of legal and other professions so that knowledge and expertise can be joined to meet the needs of consumers in a more modern and cost-effective way. <br\/><br\/>The various new legal cost transparency measures that I have set out will apply to barristers as well as to solicitors and will enable those availing of legal services to identify costs and their basis more clearly, including by way of comparison with other possible legal service providers and in relation to any potential award. I would expect that, along with those other cost reduction measures that have been introduced by the Government in the procurement of legal services by State Bodies, the new legal costs regime and new legal business models will help reduce such costs and their burden on clients.<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b>These changes, along with other measures being introduced in the Legal Services Regulation Bill, will better balance the interests of consumers and those of legal practitioners thereby supporting greater competition and choice in the provision of legal services in the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800064#WRM00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Recidivism Rate","counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800064#WRM00650"},{"type":"question","counter":485,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[41134\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800064#WRM00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the policies she will put in place to tackle the recidivism rates amongst those who have previously been in custody.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":486,"content":"<p>I published the Report of the Penal Policy Review Group on 17 September.

In my view, prison is not the only solution when it comes to those convicted of lesser non violent offences.  Re-offending can also be tackled head on by imposing a supervised community sanction, with appropriate supports, which could see punishment being served, but which would also lead, not only to rehabilitation, but to a reduced risk of re-offending. <\/p><p>  In that context, I intend to proceed with the Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill which will strengthen the legislative framework for supervised community sanctions.

This is a scheme where carefully selected prisoners can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work.  The scheme represents a move away from releasing prisoners in an unstructured way. <\/p><p>  Recidivism studies by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), which are available on my Department's website www.justice.ie, have shown that offenders who received either a Probation Order or a Community Service Order in 2007 and 2008 had a re-offending rate nearly 50% lower than those who had received a custodial sentence (41% vs 62%).  This shows that supervised community sanctions can help to reduce re-offending, thereby reducing crime.  <\/p><p>  As I have stated previously, the publication of these studies will allow the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service access to a comprehensive bank of data in relation to the rate of recidivism among ex-prisoners and offenders.  Along with the implementation of the recommendations of the Penal Policy Review Group, this will help to inform future policy on the management of offenders and will facilitate the formulation of new strategies aimed at reducing recidivism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800064#WRM00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bail Law","counter":487,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800064#WRM00850"},{"type":"question","counter":488,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[41135\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800064#WRM00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she is satisfied with the current operation of bail.","asker":"1057","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":489,"content":"<p>A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights also restrict the extent to which the right to bail can be limited.<br\/><br\/>Prior to the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, bail could be refused essentially only on the grounds that a person would be likely to abscond or interfere with witnesses. Section 2 of the Bail Act 1997, which gave effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution, provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  Section 2(2)(d) provides that in exercising its jurisdiction under that section, a court shall take into account and may receive evidence or submissions concerning any conviction of the accused person for an offence committed while he or she was on bail.<br\/><br\/>In addition, section 6 of that Act, as amended by section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007, provides that every bail recognisance is subject to the condition that the accused person shall not commit an offence while on bail.  <br\/><br\/>The criminal law takes a serious view of offences committed by persons on bail.  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence, or on the sentence last due to expire, if more than one is being served. It also provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.<br\/><br\/>I am conscious of public concern about the extent to which offences continue to be committed by persons on bail. In this regard, I can inform the Deputy that the preparation of the General Scheme of a Bail Bill to modernise the law on bail is at a very advanced stage and I intend to bring proposals to Government on the matter in the coming weeks.<br\/><br\/>While the primary aim of the proposed Bail Bill is to consolidate and update bail law, I wish to take the opportunity to seek, as far as is possible, within the constraints of the Constitution and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, to focus the legislation on the protection of the individual and of the public.

It is the case that all incidents of this nature are subject to full and determined investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy will also be aware from my previous correspondence with him in relation to his proposals for a Ramming of Garda Vehicles Bill, which has been the subject of further consideration, is that there is already a range of robust road safety and other legislative enforcement provisions available to the Garda authorities in such circumstances. <br\/><br\/>Such legislative provisions include the wide range of assault offences contained in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and for which penalties range from up to 5 years imprisonment to life imprisonment depending on the seriousness of the offence involved.  In addition, section 19 Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 provides for specific offences relating to assaults on &quot;peace officers&quot; which includes members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The penalty for this offence was increased from 5 to 7 years imprisonment by section 185 Criminal Justice Act 2006 which also provided for the criminalisation of threats to assault.  I would also add that section 2 Criminal Damage Act 1991 provides for the offence of damage to the property of another person for which the penalty is a maximum of 10 years imprisonment.  The Road Traffic Act 1961 (as amended) provides for offences of driving without reasonable consideration, careless driving and dangerous driving, and an offence of dangerous driving which causes death or serious bodily harm carrying a penalty of up to 10 years imprisonment.  In addition, as the Deputy will appreciate if the ramming of a Garda vehicle resulted in a death,  an offence of attempted murder, murder or manslaughter may be considered applicable  with the resultant penalties including mandatory life imprisonment for a conviction for murder. <br\/><br\/>In so far as the Deputy's proposals concerning presumptive mandatory sentencing are concerned, I would draw his attention to the Law Reform Commission 2013 Report on Mandatory Sentences, which recommends the repeal of the existing presumptive mandatory minimum sentence provisions for various drugs and firearms offences.  I would also note that the Report on the Strategic Review of Penal Policy which was published in September recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences should be introduced.  <br\/><br\/>I have requested an updated Garda report in relation to the number of Garda&iacute; injured arising from such incidents and will contact the Deputy directly as soon as that information is available.  <b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800065#WRN00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":530,"content":"<p>Question No. 279 answered with Question No. 268.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Investigations","counter":531,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800065#WRN00950"},{"type":"question","counter":532,"qnumday":280,"qnumall":"[43918\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800065#WRN01000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if garda&iacute; investigating suspected petrol stretching use significant price variances among fuel sellers in a particular geographical area as a criterion for their investigations.

Having considered the file the DPP advised that the file did not warrant prosecution of any individual.  Thereafter GSOC considered and decided against launching any investigation of matters which may constitute indiscipline.<br\/><br\/>The Report by GSOC also contained a series of recommendations related to informant handling procedures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, oversight of those procedures, as well as intelligence handling and information exchange between GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <br\/><br\/>At the time my predecessor sought the observations of the Garda Commissioner on the Report and its recommendations.  In response, the Garda Commissioner pointed out that following the putting in place of a code of practice for the management of Covert Human Intelligence Sources many of the recommendations made by GSOC were already incorporated into Garda procedures.  The Commissioner also emphasised that informants are clearly instructed that they may not commit crimes or act as <i>agents provocateur. <\/i><br\/><br\/>I should emphasise that there has been, since 2010, an independent, external oversight mechanism in place to ensure compliance with the code of practice.  The current holder of this appointment is Mr. Justice Thomas Smyth, former judge of the High Court.  Mr Justice Smyth's report for 2012 has been published and I am currently making arrangements to publish his reports for 2013 and 2014.  I am pleased to note that the Judge has indicated that he received full co-operation from relevant members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in compiling his report and he records substantial compliance with the code of practice by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br\/><br\/>I should mention that the recent Inspectorate report makes a number of recommendations in relation to the handling of information and these will be addressed.<br\/><br\/>A Memorandum of Understanding, Protocols and Agreement on Operational Matters, agreed by the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC), has been in place between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC since the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission in 2007.  However, a new Memorandum of Understanding, Protocols and Agreement on Operational Matters has been agreed between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC and was signed by the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission on 23rd September, 2013.  The Memorandum of Understanding agrees protocols for operational matters between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC, including the provision of information to GSOC by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br\/><br\/>There is continued ongoing co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC to address any issues that arise during the course of an investigation.  A working relationship is maintained between the two organisations with regular formal and informal meetings between senior management representatives.  In addition, the Garda Commissioner has established a dedicated office (GSOC Liaison Office) to process and monitor all such requests and ensure that all correspondence with GSOC is attended to in a timely manner. <br\/><br\/>In the context of Garda oversight generally, the Deputy will be aware that I recently introduced the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2014.  The main purpose of the Bill  is to amend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to expand the remit and powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC).  The Bill will bring the Garda Commissioner within the remit of GSOC for the first time.  It will also ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides information sought by GSOC for an investigation as soon as practicable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800066#WRO01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":574,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800066#WRO01750"},{"type":"question","counter":575,"qnumday":295,"qnumall":"[44106\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800066#WRO01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the children and family relationships Bill; when it is expected to come before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

As regards the existing ground rents, Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978 contains a statutory scheme whereby a person may, at reasonable cost, acquire the fee simple in their dwelling.  Comprehensive details of the manner in which the fee simple can be acquired under this scheme are available on the Property Registration Authority's website (www.prai.ie).  In the case of property other than dwellings, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967 contains provisions which facilitate acquisition of the fee simple in certain cases subject to agreed terms or on terms set out in an arbitration carried out by the County Registrar.<\/p><p>  As regards the number of dwellings and other properties on which ground rents remain payable, the position is that no such data are available.  The title deeds of individual properties normally contain all the relevant covenants, including details of any arrangements for the payment of ground rent and the amounts involved.  To date, over 80,000 applicants have acquired the freehold title to their properties under the statutory scheme operate by the Property Registration Authority.<\/p><p>  The position regarding ground rents was considered by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in their 2004 Report 'Private Property'.  The Committee took the view that a ground rent is a form of property right which is constitutionally protected and that abolition of such rents would be unconstitutional in the absence of adequate monetary compensation.  The Committee also noted that where leases were approaching expiry, any legislation providing for the abolition of ground rents would have to provide for the payment of enhanced compensation.

However, different people in various circumstances may require different approaches to treatment and support.  <\/p><p>  Methadone maintenance treatment is a critical stabilising treatment that enables the people involved to counter their problem drug use and to rebuild their lives.  In conjunction with other services and supports such as counselling, after-care and training, methadone maintenance treatment provides a pathway to recovery for the individual affected by problem substance use.  The National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee, which is chaired by the HSE, oversees the national implementation of an integrated inter-agency model of care in order to ensure that a person can access the range of services required to support their own recovery. <\/p><p>  An Expert Group was set up by my Department in 2006 to examine the regulatory framework which would be required to facilitate the prescribing, dispensing and supply of buprenorphine\/naloxone and buprenorphine-only products as alternatives to methadone. The Group recommended that a feasibility study should be conducted in Ireland on the use of these products to assess:<\/p><p>  -  if a regulatory regime, similar to that which applies under the Methadone Treatment Protocol would be necessary for these products, and<\/p><p>  -  which cohorts of patients would be suitable for treatment with these products. <\/p><p>  The Feasibility Study commenced in June 2009 in a number of drug treatment clinics and community settings.  An external consultant engaged to conduct an evaluation of the Study reported its findings to the Expert Group in 2011.  The Expert Group recommended that regulations and guidelines similar to those which apply to the prescribing and dispensing of methadone, should also apply to the prescribing and dispensing of products containing buprenorphine\/naloxone or buprenorphine-only for the treatment of opioid dependence. The Expert Group concluded that methadone is the drug of first choice in the treatment of opioid dependency, but that buprenorphine\/naloxone may be more appropriate for particular cohorts of patients.   <\/p><p>  The HSE has established an Opioid Substitution Implementation Group to develop a plan for facilitating the wider availability of buprenorphine\/naloxone and buprenorphine-only products as alternatives to methadone.  The Group comprises representations from the HSE and my Department, including medical professionals with specific interest in addiction.  I understand that the HSE is currently in discussions with the supplier company in relation to the pricing structure relating to the product. The outcome of these discussions will inform the recommendations of the Group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800072#WRU02200","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":812,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800072#WRU02300"},{"type":"question","counter":813,"qnumday":381,"qnumall":"[43940\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800072#WRU02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding a medical card application in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"950","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":814,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

A Working Group was established and chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith of DCU, to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structures last year. Under its terms of reference the Group made recommendations earlier this year aimed at improving the retention of medical graduates in the public health system and planning for future service needs.  In April 2014 the Group submitted a report dealing with medical career structures and pathways following completion of specialist training.

It is key to maximising patient outcomes.  Continuous professional development is a vital component in building and maintaining professional competence and fitness to practice.<\/p><p>  With regard to doctors, Part 11 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 provides for professional competence schemes as the formal structures to ensure that all doctors registered and working in Ireland maintain their education, knowledge and skills at an acceptable level.  As of May 2011, doctors are legally obliged to maintain their professional competence by enrolling in approved professional competence schemes and following requirements set by the Medical Council.  In this context, the Council has established a range of professional competence schemes through formal arrangements with the recognised postgraduate training bodies.  Schemes are operated by the postgraduate training bodies and have been developed to drive good professional practice, which is centred on patient safety and quality of patient care. <\/p><p>  While the pursuit of training by medical practitioners registered in the Trainee Specialist Division is sufficient to satisfy a doctor's requirements concerning an applicable professional competence scheme, the HSE provides the following professional competence supports for other doctors:<\/p><p>  - Continuing Medical Education (CME) funding for Consultants of &euro;3,000 per annum per claimant.  A revised CME structure ensures that Consultants are facilitated to remain up-to-date with new systems and processes relevant to their work, and all claimants must be registered on a professional competence scheme with the relevant postgraduate training body in Ireland;<\/p><p>  - annual funding  to recognised training bodies to deliver Professional Development Programmes for NCHDs in non-training posts.  Doctors register with the relevant postgraduate training body in order to access courses and on-line learning appropriate to their needs.  These learning opportunities can be used to earn credits for Medical Council professional competence scheme requirements;<\/p><p>  - funding, through the Irish College of General Practitioners, of a national Director and 37 tutors who deliver a CME programme for GPs.  The programme is delivered in small groups throughout the country and is free to participants.  Participation in the programme can be used by GPs to earn credits for Medical Council professional competence scheme requirements. <\/p><p>  With regard to nurses, the Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 provides for the professional competence of nurses and midwives.  Nurses' and midwives' continued professional development takes the form of formally accredited education programmes and shorter programmes approved by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (NMBI), comprising both theoretical knowledge and clinical skills.  These programmes are delivered by the HSE Centres of Nursing and Midwifery Education, practice development departments within services and Higher Education Institutes.  The programmes supported must be relevant to patient need, the role of the nurse and the organisation&rsquo;s service requirements.  In addition, a number of programmes have been commissioned and are delivered nationally in response to clinical programme requirements and service developments.  The NMBI approves and accredits continuing education courses (Post-registration Category 1) from a few hours to 36 hours contact time.  Currently there are 1781 NMBI-approved Category 1 courses offered across a range of facilities in all areas of practice and geographical locations.  There are also 44 NMBI-approved specialist education programmes offered at postgraduate level across the higher education sector.<\/p><p>  The HSE has a number of strategies in place to support the continued education of nurses and midwives in the Irish health system via the Office of the Nursing and Midwifery Services Director.  These include:<\/p><p>  - funding for clinical Higher Diplomas along with part funding for Masters programmes, in addition to support for leadership and management development by the Nursing and Midwifery Practice Development Units and the Leadership and Innovation Centre;<\/p><p>  - further educational opportunities to support continuous professional development at local level provided by the Centres for Nursing and Midwifery Education;<\/p><p>  - the Nurse and Midwife Graduate Programme which offers a two-year programme of further education and development to newly qualified nurses and midwives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800075#WRX01700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":938,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800075#WRX01750"},{"type":"question","counter":939,"qnumday":423,"qnumall":"[44211\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800075#WRX01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is satisfied that all hospitals' waiting lists are accurate; his views on all waiting lists setting out expected waiting time; the progress that has been made in recent years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":940,"content":"<p>The policy of the HSE is clear.  All hospital managers are expected to efficiently manage waiting lists in chronological order, except where clinical need dictates that a patient needs to be prioritised.  Performance against waiting list targets is monitored by the HSE on a monthly basis, with the assistance of the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the Special Delivery Unit.  Figures are published retrospectively to ensure their veracity and accuracy. <\/p><p>  With regard to waiting list targets, these were set in respect of access to both scheduled and unscheduled care following on from the establishment of the SDU in 2012. With regard to unscheduled care, figures for 14 November show that compared to the baseline year of 2011, there are 32.0% fewer patients on trolleys, equivalent to 25,182 patients.  The waiting lists for scheduled care were reduced from 9 months to 8 months in 2013, as analysis of waiting list data indicated that this target is challenging but achievable.  In March 2013, following publication of the first validated outpatient waiting list numbers, a target of 12 months for a first consultant-led outpatient appointment was established.  Progress in streamlining referral processing and targeting capacity gains for increased new appointments has led to an  increase of 3% (64,289) in out-patient attendances between January - August 2014 in comparison to 2013.  Total out-patient attendances year to date were 2,140,031.<\/p><p>  Despite seeing more patients, demand for services continues to exceed available supply.  The trends indicate that waiting lists are likely to increase further, with capacity to provide services for these patients curtailed by increased emergency admissions and delayed discharges.  The HSE continues to seek improvements in the provision of elective surgery, medical and outpatient services through reform, facilitation of local level initiatives, strict adherence to the National Waiting List Protocol and relevant clinical programme guidelines and networking of services between hospitals in the new hospital Groups, in addition to reducing the number of patients who do not turn up for their appointment, and increasing the number of new patients in outpatient clinics rather than just reviewing previous patients who are often better returned to their GP.<\/p><p>  The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges and thereby improve timeliness for admissions from Emergency Departments and waiting lists.  The plans to address in-patient and day-case waiting lists are being considered in the 2015 Service Planning process which is currently underway and progress in this area will be a priority for hospital groups throughout next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800075#WRX01900","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Operations","counter":941,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800075#WRX01950"},{"type":"question","counter":942,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[44215\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800075#WRX02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will request the Health Service Executive to pay an overdue account in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny; the reason this person has not received any further business from the HSE since this issue arose; his views that the HSE are penalising this person for their action in trying to sort out the account; if he will confirm the amount paid by the HSE, by county, for the purpose of bed and breakfast or hotels for consultants and doctors; if he will confirm the number of consultants from outside the country that have been transported here to fill vacancies on a temporary basis and the costs involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":943,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on this matter.

An essential element of the eligibility arrangements is that the public or private status of a patient must be specified on admission to hospital.  <\/p><p>  Section 55 of the Health Act 1970 (as amended) also provides for the charging of private in-patients.  Where a patient elects to be treated privately by a consultant the hospital must treat that patient as a private patient.  Persons who opt to be private on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care.  The hospital charge applicable depend on the hospital treating the patient and on whether a person is accommodated in a single or multiple occupancy room or on a day case basis.  The application of a charge by a hospital for in-patient services is obligatory under the legislation, irrespective of whether the patient occupies a public designated bed or private designated bed, as it relates to the private service provided.<\/p><p>  The private in-patient charge goes towards meeting part of the cost of providing the hospital's services to private patients, for example, the cost of non-consultant doctors, nursing, diagnostic services (such as x-rays and other scans), laboratory services (such as blood tests etc.), medicines and capital costs. <\/p><p>  In the case of a chemotherapy or dialysis patient, best practice is to treat him\/her in a seated or reclining position, on a therapy chair or a recliner, rather than on a bed.

Ireland's concerns on issues of tolerance of civil society and freedom of expression have been raised with the Iranian authorities, as part of our ongoing dialogue with them on the need for greater respect for human rights within Iran, and we will continue to do so, including making reference as appropriate to the infringements of basic human rights highlighted in this case.<\/p><p>  In the 2010 Universal Periodic Review of the human rights situation in Iran at the United Nations in Geneva, Ireland raised concerns over human rights violations, including with regard to freedom of expression, association and assembly.  We noted reported attacks against and the detention of human rights defenders and deplored attempts to restrict peaceful demonstrations and actions.  We further voiced our concerns about serious deficiencies in the area of gender equality.  Further concerns in relation to treatment of religious minorities and the continued excessive use of capital punishment in Iran were raised by Ireland in the second Universal Periodic Review of Iran which took place in October 2014.<\/p><p>  Human rights defenders and those promoting important issues such as gender equality should not be detained for simply exercising their rights, and all those arbitrarily detained in such circumstances should be immediately released.  This concern has been consistently conveyed to the Iranian authorities, and we will continue to do so.

The decision as to whether to accept sponsorship or partake in promotions is one for the Board of Management to take and naturally, the Board of Management should only engage in activities that are in the best interests of their students.<\/p><p>  Private companies are also free to promote their business in accordance with accepted marketing practices. There are  accepted marketing standards, such as compliance with advertising regulations which guide, inform and control the relationship between the vendor and the potential customers. Decisions in relation to participation in promotions are taken at individual school level and there is no requirement that schools report to my Department on this issue.  The data requested by the Deputy in relation to the numbers of companies involved is therefore not available within my Department.<\/p><p>  In making such decisions, it is  important that schools strike a balance between the potential  benefit to be gained from positive links with businesses while at the same time protecting children and their parents from inappropriate marketing etc.  In this context, my Department's circulars - while entrusting school authorities with deciding which activities to engage in - explicitly require them to ensure that pressure is not placed on parents to buy particular products.<\/p><p>  My Department recognises the sensitivities attached to the issue of promotion initiatives linking schools, pupils and parents to commercial activity. However, it would be inappropriate to prohibit marketing or sponsorship initiatives, provided that such schemes do not place undue pressure on parents in terms of additional expenditure, that children are protected from engagement in inappropriate promotional activity and that the schemes are linked to desirable projects of educational value.<\/p><p>  I have previously stated my position that schools need to be accountable generally to parents and we need greater levels of communication, engagement and transparency  in how schools serve their communities.  In that context, I am planning on introducing legislative amendments to underpin a Parents' and Students' Charter. The legislative amendments will set out the key principles that should apply in the relationship between a school and its parents and students. They will  also create a power for the Minister to publish statutory guidelines that will be based on these principles and which  will set out detailed actions and standards that will apply in all schools.<\/p><p>  The legislation will require consultation with the education partners on the detailed content of the Charter.  Issues such as that raised by the Deputy can be considered as part of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800078#WRAA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Administration","counter":1061,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800078#WRAA01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1062,"qnumday":467,"qnumall":"[44031\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800078#WRAA01700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps she will take to ensure that workers who are employed by construction companies who are engaged in school building projects (details supplied) are remunerated according to the sectoral norm and are not subject to exploitation; her plans with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to ensure that exploitative practices engaged in by certain construction companies are outlawed and that no further capital projects will be awarded to such companies; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1063","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":1063,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware my Department appointed Contractors Administration Services (CAS), to conduct random audits on school building projects.

The Bill is listed among the Bills expected to be published during the Autumn Session, as part of the Government&rsquo;s Legislation Programme. Drafting of the Bill is currently being finalised within the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. I intend to seek Government approval to publish the Bill in the coming weeks, with the objective of introducing it and progressing its passage through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible thereafter. <\/p><p>  The General Scheme of the Bill was developed, following extensive public consultation processes both by my Department and by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht. In the latter regard, the Joint Committee&rsquo;s Report on the outline Heads of the Bill was given full consideration, and a number of changes were made to reflect its findings, including reducing the interval between proposed National Low-Carbon Roadmaps from 7 to 5 years and enabling the National Expert Advisory Body on Climate Change to publish directly its annual and periodic review reports. <\/p><p>  With specific regard to a mitigation target for the year 2050, the General Scheme of the Bill explicitly commits the State to compliance with EU and international obligations in respect of climate change. Ireland already has greenhouse gas mitigation targets up to the year 2020, and discussions are ongoing with respect to targets up to the year 2030. This target-setting process will undoubtedly continue in relation to the periods up to the years 2040 and 2050. Given that Ireland will likely be subject to binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets up to the year 2050 as part of the EU process in any event and that a long-term vision of low-carbon transition is already set out in the National Climate Policy Position, published in April 2014, I do not consider it either appropriate or necessary to include a national 2050 target in legislation. <\/p><p>  The General Scheme of the Bill provides for the establishment of a National Expert Advisory Body on Climate Change to provide independent advice to Ministers and the Government on the development of National Low-Carbon Roadmaps and National Climate Change Adaptation Frameworks and to publish annual and periodic review reports. The Expert Advisory Body is to comprise a chairperson and between 8 and 10 ordinary members, four of whom shall be ex officio members comprising the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Teagasc and the Economic and Social Research Institute. In terms of appointing a chairperson and the remaining ordinary members, it is important to note that the Government will consider the range of qualifications, expertise and experience necessary for effective performance of the advisory body.  The inclusion of the ex officio members will help underpin this much-needed expertise and experience on these matters, as well as providing a link with relevant agencies working in the field so as to ensure effective implementation. Within this context, it should also be noted that is intended to put in place appropriate arrangements so that the Expert Advisory Body can operate effectively in performing its functions appropriately. Accordingly, I am not minded to alter this arrangement. <\/p><p>  Finally, with respect to climate justice, one of the most effective ways of lessening the effects of climate change in developing countries is for developed countries such as Ireland to engage in developing further their national mitigation measures in respect of greenhouse gas emissions, and the General Scheme of the Bill provides for just such action. Furthermore, it would be important to note in this context that despite difficult economic circumstances, Ireland has maintained significant support, including public finance, for climate action on adaptation in developing countries. While the vast majority of Ireland&rsquo;s annual climate finance returns come from Irish Aid, Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme which falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, it should also be noted that my own Department also made a contribution of &euro;33 million over two years during the Fast-Start Finance period (2010-2012) supporting the Global Climate Change Alliance and the Least Developed Countries Fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800080#WRCC01172","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tenant Purchase Scheme Administration","counter":1139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800080#WRCC01236"},{"type":"question","counter":1140,"qnumday":492,"qnumall":"[44458\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800080#WRCC01300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when the funding to local authorities will be made to their new round of house purchase schemes (details supplied).","asker":"1193","askee":"1088"},{"type":"question","counter":1141,"qnumday":513,"qnumall":"[44179\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800080#WRCC01400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans within the Department to set up a new tenant purchase scheme in the near future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1142,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 492 and 513 together.<br\/><br\/>Part 3 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 provides for a new scheme for the tenant purchase of existing local authority houses.

Article 345 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU clearly establishes a &quot;principle of neutrality&quot; in relation to the rules governing the system of property ownership in the Member States. The European Union cannot, therefore, adopt legal acts affecting the rules governing the system of property ownership, including those affecting the ownership of undertakings providing a public service, such as the provision of water. In a Communication earlier this year, the European Commission confirmed that it will continue to ensure full respect of Treaty rules requiring the European Union to remain neutral in relation to national decisions governing the ownership regime for water undertakings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800081#WRDD00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Data","counter":1169,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800081#WRDD00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1170,"qnumday":501,"qnumall":"[43895\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800081#WRDD00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of housing starts in each month since January 2013; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1171,"content":"<p>My Department collates and publishes a wide range of housing <b>statistics<\/b>that inform the preparation and evaluation of policy.

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. The Act defines the customer as the occupier of the premises in respect of which the water services are provided.<br\/><br\/>The approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. On 30 September 2014, the CER issued a determination on the plan and full details and associated documentation are available on the CER website at the following link:<br\/><br\/>.<br\/><br\/>A range of flexible payment options will be available to Irish Water&rsquo;s customers. Furthermore, Irish Water has acknowledged in its water charges plan that in some circumstances it may be appropriate to extend payment terms for some customers.<br\/><br\/>Consideration is currently being given to elements of the water changing regime, including measures to ensure water charges are modest and affordable and to bring the necessary certainty and clarity to the charging arrangements.<br\/><br\/>With the installation of domestic water meters, it becomes possible to identify domestic properties with leaks. If Irish Water suspects that there is a leak at a domestic property it will inform the property owner\/occupier accordingly. The occupier will also be able to check this as it will usually manifest itself as a high meter read or a continuous flow of water through the meter. If the leak is on the public side of the infrastructure it is the responsibility of Irish Water to locate and fix the leak. If the leak is on the private side of the supply pipe it is the responsibility of the customer to locate and fix the leak, as set out in the Water Services Act 2007; however, the Government has agreed to provide additional funding to Irish Water for their capital investment to include a free first fix scheme. Irish Water has made a proposal to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) regarding a &lsquo;first fix&rsquo; policy and it is understood that the CER intend to hold a public consultation in advance of a decision and implementation of the scheme in Quarter 1 2015.  The CER has decided that where a customer leak has been identified under the &lsquo;first fix&rsquo; policy, the customer&rsquo;s charges will be capped at the assessed level until the leak is fixed by Irish Water.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800081#WRDD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Rehiring","counter":1187,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800081#WRDD01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1188,"qnumday":508,"qnumall":"[44115\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800081#WRDD02000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of staff that are drawing down retirement pensions from the public sector or Civil Service and that have been brought back on contract work or temporary contracts to work in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1189,"content":"<p>Retired public and civil servants are engaged from time to time by my Department in areas where specific expertise is required for a short fixed period and these people provide a level of knowledge, experience and background compatible with such temporary and periodic requirements.<br\/><br\/>The abatement principle, which ensures that the fee or salary paid plus pension does not exceed the rate of pay the pensioner would receive if he\/she had continued service in their former post, applies to payments where appropriate.<br\/><br\/>The information requested in respect of persons on public service pensions who have been engaged to work in my Department in 2014 to date is set out in the table below. <table><tr><th>Role <\/th><th><div>No <\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Internal Audit Committee Member <\/td><td><div>2 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Chair Management Board Meetings of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management <\/td><td><div>1 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Service Indicators Independent Assessment Panel <\/td><td><div>1 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Parliamentary Drafting Expertise for Department's Legislative Programme (temporary contract) <\/td><td><div>1 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Independent Review of Draft Directions under section 31 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 in relation to Westmeath <\/td><td><div>1 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>National Oversight and Audit Commission <\/td><td><div>2 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Department Internal Interview Board <\/td><td><div>1 <\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>My Department occasionally avails of the services of a number of retired public and civil servants for limited adjudication purposes.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the above, a number of retired public and civil servants carry out work for my Department from time to time on a pro bono basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800081#WRDD02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1190,"content":"<p>Question No. 509 answered with Question No. 490.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Staff","counter":1191,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800081#WRDD02250"},{"type":"question","counter":1192,"qnumday":510,"qnumall":"[44167\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800081#WRDD02300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if the performance-related targets for Irish Water staff relate to collection of revenue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1193,"content":"<p>Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels. Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. They may be contacted via email at or by telephone on 1890 578 578.<br\/><br\/>The employment terms and conditions for Irish Water staff are a matter for the company and I understand that the particular pay model is something which was inherited from the parent company Ervia and therefore was not directly put in place by Irish Water. Like other commercial semi-state bodies, pay models are negotiated between management and unions and are then subject to a ballot as necessary. This occurred in Ervia&rsquo;s case and the pay model was implemented in 2011.<br\/><br\/>Ervia has in place a competitive market based pay model, which offers market based pay ranges for all employees. Under the pay model salaries, below that of the Managing Director, are calculated by reference to the relevant median market rate. An amount is then deducted which is referred to as a Performance Related Award (PRA) which is an element of pay at risk. The remaining amount is the base salary. <br\/><br\/>As such, Irish Water does not pay increments or any form of automatic pay award; the PRA element of pay is only earned subject to performance. Every individual in Irish Water has a clear set of objectives set for the year and performance pay awards would be based on a structured performance review that requires company performance, business unit performance and individual performance metrics to have been met.<br\/><br\/>Irish Water has indicated to my Department that revenue outturn would have most immediate consequence for staff whose performance objectives are directly related to revenue collection, therefore impacting their individual performance review.  Irish Water revenue collection performance would also be a factor in determining annual business performance in Irish Water and within the Ervia Group, thereby affecting the metrics associated with company and business unit performance which would impact on an individual&rsquo;s performance review.<br\/><br\/>I have been advised by the Chairman of Ervia that the Board has decided that the PRA element of the Irish Water Pay Model should not apply for 2013 and 2014. In addition, the Board has decided that the Pay Model should be subject to an independent review and this is already underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800081#WRDD02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Funding","counter":1194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800081#WRDD02450"},{"type":"question","counter":1195,"qnumday":511,"qnumall":"[44175\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800081#WRDD02500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the provisional local property tax allocation to each local authority for 2015; if he will further provide in tabular form the allocations of general purpose grants from the local Government fund to each local authority, including town and borough councils, for 2014; the net increase\/decrease in funding allocated to each local authority for 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1192","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1196,"content":"<p>Local Property Tax (LPT) was introduced to provide an alternative, stable and sustainable funding base for the local authority sector, providing greater levels of connection between local revenue raising and associated expenditure decisions. Given that local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and income sources, the Government has decided that no local authority will receive less allocation from LPT in 2015 than they received from the Local Government Fund in 2014 , prior to any decision taken locally to reduce LPT rates.  80% of LPT will be retained locally to fund vital public services in 2015. The remaining 20% will be re-distributed to provide top-up funding to certain local authority areas that have lower property tax bases due to the variance in property values across the State.<br\/><br\/>Certain local authorities, with stronger property bases, will receive additional income in 2015 from LPT compared to their 2014 General Purpose Grant. The Government has decided that these local authorities will use this surplus funding in two ways, with a portion available for their own discretionary purposes and the remainder, if any, to fund some services in the Housing and Roads areas for which they currently receive Central Government funding. The portion that will be retained for discretionary purposes by these authorities will be an amount equal to 20% of the total expected LPT income in their respective areas (before any decision to vary rates) or, in the case where that surplus will be less than 20%, the full amount. It will be a matter for the individual local authorities to decide how to spend that discretionary funding.<br\/><br\/>Effective from 1 July 2014, local authorities may vary the rate of LPT in their administrative area for the following year by up to 15% of the basic rate of the tax. The power to vary LPT rates has been given to local authorities to further increase their autonomy. Elected members are already responsible for finalising the annual budget of the local authority &ndash; it is a reserved function for them &ndash; and the power to vary LPT rates will enable them to directly influence the level of LPT income they have to meet their expenditure requirements in the future.<br\/><br\/>The decision to vary must be taken by resolution of the Council and must be notified to the Revenue Commissioners by 30 September each year in order to apply for the following year. For 2015, 14 local authorities availed of the opportunity to reduce the basic rate of LPT by the levels set out in the table below. The other 17 local authorities did not vary the LPT rate for 2015.<br\/><br\/>In the event that a local authority decides to increase LPT rates, they will retain 100% of the additional LPT collected. Where a local authority decides to reduce LPT rates, the full cost of that reduction will be reflected in a reduced LPT allocation to that local authority.<br\/><br\/>I have advised local authorities of their individual provisional LPT allocations for 2015.<br\/><br\/>The amount allocated to local authorities from the Local Government Fund for general purpose grants in 2014 is &euro;282 m; this figure recognises the removal of water related costs from local authorities to Irish Water in 2014.

The statutory certificates of compliance must be signed by a registered professional, i.e. a person who is included on the statutory registers of architects or building surveyors established in accordance with the Building Control Act 2007, or who is a Chartered Engineer. These are the construction professions typically involved in the design of construction works in Ireland and reference to these professions in regulation is entirely appropriate.<\/p><p>  Architectural Technology is not currently classed as a regulated profession in Ireland which means that there is no designated competent authority which has the power to approve or restrict access to the profession in Ireland under national or EU law. That said, I am aware of the valuable contribution to the construction industry that is made by architectural technologists and I welcome and support the recent moves made by both the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland (RIAI) and the Chartered Institute of Architectural Technologists (CIAT) to put this important discipline on a professional footing. Both bodies have recently agreed to the development through Quality Qualifications Ireland structures of an agreed common standard for Architectural Technologist in line with the National Qualifications Framework.<\/p><p>  The regulation of professions is in the first instance a matter for industry representatives working in concert with relevant industry stakeholders. Neither I, as Minister, nor my Department, have any role in the assessment or validation of professional qualifications. Nevertheless, where robust arrangements for the regulation of key disciplines such as that of Architectural Technologist can be achieved, in a manner capable of serving the public interest for quality and safety in the built environment at a reasonable economic cost to consumers, I would be happy to sponsor legislation to place such arrangements on a statutory footing.<\/p><p>  It is also worth noting that, depending on their personal background and experience, it may be open to persons who are Architectural Technologists, and who possess the requisite experience and competence in the design of buildings, to seek inclusion on either of the statutory registers in respect of Architects or Building Surveyors. A number of Architectural Technologists have already succeeded in gaining inclusion on the statutory registers to date and are thus in a position to avail of the many opportunities to act as Design Certifier and   Assigned Certifier that will continue to arise as a consequence of SI No. 9 of 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800082#WREE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1212,"content":"<p>Question No. 520 answered with Question No. 506.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Water Administration","counter":1213,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800082#WREE01150"},{"type":"question","counter":1214,"qnumday":521,"qnumall":"[44241\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800082#WREE01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the plans he has to provide a free-phone telephone number for Irish Water customers; the reason one has not already been set up; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":1215,"content":"<p>The Water Services Act 2013 provides for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigns the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake the water metering programme.<br\/><br\/>Irish Water have established a customer support call centre, open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy. In 2013, 7.8% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirements were met from renewable sources, with energy from biomass accounting for 3.2%. Biomass is expected to contribute up to half of the 2020 renewable energy targets, both here and in the EU as a whole.<br\/><br\/>Last month I published a Draft Bioenergy Plan which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website (). The draft Plan will undergo Strategic Environmental and Appropriate Assessments, including public consultation, which will inform the content of the finalised Plan. These assessment processes will commence shortly.<br\/><br\/>The draft plan recommends the continuation of the REFIT schemes and the Biofuels Obligation Scheme. Furthermore, the analysis underpinning the plan is that an additional bioenergy-focused measure in the heat sector represents the most cost effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals. Therefore, the plan also recommends the introduction of a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. The RHI scheme, once designed, will require State Aid approval from the European Commission and further Government approval. It is proposed to have the scheme in place in 2016.<br\/><br\/>The draft Plan recognises that, although Ireland will remain a net importer of biofuels in the transport sector, meeting demand for biomass from indigenous sources could deliver significant economic benefits. Consequently, the draft plan also contains measures to stimulate and support the supply of Irish biomass. In this regard, the key recommendations include: the continued support for the Afforestation Programme; the continuation of the Bioenergy Scheme for energy crops; and the establishment of Bioenergy Ireland, a joint venture between Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte.<br\/><br\/>Furthermore, in terms of developing new sources of biomass, the draft Plan provides that the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government will endeavour to optimise the availability of waste for energy and that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will continue its support for innovative energy uses for animal by-products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800083#WRFF02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Production","counter":1255,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800083#WRFF02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1256,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[44089\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800083#WRFF02100","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"to outline his plan to examine proposals to convert coal-fired generators in Moneypoint, County Clare, and peat fired generators in the midlands to biomass to reduce carbon emissions here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"987","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":1257,"content":"<p>The fuel used in the coal-fired generators in Moneypoint and in the peat-fired generators in the Midlands is a matter for the relevant operators and not a matter in which I, as Minister, have any role or function.

Notwithstanding this, I am advised that there are a number of important issues that would demand further consideration before biomass could be used extensively at Moneypoint, including:<\/p><p>- conversion of Moneypoint to biomass would require significant levels of operator capital investment and plant redesign;<\/p><p>- substantially more biomass than is available domestically would be required with large amounts of the resource having to be imported leading to questions in relation to sustainability and security of supply;<\/p><p>- the commitment of substantial amounts of biomass to Moneypoint would divert scarce biomass away from the renewable heat sector, where biomass can be used more efficiently and where fewer alternative technologies exist; and<\/p><p>- support tariffs substantially higher than those available for wind, which has been the most cost effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, would also be required which could lead to increased electricity prices.<\/p><p>  In that regard, electricity from biomass, including co-firing with peat, is already supported through REFIT.

However, the provision of incentives or compensation to land owners affected by the construction of a greenway through their lands is a matter for the local authority\u00a0in charge of delivering the specific\u00a0project given that the consideration of any such payments can substantially increase the cost of project delivery.<\/p><p>  The following sets out my Department's views with regard to the various options which can be considered in delivering greenways.<\/p><p>  The permissive access model is a worthy mechanism for certain cycling and walking projects, particularly on a local level.  It is a low cost community based model that provides access to the natural environment without interfering with the property rights of the landowners concerned.  In many cases, the landowners become champions of the project, supporting the role of the local authorities and the work of agencies such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland.<\/p><p> \u00a0In terms of the best land access models for greenway delivery, the use of publicly owned land is advantageous from the perspective of reducing costs.  Negotiated permissive access, from the perspective of cost and public ownership, continues to have value but, for projects of national scale, consideration must be given to land purchase by agreement or if necessary by CPO. \u00a0The process of obtaining permissive access is resource intensive and I would have my doubts that such a process could be deployed on projects of national scale where agreement would need to be secured with hundreds\u00a0or more\u00a0landowners.<\/p><p> \u00a0Greater investment is now being provided for greenways and it would be precarious to rely on permissive access where the associated agreements may be withdrawn at any time without recourse to the State.  Of course, as already stated, it will be a matter for all developers of cycling infrastructure to consider access to land on a case by case basis and to take a multi-criteria approach in the route selection process.  The key consideration should always be to select an approach that will maximise the future use of the amenity concerned.<\/p><p> \u00a0In the context of developing major cycling infrastructure projects that traverse long sections of privately owned land, I fully support the need to consider negotiated financial\u00a0agreements or, if required,\u00a0CPO.  However, I certainly recommend that all other options are considered before land purchase is decided upon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800084#WRGG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1007"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Expenditure","counter":1296,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800084#WRGG03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1297,"qnumday":551,"qnumall":"[43856\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800084#WRGG03300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the amount of the F&aacute;ilte\u00a0Ireland\u00a0and Tourism\u00a0Ireland\u00a0budget allocated for promoting English language schools here for 2014-2015;
