Applications under the first two tranches of the GLAS scheme\u00a0resulted in almost 38,000 farmers being approved into the scheme in its first year of implementation which represented an unprecedented level of interest in the first year of an agri-environment scheme.  A further, just under 14,000 applications, were received under GLAS 3 which closed in mid-December last.  Approvals have now issued in respect of over 90% of these applications, with the remaining applications currently being examined by the Department with a view to issuing further approvals where appropriate.

The sector is of critical importance to our economy and its regional spread means it underpins the socio-economic development\u00a0in rural areas in particular.  The sector employed approximately 173k people (i.e. 8.6% of total employment) in 2016, and the total value of agri food exports was more than &euro;11 billion.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The highly integrated nature of agri food trade between Ireland and the UK is shown in\u00a0CSO \u00a0trade figures, with some &euro;4.8bn (39%) of\u00a0 exports to the UK last year,\u00a0and\u00a0 &euro;3.7bn (46%) of agri food products\u00a0 imported from the UK. <\/p>  <p>  A number of credible analyses have been conducted on the potential impact on Ireland of a UK exit from the EU, and all of these show that the result will, most likely, be unambiguously bad for the Irish agri-food sector.  The more immediate impacts relate to the significant drop in the value of sterling against the euro and the effects this is having on industries with significant trading activity in the UK, particularly the mushroom and forest products sectors.<\/p>  <p>  The medium to longer term impacts will revolve around the potential application of tariffs, the implications of divergence in regulations and standards, border controls with the Great Britain and Northern Ireland and certification, including the related areas of veterinary and animal\u00a0health certification.\u00a0 There will also be difficult challenges in relation to potential restricted access to fishing grounds and resources.<\/p>  <p>  In response to the challenges being posed by Brexit I have undertaken a number of important steps within my Department, which include the establishment of a Brexit Response Committee and a dedicated Brexit Unit.  I have also created a Stakeholder Consultative Committee, which is complemented by frequent contact with representative organisations and companies on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  In addition I hosted two All-Island Civic Dialogues for the agri-food sector, to which interested stakeholders from both sides of the border were invited.\u00a0 The first of these - focusing on the dairy, cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry sectors - took place on 15 December 2016.\u00a0 The second - dealing with the prepared consumer foods, horticulture, forestry and cereals\/animal feed sectors - took place on 8 February 2017.  A Civic Dialogue for the seafood sector was held on 1 February 2017.\u00a0\u00a0 All of these opportunities for consultation allowed me and my Department establish the issues of critical concern to industry stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  I am also in regular communication with Commissioner Hogan and my officials have taken part in meetings with the Commission and the Barnier Task Force.<\/p>  <p>  At EU level, I have had regular contact with\u00a0the Commission and with\u00a0 counterparts in the UK and other member states, including meetings with\u00a0 my Spanish and Maltese colleagues on the margins of last Monday&rsquo;s Council of Ministers.\u00a0 Arrangements are currently being made for further formal bilateral meetings over the coming weeks involving &ndash; Germany, The Netherlands and Denmark over St. Patrick&rsquo;s weekend and Poland, Austria and Estonia at the end of the month.<\/p>  <p>  In all of these engagements I am making clear our demand for continued unfettered access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures, as well as keeping the UK market viable for Irish producers by minimising the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to fisheries, Ireland wants to maintain current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal and protect our quota share for\u00a0joint fish stocks.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Last October, as part of Budget 2017, I announced measures aimed at alleviating the pressures of income volatility and the potential impact of Brexit.\u00a0 These measures included the introduction of the &lsquo;Agri Cashflow Support Loan&rsquo; fund of &euro;150 million; enhanced taxation measures and an additional\u00a0allocation of &euro;1.6m in 2016 and &euro;2m in 2017 to Bord Bia to ensure that they are in a position to provide Brexit-related supports to affected companies.\u00a0 I also provided for increased funding under the Rural Development Programme and Seafood Development Programme.<\/p>  <p>  I recently awarded over\u00a0&euro;1.8 million in grants to 19 seafood enterprises under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme for the seafood sector.\u00a0 The aim of these grants is to incentivise seafood innovation and new product development as a means of meeting the Brexit challenge.<\/p>  <p>  The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU reinforces the need to develop as many outlets for our agri-food exports as possible, in order to minimise our dependence on any one market. Indeed this principle of market development is already a key component of Food Wise 2025.  We have been very active in recent years in our efforts to diversify markets, and in aiming to respond to consumer demands in emerging markets.<\/p>  <p>  Inward and outward trade visits will play a key role in our efforts to provide as many markets as possible for Irish agri-food products.  Last September Minister Doyle and I led very successful trade missions to China, Singapore, Vietnam and South Korea and to North Africa in November.\u00a0 I have just returned from leading a trade mission to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates which was very successful and I am currently considering potential further destinations for later in 2017. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to CAP payments the UK decision to leave the EU will result in a loss of the UK contribution to the EU budget of between 5 and 10%.\u00a0 This could have implications for future spending decisions in what is already a very tight budgetary framework.\u00a0 Given that the CAP accounts for some 37% of the EU budget, we could expect additional pressure for further contraction in CAP funding in the years ahead. However, it is important to remember that the amount of CAP funding per Member State under Pillars 1 and 2 is fixed under 2020 in the Regulations of the Council and European Parliament and it will require a co-decided amendment on these Regulations to change the figures.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the future of the CAP is of course a very important issue for Ireland&rsquo;s agriculture sector.\u00a0 I strongly believe that the CAP has evolved considerably and very effectively in recent years in response to changing market, consumer and environmental demands.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  At the Council of Agriculture Ministers earlier this week, I stressed the importance of ensuring that the CAP continues to evolve in the way that it has over recent reforms, and that it supports the achievement of European strategic objectives.  This will help to reinforce the relevance and effectiveness of the policy, and to secure a strong CAP budget for the period post-2020. <\/p>  <p>  I wish to assure the House that the Government\u00a0remains very focused on supporting the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead.  I will continue to consult with the industry as the negotiations develop, and press Ireland's case\u00a0for continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900062#WRA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":22,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900062#WRA01550"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[12195\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900062#WRA01600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will consider examining the way to co-ordinate the roles of various Departments (details supplied) in relation to animal welfare issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I am also aware, as I am sure the Deputy is, that a number of forecasts have predicted an additional 100,000 head of cattle to be available for slaughter in 2017, with the majority of these to go to plants in the early part of the year according to Bord Bia's performance and prospects publication.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While concerns have been raised about the impact of the supply of cattle on prices in 2017\u00a0I note however that R3 steer prices\u00a0have held steady, and actually risen slightly, since the beginning of the year, despite increased slaughter numbers, which is a relatively positive start to 2017.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0One of the key elements in coping with all challenges facing the beef sector is ensuring that there are sufficient markets for\u00a0Irish beef.  A strong demand for meat, including beef exists globally, and\u00a0figures from the European Commission's most recent Short Term Outlook for meat markets showed a 2.1% projected growth of per capita beef consumption for 2016. <\/p>  <p>  While we exported approximately 97% of our beef exports in 2016 to the UK and EU, I am acutely conscious of the importance of growing third country markets as a valuable outlet for any increase in Irish beef production.  Indeed, this is a crucial component of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.\u00a0 Very\u00a0significant progress has been made in this regard in recent years, and\u00a0my Department is currently in the process of securing beef access to a range of third countries including China, South Korea,\u00a0Ukraine, Thailand\u00a0and Vietnam. <\/p>  <p>  One of my priorities now, particularly in the context of Brexit, is to further increase the market opportunity for Irish food and drink internationally.  We are after all an exporting nation, with 90% of our food produce leaving the island.  I have just returned from a successful trade mission to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates last week during which enhanced access to the Saudi market was achieved for Irish beef.  This builds on the opening of some major markets in the last two years including the US, Canada and Japan.\u00a0 To date this year we have also secured new market access for Irish beef to Egypt.\u00a0 This is a vital means of providing our beef sector with as many commercial opportunities as possible for Irish beef in addition to our traditional European markets. <\/p>  <p>  I am also very conscious of the vital role that live exports play in providing an alternative market outlet for Irish farmers, especially in an environment where the number of calf births has increased, as in recent years. \u00a0The\u00a0opening of the Turkish market for live cattle exports in 2016\u00a0has been a good example of this, with approximately 20,000 live cattle exported there over the course of the last few months of 2016.  I also note that exports of live cattle to Libya have recommenced, which is a positive and welcome development.\u00a0 My Department is also currently actively examining the possibilities of bilateral health certificates for the export of cattle to Kazakhstan and Montenegro and for breeding cattle to Morocco.  I remain actively committed to ensuring that Irish beef producers have the option of exporting to as many markets as possible.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0My Department and state agencies such as Bord Bia will continue to work to ensure that any increase in production from the Irish beef herd can deliver a viable return to the primary producer.  I allocated additional funding to Bord Bia in Budget 2017 for the specific purpose of dealing with the impact of Brexit which will help to support Irish food and drink exports in 2017.  This, in addition to the opening of a new office by Bord Bia in Singapore this year, will ensure that exports of Irish beef are promoted effectively to provide viable export markets for any increases in Irish beef production.  Bord Bia has been very proactive in recent years in its promotion of Irish Beef\u00a0in Europe and further afield and this work allied to our trade missions and \u00a0promotional work will help to ensure there are a growing number of viable markets open to Irish beef this year and into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900062#WRA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Proposed Legislation","counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900062#WRA01950"},{"type":"question","counter":29,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[12359\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900062#WRA02000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans for publishing the Sea Fisheries Bill; the timeframe for its introduction; if he will provide an overview of its content and its impact on the sea fisheries sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1289","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":30,"content":"<p>The main purposes of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill are to provide for a points system for serious infringements by skippers and licence holders of the Common Fisheries Policy as required by Council Regulation 1224\/2009; to affirm that fishing quotas are a national resource; and to introduce other miscellaneous and technical amendments.<\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the most significant impact of the Bill will be its contribution to the promotion of compliance with fisheries law.\u00a0 The masters&rsquo; and licence holders&rsquo; points systems are key components in the EU Control framework aimed at promoting compliance with Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) rules by addressing situations where individuals repeatedly commit serious infringements of those rules.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0I am planning to include provisions relating to the long-standing Government policy that quotas are a national asset in primary legislation.\u00a0 This \u00a0will support the public ownership of national quotas and protect against any unintended privatisation of quotas, ensuring that benefits arising from such quotas are not lost to the State and the coastal communities reliant on the fishing industry.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am currently awaiting further legal advice of the Attorney General in relation to the required EU points system for sea-fishing boat licence holders.\u00a0\u00a0Apart from this issue, my Department&rsquo;s work is advanced on drafting the General Scheme of a Bill.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Once the draft General Scheme has been finalised, the next step would be to undertake a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) on the Points System for Licence Holders.

Commercial farmers when making breeding decisions for their beef herds are now making those decisions based on both economic and scientific data which is easily accessible to them when purchasing replacement stock using Eurostar data displayed clearly at mart ringsides.  This is an example of two Department schemes complementing one another in a positive manner.

The range of supports under the CAP such as Pillar I payments and schemes under the RDP such as GLAS, ANCs and indeed the BDGP represents a balance between direct income support for the sector and measures designed to improve its competitiveness and sustainability.

The BDGP aims to re-enforce these vital qualities by further enhancing our production to be at the forefront of Irish and international efforts to tackle climate change.

This work is being done in conjunction with the overall Government response being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  I fully recognise the potential difficulties that the agri food sector could face in the event of a hard Brexit.  The sector is of critical importance to our economy and its regional spread means it underpins the socio-economic development of rural areas in particular.  The sector employed approximately 173k people (i.e. 8.6% of total employment) in 2016, and the total value of agri-food exports was more than &euro;11 billion.<\/p>  <p>  The highly integrated nature of agri food trade between Ireland and the UK is shown in the trade figures.  Some &euro;4.8bn (39%) of these exports went to the UK last year, while\u00a0&euro;3.7bn (46%) of agri food products was imported from the UK.<\/p>  <p>  A further significant issue in relation to cross border trade is the de facto all-island milk market that currently exists.  Significant volumes of manufacturing milk processed in Ireland come from Northern suppliers and any reestablishment of a hard border would pose significant difficulties for both processors and suppliers.  In addition, a significant component of the sheep and lambs slaughtered in Irish processing facilities is of Northern Irish origin.<\/p>  <p>  The implications for North-South trade, and for the movement of raw materials, including milk, meat and live animals, are potentially severe.\u00a0 The implications for animal and plant health procedures on both sides of the border are also potentially very serious.  Put quite simply, this substantial trade would be massively affected by the constraints of tariffs, customs controls, veterinary\/phyto-sanitary certification and any deviation by the UK from EU common regulatory provisions and standards.<\/p>  <p>  In preparation for the upcoming negotiations I have had a number of meetings with key officials in the Commission, the UK and in other Members States, and this process will continue in the coming months.\u00a0 At EU level, I have had regular contact with counterparts at AgriFish Council meetings, including meetings with my Spanish and Maltese colleagues on the margins of last Monday&rsquo;s Council of Ministers meeting.\u00a0\u00a0Arrangements are currently being made for further formal bilateral meetings over the coming weeks involving Germany,\u00a0the Netherlands\u00a0and Denmark over St Patrick&rsquo;s weekend and Poland, Austria and Estonia at the end of the month.<\/p>  <p>  I am also in regular communication with Commissioner Hogan and my officials have taken part in meetings with the Commission and the Barnier Task Force.<\/p>  <p>  In all of these engagements I am making clear our demand for continued unfettered access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures, as well as keeping the UK market viable for Irish producers by minimising the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to fisheries, we want to maintain current access to fishing grounds in the UK zone in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and north of Donegal and protect Ireland&rsquo;s quota share for\u00a0joint fish stocks.<\/p>  <p>  Referring now specifically to meetings with my Northern Ireland and UK counterparts, I have met the outgoing Minister for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Michelle McIlveen on at least six occasions since last September and I have had bilateral meetings with Secretary of State Leadsom on two occasions &ndash; initially on December 1 in London and then at the Berlin Food Show last January.<\/p>  <p>  While we exchanged views on what we view as the immediate and longer-term impacts of the UK vote on Irish agri food sector, I fully observed the line agreed at EU level whereby no negotiations could take place with the UK until Article 50 has been triggered.  As you know, Ireland will be part of the EU27 team and will work with our fellow Member States in delivering the best possible result for Ireland and for the EU.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to assure the House that the Government\u00a0remains very focused on supporting the agri-food industry through the challenges ahead.  I will continue to consult with the industry as the negotiations develop, and I will continue to press Ireland's case\u00a0for continued free access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900063#WRB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Laboratory Facilities","counter":86,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900063#WRB04100"},{"type":"question","counter":87,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[12365\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900063#WRB04200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if the future of the regional veterinary laboratory in County Kilkenny, which serves the entire region of the south east, can be guaranteed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The exercise is repeated every 5 years with work on the next NFI currently underway.<\/p><p>Under &ldquo;Forests, products and people, Ireland&rsquo;s forest policy&rdquo; the aim is to increase forest cover to 18% by 2046.  Following publication of new afforestation targets under the new forestry programme launched in 2015, the estimated year in which this level of cover will be reached has been updated to 2050.  It is difficult to say what rules will be in place that far forward but currently the establishment of new forests are subject to rigorous checks and balances which undergo careful planning by professional foresters.  Furthermore, all new forests must be established in compliance with national and EU legislation and the Department&rsquo;s requirements as set out in the Forestry Standards Manual, Scheme Documents, Code of Best Practice &ndash; Ireland, the suite of environmental guidelines and requirements, and relevant procedures and protocols such as Forest Service Appropriate Assessment Procedure, consultation with statutory consultees and adherence to the Acid Sensitivity Protocol.  Only projects which receive prior written approval from the Department in line with Statutory Instrument No. 558 of 2010 (as amended by S.I.

These wide-ranging benefits are economic, environmental and social.\u00a0 Firstly forestry generates economic activity in parts of rural Ireland that other forms of investment can&rsquo;t reach.  On the environmental side, forests protect and enhance water quality, they can alleviate flooding and they are the most important land use option for climate change mitigation.  There are also social benefits that can be enjoyed from forestry in the form of amenity and recreation.  Furthermore, forestry can be complementary to existing farming activities particularly where land is being underutilised.  For example, where animals are grazing poor land which is more suitable for forestry, animals can be moved onto the better fields and the poorer ground can be planted.  In other words, forestry does not necessarily mean a reduction in agricultural output nor does it mean converting the entire farm to forestry; instead where land is underutilised, it signals a more efficient use of land bringing the entire farm closer to its productive potential.  Most importantly this approach introduces a more stable and additional income into the farm.  This new income stream can be used to develop the farm business as part of the overall plan for the farm.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900063#WRB04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Areas of Natural Constraint Scheme","counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900063#WRB05000"},{"type":"question","counter":96,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[12353\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900063#WRB05100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of the process of reviewing qualifying areas for the areas of natural constraint scheme; if his Department has completed the mapping exercise; when the maps will be published; if he will ensure consultation is undertaken with farmers on the review in advance of submitting maps to the EU and in advance of any identification of areas for designation as areas of specific constraint; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":97,"content":"<p>Under the Rural Development Regulation each Member State\u00a0must designate areas eligible for payments under the Areas of Natural Constraints (ANC) scheme.\u00a0 The ANC scheme replaces the previous Disadvantaged Areas Scheme\/Less Favoured Areas Scheme.\u00a0 The designation of eligible areas under these schemes to date has been based on a range of socio-economic factors.

The committee reviews progress on detailed actions on a quarterly basis, in order to identify and solve problems quickly.  Brexit has now been included as a standard item on the agenda of each meeting of the HLIC. <\/p>  <p>  It is not yet clear what the final outcome of the UK's Brexit decision will be. While the value of agri food exports to the UK declined in 2016, primarily as a result of the reduction in the value of sterling, the overall value of exports increased. A hard Brexit involving the imposition of WTO tariffs would have a more significant adverse affect on the value of exports, but our stated aim is to avoid such a scenario. <\/p>  <p>  In any event it is clear that the implementation of the Food Wise recommendations, particularly those related to market development, competitiveness and innovation, will assume even greater importance in the light of the UK decision, regardless of the ultimate outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900064#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Payments","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900064#WRC00500"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[12366\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900064#WRC00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the total number of persons in County Mayo that have not received 85% of their total 2016 payment under GLAS 1, GLAS 2 and AEOS; the reason for this delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":107,"content":"<p>Under the EU Regulations governing the Green, Low-Carbon, Agri-Environment Scheme (GLAS) and the Agri-Environment Options Scheme (AEOS) a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue.  <\/p>  <p>   MY Department as the accredited Paying Agency must ensure that, before payment issues, everything in an application that can be checked is checked as required under the regulations.

Already in the first two months of this year, just over 20, 000 head, including 12, 000 calves, were exported, up from 18, 900 in the same period last year.  The number of calves exported in January and February increased by 3,000 over last year. I recently reduced the veterinary inspection fee payable on live exports of calves under three months of age to &euro;1.20 per animal from &euro;4.80, in order to bring greater equity in the fees payable per consignment in respect of calves, weanlings and adult cattle.  The live calf export trade with the EU has proved difficult in recent years for a number of reasons, including changes in animal health rules in Belgium and changes in the interpretation of the EU rules on animal transport in the Netherlands.  However, my Department has been working closely with the Dutch authorities on the transport issue and nearly 7,000 calves were exported to the Netherlands in February, double the number for February 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  Last year saw significant developments in exports of cattle to third countries. We exported almost 20, 000 head to Turkey in 2016 and the indications are that there will be further shipments this year. In relation to the other significant potential third country markets for live exports, Ireland reached agreement with Egypt in 2016 on a health certificate for slaughter cattle. My Department has been actively discussing with the Egyptian authorities the possibility of agreement on a health certificate for fattening cattle. Good progress has been made on this matter and I am optimistic that an agreement can be finalised in the near future.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is also looking at the possibility of bilateral health certificates for the export of cattle to Kazakhstan and has identified Israel as a live export market of potential interest to exporters. Agreement on health certificates has been reached by my Department with all other live export markets identified as being of potential interest to Ireland.  At present 9 non-EU markets (Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, Montenegro, Morocco, Serbia, Tunisia, and most recently Turkey) are currently open to live cattle from Ireland, in addition to all EU Member States.  Demand from North Africa and the Middle East for live cattle will depend on the political environment there as well as, Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department works with all those involved &ndash; including farmers, marts, exporters, assembly centre operators and transporters - to ensure the export trade is carried out to the highest animal health and welfare standards.  We have a comprehensive legislative framework in place governing vessels that export animals and we have rigorous controls and procedures in place to ensure compliance with this legislation.  My Department also supports on-going efforts by international organisations such as The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), to improve welfare standards at slaughter plants worldwide and will continue to promote and maintain an environment in which live exports can continue in both an economic and sustainable manner and with due regard for the welfare of all animals exported. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900064#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Exports","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900064#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[12342\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900064#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he is engaged in the identification of alternative markets for Irish food and food products within the EU and elsewhere with a view to amelioration of the impact of Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>In keeping with the priorities outlined in Food Wise 2025 and with a view to ameliorating the impact of Brexit , Minister Doyle and I led Trade Missions to Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore and China in early September 2016.

The remainder is made up of a wide range of species including over 25% broadleaves including several native species, mostly ash, oak and birch. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland, however, has very few native tree species compared to other European countries.  Native trees are often selected by landowners whose objectives include optimising the recreational and biodiversity aspects of the new forest while Sitka spruce is normally selected by landowners whose objectives include optimising the economic return. Where a landowner wishes to plant Sitka spruce they must plant a minimum of 10% broadleaves and have 10 to 15% unplanted Areas of Biodiversity Enhancement. In all cases the landowners plan must be examined and approved by my Department. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Forestry programme 2014 &ndash; 2020 my Department operates a package of measures, aimed specifically at protecting and expanding Ireland&rsquo;s native woodland resource. These measures, which are 100% funded by the exchequer, represent a key biodiversity component within Ireland&rsquo;s national forest policy. My Department provides higher grants and annual premiums to landowners who wish to establish native woodlands.<\/p>  <p>  Native Woodland Establishment as represented by Grant &amp;amp; Premium Categories (GPC) 9 and 10 under the Afforestation Scheme, funds the establishment of new native woodland on open &lsquo;greenfield&rsquo; sites. The Native Woodland Conservation Scheme, promotes the appropriate restoration of existing native woodland, including the conversion of non-native forest to native woodland, through the provision of financial support to forest holders towards the cost of appropriate works. A third strand in my Department' strategy to support and expand Ireland&rsquo;s native woodlands is the Seed Stand and Seed Orchard Scheme. This Scheme encourages the registration of seed stands comprising of native species on the National List of Basic Material. Most importantly the scheme supports the improvement and management of sessile oak and pedunculate oak seed stands within ancient woodlands. The establishment of indoor and outdoor seed orchards for both native and non native species is also supported under this scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s climate allows a wide range of native and exotic species to be grown, as can be seen from the great diversity of both herbaceous and woody species that grow successfully side-by-side in Ireland&rsquo;s gardens and arboreta. The ability to grow many species of trees presents foresters with opportunities to use different species, not only to maximise site productivity for the production of specific wood products, but also to enhance the amenity, landscape and biodiversity values of the forests.  Under the Afforestation and Creation of Woodlands measure the selection of species, and provenances of trees take into account all the site  conditions of the area concerned.  The need to select species resilient to climate change has been described in my Department&rsquo;s recent  &ldquo;Draft Adaptation Plan for the Agriculture and Forest Sector&rdquo;. <\/p>  <p>  Species selection to ensure that the most suitable species are planted is guided by the COFORD publication &lsquo;A Guide to Forest Tree Species Selection and Silviculture in Ireland&rsquo;.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900064#WRC02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Laboratory Facilities","counter":123,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900064#WRC02300"},{"type":"question","counter":124,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[12351\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900064#WRC02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will ensure that the Sligo regional veterinary laboratory will remain open following the recently completed review of the veterinary laboratory services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As part of Budget 2017 I secured an additional &euro;700,000 in funding for capital investments in the Commercial Horticulture sector.  This means that this year&rsquo;s budget for the scheme will be &euro;5 million. In addition, the Horticulture sector will have access to the &euro;150 million low interest cash flow support loan fund announced in Budget 2017, providing access to highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000, at an interest rate of 2.95%. <\/p><p>The impact that the devaluation of Sterling is having on mushroom producers and grower margins is a problem that has happened over a very short space of time. Grower production of this highly perishable product must be well aligned with demand and the mushroom sector, like many other exporting sectors, is particularly at risk because of the high dependency on the UK market. I am monitoring the situation regarding Sterling volatility closely and in my own Department I have established a dedicated unit to consider the direct impact of Brexit on our industry. Although it is still a serious situation, the Sterling exchange rate has stabilised and is now holding at around 85p to 86p to the Euro.<\/p><p>My Department, along with the various State agencies, in particular Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland, are working closely with the industry to provide the necessary support and assistance.  Bord Bia is actively supporting the sector in the areas of Market Intelligence, UK consumer research and Quality Assurance. Towards the end of 2016 they held a currency and negotiation workshop specifically targeted at the sector which I understand was very well received by the mushroom industry. Bord Bia is also running a Marketing Intensification Programme which aims to<b><\/b>provide targeted marketing supports to companies with high dependency on UK markets. Grant supports will be prioritised to assist companies in strengthening their position in that market, and in their efforts to identify new markets.  The CEO of Bord Bia and I have held a series of meetings with senior executives from the UK retailers, to highlight the obstacles that our producers are facing. I understand that representatives of mushroom growers have recently met with a more positive reaction from their UK Multiple customers, to their need for fair and reasonable returns for their produce from the marketplace. A pilot programme on LEAN processes has been initiated, with the assistance of Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland. The programme has commenced with 6 mushroom growers, to assess efficiency across all aspects of the business, including supply chain, innovation, marketing and logistics. It is hoped that a template could be developed through this programme that will enable growers to optimise their production costs further. <\/p><p>I would also draw attention to support being provided to the industry through National and EU Schemes. <\/p><p>Under the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007 &ndash; 2013 my Department implemented the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector.  During this period my Department paid out over &euro;4 million in grant payments to mushroom growers which supported &euro;10.1 million in investment.<\/p><p>To ensure ongoing support for the sector, my Department extended, under EU sanction, the Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector to run until 31 December 2019. In the years to 2016, a further amount of &euro;2.0 million in grant aid was paid to mushroom growers.  The grant aid paid supported some &euro;5.0 million in investment by these growers. <\/p><p>Under the 2017 Scheme of Investment Aid for the Development of the Commercial Horticulture Sector, my Department received a total of 164 applications, 20 of these from mushroom growers.

I am deeply conscious of the serious issue of road safety and mindful of the increase in 2016 of road traffic fatalities on the corresponding figure for 2015.  I am also mindful of the traumatic impact of road traffic collisions on those directly affected and their families, as well as the impact of dangerous driving more generally on the quality of life of residents in local communities across the country. <\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that I have no direct role in the enforcement of road traffic legislation, which is an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am informed that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as through a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies. Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including driving while intoxicated, as well as speeding and use of a mobile phone.  Both strategic, targeted operations and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's road traffic enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to target persistent offenders, make optimal use of the Garda PULSE system and utilise Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology to identify and target vehicles, with 'warnings' also placed on the ANPR system. I am informed by the Garda authorities that 19,290* offences of driving without a driving licence, contrary to section 38 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 as amended, were detected in 2016. This is the category of offence which drivers caught driving while disqualified are prosecuted under.<\/p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has identified a number of key road traffic initiatives in the Annual Policing Plan 2017, as follows:<\/p><p>- Work in partnership with other agencies including the Road Safety Authority, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, and Road Safety Officers in local authorities to reduce road deaths and serious injuries,<\/p><p>- Increase use of technologies and analytical tools to develop and implement plans to reduce the occurrence of road collisions, and the use of our roads for criminal activity,<\/p><p>- Expand the Fixed Charge Processing System, including penalty points,<\/p><p>- Strengthen and re-develop the Traffic Corps to tackle all forms of criminality on our road network, and<\/p><p>- Ongoing planning, risk assessment and operational preparation for major emergencies in conjunction with major emergency management partners. <\/p><p>Underpinning road traffic enforcement measures, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme (2016-2021) sets out key strategic objectives for Road Policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Road Policing plans over the next 5 years. Under the Programme, the Garda Commissioner will undertake a number of road safety traffic enforcement initiatives, including expanding the use of technology and increasing checkpoints. <\/p><p>A number of important actions are being taken to build on the vital work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Road Safety Authority (RSA) and other stakeholders: In January, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicated that there will be a 10% increase in the traffic corps during the course of 2017, which should also lead to better outcomes in relation to road traffic enforcement.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also indicated that it was intended to have a stronger focus on road traffic enforcement in the training provided to new recruits at Templemore;<\/p><p>- The Deputy will be aware that road traffic legislation is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr Shane Ross, T.D.  I am, however, informed that the  Road Traffic Act 2016 (the 2016 Act) provides for insurance companies to collect driver numbers and other details when selling insurance policies, and to validate them with the National Vehicle and Driver File, which will ensure that disqualified drivers are not able to obtain insurance.  I am further informed that this project is currently in development and a test version is due to be ready later this year;<\/p><p>- The Deputy will also be aware that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is working with key stakeholders to introduce the new roadside tests for drugs provided for in the 2016 Act, which will be known as preliminary drug tests.  It is intended that the provisions will be commenced at the Easter Bank Holiday weekend.  This will provide a valuable opportunity to highlight the dangers of drug driving over the Bank Holiday weekend. I look forward to the introduction of the preliminary drug tests and am confident that these new road traffic enforcement measures will impact positively on road safety;<\/p><p>- The Deputy is aware that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport announced earlier this year that his Department will review Section 29 of the Road Traffic 2010 with the intention of ensuring that all drivers, if caught drink driving, will, in future, receive a mandatory disqualification. I support Minister Ross's intention to amend section 29 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, which should assist us in ensuring more effective enforcement of road traffic offences and making our roads safer.

It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division. <\/p><p>Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. <\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that 838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 76 of whom have been assigned to the DMR West Division. I am also informed that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.

In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.

The question of not returning a person to a place where certain fundamental rights would be breached (or <i>non refoulement<\/i>as it is commonly referred to) is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order.

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products. <\/p>  <p>  However, I do accept that it is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market and deal with factors contributing to the cost of insurance.  Consequently, I established the Cost of Insurance Working Group and appointed Minister of State Eoghan Murphy as Chair. The Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was finalised in December 2016, approved by Cabinet on 10 January, 2017, and subsequently published.  It contains 33 recommendations and 71 actions which are detailed in an action plan contained in the Report with agreed timelines for implementation.  Work on carrying out these recommendations is well underway and I am confident that the report's 71 action points will be implemented by the end of 2018, with 45 due for completion this year.  The Working Group continues to meet regularly and will report on a quarterly basis detailing its progress.  As part of its second phase, the Working Group is now examining issues related to Employer Liability and Public Liability insurance including the impact of the cost of insurance on the competitiveness of particular business sectors. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the road passenger industry in particular, the issues are in the main similar to those affecting drivers generally, notwithstanding that there are risks that are specific to the sector.  While there is no simple solution to reduce the cost of insurance, I believe that with cooperation and commitment between all parties, fairer premiums can be delivered for consumers, including coach companies, without unnecessary delay.  This in turn should lead to greater stability in the pricing of motor insurance and should help prevent the volatility that we have seen in the market in the past. It should also better facilitate new entrants to the market.  Taken together, these measures should address many of the issues raised by the road passenger industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900066#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":228,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900066#WRE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":229,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[12596\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900066#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the level of engagement that has taken place between his Department and the insurance industry to ensure that appropriate insurance is available to persons residing in an area in which flooding has never occurred but who are being excluded from cover, en masse, by insurance providers due to their Eircode; his views on such practices; the measures which have been implemented by his Department to hold insurance providers to account and protect the consumer in such instances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Dividend payments are therefore\u00a0made to the\u00a0ISIF.\u00a0Payments from the ISIF\u00a0to the Exchequer arising from the proceeds of the disposal of the State's shareholdings in the Banks are provided for under the NTMA (Amendment) Act 2014. This legislation allows the Minister to direct the Agency to make such payments after having consulted the Agency. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the sale of financial assets, these type of transactions do not result in a beneficial impact to the General Government Balance (GGB) under the\u00a0European System of Accounts (ESA) framework.\u00a0This is due to the fact that it\u00a0is classified as a 'financial transaction' whereby it is essentially the exchange of one form of asset (shares, equities, loans) for another kind (cash). Consequently, the sale of any shareholding in Allied Irish Bank (AIB) would not count as general government revenue. Accordingly,\u00a0there will not be increased capacity to spend on capital projects as a result of the sale of shares in AIB without affecting the general government balance.<\/p>  <p>  However, while not improving the deficit, cash proceeds arising from the sale of AIB shares that are transferred to the Exchequer\u00a0would\u00a0reduce the\u00a0Exchequer borrowing requirement and\u00a0ultimately result\u00a0in lower general government\u00a0debt. A lower level of\u00a0debt is not only beneficial in terms of the fiscal sustainability of the State but would also result in reduced interest payments in future years. The strategy of reducing the national debt is consistent with the Government policy of repaying the borrowing previously undertaken to finance the recapitalisation\u00a0of the banking sector during the financial crisis.\u00a0It is my view, therefore, that because public indebtedness rose partly due to the recapitalisation of the Banks, it is appropriate to use\u00a0one-off revenue from divesting the State of its banking assets to reduce\u00a0debt\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Regarding proceeds from dividends, these are typically recorded as property income in the ESA framework.

These are set out in the Code of Practice for Revenue Audit and other Compliance Interventions (the Code) and include reduced penalties, avoiding publication in the list of tax defaulters and not being investigated by Revenue with a view to prosecution.

Loans made to SMEs, on the basis of viable business plans, can also give them the opportunity to diversify into other markets and reduce their exposure to the UK.\u00a0<\/p><p>In this context, it is encouraging to note that SMEs can access lower cost, flexible finance from the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).  To the end of December 2016, the SBCI has lent &euro;544 million to 12,593 SMEs supporting an estimated 67,150 jobs.  The SBCI's goal is to increase the availability of funding to SMEs at a lower cost and on more flexible terms than has been available in recent times on the Irish market.  The SMEs who received SBCI finance are from a variety of business and economic sectors.  More than 80% of loans are for investment purposes and the average loan size is &euro;43,200.  There is a broad regional spread of the SMEs supported, with 84.8% of them based outside Dublin. <\/p><p>The\u00a0Action Plan for Jobs 2017\u00a0has committed the Government to roll out an Export Finance Initiative to support Irish exporting SMEs this year.  Officials from my Department are working with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the SBCI, Enterprise Ireland and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to develop a product that will support the working capital needs of exporting Irish SMEs.  It is intended to launch this Initiative on a pilot basis initially, for a period of one year.  As part of this process, my Department and the SBCI\u00a0are engaging with DG Comp to address any potential State Aid issues.<\/p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that, aside from the SBCI,\u00a0there are significant Government measures to support the financing needs of SMEs that are facing challenges.  These\u00a0measures\u00a0include the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices and the Credit Review Office.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is a cross-government initiative.  By answering eight simple questions, SMEs will receive a tailored list of available Government supports to suit their needs.  The Supporting SMEs Online Tool is available at .\u00a0 <\/p><p>The Credit Guarantee Scheme encourages additional lending to small businesses by offering a partial Government guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to eligible SMEs.  Further information is available on the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation website. <\/p><p>The Microenterprise Loan Fund, administered by Microfinance Ireland, is an additional source of credit\u00a0that provides loans for up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing micro enterprises employing less than 10 people.  Microfinance Ireland works in partnership with the Local Enterprise Offices nationally to administer this fund <i>(<\/i><i><\/i>).<\/p><p>The Credit Review Office<b><\/b>(CRO) is another government initiative that helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition.

In my role as\u00a0Minister for Finance, I have responsibility for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation, and neither I,\u00a0nor the Central Bank of\u00a0Ireland, can\u00a0interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products or have the power to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals or businesses.<\/p>  <p>  While it is not possible for me to comment in detail on this matter in the absence of\u00a0details of the particular properties in Sallins, I have been advised by the Office of Public Works that a grant of &euro;500,000 to Kildare County Council was approved\u00a0on 1st June 2010 for funding towards Flood Alleviation Works, under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works Scheme.  Kildare County Council has confirmed that by 2012, this 'Culvert Upgrade and Embankment at Sallins' project was completed which aimed to reduce the risk to the Waterways Estate in particular.

This information has been provided as part of an information sharing arrangement entered into between OPW and Insurance Ireland (Memorandum of Understanding).  The nature of this arrangement is such that it should lead to a greater availability of flood cover in previously higher risk areas, and at better prices. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent Insurance Ireland survey of approximately 85% of the property insurance market in Ireland indicates that of the 16 completed defence schemes, 90% of policies in areas benefitting from permanent flood defences include flood cover, while 77% of policies in areas benefitting from demountable defences include flood cover.  The particular issues in relation to the remainder of policies is actively being explored with the insurance industry through a working group in which the OPW, the insurance industry and the Department of Finance participate.

DES Circular 0013\/2017 provides details for primary schools\u00a0while DES Circular 0014\/2017 sets out the position for post primary schools.<\/p><p>Schools\u00a0will also\u00a0receive details of their allocations under the new model this week.<\/p><p>The\u00a0aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. <\/p><p>No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils\u00a0by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. <\/p><p>An additional 900 teaching posts will be provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional\u00a0teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011, when 5265 teachers were allocated, as opposed to\u00a0provision for 7542 posts in the current school year.<\/p><p>The additional funding will provide\u00a0extra supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model. Supports for children with special educational needs is a huge priority for this Government.  We currently spend over &euro;1.6 billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs. <\/p><p>This investment\u00a0will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation\u00a0of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils\u00a0who require such support.\u00a0<\/p><p>Under the new allocation model, schools will be\u00a0provided with a total allocation which includes\u00a0a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile. <\/p><p>The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need and pupils in each school. <\/p><p>Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school's profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will\u00a0reduce the administrative burden on schools as they will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils, or pupils transferring\u00a0in to the school,\u00a0who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p><p>DES Circulars 0013\/2017 and 0014\/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools. <\/p><p>Schools will be able to appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017\/18 allocation.<\/p><p>In advance of the submission of an appeal, schools should read carefully the DES circulars and in particular the relevant section, which relates to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.<\/p><p>Taking this into account, the NCSE will publish details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: on 20th March 2017.  Should a school wish to appeal they should do so by March 31st 2017. <\/p><p>The appeal will consist of a review of whether the correct data was correctly applied to one, or all, of the components of the schools profile and a correct allocation made.

This includes investment in top quality researchers, physical infrastructure, equipment and structures to commercialise research. <\/p><p>Investment in research is key element of overall enterprise policy and seeks to drive innovation and competitiveness in business and the public sector and enable the creation of sustainable jobs.  Higher education institutions are central to the delivery of this ambition.<\/p><p>In that context, the Deputy may already be aware that the national IP Protocol &ldquo;Putting public research to work in Ireland&rdquo; was developed by a task group comprised of leaders from industry, the investment community and TTOs in 2012.  The new protocol built on earlier guidelines and codes of practice, using the lessons learned from their use. <\/p><p>In 2013 the Government established a centralised function with responsibility for technology transfer in the State which led to the creation of Knowledge Transfer Ireland, launched in May 2014.  Knowledge Transfer Ireland (KTI) now has responsibility for setting direction for research performing organisations (RPOs) best practice to enable compliance with IP policy and procedures.<\/p><p>The publication of the national IP protocol in 2012, and its subsequent refresh in 2016, sought to establish policy and guidelines on the interactions between industry and Ireland&rsquo;s Higher Education Institutes, including the treatment of intellectual property.  It provides guidelines and sets expectations for the RPOs and for industry.<\/p><p>The national IP Protocol 2016 comprises two volumes:<\/p><p>-  the National IP Protocol policy document which sets out the framework underpinning research collaboration and access to intellectual property from state-funded research<\/p><p>- the IP Protocol Resource Guide which provides an overview of the national IP management guidelines and links to resources and template documents, available for industry and RPOs.  It also provides an overview of the knowledge transfer structures in Ireland and the kinds of agreements that can be used to formalise research-industry engagements.<\/p><p>The protocol explains the National IP Management Requirements and requires that RPOs have in place and operate internal IP management systems that meet or exceed these.  The protocol also includes &ldquo;good practice&rdquo; that will normally be followed.  However, industry and RPOs are free to adopt a different approach where this is in the best interests of successful relationships and research commercialisation.Practices are also highlighted that may be followed if industry \/ RPOs choose to do so.<\/p><p>The IP Protocol is a key reference source for Ireland&rsquo;s HEIs and research funders. HEIs have developed IP policies that are in line with national guidelines and good practice.  These will include policy on spin-out formation.  The detail of policies will differ amongst institutions. <\/p><p>The research funding agencies for the publicly funded research system all require that the higher education institutions own the intellectual property arising from research projects that they fund.  Each University and IoT has a set of policies that cover how they will govern the use of that IP.<\/p><p>The national IP Protocol explains that commercialisation may benefit HEIs and provide incentives to the researchers involved in creating IP.  IP may include protectable IP and know-how.  Furthermore, the national IP management requirements make provision for HEIs to have in place a system for sharing of income from commercialising within the organisation, including with relevant researchers.<\/p><p>It is international practice that researchers may hold shares in spin-out companies.  The national IP Protocol makes it clear that HEIs should have policies and procedures in place that minimise or manage potential or actual conflicts of interest concerning the commercialisation of IP.<\/p><p>The IP Protocol (National IP Management Requirements) refers to conflict of interest as it applies to commercialisation of IP.<\/p><p>The national IP Protocol is clear on the policy and processes to identify, protect and commercialise IP that arises in HEIs.  This includes guidance on licensing of IP.  A suite of Model Agreements, available for use if HEIs and companies choose, covering a range of IP licensing scenarios is available on the KTI website.<\/p><p>In addition, all HEIs are requested yearly as part of their governance statements to state that a code of conduct for Governing Body members and a Code of Conduct for Employees has been adopted and is being monitored.  Guidelines for these codes are included in the IOT and University Codes of Governance (section 3.2).<\/p><p>The University Code of Governance has been implemented since 2007 and was updated in 2012.

first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.\u00a0 I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. <\/p><p>However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.<\/p><p>Once this work\u00a0has been\u00a0completed, consideration will be given to extending

in some areas than others.\u00a0 Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.\u00a0 The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.\u00a0 If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.<\/p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional

In the case referred to, as the activity was not a class of activity set out in either Annex 1 or 2 of the EIA Directive, nor was it within a Natura 2000 site, an EIA was not required.The application was subject to the normal public consultation process which ran from 12 December 2009 until 15 January 2010.

There were no submissions on the application from members of the public.<\/p><p>In addition to the public consultation process, written submissions were received from the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Underwater Archaeology Unit of the Dept of the Environment, the Marine Survey Office, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board, the Central Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute.

The A &amp;amp; B zones are stand by areas only to be harvested if conditions do not allow for harvesting in zones C to E.

I also had discussions with a number of the main party leaders in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Both Governments are agreed on the need for intensive engagement to address outstanding issues including; the implementation of past agreements and addressing the legacy of the past, and to ensure the early establishment of an Executive which can operate effectively and deliver for all of the people of Northern Ireland in a spirit of partnership and mutual respect.  Dealing with outstanding issues from previous agreements is a necessary and important part of creating confidence at this critical moment for devolution in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, both Governments have a role to play in supporting the effective operation of the devolved institutions, and in upholding both the letter and the spirit of the Agreement as a whole, in the interests of all in Northern Ireland.  All parties eligible to nominate Ministers to the Executive have been invited to participate in the discussions relating to outstanding issues which, in accordance with previous agreements, are being facilitated by the two Governments.<\/p>  <p>  There is a short three week window for the formation of a new Executive.  The political parties have each received fresh mandates.  Particular responsibilities attach to the two parties who are entitled to nominate a First Minister and deputy First Minister to engage with each other, and to advance discussions with all eligible political parties, on the formation of a new Executive.<\/p>  <p>  Discussions commenced this week in Belfast.  I met yesterday with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and a number of the parties, and I am continuing this engagement today.  In our first round of discussions with the parties, both I and the Secretary of State have emphasised to the party leaders the significance of the electoral mandate they have each received and discussed with them the role that each party might play in creating the conditions that allow for the formation of a new power-sharing Assembly and Executive.  We have also discussed with the parties the ways forward on the full implementation of past agreements and addressing the legacy of the past.<\/p>  <p>  The heart of the Good Friday Agreement is its interlocking political institutions.  However, they can only be sustained on the basis of partnership, equality and mutual respect.  As a co-guarantor, the Irish Government is determined to uphold the principles of the Agreement and to protect its institutions.  These institutions, including the Assembly and the Executive, are indispensable for addressing the needs and concerns of people in Northern Ireland, including peace, prosperity, reconciliation and indeed the considerable challenges posed by the upcoming Brexit negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, I hope that the new Northern Ireland Executive will be in place as soon as possible.  The interests of the island as a whole and protecting the gains of the peace process will remain a priority for the Government in the upcoming Brexit negotiations.  It will remain part of our ongoing engagement with the Northern Ireland parties.  The Government&rsquo;s All-Island Civic Dialogue is also a central strand of our approach to preparing for and managing Brexit.  The Government will continue to be proactive in seeking input on Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests, as we prepare for the Brexit negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  In the coming weeks I will continue, in cooperation with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, to engage intensively with the political parties to see the power-sharing Assembly and Executive restored to effective and harmonious operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900071#WRK02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":487,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[12614\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900071#WRK02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the particular challenges facing business and enterprise in the Border region, which are heavily or totally dependent on exports to the sterling area, will be considered in the context of the all-island civic dialogue on Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":488,"content":"<p>The inaugural plenary meeting of the All-Island Civic Dialogue took place on 2 November 2016.

It is also of grave concern that intractable conflict is the main driver of the humanitarian emergencies for people in these countries.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland, working with our international partners, will continue to support a strong focus on the need for peaceful resolution of these conflicts.  In addition, the provision of timely humanitarian assistance will remain a key foreign policy priority.  In 2016, we provided a total of some &euro;190 million in humanitarian assistance to people affected by crisis and conflict including in Somalia, Yemen, South Sudan and north east Nigeria.  <\/p>  <p>  The EU is providing very significant humanitarian assistance to each of the four crises and the European Commission&rsquo;s humanitarian budget now amounts tom some &euro;1 billion annually.<\/p>  <p>  We are keeping these situations under close review and I would expect we will provide further humanitarian support to each of the four crises in the coming period.  <\/p>  <p>  Famine was declared in parts of South Sudan in recent weeks and 7.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.  Severe drought, compounded by years of conflict, has led to emergency levels of food insecurity and risk of famine in Somalia, where 6 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.  We are currently preparing a package of humanitarian assistance to cover both of these crises and this will be released in the coming weeks. <\/p>  <p>  This will be in addition to the over &euro;31 million Ireland has provided to South Sudan since December 2013 and over &euro;27 million for Somalia since 2012.  <\/p>  <p>  We are also gravely concerned about the situation in Yemen where 70% of the population of 27 million is now in need of assistance.  Ireland has provided almost &euro;6 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen since the conflict began in early 2015 and we intend to maintain similar levels of support in 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  At the recent Oslo Conference for north east Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, Ireland made an indicative commitment of at least &euro;5 million in humanitarian funding for 2017 in response to the ongoing severe humanitarian crisis in this region, which encompasses the dire food security situation and risk of famine in North-East Nigeria. <\/p>  <p>  We use every opportunity we have internationally to focus on the unprecedented level of humanitarian need globally, including at the Foreign Affairs Council.

This scheme does not apply in normal course to storm damage repairs.  However, as an exceptional measure, funding for such work was provided under the scheme in 2014 and 2015 arising from the Government Decision of 11 February 2014 which allocated total funding of up to &euro;69.5 million for clean-up, repair and restoration works in relation to public infrastructure that was damaged in the severe storms during the period 13 December 2013 to 6 January 2014.  Of this sum of &euro;69.5 million, up to &euro;19.6 million was allocated for repair of existing coastal protection and flood defences based on submissions and cost estimates made by the local authorities concerned to the then Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.  This funding was made available to the local authorities via the OPW based on programmes of works submitted by the local authorities.  The Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Agriculture, Food and the Marine were responsible for the approval of programmes of work and the disbursement of funding for repair of other damaged public infrastructure such as roads, piers, harbours and other community facilities and amenities.<\/p><p>The identification and assessment of problems of flooding or damage to properties due to ongoing coastal erosion is a matter for local authorities in the first instance.  If the local authority can identify an economically and environmentally viable solution to address the problem through improving coastal defence infrastructure or some alternative measures then it is open to it to undertake that work using its own resources or, if that is not feasible, to apply for funding under the OPW's Minor Works scheme.  Any application received will be assessed under the scheme's eligibility criteria.  I would emphasise that the Minor Works scheme is not a grant scheme for individual householders and is not operated in that way. It is a funding mechanism between OPW and local authorities to enable the latter to undertake smaller scale, localised works.  All applications must be received from the local authority and, if funding is approved, the works must be organised, contracted and paid for directly by the local authority.  Under the scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost up to &euro;500,000 in each instance.  Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects, with the balance being funded by the local authority concerned.  Local authorities submit funding applications in the prescribed format, which are then assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific technical, economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost benefit assessment.

The official agencies performing these controls include the Health Service Executive (HSE), the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM), Local Authorities, Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) and National Standards Authority of Ireland.  Authorised officers work with food businesses to raise standards and ensure compliance with food Regulations.<\/p>  <p>  During 2015, 36,353 official control inspections were carried out in HSE Environmental Health Service supervised establishments; 15,011 inspections were carried out in DAFM supervised establishments; 5,033 inspections were carried out in Local Authority supervised establishments; and 2,015 inspections were carried out in SFPA supervised establishments.<\/p>  <p>  During 2015, 25,649 labelling inspections were carried out in HSE-supervised establishments.  7,587 of these resulted in labelling infringements (Beef Labelling - 2,117; Country of Origin for Beef - 751; Fish Labelling - 237; and General Labelling - 4,482).<\/p>  <p>  The FSAI monitors the Irish market to ensure that foods not authorised for irradiation are not offered for sale within the EU and that those authorised for sale are labelled correctly.  In 2015, no breaches were identified in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, the FSAI coordinated the sampling and analysis of 48 food samples (maize, soya and rice) by the HSE's Environmental Health Service and the Public Analyst Laboratories respectively, for the authorised presence and appropriate labelling of genetically modified food ingredients.  Four of the samples analysed (two containing maize and two containing soybean) were found to contain authorised GM ingredients at below the labelling threshold.<\/p>  <p>  In other official agencies' inspections, food labels are checked at production and processor level as part of routine food controls.<\/p>  <p>  The DAFM Egg and Poultry Inspectorate is responsible for controls in barn egg producers, free range producers and egg packing centres.  This inspectorate is also responsible for verification of compliance with the marketing standards for eggs and poultry from primary production through to retail.

Checks are carried out at primary production, retail and processor level to ensure compliance.<\/p>  <p>  The FSAI advice line responds to consumer and industry concerns on food issues, including labelling.  Labelling complaints amounted to 192 in 2015 and 221 in 2016.  One of the most common queries in 2016 was in respect of legislation on food labelling requirements.  A large proportion of the calls to the Advice Line in 2015 (1,900) sought advice on food labelling.

The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation on 9 December 2016.  The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug and did not recommend it for reimbursement.<\/p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: .<\/p><p>The HSE considers the NCPE assessment, and other expert advice, as part of its decision-making process for reimbursement, which is made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.<\/p><p>The HSE has confirmed that the drug Respreeza was considered by the HSE Drugs Group, which did not make a recommendation for reimbursement on clinical grounds.  The HSE Leadership team has accepted the Drugs Group recommendation of non-reimbursement.<\/p><p>Under the HSE statutory assessment process, the HSE is required to set out a notice of any proposed decision to an applicant company.  The HSE is legally required to provide at least a 28 day period (from the formal written notice of proposal), to enable the company to consider any such proposal not to reimburse and to make representations to the HSE if it wishes to do so.  The HSE is required to consider any such representations in advance of a formal decision.<\/p><p>Therefore, as the statutory process is still ongoing, the company has an opportunity to have further discussions with the HSE.<\/p><p>In relation to the compassionate access scheme operated by the manufacturer I note its decision to extend the scheme by a further two months.  However it is important to point out that the operation of compassionate schemes is at the discretion of manufacturers.  As Minister for Health I have no role in the operation of these schemes.  There is no provision in Irish legislation for the approval of compassionate use programmes for specific groups of patients with an unmet medical need.<\/p><p>I have previously said that any attempts by manufacturers to link continued access, for patients already being treated with a new medicine, with decisions under the statutory reimbursement process is both inappropriate and unethical.  Manufacturers should operate such schemes in a compassionate and not a commercially-motivated manner.  There should be no link between compassionate use schemes and reimbursement decisions and manufacturers should be open with patients and clinicians from the outset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900073#WRM01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision","counter":562,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900073#WRM02000"},{"type":"question","counter":563,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[12482\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900073#WRM02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the HSE national counselling service (details supplied) has plans to recruit counsellors and persons qualified in psychotherapy for the provision of services in the Cork area; if so, the details; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":564,"content":"<p>As this is a service issue, this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900073#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Long-Term Illness Scheme Coverage","counter":565,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900073#WRM02300"},{"type":"question","counter":566,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[12487\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900073#WRM02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to make available the FreeStyle Libre device to children with diabetes that currently hold a long-term illness card; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1220","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":567,"content":"<p>Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the HSE has statutory responsibility for the administration of the community drug schemes; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900073#WRM02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":568,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900073#WRM02600"},{"type":"question","counter":569,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[12488\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900073#WRM02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a hospital appointment in respect of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":570,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe.  Lyme disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe.<\/p>  <p>  Lyme disease can be very successfully treated using common antibiotics.  These antibiotics are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  Antibiotics are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may be considered. In Ireland, treatment by most clinicians is based on that laid out in evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis (formerly known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and babesiosis published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America in 2006.  <\/p>  <p>  A Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre has been established to look at methods of raising awareness especially in those areas (including recreation areas) where Lyme carrying ticks can be most expected to be found.

Its functions relate to the regulation of pharmacy services in Ireland (5,840 pharmacists, 1,900 pharmacies and 360 pharmaceutical assistants).  Under the Act, the PSI inter alia is responsible for the registration of pharmacists, pharmacies and pharmaceutical assistants and the education, training and continuing professional development of pharmacists, as well as the inspection of pharmacies, enforcement of medicines and pharmacy legislation and the operation of fitness to practise functions. <\/p>  <p>  These functions are funded by fees paid by registrants.  The setting of fees for the pharmacy profession is governed by the Act which requires the PSI to make an application for ministerial consent to any fees that it proposes to charge.  This process allows for the consideration, and examination, of the Society&rsquo;s fee proposals by my Department.  Following an extensive review fees were reduced by 10% in 2010 and most fees by a further 5% in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  The PSI receives the majority of its income from registration fees in the last quarter of each year (70%) and this income is reflected in the PSI Financial Statements for that year.  However, this income is required to enable the PSI to fulfil its statutory obligations under the Act in the following year.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the PSI superannuation scheme, the Department of Finance granted sanction in May 2008 to the PSI to operate, on an administrative basis, a superannuation scheme based on Public Service Model Scheme terms.  On 10 March 2016, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland Superannuation Scheme 2016 (S.I. 136 of 2016) was approved and signed by the Minister for Health with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER). The Scheme came into operation on that date.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the SI is to adopt the Rules set out in the Schedule to the Rules for Pre-existing Public Service Pension Scheme Members Regulations 2014 (S.I. No. 582 of 2014) as a scheme for the granting of superannuation benefits to the Registrar and staff of the PSI who are not members of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The PSI operates its superannuation scheme on a 'pay as you go' basis from existing cash reserves as well as from employer and employee superannuation contributions.  Contributions to the Scheme are currently held in a designated deposit account until such time as the funding mechanism is formally approved.  The amount held in the deposit account is reflected in the PSI cash balances.  The current value of the funds held on deposit is &euro;3.7m.  The approval of a funding model is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) and it is currently considering the appropriate funding mechanism which should apply.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the superannuation scheme and the funds held pending the approval of the funding mechanism by DPER are separate to PSI funds required to fulfil its statutory requirements under the Act.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900076#WRP00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":697,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900076#WRP00500"},{"type":"question","counter":698,"qnumday":253,"qnumall":"[12759\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900076#WRP00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if additional home help hours will be provided to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":699,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900076#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Suicide Incidence","counter":700,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900076#WRP00800"},{"type":"question","counter":701,"qnumday":254,"qnumall":"[12761\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900076#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons that died of suicide within 24 hours of being discharged from or having left St James's Hospital, the Mater Hospital, James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Beaumont Hospital or St. Vincent's Hospital for each of the past five years.

In 2011 my Department officials met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing a new sugar and bioethanol production\u00a0facility, using sugar beet,\u00a0in this country.  The figures published by the interested groups who are investigating the possibility of building a new facility, indicate that the overall capital costs involved could range from &euro;250 million to &euro;400 million, depending on what type of facility will be constructed. <\/p>  <p>  My Department officials informed both groups at the time and many times since\u00a0that any venture to develop a combined sugar\/bioethanol production facility in Ireland, would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by a\u00a0sufficiently robust business case\u00a0in order\u00a0to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required.  My Government colleague Minister Coveney clearly informed both groups at the time that it was his job to look for agreement at EU level to allow for the growing of sugar beet for the manufacture of sugar, at the earliest possible date.  In this connection, he secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package at the final EU Council of Agriculture Ministers, which he chaired in June 2013, to abolish all sugar quotas by 30 September 2017.  This agreement removes, with effect from 1 October 2017, the current EU quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member State's, wishing to re-establish a sugar industry. <\/p>  <p>  The current\u00a0Programme for a Partnership Government makes clear that &ldquo;State enterprise bodies will be asked to examine any substantial business plans related to rebuilding the industry with a view to considering appropriate State supports&rdquo;.  The opportunity remains therefore for\u00a0interested parties to move the project forward and to garner sufficient commercial and financial support to turn their plans into a viable reality.<\/p>  <p>  Through the EU Research and Innovation funding stream currently called the Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking - ongoing for the period 2014-2020 - there is the possibility to submit proposals for evaluation to a competitive funding process in relation to, inter alia, producing industrial chemicals from sugar beet.\u00a0 This Joint Undertaking is a &euro;3.7 billion Public-Private Partnership between the EU and the Bio-based Industries Consortium.\u00a0 The programme operates under Horizon 2020, the EU Funding Programme for research and innovation, and it is driven by the Vision and Strategic Innovation and Research Agenda (SIRA) developed by the Biobased Industry Consortium.<\/p>  <p>  Proposals to the\u00a0 Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking may cover research and innovation, pilot and demonstration and flagship actions.\u00a0 The annual work plan for the Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking indicates the topics eligible for funding each year.\u00a0 This plan is now available for 2017.\u00a0 The call for proposals will open in April and submissions must be made by early September 2017 with indicative results of proposal evaluations provided in December 2017.<\/p>  <p>  A number of Irish participants have so far accessed the EU funding opportunity under the Bio Based Industries Joint Undertaking.

In general terms an eligible hectare is one that is used for an agricultural activity or, where the area is also used for a non-agricultural activity, is predominantly used for such activities.  An area is predominantly used for agricultural activity if that activity can be exercised without being significantly hampered by the intensity, nature, duration and timing of the non-agricultural activity.<\/p>  <p>  While cases involving solar panels will be examined on an individual basis, it is currently envisaged that the area covered by the solar panels will be deemed ineligible for the purposes of claiming BPS.  Furthermore, in line with the Department&rsquo;s current approach on land eligibility, where the area of a parcel covered by solar panels is 70% or greater of the overall parcel, that parcel will be wholly ineligible.  If less than 70% is covered by solar panels and the agricultural activity is not hampered by the presence of the solar panels, the area not covered by solar panels may be eligible.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to entitlements it is important to note that a farmer must use all entitlements every two years.  Therefore if the land is deemed ineligible for BPS the farmer would lose the entitlements after two years unless he (a) got more land (b) leased out his entitlements or (c ) sold the entitlements.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that all agricultural land used to claim BPS must be owned\/leased, used and managed by the applicant.  If the applicant is not the owner of the land, they must have a lease or rental agreement in place with the owner of the land.

","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":772,"content":"<p>As a small open economy, Ireland supports trade liberalisation and recognises the benefits of trade agreements with third countries which can potentially give rise to increased exports and job creation.  However such agreements must be balanced and must serve both our offensive and defensive interests. This does not, of course, obviate the need to have regard to the potential impact of\u00a0particular trade deals on sensitive sectors such as the beef sector.  <\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless I \u00a0welcome the Commission&rsquo;s latest study particularly as it takes in a broad range of examples.  It used the EU trade agreements with Mexico (\"first generation\" trade agreement), South Korea (new generation Deep and Comprehensive Trade Agreement DCFTA) and Switzerland (specific sectorial agreements) and this gives a balanced overview\u00a0of such agreements.  <\/p>  <p>  The study shows that the agreements contributed to increased trade in both directions, with increased EU exports and increased imports of products from these three countries, giving EU consumers and business greater access to agri-food products.  Importantly, it suggests that these increased imports have little impact on domestic EU production. Instead, they reflect mainly a replacement of imports from other third countries or an increase in EU consumption.<\/p>  <p>  The study underlines the importance of closely following the trade negotiations of the EU's main competitors to make sure that the EU does not fall behind in access conditions to important markets for agri-food products.  It also shows that more recently, ambitious agreements such as the EU-Korea trade deal, which entered into force in 2011, have a higher positive impact than older and less comprehensive agreements like the 2000 EU-Mexico agreement.  This is a sign of the increasing quality and effectiveness of EU trade agreements in terms of removing barriers and of the success of the sector in improving competitiveness.  <\/p>  <p>  The study also emphasises the importance of EU promotion and information campaigns in helping EU exporters access new markets and grow their businesses in existing markets.  The pursuit and development of new markets for Irish agri-food exports is of course an ongoing and central component of the strategic development of the agri-food sector, as evidenced by its placement right at the centre of Food Wise 2025, the industry&rsquo;s strategy for development over the coming decade.  Indeed, this is all the more relevant after the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU, which presents significant new challenges for the agri-food sector in particular.  <\/p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 outlines the huge potential for growth in agri-food exports to new and emerging markets, particularly in Asia, Africa and the Gulf region.  This is where our efforts will be focused for the foreseeable future, particularly given the need to diversify our markets and to reduce our reliance on traditional destinations such as the UK.  <\/p>  <p>  Overall this study illustrates the potential for European agriculture products to increase exports even within the existing scope of the trade agreements.  The additional export demand enhanced by trade agreements could translate into an important source of growth, jobs and value added for the Irish and European agricultural and food sectors.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900077#WRQ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Payments","counter":773,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900077#WRQ03000"},{"type":"question","counter":774,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[12622\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900077#WRQ03100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if a GLAS payment for 2016 due to a person (details supplied) will be paid out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":775,"content":"<p>The person named was approved into GLAS 2 with a contract commencement date of 1 January 2016.\u00a0<\/p><p>The 85% advance payment for 2016 has been processed and payment has issued to the person named.

The CAP has demonstrated its capacity to evolve very effectively in response to changing market, consumer and environmental demands in recent years, to the point where it now plays a central role in delivering the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth sought under the Europe 2020 strategy. <\/p>  <p>  It is vitally important that the CAP continues its market orientation, and to evolve in a way that supports the achievement of European strategic objectives.  This will help to reinforce the relevance and effectiveness of the policy, and to secure a strong CAP budget for the period post-2020.<\/p>  <p>  The Maltese Presidency identified a number of priorities for the future CAP, based on recent discussions, and which formed the basis of the discussion at Council.  These priorities are - building resilience; responding to environmental challenges; investing in rural viability and vitality; ensuring generational renewal; maintaining a market orientation; and, strengthening farmers&rsquo; position.<\/p>  <p>  These priorities largely coincide with what Ireland views as the key challenges ahead.  In our view, the overriding priority must be to support the sustainable intensification of food production, in order to meet the requirements of a growing global population while at the same time facilitating adaptation to climate change and mitigation against further change.<\/p>  <p>  This can be achieved by sharpening the focus on outcomes, and by reducing the regulatory and audit burdens on Member States and farmers as they implement measures to achieve these outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of addressing these priorities, I am of the view that a more holistic approach is needed. For example, in the case of sustainable intensification, Member States need to be able to identify objectives, such as the production of food in an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable way, and then be allowed to implement measures which will enable them to achieve those objectives.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Beef Data &amp;amp; Genomics Programme is a good example of a measure that achieves multiple objectives (improving efficiency, profitability and sustainability) while not fitting neatly within the existing, somewhat restrictive, regulatory framework.  A greater focus on outcomes combined with Member State flexibility on the means to achieve them would help to address this problem.<\/p>  <p>  This holistic approach can equally be applied to our efforts to build farmer resilience in the face of market volatility.  The use modern and innovative measures such as futures markets, fixed price contracts and hedging arrangements have a role to play, but the direct payments system provides stability and certainty for farmers in the face of market volatility and should remain a key component of the CAP, as should other useful existing measures such as intervention, which has proven very effective in dealing with recent market difficulties.<\/p>  <p>  However, in order to achieve these priorities, it is important that a strong CAP budget is maintained.  The future of the CAP budget will be discussed in the context of the Multiannual Financial Framework for the post-2020 period.  It is expected that the CAP budget will come under increasing pressure, which will be compounded further by the loss of the UK&rsquo;s contribution to the EU budget.  It will be important therefore to ensure that there is a commensurate CAP budget in place post-2020 in order for the new CAP to achieve its objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900078#WRR00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Appeals","counter":799,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900078#WRR00900"},{"type":"question","counter":800,"qnumday":291,"qnumall":"[12631\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900078#WRR01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of an appeal in respect of a national reserve application for a person (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":801,"content":"<p>The person named submitted applications under the &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; category of the 2015 National Reserve and the Young Farmers Scheme.

For the last number of months\u00a0Government has been actively engaged in assessing the impact of the Brexit vote, consulting with appropriate stakeholders and engaging with the relevant politicians and institutions to ensure that our priorities are well understood by those likely to be in a position of influence in the course of the negotiations.  This work is being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  The agrifood sector is of critical importance to our economy and its regional spread means it underpins the socio-economic development of rural areas in particular.  The sector employed approximately 173,000 people (i.e. 8.6% of total employment) in 2016, and the total value of agrifood exports was almost &euro;12.2 billion.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU reinforces the need to develop as many outlets for our agrifood exports as possible, in order to minimise our dependence on any one market.  Indeed this principle of market development is already a key component of Food Wise 2025.  We have been very active in recent years in efforts to diversify markets, and in aiming to respond to consumer demands in emerging markets.<\/p>  <p>  While Ireland exported some &euro;2.4 billion worth of beef to approximately 70 countries last year, I am still very cognisant of the need both to expand the number of beef markets but also to enhance existing market access given the current exposure to the UK beef market.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the beef market access, 2016 saw the extension of our access to the US, as well as the opening of the Canadian, New Zealand and Israeli beef markets.  So far 2017 has seen the re-opening of the Egyptian market to Irish beef although we need to complete the remaining technical steps before the resumption of beef exports.  The recent Trade Mission to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates saw the extension of our beef access to Saudi Arabia following a period of detailed engagement with the Saudi Arabian Food and Drug Authority (SFDA).  Priorities in terms of market access for 2017 include further advancing beef access to China which is a very high priority.  The Department is also pursuing beef access to a number of other Third Countries including South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand and Ukraine, and is working to simplify certification procedures in a number of markets to which we already have access.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to dairy, Irish dairy products have a highly rated and hard earned reputation in terms of quality, safety and sustainability, and this gives them a competitive edge in markets over the world.  My Department, in conjunction with other stakeholders, including the Irish dairy companies and agencies such as Bord Bia, are playing a key role in building the market for Irish dairy.  In 2016 Ireland exported dairy products to over 130 countries.  Against the backdrop of our efforts to significantly increase dairy output and grow the sector, export market diversification is obviously of the upmost importance, and this is particularly true in the context of a post-Brexit scenario.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Irish seafood industry Brexit poses a very significant threat.  On average, over one third of our current landings are from inside the UK zone.  While some benefits may accrue in terms of increasing market share in EU Member States, overall these will be more than offset by three main threats - (i) loss of access, (ii) substantial loss of quota share and (iii) displacement into our zone &ndash;as well as a high level of uncertainty in the short term.  The Irish fishing industry is focussed on these three threats.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also working on expanding\u00a0market access for sheepmeat, pigmeat, poultry and cooked meats across a range of markets.  On sheepmeat the market in Iran opened in 2016.  Access to China is a high priority for the industry but cannot be gained until after beef access with China has been progressed further.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that I consider it vitally important that our key message of remaining as close as possible to the current trading arrangements is heard and understood across Europe, and for that reason the extensive consultations currently being undertaken with our EU counterparts at political and official levels will continue, and indeed intensify, over the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900078#WRR04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agrifood Sector","counter":835,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900078#WRR04500"},{"type":"question","counter":836,"qnumday":303,"qnumall":"[12723\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900078#WRR04600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he continues to encourage the growth of the food producing sector here in line with general economic expansion and the success of this sector over the past number of years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":837,"content":"<p>Food Wise 2025, the ten year strategy for the agrifood sector, identifies\u00a0opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy to\u00a0allow the sector to grow and prosper.

Growth prospects for the sector are positive overall, driven by increased consumer interest in the provenance of food, environmental concerns, health and a desire to support the local economy.\u00a0 While the possible impact of the UK referendum on consumer sentiment remains to be seen, it is estimated that the sector may have grown in value to &euro;700 million in 2016, including &euro;500 million in this jurisdiction.<\/p>  <p>  Artisan and speciality food businesses can have a significant impact on local economies as businesses are typically owner managed and may be closely linked to local farms.\u00a0Recognising the\u00a0value of the sector and its development and employment potential, FoodWise 2025 recommended\u00a0actions to support it,\u00a0including festival markets, a pipeline for new entrants to the Artisan Food Market at Bloom, promoting meet the buyer opportunities, delivery of small business specific consumer and market insights, and programmes to assist producers to extend business reach. A number of artisan businesses have participated in\u00a0Food Academy (developed by Bord Bia, Local Enterprise Offices and Musgraves\/Supervalu and delivering growth and jobs) and Food Works (developed by Bord Bia, Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland for start-up food entrepreneurs). <\/p>  <p>  The farmhouse cheese sector alone includes over 50 cheese makers producing more than 150 types of cheese valued at over &euro;12 million a year\u00a0at farm gate level.

Inspections, both announced and unannounced, are undertaken on a regular basis to ensure that the requirements of the Act are strictly adhered to. These inspections are scheduled on both a random and targeted basis. My Department also operates an anonymous helpline through which members of the public can express animal welfare concerns.

There is a greater awareness of the value of slurry which is being used to replace nutrients as chemical fertiliser prices increased. Farmers would benefit from using the cheaper ureic form of Nitrogen- Urea fertiliser, which has a price advantage over calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) per unit of nitrogen. <\/p>  <p>  Teagasc has identified that soil pH has a large influence on nutrient availability with 64% of grassland soils below optimum pH. Grassland soils can release up to 80 kg N\/ha per year when soils are at optimum pH. This can be achieved by the application of ground limestone based on soil analysis results.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900079#WRS01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Fisheries Policy","counter":861,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900079#WRS01350"},{"type":"question","counter":862,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[12733\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900079#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which EU fishing conservation measures have affected the industry here, with particular reference to employment in the industry and competition from elsewhere; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":863,"content":"<p>The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) provides the framework for the long term sustainability of fish stocks around our shores, the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processing industry while supporting our families and communities that depend on the sea for their livelihood.<\/p>  <p>  A key element of the CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield). This should ultimately lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns.

This is being phased in gradually and is due to be complete by 2020 at the latest for all stocks.\u00a0\u00a0 This will result in more fish being left in the sea to mature and reproduce leading to increased abundance of fish, and over time to higher quotas for Irish fishermen. <\/p>  <p>  The EU Commission has noted that the state of fish stocks in European Atlantic and nearby waters continues to improve which I believe indicates that we are continuing to see the benefits of prudent and responsible fisheries management practices. <\/p>  <p>  The ongoing implementation the \u00a0landing obligation, which began in 2015 will also contribute to an improvement in the state of the stocks of importance to Ireland and will result in increased fishing opportunities for the Irish fishing industry.<\/p>  <p>  My overarching goal for fisheries is to ensure a sustainable, profitable and self reliant industry that protects and enhances the social and economic fabric of rural coastal communities dependent on the seafood sector, while balancing these objectives with the need to safeguard fish stocks for future generations.

Launched last year, the Action Plan for Education 2016 &ndash; 2019 contains a range of actions to be implemented with a particular focus on identifying and addressing the skills needs of employers in skills areas such as engineering and STEM related skills demands.  The National Skills Strategy 2025 also launched in 2016, contains over 140 Actions, a number of which of which are aimed at identifying and addressing skills shortages across various sectors including engineering and STEM related skills demands.<\/p>  <p>  The 9 Regional Skills Fora have been established and a Regional Skills Manager has been appointed to lead the activities of each Forum.  The Managers have established a strong network of working relationships between the relevant stakeholders in the region, with particular focus on liaison between enterprise and education and training providers in advancing the objectives of each Forum which include addressing identified skills demands by using evidence based data in the various sectors in each Region.  <\/p>  <p>  The expert report on education in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) in Irish primary and post-primary schools was published in November 2016 by the STEM Education Review Group.  The report presents a detailed examination of the provision of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education in Ireland.  One of the recommendations of the report is for the development of an integrated National STEM Education Policy Statement by end June 2017 and that this Policy Statement should include a detailed implementation plan with responsibilities and timelines clearly outlined.  <\/p>  <p>  Within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, significant improvements have been made in the planning and funding of provision since the publication of the FET Strategy in 2014.  Education and Training Boards engage in a service planning process annually against a range of detailed parameters set by SOLAS.  This process has been refined and improved each year and includes the use of strengthened labour market data provided by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit to ensure that the skill needs of learners and enterprise are met.  <\/p>  <p>  The FET Services Plan published by SOLAS each year since 2014 sets out measures to address FET skill needs in line with labour market and EGFSN forecasts.  ETBs are currently reviewing existing provision for the purpose of matching capacity with potential demand for specific programmes e.g. apprenticeship, engineering, entrepreneurship and IT.  This will also enable the realignment of course provision to meet identified skills needs.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was initiated by SOLAS in collaboration with the ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice.  The Career Traineeship model of work-based learning is currently being piloted with the Hospitality and Engineering sectors, with the involvement of seven ETBs.<\/p>  <p>  Funding is provided to the Higher Education Institutions to support summer camps in Computer Science for second level students.  The aim of the camps is to encourage more students to take up Computer Science at third level.  In 2016, 29 camps were funded accommodating over 1,245 students.  Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) computing departments are centrally involved in supporting coder dojos, providing facilities to host dojos, third level computing students to run clubs and lecturers to provide mentoring strategies.  HEIs link their computing camps and computing outreach activities to Coder dojo activities and use these to foster greater links with secondary schools within their region.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 provided for an additional &euro;1 million to support 200 places on Level 9 ICT conversion courses for graduates of non ICT courses to convert to this skill shortage area.<\/p>  <p>  All Higher Education Institutions work within their own region to promote STEM courses examples include Limerick for IT and Limerick for Engineering where organisers host events aimed at second level students and their parents with invited industry and higher education institution representatives to promote STEM as a career.<\/p>  <p>  The Higher Education Authority has recently issued a further Call for course proposals to be funded under Springboard+ 2017.  Springboard+ provides jobseekers with free part-time upskilling and reskilling higher education opportunities in areas of identified skills need to include skills shortages in STEM.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the employment of non-EEA nationals, the State's general policy is to promote the sourcing of labour and skills needs from within the workforce of Ireland and the European Economic Area (EEA).  The employment permits system, which the Department Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation \u00a0administers, is intended to offer an interim solution for employers where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA.  <\/p>  <p>  The system offers a conduit into the Irish labour market for non-EEA nationals with in-demand skills and is operated as a vacancy-led system.  Vacancies must be for eligible occupations &ndash; the system is ordered by the use of lists which determine which occupations are highly demanded and which are ineligible for consideration for employment permits.  <\/p>  <p>  Changes to access to the Irish labour market for specific occupations via the employment permits system are made on the basis of research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) in tandem with a consultation process, as part of a package of measures to meet those skills needs.  Such changes are made on the basis of bi-annual reviews, which include a public consultation process.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Non-EEA engineering professionals with specified skills in electrical, electronics, mechanical, design and development, and production and process, as well as material scientists are currently included on the Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List for employment permits, which means that such professionals may be granted Critical Skills Employment Permits if they choose to work in this State.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Critical Skills Employment Permits confer a number of benefits to their holders which are additional to those offered by other employment permit types, including immediate access to the Irish labour market for specified family members.

I understand that information on children's absences from care is being collected in all administrative areas, and is being used in service and care planning for children in care.  However, it may not be collated in the manner referred to by the Deputy.  I have asked Tusla, the Child and Family Agency for the information and I will respond to you when their reply has been received.<\/p>  <p>  A child in care would be expected to have an Absence Management Plan.  This is used to assess the risk in the event of a child going missing and the action to be taken.  A child in care is considered to be missing when his or her whereabouts are unknown and the Absence Management Plan indicates concern for the child&rsquo;s safety.  For example, a child in care can be subject to curfews as part of their placement plan that reflect their ability to keep themselves safe.  It should be remembered that most children in care live in family settings in the community.<\/p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that I have been assured that there is strong inter-agency co-operation to promote the safety and welfare of children who are reported missing from care.  In this regard, a Joint Protocol between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, sets out the procedure to be followed in the event that a child in care goes missing.  Children in care are recognised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla as being among the most vulnerable in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900082#WRV04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Requests","counter":1032,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900082#WRV04850"},{"type":"question","counter":1033,"qnumday":376,"qnumall":"[12770\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900082#WRV05100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the number of freedom of information requests received\u00a0by her Department on which the Office of the Chief State Solicitor has incurred expenses for each of the past three years and to date in 2017; and the amount of fees for counsel and other legal costs incurred respectively, for each of the past three years and to date in 2017.","asker":"1226","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1034,"content":"<p>There has never been any involvement of the Chief State Solicitor's Office in any Freedom of Information requests received by my Department.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900082#WRV05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":1036,"qnumday":377,"qnumall":"[12772\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900082#WRV05400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of freedom of information requests received\u00a0by his Department on which the Office of the Chief State Solicitor has incurred expenses for each of the past three years and to date in 2017; and the amount of fees for counsel and other legal costs incurred respectively, for each of the past three years and to date in 2017.","asker":"1226","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":1037,"content":"<p>My Department has not received any Freedom of Information requests in the past three years in which the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office had any involvement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030900082#WRV05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"}]
