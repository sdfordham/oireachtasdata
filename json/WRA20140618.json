The EAG's report was accepted by Government in 1995. <\/p><p>  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA).  In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces.  This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct.  Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. <\/p><p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the PDF after 1 January, 1994.  A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.<\/p><p>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:<\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service. <\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.<\/p><p>- Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.<\/p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks.  A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter.  In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  I understand that discussions are taking place with the Representative Association under a special Subcommittee of Conciliation Council.  As discussions are confidential to the parties involved in accordance with the terms of the Scheme, I do not in any way want to prejudice them or impact on their outcome. <\/p><p>  However, I do understand the concerns it raises for enlisted personnel due to be discharged in terms of their personal circumstances and the impact on their families.  I am sure that all matters raised by PDFORRA on behalf of their members are being comprehensively examined at Conciliation Council.  I am also cognisant of the need for continuing recruitment to the Defence Forces of young and fit men and women so that the Defence Forces can discharge all the roles assigned to them by Government, both at home and overseas.  It was for this very reason that this policy was introduced in the first place. <\/p><p>  As the negotiation process with the Representative Association is very much ongoing, I would not like to pre-empt or second guess the outcome of current discussions at Conciliation Council, and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this issue publicly at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800067#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[25796\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800067#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"his views regarding compulsory random drug testing of Defence Forces personnel; and his plans to amend the penalty of dismissal which has been considered disproportionate, particularly in relation to problems with the reliability of the test.","asker":"1192","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>In October 2002 the Defence Forces introduced a Compulsory Random Drug Testing programme.  The primary objective of Compulsory Random Drug Testing is deterrence.  The Defence Forces policy on drug and substance abuse or misuse is based on the premise that unlawful possession, supply or use of a controlled drug is incompatible with membership of the Defence Forces.  Drug and substance abuse, because of its insidious nature, and because of the possible residual effects on the abuser, is particularly dangerous in the military environment and incompatible with military life.  Military personnel are entrusted with the responsibility of using firearms and other lethal equipment.  Drug misuse has serious implications for the safety of members of the public as well as fellow soldiers.  The nature of military service, therefore, requires that military personnel are free from the presence or influence of any controlled drug or substance.  All members of the Defence Forces are aware that they are liable for testing.  Any member who tests positive is liable to be removed from the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>  The compulsory random drug testing process focuses on providing a credible and robust deterrent.  The random nature of testing ensures that there is a fair system of monitoring members of the Defence Forces and involves the provision of a urine sample.  Any sample that initially tests unclear is sent to accredited drug testing laboratories for more detailed analysis.  I am advised by the military authorities that there are no issues with regard to the reliability of the testing. <\/p><p>  Each case involving a positive drug test is individually considered on its merits.  An effective appeals mechanism is in place.  Only in appropriate circumstances is an administrative discharge decided upon.

While some progress has been made by the Military Authorities in addressing gaps between male and female participation in the Defence Forces, it is recognised that more work needs to be done to meet the gender target for recruitment of females of 20% which was set by the Military Authorities in 2007.  <\/p><p>As at 30 April 2014, the latest date for which figures are available there were 555 women out of a total strength of 9,110 serving in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF).  This represents 6.1% of the overall strength of the Defence Forces. <\/p><p>A number of specific initiatives have been implemented to increase female participation in the Defence Forces including:<\/p><p>- the introduction of best practices in recruitment, such as the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants,<\/p><p>- special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment,<\/p><p>- there is balanced composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards,<\/p><p>- all promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit,<\/p><p>- a Gender Adviser has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces. <\/p><p>Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties.  Women, therefore, play a full and meaningful role in all aspects of Defence Forces operations at home and overseas.<\/p><p>The Defence Forces also prides itself on providing a gender neutral working environment.  Policies on equality are being constantly communicated to all ranks.  The Military Authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing this matter in a continuing and proactive manner when it arises.<i><\/i>However, a key impediment in achieving the target gender balance is the lack of female applicants relative to males. <\/p><p>I believe that there is a need to continue to develop and promote strategies that not alone support increased female participation in the Defence Forces but also support increased diversity. The personnel profile of the Defence Forces should reflect the changing demographic and multicultural nature of Irish Society.  To this end, as part of the recent recruitment campaign for enlisted personnel and the Reserve, specific efforts were made to increase the number of female applicants.  This was part of a wider campaign aimed at improving gender and ethnic representation and diversity in the Defence Forces.  In the case of female participation, these efforts included school visits, media engagement including national and local radio, targeting sports clubs and use of social media.  At the closing date for this recruitment campaign on 9 April 2014 there were 755 Female applicants or 10.3% out of a total of 7,295 applicants for the Permanent Defence Force and 320 female applicants or 14.9% out of a total of 2,146 applicants for the Reserve Defence Force.  On the face of it these figures appear to be disappointing. However, I believe that a key issue in recruiting and retaining female personnel lies in societal perception and attitudes to female soldiers and officers.  Much of the solution to this lies outside the control and influence of the Defence Forces.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800067#WRA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naval Service Vessels","counter":25,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800067#WRA01950"},{"type":"question","counter":26,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[25609\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800067#WRA02000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the consideration that has been given by his Department to additional replacements and further modernisation of the naval fleet; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1058","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":27,"content":"<p>A Defence Forces vessel replacement strategy has been in progress since 2007.

The properties in question comprise a terrace of 16 houses.  Three of the houses had previously been reconfigured by combining adjacent houses with the result that there are now 13 individual units in the terrace overall.<\/p><p>  The assessment indicates that, in order to be viable for military purposes as multi-occupancy Single-Living-In accommodation, adjacent properties would best be combined to give a smaller number of larger units.  The assessment also indicates that the properties are in a very poor state of repair and that the estimated cost of repairs necessary to make them suitable as accommodation is simply prohibitive.<\/p><p>  While the outcome of the assessment is still under consideration it is clear that any renovation would be very costly, would only deliver around half the number of viable units and would be very limited in terms of future military needs.  At this stage, this is not considered to be a cost effective solution to meeting accommodation needs in the Curragh.<\/p><p>  This assessment was undertaken as the block overall appeared to be structurally sound and contained a sizeable number of houses, the majority of which were vacant.  Given the outcome of the assessment in this case there appears to be little prospect that the outcome would be much different were other individual or small groups of houses assessed.  Consequently there are no plans to expand the assessment to include all residential units in the Camp.<\/p><p>  The Curragh Camp is a key military installation.

Therefore, there is no way of providing this information without examining every medical record of every person discharged.  In January 2011 the Department established a working group to examine the use of Lariam and other anti-malarial drugs in the Defence Forces.  The Group comprises military and civil officials and representatives from the State Claims Agency and the Chief State Solicitors Office.  <\/p><p>  The purpose of this Group was to review issues arising in relation to the use of Lariam, particularly in the context of the current and potential litigation; to review and confirm the Defence Forces approach in relation to the use of malaria chemoprophylaxis in the Defence Forces; and to ensure that the procedures in relation thereto continue to be appropriate and in accordance with best medical practice as promulgated by the relevant medical authorities.  The work of the Group informs the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s process of ongoing risk assessment and mitigation in the context of a proactive Risk Management Strategy.<\/p><p>  The Group reported back to the previous Minister in June 2013.  The Report was produced in the context of current and potential litigation and is, therefore, legally privileged.

The Defence Forces Medical Corps complies with its guidelines on the prescription of medicines, including Lariam.  I am advised that Lariam is one of the most effective medications for protection against the type of malaria prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.  It continues to be licensed by the IMB.  The Defence Forces are fully aware of the range of reported side affects attaching to all anti-malaria medications.  I am advised that protocols are in place to control the risk of side effects in individuals.<\/p><p>  The Defence Forces follow best international practice in prescribing Lariam.  It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability, i.e. a medical risk assessment for Lariam is carried out on an individual basis.  This is intended to rule out personnel from overseas service with certain conditions, e.g. depression, anxiety, pregnancy, neurodegenerative disorders etc. which, as has been indicated by the IMB, are more likely to precipitate serious adverse reactions to Lariam.  Lariam remains licensed by the IMB and must remain in the formulary of medication prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800067#WRA03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800067#WRA03350"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":24,"qnumall":"[25804\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800067#WRA03400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"his plans to allow PDFORRA members in the Defence Forces to take up associate membership of the Irish Congress of Trades Unions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>There are no plans to allow PDFORRA to take up associate membership of ICTU.

The potential for serious difficulties and conflicts could arise in these circumstances if the Defence Forces Representative Associations were associated with, or affiliated to ICTU, given ICTU rules in relation to such matters.

Under the CCMA, if a borrower is not satisfied with the way that their lender is dealing with them or if they think the lender is not complying with the CCMA, the borrower can\u00a0make a complaint to their lender.

The existing provision for 10,575 SNA posts has been increased by 390 to 10,965 posts, which are being made available for allocation to the end of 2014, of which 10,656 posts are currently in place.  The increased provision will bring to almost 11,000 the number of SNA posts available to work with children who have an assessed care need requiring SNA support in primary, post primary, and special schools. This will ensure that the Department's policy of ensuring that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support.<\/p><p>  In June 2011, my Department published a Value for Money and Policy Review of the SNA scheme.  In May 2013, the National Council for Special Education published its Policy Advice on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools.  Both reports concluded that the SNA scheme has been highly successful in supporting the care needs of children with special needs in schools and with assisting to facilitate their integration and inclusion.  However, the reports also concluded that the intended purpose of the scheme was not always generally well understood by parents or schools and that the scope and purpose of the scheme should be clarified for schools.<\/p><p>  My Department accordingly prepared a new Circular for schools, which was designed to clarify the scope and purpose of the SNA scheme, in accordance with the recommendations of the reports and policy advice noted above. It should not be assumed that this will automatically lead to a reduction in SNA support for individual pupils, or for schools who have pupils who have continuing care needs.  The purpose of Circular 0030\/2014 which issued on 10th April last, is therefore to clarify the scope and purpose of the SNA scheme for schools, in accordance with the recommendations of these reports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800072#WRF00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"SOLAS Training and Education Programmes Administration","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800072#WRF00550"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[26208\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800072#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 175 of 8 April 2014, if he will provide an update on a matter (details supplied).","asker":"1057","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>I understand from SOLAS that following the closure of a Local Training Initiative in 2012, Statutory Redundancy was paid to the persons involved.

I recently approved a new short course in CSPE that has been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). This short course will be available to schools to implement from this September, should they wish to do so, as part of their Junior Cycle programme. This programme is in fact designed for 100 hours of teaching compared to less than 70 hours for the existing CSPE syllabus.<\/p><p>  The CSPE short course will be complemented at Senior Cycle by the introduction of 'Politics and Society' as a new optional Leaving Certificate subject.

It is proposed to include a new provision under section 13 of the Bill requiring public bodies to specify the posts that require an Irish language competency in their language schemes.  This amendment reflects a decision by Government to replace the policy of awarding bonus marks for Irish language proficiency in civil service recruitment and promotion competitions with a competency-based system whereby specified posts will have an Irish language proficiency requirement. <\/p><p>  In addition, as a result of the Government decision, the workforce plans of Departments will specify the posts\/areas of work which require functional bilinguals.

This process will be central to ensuring that future recruitment and inter-departmental promotion competitions run by the Public Appointments Service make sufficient provision for appointments to posts requiring functional bilinguals.

Applications to the value of some &euro;164 million in loans, were accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme. <\/p><p>  The figure of &euro;164 million includes &euro;111 million in respect of loans which were fully redeemed by local authorities with funding recouped from my Department, under the original terms of the Scheme.  The remaining &euro;53 million accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme is in the form of annuity loans, for which local authorities are making repayments to the Housing Finance Agency.  Such annuity repayments are recoupable from my Department subject to the local authority complying with terms of the Scheme. <\/p><p>  In 2013 as a consequence of continuing pressure on Exchequer resources, and following a review of the Scheme carried out in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it became evident that further expenditure on the Land Aggregation Scheme, in terms of accepting new applications into the Scheme, was no longer a sustainable option.  The review concluded with the issuance of Circular 35\/2013 on 11 December, 2013, notifying Local Authorities of the discontinuance of the Scheme in respect of new applications. <\/p><p>  The focus of the Scheme has now shifted to the management and utilisation of the lands included in the Scheme.  The Housing Agency is developing a strategy for the utilisation of transferred lands, which will involve consultation with the relevant local authority and other appropriate parties.  The development of this strategy is being progressed in the context of the new Social Housing Strategy, a Departmental commitment under Construction Strategy 2020.<\/p><p>  I recognise the cessation of the Land Aggregation Scheme presents challenges for some local authorities.  However, it is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources.  The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which includes adopting annual budgets, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority. <\/p><p>  Following the discontinuance of the Scheme, local authorities had been advised to consult with the Housing Finance Agency directly on the management of loans relating to lands not accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme.  I understand the Housing Finance Agency has made arrangements directly with some local authorities to extend interest-only arrangements to land acquisition loans, on maturity, for a further five years, after which they will revert to normal-course annuities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800079#WRN01500","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":292,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800080#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":293,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[26180\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800080#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide the cost to the Exchequer each year from 2009 to 2014 of the amount paid by his Department under the terms of settlements which included confidentiality agreements or confidentiality clauses.","asker":"998","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":294,"content":"<p>The information requested is set out in the following table. <\/p><p><b>Total annual payments by DECLG which included confidentiality agreements\/clauses in the terms of settlement<\/b><table><tr><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012*<\/th><th>2013*<\/th><th>2014<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;58,489<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><td>&euro;5,696,450<\/td><td>&euro;2,664,000<\/td><td>&euro;0<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>*&euro;8.3 million of the total payments in 2012 and 2013 related to a High Court judgement in respect of a land swap arrangement which, though subject to a confidentiality clause, subsequently came into the public domain under statutory reporting requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800080#WRO00400","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Development Initiatives","counter":295,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800080#WRO00450"},{"type":"question","counter":296,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[26192\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800080#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will consider allowing national organisations to tender for the social inclusion community activation programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":297,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[26193\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800080#WRO00700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will ensure the viability of the National Collective of Community Based Women's Networks into the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1001","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":298,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 111 together.<\/p><p>The proposals outlined in <i>Putting People First - Action Programme for Effective Local Government<\/i>seek to position local government &ldquo;as the primary vehicle of governance and public service at local level &ndash; leading economic, social and community development, delivering efficient and good value services, and representing citizens and local communities effectively and accountably&rdquo;.<\/p><p>As part of the programme of reform of local government, Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) are being established in all local authority areas.\u00a0These Committees, comprising public-private socio-economic interests, will have responsibility for local and community development programmes on an area basis.\u00a0They will develop, co-ordinate and implement a more coherent and integrated approach to local and community development than heretofore, with the aim of reducing\u00a0duplication and overlap and optimising the use of available resources for the benefit of citizens and communities.   <\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Local and Community Development Programme is the largest social inclusion intervention of its kind in the State.

Subsequently, some industry representatives have also contacted my Depart ment in relation to the issue.  <i>Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013<\/i>, building control authorities are designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the Construction Products Regulation (CPR) and<i><\/i>are responsible for the market surveillance of such products. Concrete blocks are covered by a harmonised European standard ( <i>EN 771-3 -2011-Aggregate concrete masonry units (dense and light weight aggregates)<\/i>and therefore come within the remit of the CPR.<\/p><p>The European Union (Construct ion Products) Regulations 2013 provide building control authorities with   a wide   rang e of powers to ensure that constructions products placed on the market comply with the requirements set out in the Construction Products Regulation. Such powers include the issuing of a notice to require corrective actions to be taken by an economic operator within a specified period of time and, in the event of a serious risk being identified, to request the nister to prohibit or restrict a construction product from being made available on the market, to withdraw it from the market or to recall it, or to make its use subject to special conditions as deemed appropriate.<\/p><p>On being advised of the problem the relevant market surveillance authority took immediate and appropriate action under the applicable legislation to deal with this issue. The authorised officer of the market surveillance authority involved visited the premises of the block manufacturer and requested detailed information as to the precise nature and extent of the problem including where the blocks had been supplied, the actions taken or being taken by the block manufacturer to deal with the problem as well as necessary documentation to demonstrate compliance with the harmonised European standard for blocks and with the requirements of the CPR.<\/p><p>It is understood that a small number of construction sites have been supplied with the affected blocks, that t he company is co-operating with the market surveillance authority and has supplied certain information on the extent of the problem, the actions being taken to provide for a resolution and compliance documentation. Additional information has been sought from the company to provide clarity o n a number of pertinent issues.   <\/p><p>My Department has written to the building control\/market surveillance authorities in whose functional areas the construction sites to which it is understood the blocks were supplied are located and advised them to visit the construction sites identified for the purposes of assessing whether the concrete blocks used in the construction works on these sites are &ldquo;proper materials&rdquo; within the meaning of Part D of the Building Regulations 1997, i.e. that they are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.<\/p><p>One of the developments involved is a social housing development of 25 dwellings commissioned by North and East Housing Association Ltd. in Moneymore, Drogheda, County Louth. As matters stand, it would appear that six houses in the development will have to be demolished due to the incorporation of defective blocks in the construction. Testing of the blocks on the six houses involved confirmed the presence of pyrite in the blocks and the solution is for demolition and rebuild. It is understood that the contractor and the concrete block manufacturer are co-operating in order to provide a resolution to the problem through the construction contracts. Further testing of the remaining 19 houses in the development is being carried out and these results are awaited to determine what, if any, remedial action will be needed in respect of the remaining houses. On completion of a satisfactory resolution to these matters, the 25 housing units in Moneymore will be made available for social housing purposes.<\/p><p>From the information available at this stage, it appears that testing has also been carried out in a small number of other developments identified as having been supplied with the affected blocks which has confirmed the presence of deleterious material (sulphates\/pyrite) in the blocks. My Department understands that in each case the costs of resolution are being pursued, in the first instance, with the relevant contractors and suppliers through the construction contracts. The actions taken thus far by the relevant parties involved suggest that the regulatory system is functioning effectively and that an appropriate means of redress is being pursued through those responsible for the building failure.<\/p><p>My Department will continue to work closely with the building control\/market surveillance authorities involved in dealing with this particular matter to monitor the situation. It will continue to provide whatever advice, guidance or clarifications as are required to ensure that the necessary actions are taken to resolve the problems identified and to safeguard against defective products being placed on the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800080#WRO02500","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800081#WRP00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800081#WRP00125"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[26178\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800081#WRP00200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if he will provide the cost to the Exchequer each year from 2009 to 2014 of the amount paid by his Department under the terms of settlements which included confidentiality agreements or confidentiality clauses.","asker":"998","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":319,"content":"<p>The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office and the State Claims Agency manage and provide legal representation in relation to all cases taken against the Minister for Defence.

The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act, 1927. The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members. The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps. The chairman and the non military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces. <\/p><p>  There have been two appointments to the Army Pensions Board since March 2011. A serving officer was appointed to the position of Army Medical Corps member of the Board in December 2011, and a civilian doctor was appointed as ordinary member in November 2013. <\/p><p>  The position of Army Medical Corps ordinary member became vacant due to retirement in 2011. The then Minister for Defence appointed Commandant Adam Lagun to the Board on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff. As the Army Pensions Act, 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, this position was not publicly advertised. Details of Commandant Lagun&rsquo;s appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;l on 13 January 2012.<\/p><p>  The civilian doctor vacancy was advertised on the Department of Defence website and the Public Appointments Service website. A number of expressions of interest in the position were received and an appointment to the Board was made on foot of this public advertisement process. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800081#WRP00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1072"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":324,"content":"<p>Question No. 123 answered with Question No. 11.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Strength","counter":325,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800082#WRQ00250"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[26332\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800082#WRQ00300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which it is expected to maintain the strength of the Defence Forces throughout the Army, Navy and Air Corps having particular regard to retirement that may now become due on foot of service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":327,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to a stabilised strength of 9,500 for the Permanent Defence Force.

The Air Corps operate a maintenance plan which endeavours to ensure that the maximum number of operational flying hours is available from aircraft when most needed. The maintenance of the Air Corps fleet falls into three broad categories: scheduled, unscheduled and routine\/daily. The use of Power by the Hour \/ Performance Based maintenance contracts assists the Air Corps in keeping downtime of aircraft to the minimum.

However, attempts to consider measures beyond those agreed in 2008 have been resisted and neither of the interim reports on the <i>2008 CAP Health Check Agreement,<\/i>in 2010 and 2012, proposed any further changes to the quota regime.<\/p><p>This year I have joined with my colleagues at each Agriculture Council meeting in pressing this matter and we submitted a proposal for the Commission to adjust the butterfat coefficients.  For super levy purposes, butterfat causes an adjustment to milk supply &ndash; the greater the differential between average butterfat (current levels) and reference fat levels (base fat), the greater the adjustment to milk intake levels.  The proposed solution is to reduce the positive butterfat co-efficient and increase the negative one to ensure fair distribution across MS.  Technically, this can be changed under Commission competency at Management Committee level.  The Commissioner has said they will not move on butterfat without majority support at Council, and unfortunately, there are enough countries opposed to any move on butterfat.  At Council last Monday we tried again to get agreement on a compromise but there was no qualified majority in favour.  Despite there being a blocking minority at this month&rsquo;s Council, I along with a number of Member States who share our views on soft landing succeeded in having the issue put on the agenda for the July Council, the first under the Italian Presidency.  In the meantime, we will be in contact with various countries in an attempt for an agreement which would bring about an adjustment to the fat co-efficient.  While I will continue to try and achieve measures to ensure a soft landing in the final year of the quota regime, but in the meantime dairy farmers must operate within the quota regulations until they expire in 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800085#WRT01200","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":402,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800086#WRU00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Victim Support Services","counter":401,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800086#WRU00150"},{"type":"question","counter":402,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[26170\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800086#WRU00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will report on the implementation of the recommendation of Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in its final report on the report of the independent commission of inquiry into the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973 that a Garda liaison officer be appointed to assist the victims and family members of the bombings.","asker":"998","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":403,"qnumday":150,"qnumall":"[26171\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800086#WRU00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"in line with the need to support victims and survivors of conflict, if consideration will be given to appoint a Garda liaison officer to work with all of those injured or bereaved due to political conflict.","asker":"998","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":404,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 and 150 together.<\/p><p>  The tragic human cost of the troubles on this island in terms of the lives lost, the people injured and the families bereaved, such as in the bombings in Dublin and Monaghan, is still felt to this very day.

However, I can tell the Deputy that in February 2014 there were approximately 900 judicial reviews involving individuals resident in Direct Provision accommodation. It should be noted that the actual number of persons residing in Direct Provision accommodation whose applications are subject to judicial review is a multiple of this figure because, for instance, as families are normally processed by ORAC, RAT and INIS together, a judicial review taken by a single member of a family will have the effect of holding up the processing of a number of persons in the system. <\/p><p>   With regard to the question of costs, the costs of judicial reviews and other legal costs from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) budget amounted to &euro;8.6m in 2011, &euro;6.3m in 2012 and &euro;5.8m in 2013.   While the downward trend in costs is very welcome, I am concerned with the overall high number of judicial reviews within the system. It is clear that the multi-layered and sequential processes associated with the current protection system and the related delays in finalising protection decisions are key contributors to those high numbers.<\/p><p>  In that regard, legislating to establish a single protection procedure is a priority in that it will provide the legislative framework for removing the structural delays which are a feature of our existing protection system.

In Ireland's case there are also considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account<i>. <\/i>Any significant departure from well established policies in this respect would have a major impact on the operation of the Common Travel Area both here and in the United Kingdom<i>.<\/i>It must also be emphasised that broad regularisation programmes are problematic, in particular as they could give rise to unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services. Clearly there would also be significant issues in allowing illegal immigrants access to the labour marker in the context of the very large number of people unemployed in the State. Similar issues would arise in respect of access to the housing market and its related supports, such as supplementary welfare payments, rent allowances and so forth.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that in very many instances the delay in finalising cases is due to applicants challenging negative decisions by initiating multiple judicial reviews at various stages of the process. Thousands of applications cannot be finalised because of these legal challenges. Moreover, many other failed protection applicants do not leave the State when subject to a Deportation Order even though the clear legal requirement is for them to leave the State.<\/p><p>Measures have recently been taken with a view to delivering improvements in the processing of protection applications. The Deputy may be aware that the European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 426 of 2013) were signed into law by my predecessor last November. Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection was transferred from my Department to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) with appeals to be dealt with by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT).  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals, respectively. Additional resources have been allocated to the establishment and operation of the new arrangements for the processing of these cases which include the engagement of a panel of legally qualified persons to process cases, personal interviews for each applicant at the first instance and the opportunity for an applicant to appeal a negative recommendation of the ORAC to the RAT. The ORAC, in consultation with the UNHCR, have recently published on its website details of how it will prioritise the process of scheduling persons for interview taking into account, inter-alia, dealing with applicants who are longest in the system first. The intention is to process as many of these cases to finality as soon as possible to include consideration of any leave to remain aspects arising.<\/p><p>The Government remains committed to immigration and protection reform as provided for under the Programme for Government and under the Government Legislation Programme. Legislating to provide the means for a single procedure and related issues to deal with all protection claims is of priority in that it will provide the framework for removing the structural delays which are a feature of our existing protection system. In that respect work by my officials on legislative reform in this area continues, including in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of the Parliamentary Counsel, with a view to bringing forward legislation this year . <b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b><b><font color=\"#000080\">  <\/font><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800088#WRW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":450,"content":"<p>Question No. 165 answered with Question No. 162.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":451,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800088#WRW01150"},{"type":"question","counter":452,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[26350\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014061800088#WRW01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will report on Garda Operation Camac; the number of persons arrested and charged to date; and the number of successful convictions obtained as part of this operation.","asker":"1190","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":453,"content":"<p>Operation Camac was set up by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to target individuals who are involved in the production, distribution and sale of counterfeit merchandise in this jurisdiction.

The vast majority of claims under the remit of the State Claims Agency (over 11,000 received since 2009) are resolved without confidentiality agreements attaching. Confidentiality agreements typically apply to claims in respect of minors or claims associated with abuse or specific medical negligence issues. The fact that cases might be subject to confidentiality agreements is not recorded on the National Adverse Event Management System (NAEMS). The confidentiality clauses are recorded only on the paper files. The agreements, where entered into at the behest of either party, preclude the disclosure of settlement details by either party. <\/p><p>Historically, medical indemnity in Ireland has been offered to medical consultants and other healthcare professionals by two private companies, the Medical Defence Union (MDU) and the Medical Protection Society. <\/p><p>The Clinical Indemnity Scheme (CIS) was established in 2002, in order to rationalise pre-existing medical indemnity arrangements by transferring to the State,  responsibility for managing clinical negligence claims and associated risks. Under the scheme, which is managed by the State Claims Agency (SCA), the State assumes full responsibility for the indemnification and management of all clinical negligence claims, including those which are birth-related. <\/p><p>One of the Medical Defence Organisations, the MDU, contended that the Irish State should take over the historic liabilities of its members in respect of claims which occurred prior to the introduction of the Clinical Indemnity Scheme, as it alleged that the establishment of the Scheme deprived it of vital income to meet its historic liabilities in Ireland.  Despite protracted negotiations between the State and the MDU, it was not possible for the parties to reach agreement on this matter. The MDU subsequently began to refuse cover to its existing and former consultant members in Ireland. <\/p><p>To ensure that no one  who suffered from a medical mishap would be left without compensation in all reasonable circumstances, the Department put in place arrangements in October 2004 whereby consultants, refused indemnity by the MDU, would have their cases handled to completion by IHCA and IMO nominated solicitors whereupon, at the conclusion of individual proceedings, application could be made to the Minister for ex&ndash;gratia assistance in respect of settlements\/award of damages and attendant legal costs. <\/p><p>In September 2012 the Government decided to accept an MDU offer of &euro;45 million in full and final settlement of its historic liabilities in Ireland.

It increased its prices by an average of 3% on March 1, 2014 and an average of 6% on March 1, 2013.  VHI has indicated that the price increases were necessary to cover the costs of providing for the healthcare needs of their customers in an aging market and it has continuously sought to keep any price increases as low as possible.  It has minimised price increases in the past two years because of the work it has done on cost containment. \u00a0This has been achieved through a range of measures, such as targeted claims efficiency programmes, reduced fees to providers, increased activity of the special claims investigation unit and the continued transition of procedures to lower cost medically appropriate settings.  It reduced its cost of total gross claims paid in 2013 by 2.1%.<\/p><p>  I have consistently urged the VHI and all the private health insurers to do everything possible to keep down the cost of private health insurance.

Litigation and threat of litigation is one of the forms mentioned.    These measures are often utilised as a means of delaying various legislative provisions from coming into operation and as a means of diverting resources away from other tobacco control and health promotion initiatives.  Litigation also acts as a deterrent for other countries from developing and enacting new progressive pieces of tobacco control legislation. The threat of litigation should not be an obstacle to the introduction of important public health measures.  I am of the view that standardised packaging for tobacco products is a proportionate, evidence-based public health measure which will assist, together with the other many initiatives outlined in <i>Tobacco Free Ireland<\/i>, in reducing the overall prevalence of smoking in Ireland.
