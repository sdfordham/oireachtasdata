It is worth remembering that in the three years to March 2011 a net 250,000 jobs were lost in the private sector in Ireland under the last Fianna Fail - Green Party Government. We are rebuilding our economy brick-by-brick, making it stronger, ensuring that successes gained are here for the long term.<\/p><p>  Since entering into office, the current Government is working very hard to tackle all forms of unemployment, particularly the unfortunate trends in long-term unemployment and youth unemployment. We have developed detailed strategies on several fronts - the Pathways to Work plan will help activate the long-term unemployed and the Action Plan for Jobs will, I hope, help create the right conditions for job creation within the economy.

This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and nearly 10,000 Learning Support and Resource Teachers.  These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position and a requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas.  There has been no reduction in the overall number of SNA posts being provided for schools for the coming school year.  This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which will ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to such support.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that the level of SNAs required to support children with special educational needs changes from year to year in line with the enrolment of different children with different care needs.  The care needs of individual children can also change from year to year. The NCSE takes these factors into account when allocating SNAs to schools.  Therefore, even if the number of students receiving SNA support rises, this does not necessarily mean that the required number of SNAs to support their care needs should rise by a similar percentage.  In June 2012 the NCSE reported that the number of children requiring support for the 2012\/2013 school year was in the order of 20,000 and the most up-to-date current figures is that for December 2012 of 21,972. <\/p><p>  The initial allocation of SNAs for the coming school year will support about 22,000 pupils.

The report refers to the limited availability of assessments in some areas and indicated that there was parental concern with regard to the assessment process and the waiting time for health or educational assessments. <\/p><p>The report found that a serious consequence of the limited access to professional assessment is that access to supports which require an assessment to trigger a support may become dependent on the ability of the parent or the school to fund private assessments and that some schools and parents have greater capacity to source private reports.

While this policy document is in preparation, the Deputy is assured that national policy for the education of children with autism is being fully implemented in a timely and consistent manner.  My Department's policy on the education of children with Autism resides within the overall policies on the education of children with special educational needs. In the main these policies are not condition-specific. In this context, the Autism policy, whether expressed in a multiple of documents or in a single document, should not be viewed as a separate 'stand alone' policy. The new policy statement will not be exclusive. Policies are subject of necessity to change from time to time. Also, the new statement will neither alter nor add to existing policy. It will reflect the current policy in a coherent and articulate manner for the benefit of schools and parents.  As the Deputy is aware I have now requested the NCSE to prepare Policy Advice on the Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and it is not expected that the report will be finalised until early 2015. The time frame required is reflective of the wide consultation process which will be a feature of the preparation of the advice.

Furthermore the NCSE has commissioned research which will not be finalised until mid to late 2014 and I expect that this research will inform much of the work in preparing the policy advice.

Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, I have attempted to take steps to reduce the burden on families.  Shortly after coming into office I met with members of the Irish Educational Publishers' Association and impressed on them the need to limit the cost of textbooks.  I have also stressed to them the real need to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.  The Association responded positively to my approaches and agreed a voluntary Code of Practice among their members.  The Code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years.  The publishers have also given assurances to me that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes.  All these developments are welcome, and I look forward to seeing the members of the Association implement these commitments.  The Department provided approximately &euro;15m in total to first and second level schools by way of book grants in 2012 and the same level of funding will be provided in 2013. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware I launched new &quot;Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools&quot; on the 28th January last.  These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.  The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.<\/p><p>  The publication of these Guidelines follows a survey of schools by the Department, and which I published in May 2012.  This had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme.  At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%.  Of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community &amp;amp; Comprehensive sector operated a book rental scheme.  I believe these results show that we have a good foundation to build on across the country.  I hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the Guidelines to introduce them.  If they do, it will result in substantial savings for parents.  Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books.  <\/p><p>A special &quot;Guide for Parents&quot; was also published, to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them.  I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes.  All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden it places on already hard pressed families at the start of every school year.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to see the high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary level and I believe that these Guidelines will encourage this practice across all schools in our education landscape.<\/p><p>  I also published a Report on Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and the Allocation of Textbook Grants by the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills in May 2012.  This report presented four policy options to encourage schools to establish textbook rental schemes.  None of the options are ideal, each one involves a trade-off of advantages and disadvantages.  I will continue to monitor the number of schools operating book rental schemes, and if it proves necessary consider further steps to encourage schools to do so.<\/p><p>  Educational book publishers are independent private companies not under the direct control of my Department.  Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second-level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on textbooks are taken at school level.  Individual schools need to adopt a more cost-conscious approach to the selection of books in their classes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300072#WRF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Staffing","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300073#WRG00150"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[32246\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300073#WRG00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will examine the case of a school (details supplied) in County Wexford which has recently lost 2.5 special needs assistants even though two new children with special needs are due to start at the school this September; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The ongoing commitment of my Government to protect frontline supports for children with special educational needs is an acknowledgment of the important role played by SNAs and resource teachers in ensuring that children with special needs can progress and develop and be included, where appropriate, in mainstream school settings.<\/p><p>  Whereas the allocations of SNA support for individual schools may change each year in line with a schools enrolment of children with care needs, there has been no reduction to the overall number of SNA posts being provided for schools for the coming school year. This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which will ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to such support. <\/p><p>  The total number of SNA posts allocated to schools for the 2012\/13 school year was 10,487 posts. For the 2011\/12 school year it was 10,320 posts. The demand for SNAs for the 2013\/2104 school year currently stands at 10,490 leaving some 85 posts available for late demand. It is therefore estimated that there will be sufficient SNA posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such support in the coming school year.<\/p><p>In relation to the allocation of resource teaching support for schools from September 2013, demand for support has risen again this year, due to a combination of demographic growth and increased assessments.<\/p><p>  Despite the fact that the overall number of posts available to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) for allocation to schools had been maintained at existing levels, the allocations initially announced by the NCSE on 19th June were reduced to take into account of the growth in demand, within the maintained number of posts, in order to ensure that equivalent allocations could be made for all qualifying children.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that I announced recently that I have now authorised the NCSE to restore the level of resource teaching allocations which can be provided for students with special educational needs to the 2012\/13 levels. This will mean that there will not now be any reduction to resource teaching time for children on the level which applied last year.<\/p><p>  I also committed to ensuring that the resources which will be required to ensure that the allocations can be made to schools at existing levels will be provided, including resources required to meet any late demand expected to arise between now and the start of the school year.

Some of the provisions of the Treaty concern matters that fall within the exclusive competence of the European Union, as they come under the scope of the Common Commercial Policy or affect the rules of the Internal Market.  As a result, a Decision authorising member States to ratify must be adopted by the Council before Ireland and its EU partners can proceed to ratification.<\/p><p>  A proposal to the Council recommending the adoption of a draft Council Decision is awaited from the European Commission in this regard.  The Commission will set out its assessment of the legal position, including whether any European legal instruments need to be amended in order to comply with the terms of the Treaty.  Any changes in European legislation identified by the Commission may require corresponding changes in domestic legislation transposing the relevant European laws.  This would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, whose Department operates Ireland&rsquo;s national licensing unit.<\/p><p>  At the national level, I have instructed officials in my Department to begin preparations to ensure that the necessary steps are taken in good time to allow for early ratification.

This involves an examination of the provisions of the Treaty to establish whether legislative, administrative and-or policy measures are required to implement them.  Contacts are ongoing between my Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in this regard.  Early ratification by the 28 EU member States, including Ireland, would advance matters considerably toward the ATT becoming a reality on the ground and starting to save lives.

This is a very positive development that takes us another step closer towards addressing the problems faced by undocumented Irish emigrants in the US and will allow them to emerge from the shadows.  I strongly welcome the provisions in the Bill passed by the Senate to address the concerns of our undocumented and the specific E3 provisions for Ireland that provide extensive legal pathway for future migration flows between Ireland and the US.  <\/p><p>  I am particularly pleased that the Bill includes provisions that will allow for continuation of the summer J1 visa programme.  Earlier drafts of the bill had threatened the future viability of the programme.  I raised these concerns directly with Senator Patrick Leahy, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  I am pleased that the Bill as passed by the Senate no longer classifies J1 summer participants as foreign workers, which would have imposed significant additional requirements on them and their potential employers.  Earlier texts had also proposed a further fee of $500 to be paid by the sponsoring organisations; the Bill as passed introduces a fee of $100, and the conditions surrounding payment of this fee would allow for it to be paid by either the sponsoring organisation or the participant.<\/p><p>  I pay tribute to hard work and persistence of Senators Leahy, Schumer, McCain and other members of the US Senate bi-partisan group who brought forward the original proposals.

It has been suggested recently that huge savings could be made by moving from the current system of marking rebated fuel to one based on making repayments to those users that currently use marked fuel. This seems to be based on the erroneous view that adding the prescribed markers to rebated fuel is exceptionally costly and is borne by the Exchequer. This is not the case; the cost of the markers is negligible and is borne by the industry. The cost to the exchequer of marked fuel is the tax foregone and an alternative system based on direct repayments to users would not produce any savings for the exchequer and might be more costly if the incidence of fraud were greater. This system of marking diesel has been an effective and efficient means of delivering a tax rebate on a product used by a very large number of users across a wide range of uses. Fuel laundering to remove the marker added to lower-taxed mineral oil for off-road use has been a persistent problem over the years. However, it remained a marginal activity because the sulphur content of marked fuel was higher than that for road fuel and therefore the sulphur content continued to distinguish laundered fuel from genuine road fuel. Environmental requirements in relation to the sulphur content of fuel changed from the beginning of 2011, which resulted in marked fuel with the same sulphur content as road fuel coming onto the market. With this change, fuel laundering became more viable and criminal gangs intensified their laundering and distribution activities dramatically from the first half of 2011.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to estimate accurately the loss to the Exchequer from particular activities in the shadow economy such as fuel laundering<b>.<\/b> It is clear, however, that illegal activity in the fuel market is significant, and that it poses a threat to the tax yield and to legitimate business. Revenue, therefore, has made action against fuel laundering one of its priorities and is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem through enhanced supply chain controls, the acquisition of a more effective fuel marker and continued robust enforcement action. This strategy included strengthening the licensing conditions for auto-fuel traders in 2011 and the introduction of a new licensing system for marked fuel traders in October 2012. In addition, since January 2013, all licensed fuel traders are required to make electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions each month. These supply chain control measures are designed to make it difficult for fuel criminals to source marked fuel for laundering and to get laundered product onto the market. Analysis of the monthly returns of fuel trading will enable Revenue to identify suspicious or anomalous fuel transactions and patterns of distribution. Analysis of the first few months of returns data is well advanced. Traders found to be involved in suspicious activity will be investigated and if they are unable to account properly for the source or disposal of product will face revocation of their licence, tax assessment and prosecution where appropriate. In addition, Revenue and HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs in the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding in May 2012 on a joint approach to finding a more effective marker for use in both jurisdictions. A number of proposals for a new marker submitted in response to an Invitation to Make Submissions are currently being evaluated. The outcome of this process is expected later this year. Revenue, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the border, continues to intensify enforcement action against fuel fraud and this work has yielded significant results to date. In the past two years 97 filling stations throughout the State were closed for breaches of licensing conditions. Since the beginning of 2010, over 2.8 million litres of fuel have been seized and 29 oil laundries detected and closed down, including 5 oil laundries in 2013 to date. Revenue regularly reminds motorists and the public generally that, in addition to its impact on the exchequer and legitimate trade, they should be aware of the risks posed to their vehicles by using laundered fuel and the fact that sourcing fuel in this way is funding criminal activity. The legitimate retail trade can also contribute to closing down this illegitimate trade by providing information on the outlets that are selling laundered diesel.

In May, 2011, the Garda&iacute; informed the Bank, following consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions, that to proceed with the Bank&rsquo;s investigations at that time could prejudice any future criminal prosecutions. Accordingly, the Bank decided to defer its investigation but has kept this decision under review. Given the seriousness and sensitivity of criminal proceedings and the strength of the sanctions available to the Garda&iacute; and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE), the Bank considers that this is the most appropriate approach to take where there is a reasonable possibility of multiple proceedings. Regular liaison with these agencies is continuing.<\/p><p>  In relation to Irish Nationwide Building Society (INBS), an investigation into historical lending practices at INBS is at an advanced stage and, once concluded, decisions regarding any possible future enforcement proceedings will be made.<\/p><p>  In addition to the above two investigations, the Bank commenced a review in June, 2011, of the fitness and probity of all sitting directors of the six banks and building societies covered by the State guarantee. This review concluded in June, 2012. In respect of a small number of directors, the Bank investigated more thoroughly their individual roles and responsibilities during the period leading up to the present banking crisis. During the period of the review, many of the long-standing directors of the six institutions have resigned. <\/p><p>  In respect of any directors who continued in their roles into 2012 and beyond and who were in place prior to 2008, the Bank concluded that, based on the evidence available, it had no reason to suspect the fitness and probity of those individuals. In some cases, this decision was taken within the Bank and, in others, the Bank sought an external opinion on the material available. <\/p><p>  In respect of any directors of the institutions, including those whose tenure goes back to before 2008, the Bank will continue to carry out its role in respect of the supervision of the fitness and probity of those directors. Where any information comes to light to give the Bank reason to suspect that the Bank&rsquo;s standards may not be met by any individual director, then the Bank will commence to investigate that information in a thorough and comprehensive manner and take any action that may be warranted using the powers available.<\/p><p>  New applications to sit on the boards of any of these institutions which remain under the Bank&rsquo;s active supervision will require the applicants to establish, to the satisfaction of the Bank, that proposed directors meet the Bank&rsquo;s minimum standards of fitness and probity. <\/p><p>  In addition to the above, the Central Bank is carefully studying the various transcripts emerging in relation to Anglo Irish Bank. This is something that is viewed very seriously. The Central Bank will be liaising with the Garda&iacute; in this regard and is also examining whether or not any breaches of regulatory requirements may have occurred arising from the information contained in the transcripts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300077#WRL01500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bank Guarantee Scheme Administration","counter":221,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300078#WRM00150"},{"type":"question","counter":222,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[32532\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300078#WRM00200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of money held by the then Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland at 30 September 2008 in respect of the deposit guarantee scheme for banks and building societies; and to specify the amount currently being held by the Central Bank of Ireland in respect of the same scheme.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":223,"content":"<p>The Deposit Guarantee Scheme (DGS) protects depositors in the event of a bank, building society or credit union authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland being unable to repay deposits.

Private consumption was down -1.6 per cent, partly due to low car sales. Investment fell -19.8 per cent as there were fewer purchases of aircraft than in the same quarter of the previous year. Government consumption continued to fall as public service employment continues to shrink in line with policy objectives.<\/p><p>  On the external side, exports fell by -4.1 per cent. This is primarily due to patent expiration in the pharma sector as goods exports are down -9.4 per cent. Weak trading partner demand is also impacting. Imports fell by -4.2 per cent.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding these data, the labour market continues to show signs of stabilisation. Figures published this morning show that unemployment has fallen from a high of 15.1 per cent in February 2012 to 13.6 per cent in June 2013. In addition, the latest Exchequer returns published yesterday by my Department highlight the consistent improvement in Ireland's public finances with the gap between income expenditure continuing to narrow.<\/p><p>  The latest GDP figures are below expectations of both domestic and international forecasters. This makes the Government's primary macroeconomic policy objective of putting the economy back on a sustainable growth path so as to move to a point where sustained net employment creation is taking place, even more imperative. <\/p><p>In this regard, competitiveness has improved substantially in recent years, with inflation at or below the euro area since March 2008. Tangible progress is being made to ensure a banking system healthy enough to support productive investment by <i>inter alia<\/i>   the SME sector. In relation to the public finances, the policy objective remains the correction of the excessive general government deficit by 2015, as recommended by the ECOFIN Council in late-2010. All of the interim annual deficit ceilings set by the Council have been met, and the Government remains committed to bringing the deficit below 3 per cent of GDP within the stated time horizon.<\/p><p>Finally, I would like to emphasise that the Government remains committed to tackling the unacceptably high level of unemployment.

Following consideration of the issues involved, it was decided that the school-focused functions of the NCTE should be integrated more closely with other support services for teachers and schools and that certain functions relating to curriculum development be transferred to the NCCA. Therefore the NCTE was formally merged with the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) as of 1st June 2012, while a senior post from the NCTE dealing with curricular matters was assigned to the NCCA.  A new senior management team consisting of a Director and four Deputy Directors was appointed to the PDST organisation as a whole.<\/p><p>  One of the Deputy Director posts has responsibility for the ICT support service functions carried out by the staff of the former NCTE. The new configuration ensures greater integration of ICT within teaching and learning both in terms of policy and practice.  In relation to increasing the number of students opting for ICT courses at third level, the joint Government-Industry ICT Action Plan, which was published in January 2012, sets out a multi-level approach with an overarching aim of doubling the number of graduates from ICT disciplines to 2,000 by 2018. It contains a comprehensive range of measures to build the domestic supply of ICT graduates, in the short, medium and long term, including through the roll out of the ICT graduate skills conversion programmes. Almost 1,500 places have been provided for graduate jobseekers under two the rounds of the ICT graduate skills conversion programmes that have issued to date. More than 400 people have already graduated from these programmes and a further 300 are due to graduate before the end of this year. In addition, more than 3,700 people have enrolled on ICT programmes under the first two rounds of the Springboard reskilling initiative and a further 2,000 ICT Springboard places have been made available under the third phase of Springboard which was launched in June 2013.<\/p><p>  The Plan has helped to raise awareness of employment opportunities in ICT. Technology courses accounted for 20.5% of all honours degree level first preference applications through the CAO this year. The increase in demand from students for technology courses, including a 50% increase in first preference applications for computing over the past 5 years is very positive in building the future supply of graduates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300078#WRM00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":233,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300078#WRM00950"},{"type":"question","counter":234,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[32309\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300078#WRM01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a school (details supplied) in County Louth has proposed to integrate an autism unit into its school and that a prefabricated building has been in place for some time now; the reason the service has not yet been established in this school; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1066","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":235,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) engaged with County Louth VEC during the 2011\/2012 school year with a view to establishing an autism unit at one of its post-primary schools in Louth.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.<\/p><p>  The level of resources being devoted to supporting children with Special Educational Needs has been maintained at &euro;1.3 billion this year. This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and nearly 10,000 Learning Support and Resource Teachers.  These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position and a requirement to make expenditure savings accross a range of areas.  There has been no reduction to the overall number of SNA posts being provided for schools for the coming school year. This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which will ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to such support.<\/p><p>  The total number of SNA posts allocated to schools for the 2012\/13 school year was 10,487 posts. For the 2011\/12 school year it was 10,320 posts. The demand for SNAs for the 2013\/2014 school year currently stands at 10,490 leaving some 85 posts available for late demand. It is therefore estimated that there will be sufficient SNA posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such support in the coming school year.  SNA allocations are made to schools by the NCSE annually, taking into account the assessed care needs of  qualifying children.  All schools were advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2013\/14 school year by 15th March 2013.<\/p><p>  Details of the SNA allocations which have been made to schools by the NCSE for the 2013\/2014 school year are now available on the NCSE website www.ncse.ie, which provides details of the SNA allocations for each school on a school by school and per county basis.  Where schools have enrolled children who were not considered at the time that these allocations were made, or where schools are seeking a revision to the quantum of SNA support which has been allocated to them for the coming school year, they should contact the NCSE regarding this matter.  In general a revision to SNA allocations will only be made in circumstances where schools have enrolled new pupils or where schools can demonstrate that they do not have sufficient SNA posts to cater for the care needs of all of the qualifying children in their school.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300080#WRO00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staffing","counter":266,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300080#WRO00350"},{"type":"question","counter":267,"qnumday":97,"qnumall":"[32393\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300080#WRO00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the number of release days from full-time teaching duties afforded by his Department to teaching principals; his plans to increase these; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"984","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":268,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[32404\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300080#WRO00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will list in tabular form the number of release days from full-time teaching duties afforded by his Department to teaching principals; his plans to increase these; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.  In addition, the National Council for Special Education's (NCSE) Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) can assist parents to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs.

This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs).  These resources have been protected despite the ongoing severe financial position and a requirement to make expenditure savings across a range of areas.  There has been no reduction to the overall number of SNA posts being provided for schools for the coming school year.  This provision remains at 10,575 posts, which will ensure that all children who qualify for access to SNA support for the coming school year will receive access to such support. <\/p><p>  The demand for SNAs for the 2013\/2104 school year currently stands at over 10,490 leaving over 80 posts available for late demand.  Some additional posts are also likely to be freed up during the year due to children not enrolling to schools or diminishing care needs.  The NCSE will allocate the remaining SNAs to schools during the year, as required, based on the care needs of qualifying children.<\/p><p>  In relation to the July Provision scheme I wish to clarify that the allocation of home based provision to siblings for July Provision is reflective of the school grouping principle.  This is where one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary.  Accordingly it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home.  The school grouping principle does not purport to replicate or mirror all aspects of school based provision.  The age or ability of siblings is reflected in their education level as determined by education and health professionals.  In general where a child is receiving their education in a class setting with other children of mixed age and ability, this should carry through to their July Provision.<\/p><p>  However in recognition of the differing needs of some siblings, separate allocations can considered on a case by case basis.  Applications in this regard will require supporting documentation including professional reports from a psychologist or a letter from the principal of the school detailing the existing arrangements currently in place for the respective children and providing reasons why they cannot be tutored together in the home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300082#WRQ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Appeals","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300082#WRQ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":115,"qnumall":"[32435\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300082#WRQ01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will examine a student grant appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":319,"content":"<p>Officials in my Department have confirmed with Student Universal Support Ireland that in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy, her student grant application was appealed to the appeals officer in SUSI on 12 June 2013.

The following table from the report illustrates the non-presence rates of new entrants in their second year of study by sector, NFQ level and course duration. New entrants are classified as 'not present' if they do not appear in the statistical returns of that institution in the following academic year. The proportion of new entrants in 2007\/08 who were not present one year later was 15% on average across all sectors and NFQ Levels. Prior educational attainment is a very significant factor.<br \/>  The HEA is currently in the process of working on an analysis of retention rates in the universities and institutes of technology. This has only recently become possible due to a full population of SRS (Student Record System) data becoming available for a period spanning five years. The HEA which is responsible for the collection of data on student progression does not have information for the current academic year, however it is currently collating data for the 2010\/11 academic year and it is hoped that this data will be available in the autumn. Higher education institutions have a wide range of supports in place to improve retention of students in their institutions.  The HEA study and other research has also highlighted that undergraduate first years are most at risk of non-progression.  The new National Forum for the enhancement of Teaching and Learning that I established late last year is looking at the undergraduate student experience in first year and how that may be improved on a system wide basis.  Their work should improve quality outcomes for students at that difficult transition period.  <br \/>  The work of the Transition reform group chaired by the Secretary General of my Department should also contribute to improvements in students' quality outcomes.  A key commitment has been made by the higher education institutions to reduce the number of level 8 programmes offered through the CAO and broadening them.  This should help school leavers better navigate the entry routes into higher education system when making the important choice about what programme to undertake.  They will also be exposed to a broader first year experience.  This change when implemented should help to reduce the number of school leavers making the wrong choice about what course of study to undertake and help to reduce non-progression and completion.<\/p><p>Non-Presence Rates for New Entrants by Sector and NFQ Level (2008\/09).<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Sector<\/th><th>Level<\/th><th>Most Common Points Attained<\/th><th>% Not Present<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>Level 6<\/td><td>250-300<\/td><td>25%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>Level 7<\/td><td>250-300<\/td><td>26%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>Level 8<\/td><td>300-350<\/td><td>16%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>L8 3 yr duration<\/td><td>300-350<\/td><td>16%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>L8 4 yr duration<\/td><td>300-350<\/td><td>16%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>L8 4+ yr duration<\/td><td>450-500<\/td><td>10%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Institutes of Technology<\/td><td>All New Entrants<\/td><td>300-350<\/td><td>22%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>Level 8<\/td><td>400-450<\/td><td>9%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>L8 3 yr duration<\/td><td>350-400<\/td><td>10%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>L8 4 yr duration<\/td><td>450-500<\/td><td>9%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Universities<\/td><td>L8 4+ yr duration<\/td><td>550-600<\/td><td>3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>Level 8<\/td><td>450-500<\/td><td>4%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>-<\/td><td>L8 3 yr duration<\/td><td>450-500<\/td><td>2%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Other Colleges<\/td><td>L8 4 yr duration<\/td><td>400-450<\/td><td>7%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>All Institutions<\/td><td>Level 8<\/td><td>350-400<\/td><td>11%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>All Institutions<\/td><td>All New Entrants<\/td><td>350-400<\/td><td>15%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300086#WRU00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Staffing","counter":373,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300086#WRU00425"},{"type":"question","counter":374,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[32523\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300086#WRU00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a special needs assistant will be assigned to a school (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":375,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including the allocation of resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools.

However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy I have had enquiries made with the Board on his behalf.<\/p><p>I am advised that demand for legal services from the Legal Aid Board (&quot;the Board&quot;) has increased significantly since the down-turn in the economy.  While there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006.  Demand in 2013 is running at the same level as it was in 2012.  The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board's grant-in-aid at the same level for 2013 as it was in 2012 (and 2011).<\/p><p>Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in lengthened waiting times for those seeking legal services for matters that are not prioritised. Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery.  The Public Appointments Service has recently concluded a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board from which appointments, both temporary and permanent, are being made at the moment.<\/p><p>In response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services.  Those steps include the following:<\/p><p>- The Board has been piloting a 'triage' approach in most of its law centres to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage.  The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times.  The aim of the 'triage' approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes).  If the applicant requires further services they remain on the 'waiting list'.  There is or has been a 'backlog' of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month.  A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were overwhelmingly satisfied with this particular service initiative.  This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved.<\/p><p>- In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres.  This is a 'start to end' system which will in the medium term deliver efficiencies in terms of the administration aspect as well as in relation to the delivery of the legal services;<\/p><p>- In November 2011 the Board took responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded family mediation service.  A key reason for transferring this responsibility to the Board was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law).  Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a 'litigation first' approach that may on occasion be too common.  Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service located there also.  Steps are now being taken to replicate this initiative in a number of other locations including Cork and Naas;<\/p><p>- With the drop in demand for asylum services the Board has taken steps to integrate its Refugee Legal Service into the general law centre service delivery model thus effectively transferring resources from the asylum area to the general legal service area where the demands have increased;<\/p><p>- The Board has maintained a high level of usage of private solicitors for family law cases in the District Court;<\/p><p>- The Board has continued to engage with other key players in the justice \/ legal area with a view to trying to ensure that State funded resources that impact on its area of business are used to best effect.<\/p><p>I am currently considering a package of proposals from the Board for the revision of the financial eligibility and contributions provisions governing the granting of civil legal aid.  These provisions may have some impact, albeit relatively marginal, on the demand for legal services and the resources available to the Board.<\/p><p>I am very conscious of the difficulties that delays in accessing legal aid can give rise to and I am aware that the Board is also keenly aware of those difficulties and is working to ensure the delays are minimised to the greatest extent possible.  I have noted some of the steps that it has taken and I know that it is constantly keeping the delivery of its services under review with a view to getting services to those most in need of them as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>It is difficult to give an 'average' waiting time as waiting times fluctuate at the individual law centres depending on the levels of demand, the levels of resources available and &lsquo;environmental&rsquo; factors such as the frequency of court sittings.<\/p><p>The waiting times at law centres for non prioritised matters are as per the schedule below.  This schedule sets out the waiting times for centres not operating the triage approach (second column) and the waiting times for centres operating the triage approach (third and fourth column).  The fourth column indicates the additional time that a person who has had a triage appointment is likely to have to wait for a second consultation.<\/p><p><bu>Details re waiting times and numbers waiting on the 1<\/bu><bu>st<\/bu><bu>June 2013 (in months)<\/bu><\/p><p><pli4><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Law Centre<\/th><th>General <br \/>Law Centre not operating triage<\/th><th>Waiting time for a triage appointment <\/th><th>Further waiting time where triage appointment previously given<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Blanchardstown<\/td><td>3<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Brunswick St<\/td><td><\/td><td>9<\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clondalkin<\/td><td>12<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Finglas<\/td><td>14<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Gardiner St<\/td><td><\/td><td>3<\/td><td>15<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tallaght<\/td><td>11<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Popes Quay<\/td><td>9<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Mall<\/td><td>12<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Athlone<\/td><td><\/td><td>4<\/td><td>8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Castlebar<\/td><td><\/td><td>2<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td><\/td><td>4<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dundalk<\/td><td>4<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ennis<\/td><td>13<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway- Francis St<\/td><td><\/td><td>6<\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway - Seville H<\/td><td><\/td><td>7<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td><\/td><td>2<\/td><td>11<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Letterkenny<\/td><td><\/td><td>5<\/td><td>7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>10<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford<\/td><td><\/td><td>3<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan<\/td><td>2<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Navan<\/td><td><\/td><td>4<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Nenagh<\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Newbridge<\/td><td><\/td><td>6<\/td><td>9<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Portlaoise<\/td><td><\/td><td>6<\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td><\/td><td>4<\/td><td>5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tralee<\/td><td>4<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tullamore<\/td><td>6<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>7<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>9<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><td>12<\/td><\/tr><\/table><<\/p><p><\/PLI4><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300092#WRAA01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Law Matters","counter":505,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300092#WRAA01550"},{"type":"question","counter":506,"qnumday":183,"qnumall":"[32452\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300092#WRAA01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will investigate the legality of a mosquito device and clarify if there is any breach of Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act (details supplied) ","asker":"1017","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":507,"content":"<p>I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in relation to the matters referred to by the Deputy.

The EU Sugar Regime underwent a radical reform in 2005 following major EU decisions to restructure the industry.  A temporary restructuring scheme was introduced with the aim of reducing EU sugar production.  Greencore, the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota, availed of this voluntary scheme, dismantled its facilities and ceased production in 2006. Ireland secured &euro;353 million as part of the reform package of which &euro;220million went to beet growers, &euro;127million to Greencore and &euro;6 million to machinery contractors.  There is no mechanism under the present EU Regulations to allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for Ireland.<\/p><p>  I know you will be aware that in 2011 I met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of establishing a new sugar\/bioethanol facility in the country.

I am pleased to confirm to the Deputy that at the recent Council of Agriculture Ministers, which I chaired under Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency, I secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package to abolish sugar quotas by 30 September 2017.  This agreement removes, with effect from 1st October 2017, the quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member States wishing to re-establish a sugar industry.

However, in general terms, the situation as described most commonly occurs where an applicant has made an over-claim on his or her contract and my Department discovers that over-claim.<\/p><p>  The forestry schemes administered by my Department and other schemes, such as the Single Farm Payment scheme, use computerised geo-spatial and payments systems. These systems use ortho-photography, which is geometrically corrected aerial photography overlaid onto maps. The systems capture an image of an applicant's claim map and calculate an accurate measurement of the area being claimed. The process of electronically capturing the claim map is called digitisation. This technology has been used internationally for many years. Tolerances are applied when capturing and measuring claims in order to avoid penalising applicants due to minor inaccuracies in their claims. To ensure accuracy and consistency, digitising is performed by the contracted company using well established standards and procedures. My Department has no concerns over the accuracy of ortho-photography and geo-spatial systems for measuring areas. Digitising accuracy depends on the applicant's claim map &ndash; if the applicant submits a claim map which does not accurately define the area planted then the digitised image will obviously reflect that.<\/p><p>  My Department, including Forestry Division, uses constantly updated ortho-photography to detect potential over-claims and overpayments. A simple example would be where a forestry plantation is initially established, the trees planted are not visible when viewed in contemporaneous photographs. However, when viewed on later photography, maturing trees in the plantation will be visible but the more recent photographs may show gaps where trees have failed, were removed, or were never planted. The updated photography therefore provides an effective audit tool to ensure that claims made under my Department&rsquo;s schemes are accurate.<\/p><p>Over-claims and overpayments on forestry contracts (and other schemes) are detected in this manner or through random or risk analysis driven inspections; through Single Farm Payment queries by applicants or their neighbours; through forestry queries by the applicant himself; by formal audit of files, etc. Any over-claim and overpayment, regardless of how it was detected, will be similar to the case described, in that the contract will be paid on an area determined from the applicant&rsquo;s claim from the 1st grant onwards and then, if an over-claim is discovered, the payable area will be adjusted downwards and any overpayment will be recouped.<\/p><p>  It is impossible for the Forest Service to predict how many over-claims are made on contracts, as it must first detect each individual over-claim in order to be aware it.

Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities. This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of job opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and demonstrates how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.<\/p><p>  The initiative is expected to receive full year funding of &euro;14 million to provide over 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school in order to support parents to take up employment.  This funding has been made possible through savings from the Vote of the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>  Eligibility for the new After-school Childcare programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Officials from the Department of Social Protection and my Department are continuing in close collaboration on the operation of the programme.   The first pilot phase has commenced.  Up to 500 childcare places are available with  Department of Social Protection local offices in Tralee, Mullingar, Dundalk, Cork City, Finglas, Kings Inn and Limerick City participating.  The second phase of the pilot will be rolled out in July, with the full roll-out of the programme in September 2013, to coincide with the new school year.  The pilot programme will assist both Departments in determining the procedural, quality and practical issues that require attention prior to the finalisation of the programme.<\/p><p>  The programme will provide &euro;35 per week per child enrolled in a participating service for after school services and this payment will rise to &euro;100 per week during holiday periods when parents will be availing of full day care.  A further &euro;20 per week will be paid by the parent to the provider in both instances.<\/p><p>  The new After-school Childcare programme will further augment my Department's programme of childcare supports for low income families. These include the Community Childcare Subvention and the Childcare Education and Training Support  programmes, both of which provide subsidised childcare for low income parents, including qualifying parents who are on approved VEC and F&Aacute;S education and training courses.  In 2013, my Department expects to spend in the region of &euro;70 million on these programmes, supporting over 30,000 childcare places.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300092#WRDD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":566,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300092#WREE00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sunbed Usage","counter":565,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300092#WREE00100"},{"type":"question","counter":566,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[32708\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300092#WREE00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has any proposals to bring in regulations with regard to persons who operate sun beds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":567,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[32306\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300092#WREE00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will introduce legislation to protect young persons from sunbed use as a result of the huge incidents of skin cancer resulting from same","asker":"1015","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":568,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[32416\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300092#WREE00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he expects legislation on the regulation of sunbeds to be introduced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1105","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":569,"content":"<p>  I propose to take Questions Nos. 205, 206 and 221 together.<\/p><p>  I can confirm that legislation will be implemented to regulate the use of sunbeds.

Approval for a HSE direct-build PCC was approved in 2012 in the context of the HSE's multi-annual Capital Plan.   Following the review of a number of sites in the area, the HSE identified a Dublin City Council owned property on Mellowes Road, Finglas as the preferred site for the construction of the proposed new Finglas PCC.  Subject to planning permission, the commercial terms for the sale were agreed with the officials of Dublin City Council and approved by the HSE.  This site was selected because<\/p><p>- it is centrally located in the catchment area which it is intended to serve;<\/p><p>- it has very good accessibility and is well served by bus routes;<\/p><p>- it is a generous green-field site, has future expansion capacity and there would be no impact on current services during the construction period; <\/p><p>- it would complement the HSE Day Care Centre on Kildonan Road;<\/p><p>- it facilitates the establishment of GP services in this area;   local GPs have expressed significant interest in discussion with the HSE, in being a part of this development in this specific location.<\/p><p>  The HSE now advises that the North West Committee which is a local area committee of Dublin City Council has rejected the proposed sale of the Mellowes Road site to the HSE for use as a health care facility.    A final decision is awaited from Dublin City Council.    The HSE remains committed to the development of this primary care centre and has appointed a design team who have commenced a preliminary design.  The design is now on-hold pending completion of the purchase.  It was intended to submit the planning application once the site acquisition had been finalised.  <\/p><p>  An important feature of the HSE's construction programme is that it recognises the construction dynamic - that construction projects can develop at different paces - and as a consequence it is multi-annual.   Ring-fencing this project's estimated construction costs would cut across the multi-annual concept and be counter-productive, as funds ring-fenced but not spent in a given year must be surrendered to the Exchequer at year end.    This project's progress and its estimated costs (as is the case for all other projects) are reviewed and revised as appropriate at each stage of development.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300092#WRHH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":644,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300092#WRHH01350"},{"type":"question","counter":645,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[32460\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300092#WRHH01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a patient who is under the care of a consultant (details supplied) in County Donegal since November 2012 was informed that their surgery will not be carried out; the reason this is the case, and reassure this patient that they will receive the necessary care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The EU Sugar Regime underwent a radical reform in 2005 following major EU decisions to restructure the industry.  A temporary restructuring scheme was introduced with the aim of reducing EU sugar production.  Greencore, the holder of the entire Irish sugar quota, availed of this voluntary scheme, dismantled its facilities and ceased production in 2006. Ireland secured &euro;353 million as part of the reform package of which &euro;220million went to beet growers, &euro;127million to Greencore and &euro;6 million to machinery contractors.  There is no mechanism under the present EU Regulations to allow for the re-instatement of the sugar quota for Ireland.<\/p><p>  I know you will be aware that in 2011 I met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies, into the possibility of establishing a new sugar\/bioethanol facility in the country.  I understand from figures published by the interested groups who are investigating the possibility of building a new facility, that the overall capital cost costs involved could range from &euro;250 million to &euro;400 million, depending on what type of facility will be constructed.<\/p><p>  I have previously indicated that any venture to develop a combined sugar\/bioethanol production facility would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by a business case which is sufficiently robust to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required.  I am pleased to confirm to the Deputy that at the recent Council of Agriculture Ministers, which I chaired under Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency, I secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package to abolish sugar quotas by 30 September 2017.  This agreement removes, with effect from 1st October 2017, the quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member States wishing to re-establish a sugar industry.

However, in general terms, the situation as described most commonly occurs where an applicant has made an over-claim on his or her contract and my Department discovers that over-claim.<\/p><p>  The forestry schemes administered by my Department and other schemes, such as the Single Farm Payment scheme, use computerised geo-spatial and payments systems. These systems use ortho-photography, which is geometrically corrected aerial photography overlaid onto maps. The systems capture an image of an applicant's claim map and calculate an accurate measurement of the area being claimed. The process of electronically capturing the claim map is called digitisation. This technology has been used internationally for many years. Tolerances are applied when capturing and measuring claims in order to avoid penalising applicants due to minor inaccuracies in their claims. To ensure accuracy and consistency, digitising is performed by the contracted company using well established standards and procedures. My Department has no concerns over the accuracy of ortho-photography and geo-spatial systems for measuring areas. Digitising accuracy depends on the applicant's claim map &ndash; if the applicant submits a claim map which does not accurately define the area planted then the digitised image will obviously reflect that.<\/p><p>  My Department, including Forestry Division, uses constantly updated ortho-photography to detect potential over-claims and overpayments. A simple example would be where a forestry plantation is initially established, the trees planted are not visible when viewed in contemporaneous photographs. However, when viewed on later photography, maturing trees in the plantation will be visible but the more recent photographs may show gaps where trees have failed, were removed, or were never planted. The updated photography therefore provides an effective audit tool to ensure that claims made under my Department&rsquo;s schemes are accurate.<\/p><p>Over-claims and overpayments on forestry contracts (and other schemes) are detected in this manner or through random or risk analysis driven inspections; through Single Farm Payment queries by applicants or their neighbours; through forestry queries by the applicant himself; by formal audit of files, etc. Any over-claim and overpayment, regardless of how it was detected, will be similar to the case described, in that the contract will be paid on an area determined from the applicant&rsquo;s claim from the 1st grant onwards and then, if an over-claim is discovered, the payable area will be adjusted downwards and any overpayment will be recouped.<\/p><p>  It is impossible for the Forest Service to predict how many over-claims are made on contracts, as it must first detect each individual over-claim in order to be aware it. In all cases of overpayments, my Department is obliged to recoup any public money that has been overpaid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300095#WRDD01000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":731,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300095#WRDD01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Missing Children","counter":730,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300095#WRDD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":731,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[32541\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300095#WRDD01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will update D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as to recent EU dialogue about Finland's position on the EU missing children help line; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Lack of access to affordable, quality childcare is a significant barrier to many low income and disadvantaged families seeking to avail of work opportunities. This initiative will provide an important support measure to enable parents to avail of job opportunities.  This is in line with the Government's overall strategy to support parents of low income families to take up employment and demonstrates how Departments are working together to deliver the Government's agenda on promoting employment and supporting children's development.<\/p><p>  The initiative is expected to receive full year funding of &euro;14 million to provide over 6,000 after-school places for children attending primary school in order to support parents to take up employment.  This funding has been made possible through savings from the Vote of the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>  Eligibility for the new After-school Childcare programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  Officials from the Department of Social Protection and my Department are continuing in close collaboration on the operation of the programme.   The first pilot phase has commenced.  Up to 500 childcare places are available with  Department of Social Protection local offices in Tralee, Mullingar, Dundalk, Cork City, Finglas, Kings Inn and Limerick City participating.  The second phase of the pilot will be rolled out in July, with the full roll-out of the programme in September 2013, to coincide with the new school year.  The pilot programme will assist both Departments in determining the procedural, quality and practical issues that require attention prior to the finalisation of the programme.<\/p><p>  The programme will provide &euro;35 per week per child enrolled in a participating service for after school services and this payment will rise to &euro;100 per week during holiday periods when parents will be availing of full day care.

They set out a clear legal framework for the application of quality and safety standards for human organs intended for transplantation.

They include questions in relation to certain  risk behaviours. The decision on whether someone who is gay may become a donor is not based on sexual orientation, but because it is known that there is an increased level of HIV infection rates in MSM in Ireland. Testing for HIV remains very sensitive and effective, but there remains a period between infection and detection which could permit the transmission of the virus to a recipient.   For this reason sexually active gay men are currently excluded from becoming organ donors.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300097#WRFF00300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Eligibility","counter":764,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300097#WRFF00350"},{"type":"question","counter":765,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[32341\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300097#WRFF00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the withdrawal of a medical card from a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath.","asker":"1062","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":766,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive has been asked to examine this matter and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p><p>  The Health Service Executive operates the General Medical Services scheme, which includes medical cards and GP visit cards, under the Health Act 1970, as amended.

Approval for a HSE direct-build PCC was approved in 2012 in the context of the HSE's multi-annual Capital Plan.   Following the review of a number of sites in the area, the HSE identified a Dublin City Council owned property on Mellowes Road, Finglas as the preferred site for the construction of the proposed new Finglas PCC.  Subject to planning permission, the commercial terms for the sale were agreed with the officials of Dublin City Council and approved by the HSE.  This site was selected because<\/p><p>- it is centrally located in the catchment area which it is intended to serve;<\/p><p>- it has very good accessibility and is well served by bus routes;<\/p><p>- it is a generous green-field site, has future expansion capacity and there would be no impact on current services during the construction period; <\/p><p>- it would complement the HSE Day Care Centre on Kildonan Road;<\/p><p>- it facilitates the establishment of GP services in this area;   local GPs have expressed significant interest in discussion with the HSE, in being a part of this development in this specific location.<\/p><p>  The HSE now advises that the North West Committee which is a local area committee of Dublin City Council has rejected the proposed sale of the Mellowes Road site to the HSE for use as a health care facility.    A final decision is awaited from Dublin City Council.    The HSE remains committed to the development of this primary care centre and has appointed a design team who have commenced a preliminary design.  The design is now on-hold pending completion of the purchase.  It was intended to submit the planning application once the site acquisition had been finalised.  <\/p><p>  An important feature of the HSE's construction programme is that it recognises the construction dynamic - that construction projects can develop at different paces - and as a consequence it is multi-annual.   Ring-fencing this project's estimated construction costs would cut across the multi-annual concept and be counter-productive, as funds ring-fenced but not spent in a given year must be surrendered to the Exchequer at year end.    This project's progress and its estimated costs (as is the case for all other projects) are reviewed and revised as appropriate at each stage of development.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300097#WRHH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":821,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300097#WRHH01350"},{"type":"question","counter":822,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[32460\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300097#WRHH01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a patient who is under the care of a consultant (details supplied) in County Donegal since November 2012 was informed that their surgery will not be carried out; the reason this is the case, and reassure this patient that they will receive the necessary care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Approval for a HSE direct-build PCC was approved in 2012 in the context of the HSE's multi-annual Capital Plan.   Following the review of a number of sites in the area, the HSE identified a Dublin City Council owned property on Mellowes Road, Finglas as the preferred site for the construction of the proposed new Finglas PCC.  Subject to planning permission, the commercial terms for the sale were agreed with the officials of Dublin City Council and approved by the HSE.  This site was selected because<\/p><p>- it is centrally located in the catchment area which it is intended to serve;<\/p><p>- it has very good accessibility and is well served by bus routes;<\/p><p>- it is a generous green-field site, has future expansion capacity and there would be no impact on current services during the construction period; <\/p><p>- it would complement the HSE Day Care Centre on Kildonan Road;<\/p><p>- it facilitates the establishment of GP services in this area;   local GPs have expressed significant interest in discussion with the HSE, in being a part of this development in this specific location.<\/p><p>  The HSE now advises that the North West Committee which is a local area committee of Dublin City Council has rejected the proposed sale of the Mellowes Road site to the HSE for use as a health care facility.    A final decision is awaited from Dublin City Council.    The HSE remains committed to the development of this primary care centre and has appointed a design team who have commenced a preliminary design.  The design is now on-hold pending completion of the purchase.  It was intended to submit the planning application once the site acquisition had been finalised.  <\/p><p>  An important feature of the HSE's construction programme is that it recognises the construction dynamic - that construction projects can develop at different paces - and as a consequence it is multi-annual.   Ring-fencing this project's estimated construction costs would cut across the multi-annual concept and be counter-productive, as funds ring-fenced but not spent in a given year must be surrendered to the Exchequer at year end.    This project's progress and its estimated costs (as is the case for all other projects) are reviewed and revised as appropriate at each stage of development.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300099#WRHH01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":901,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300099#WRHH01350"},{"type":"question","counter":902,"qnumday":232,"qnumall":"[32460\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013070300099#WRHH01400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a patient who is under the care of a consultant (details supplied) in County Donegal since November 2012 was informed that their surgery will not be carried out; the reason this is the case, and reassure this patient that they will receive the necessary care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
