I fully welcome recent amendments in equality legislation which prohibits discrimination in the letting of residential property to people who are in receipt of a Rent Supplement or Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Department officials had engaged with the owners of the larger property websites in advance of the enactment of this legislation and progress had already been made in this area. <\/p>  <p>  Persons who feel they have been discriminated against by a landlord or their agent may wish to contact the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission or make a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of rent limits, the Department undertook a review of these limits in 2015 and found that the impact of increasing limits at a time of constrained supply in the private rented market will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with little or no new housing available to recipients. The Department has instead implemented a targeted policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the limits for both existing customers and new applicants to the rent supplement scheme. The circumstances of tenants are considered on a case-by-case basis and rents are being increased above prescribed limits, as appropriate.  In addition, the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute, with plans underway to extend this to other urban and commuter areas. This flexible and targeted approach has assisted over 7,300 rent supplement households nationwide to retain or acquire rented accommodation through increased rent payments.  <\/p>  <p>  I believe these measures and the reforms announced to the private rental sector provide stability in what has become a highly volatile rental market.

The corresponding appeal processing times in 2015 were 25.9 weeks and 20.6 weeks respectively, and in 2014 were 34.4 weeks and 30.1 weeks.<\/p><p>The unprecedented increase in appeal receipts since 2009 placed considerable pressure on the appeals office and impacted adversely on processing times.  The overall number of appeals received increased from an average of 15,000 per year up to 2009, to a peak of 35,500 in 2012, reducing annually thereafter to just below 25,000 in 2015.<\/p><p>Significant effort and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeals process in recent years:<\/p><p>- Additional appeals officers were appointed to the office<\/p><p>- An overhaul of the operating model was undertaken<\/p><p>- New technology to support appeals officers was introduced<\/p><p>- Work was undertaken with the Department to reduce delays in responding to requests from the appeals office for appeal submissions.<\/p><p>This resulted in a marked improvement in overall appeal processing times. The average time taken to determine an appeal requiring an oral hearing reduced from 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 25.5 weeks in 2015 and the average time taken to finalise an appeal decided by way of a summary decision dropped from 25.1 weeks in 2011 to 18.1 weeks in 2015.<\/p><p>The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved.

Staff in the Department make every effort to ensure customers are informed of any change in entitlement in a timely manner.

Mindful of the current and ongoing discussions on Government formation, any further development of policy will be a matter for the incoming Government.<\/p>  <p>  The current position is that the department has a cohort of jobseeker customers who are classified as casual jobseekers. These are in-work customers who can claim a jobseeker's payment for 2 to 3 days per week or who work week on\/week-off.  These customers are paid by cheque each week. Not all customers will be paid every week due to their changeable work patterns.<\/p>  <p>  These customers have been paid by cheque due to the changing nature of their work\/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue payments.  It is critical to note that they are not paid via post offices under the department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the National Payments Plan, my department is seeking to reduce cheque usage in the economy; this is not only a matter of decreasing the significant costs associated with cheques in the department and wider economy but also of moving to a more secure method of payment and enhancing customer convenience.<\/p>  <p>  When paid by cheque, customers have the option of lodging them direct to their accounts or negotiating them at banks or the Post Office.  The vast majority of the department&rsquo;s customers paid by cheque choose to lodge them direct to their accounts.<\/p>  <p>  The department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns and is able to offer payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual Jobseeker customers thereby increasing customer convenience.  This is in line with wider departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that in-work customers are paid by the most convenient method possible.<\/p>  <p>  Consequently the department has written to its casual Jobseeker customers asking them to provide their account details to enable direct payments to financial institutions.<\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the department does not issue these cheque payments to Post Offices. This process does not reduce the number of existing cash payments through Post Offices under the current contract between the department and An Post.<\/p>  <p>  I want to reiterate that what the department is doing is moving customers from cheque payments to the much more secure, customer convenient and cost effective payment method of payment directly into accounts in financial institutions. This is entirely consistent with the National Payments Plan and in line with payment methods that now prevail across the economy.  The department must consider the most efficient payment method for our customers who are in employment most of whom get their salary payment into bank accounts.  To have weekly income (work + welfare) payable in two different ways is a highly inappropriate and costly way of dealing with people in employment. The department&rsquo;s focus must be on our customers.<\/p>  <p>  Customer choice will be maintained.  Customers, if they wish, may continue to receive cheque payments in the medium term.  To date the take-up of this option has been minimal.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of working groups arising from the &ldquo;Kerr&rdquo; Report, The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is actively working with An Post and others to set out a clear implementation plan for all of the actions in the Kerr Report.<\/p>  <p>  The report clearly sets out the challenges that An Post and Postmasters face as they ensure that the network remains relevant in the context of an inexorable shift in consumer preferences, including the trend towards digital transactions.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources anticipates that this work will take no more than 6 months.  The Department of Social Protection is engaging with this process as appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600042#WRB03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1253"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":132,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600042#WRB03650"},{"type":"question","counter":133,"qnumday":43,"qnumall":"[5670\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600042#WRB03700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"to expedite a decision on an appeal by a person (detail supplied) in County Cork under the carer's allowance scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1285","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":134,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 29<sup>th<\/sup>January 2016.

This Scheme, which sets out the Department&rsquo;s commitments to customer service in Irish and advises of the availability of services through Irish, was published on Department&rsquo;s website in March 2015.<\/p><p>Due to the large number of Departmental offices nationwide, it is not possible to have staff members with sufficient fluency to deal with a customer through the medium of Irish available at all times in every location.  However, following a Departmental-wide survey in 2015, some 172 staff (2.6% of total staff) stated that they were willing to provide a service to customers in Irish on a voluntary basis. In areas where the staff available are unable to deal with a person through Irish, a language interpretive service is offered to the customer. This service, which can be arranged at very short notice, enables customers (through a 2nd telephone handset or headphones) to have a conversation with staff through a language interpreter.<\/p><p>The following public offices of the Department<b><font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font><\/b>are located in Gaeltacht areas: Acaill, An Cloch&aacute;n Liath and Beal an Mhuirthead Intreo Centres and An Daingean branch office. All of these offices can currently provide a direct (telephone\/ face to face) service through Irish. The Department is currently in the process of arranging to fill three vacant posts which require the assignment of a bilingual staff member.  A review is currently under way to determine the overall number of functional bilingual posts that are required in the Department and assignments will be made to fill vacant bilingual posts as they arise.<\/p><p>The Department is committed to the continued development and training of staff to facilitate the provision of services through Irish.  A range of supports is available to equip frontline staff with the necessary skills and confidence to deliver a quality customer service in Irish by phone, letter and in person. Supports available include funding for attendance at Irish language training courses; training resources such as language discs and books are made available; and funding through the Department&rsquo;s Refund of Fees scheme, to encourage staff to pursue Irish Language education outside of work hours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600043#WRC02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1253"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Applications","counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600043#WRC02900"},{"type":"question","counter":193,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[5850\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600043#WRC03000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when she will pay arrears to a person (details supplied) in County Kildare under rent supplement scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":194,"content":"<p>The client concerned provided relevant documentation to the Department confirming their income from employment on 22 March 2016.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.The Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan.Within this framework, the Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment, education or training within four months of becoming unemployed. The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs. There is monthly engagement with all young jobseekers. For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training. Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and Tus, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. <\/p><p>Overall, young people took up just over 19,000 Youth Guarantee-related programme places in 2015.<\/p><p>The table details the original expected full year intake on relevant programmes for 2015 as well the actual number of starters up to the most recent date for which data are available.<\/p><p>These data exclude an estimated 24,000 places provided for young people through PLC courses and apprenticeships.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  There are a number of conditions which must be met in order to qualify for a State pension (contributory).  One of these is the condition mentioned by the Deputy, that they should have a minimum of 520 paid contributions.  However, it is not the only condition which must be met.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  <\/p>  <p>  A credited contribution is a pay related social insurance (PRSI) contribution awarded to an insured person under certain circumstances, such as proved unemployment. PRSI credited contributions are an integral part of the social insurance system. For the most part they are linked to having an underlying entitlement to a social welfare payment while temporarily detached from the labour force or having entitlement to statutory leave.  The primary purpose of PRSI credits is to secure social welfare benefits and pensions of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI such as during periods of unemployment, illness, etc.  Credits ensure that a person&rsquo;s insurance record is maintained and can be helpful at a later stage to qualify for other social welfare benefits, such as pensions. <\/p>  <p>  If someone qualifies for a State pension (contributory), their rate of entitlement is calculated by the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system, where the total number of contributions paid or credited by the pensioner during his or her working life is divided by the number of years of the person&rsquo;s insurance record.  In calculating the yearly average, the number of reckonable contributions paid and\/or credited since entering insurable employment (after the age of 16) are counted up to the end of the tax year before reaching pension age (66), and this total is divided by the duration (in years) of their record up to that point.  For example, 1,800 contributions over a period of 45 year duration might attract a yearly average of 40 (i.e. 1,800 divided by 45), depending on the circumstances of the pensioner.<\/p>  <p>  There are six banded rates of the State pension (contributory), ranging from the maximum personal rate of &euro;233.30 (paid to pensioners with a yearly average of 48 or more contributions) to the minimum personal rate of &euro;93.20 (paid to pensioners with a yearly average of 10-14 contributions).  Such entitlements are subject to satisfying the qualifying conditions of this pension, including the minimum 520 paid contributions criterion.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that, where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600044#WRD02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1253"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":293,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600044#WRD02950"},{"type":"question","counter":294,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[5984\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600044#WRD03000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"when she will finalise an application by a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary under the carer's allowance scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1273","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":295,"content":"<p>I confirm that the department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person concerned on 26 January 2016.

Prior to that Act, any person taking a pension from a Defined Contribution (DC) scheme or a Retirement Annuity Contract had no choice but to purchase an annuity with their remaining pension pot after drawing down the permissible tax-free retirement lump sum.  The ARF arrangement extended the options at retirement so that, in addition to the annuity option, the balance of a pension fund could be taken in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate) or be invested in an ARF or an approved minimum retirement fund (AMRF), subject to certain conditions. <\/p>  <p>  ARFs and AMRFs are investment products into which the proceeds of certain pension funds of an individual can be invested at retirement.  Beneficial ownership of the assets in an ARF\/AMRF vests in the individual owner of the ARF\/AMRF.  An ARF\/AMRF must be managed by a Qualifying Fund Manager and, as would be the case as a member or holder of a DC pension scheme or personal pension plan, the ARF\/AMRF owner also bears the investment risk of the funds.  Tax is not payable on the investment income or gains while the funds are invested in an ARF\/AMRF.  Distributions from an ARF or AMRF are taxable at the owner's marginal rate of tax and, in the case of ARFs, a certain percentage of the assets are imputed as distributed each year and taxed accordingly unless actual distributions equivalent to the imputed amount are made.<\/p>  <p>  The ARF option was extended in Finance Act 2000 to the part of an employee's occupational pension fund built up from Additional Voluntary Contributions (AVCs) and more recently, in Finance Act 2011, it was further extended to cover an employee's entire pension fund where the fund is a DC occupational pension scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The ARF option does not apply to the main benefits paid from defined benefit (DB) pension schemes, generally, since it was never intended or considered a necessary requirement for such schemes.  Among other reasons, this is because such schemes pay out a specified pension benefit to members on retirement based on their service and remuneration.  Furthermore, unlike in DC pension arrangements, there are no individual funds or pension pots attributable to individual members of DB schemes and, as such, DB scheme members do not individually bear the investment risk of the scheme and are not required to make their own investment decisions.  Accordingly, I see no reason to extend the ARF option to the main benefits payable from DB pension schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600046#WRF04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme","counter":442,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600046#WRF04350"},{"type":"question","counter":443,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[6005\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600046#WRF04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will resolve the issues in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny relative to a claim for a refund of value-added tax and vehicle registration tax under the disabled drivers scheme.","asker":"1248","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":444,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the car concerned does not qualify for relief from VAT and VRT and the person concerned was advised of this by Revenue on 30<sup>th<\/sup>March 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600046#WRF04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Lending","counter":445,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600046#WRF04650"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[6019\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600046#WRF04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if it is permissible for a bank to remove a tracker mortgage rate from a borrower in circumstances where the property in question is no longer the principal private residence of the borrower; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":447,"content":"<p>It is not possible to answer this question comprehensively for all mortgages as, by their very nature, mortgages are complex and can extend over a number of different loans for one particular borrower.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, any moves by lenders to remove tracker rate mortgages from borrowers can only be carried out in accordance with the underlying terms and conditions of the loans and the relevant consumer protection requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that it has strong consumer protection requirements covering tracker rate mortgages which are set out in the statutory Consumer Protection Codes and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.

Furthermore the Consumer Protection Code 2012 sets out specific requirements in respect of the treatment of personal customers exiting tracker rate mortgages.  In the case of accounts in financial difficulty, the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears applies to properties occupied by the borrower in the State or where the property is the only residential property owned by the borrower in the State.  Under the CCMA a lender is permitted to offer a borrower an alternative repayment arrangement which requires the borrower to change from an existing tracker mortgage to another rate, but only as a last resort, where: all other options, which would retain the tracker rate, have been considered to be unsustainable; the arrangement offered is affordable for the borrower; and the arrangement is a long-term sustainable option.<\/p>  <p>  I would also note that if a mortgage holder is not satisfied with a financial service provider's decision, the customer can make a complaint, using the financial service provider's internal formal complaints procedure.\u00a0If they are not satisfied with the outcome they may wish to refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman to have it independently investigated. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, it may be useful to know that the Central Bank has embarked on a broader examination of tracker mortgage-related issues covering, among other things, transparency of communications with, and contractual rights of, tracker mortgage borrowers.

Schedule 2 lists supplies that are liable at the zero rate and in respect of which the supplier has an entitlement to deduct input VAT.  Schedule 2 includes international services, human and animal oral medicines, children's clothing and footwear, books and a range of food and drink items.  The range of food products that can benefit from the zero rating is constrained by Article 110 of the VAT Directive which permits the retention of the zero rate for &quot;clearly defined social reasons&quot; where the products were liable to VAT at the zero rate on 1 January 1991.<\/p><p>Schedule 3 lists the goods and services that are liable to VAT at the reduced rates of 9% and 13.5%.  The goods and services currently liable to VAT at the 9% rate are ones listed in Annexe III of the VAT Directive and Ireland was permitted under Article 113 of the Directive to apply a rate lower than 12% to these goods and services.  The goods and services liable to VAT at the 13.5% rate are ones that are not listed in Annexe III, but in respect of which Ireland is permitted under Article 118 to retain a reduced rate.  The goods and services to which the 9% rate applies include:<\/p><p>- the supply of food and drink (excluding alcohol, soft drinks and bottled water) in the course of catering;<\/p><p>- hot take-away food and hot drinks;<\/p><p>- hotel lettings, including guest houses, caravan parks, camping sites etc.;<\/p><p>- admissions to cinemas, theatres, certain musical performances, museums, art gallery exhibitions;<\/p><p>- amusement services of the kind normally supplied in fairgrounds or amusement parks;<\/p><p>- the provision, by a person other than a non-profit making organisation, of facilities for taking part in sport;<\/p><p>- printed matter e.g. newspapers, magazines, brochures, leaflets, programmes, maps, catalogues, printed music (excluding books);<\/p><p>- hairdressing services.<\/p><p>The goods and services to which the 13.5% rate applies include:<\/p><p>- The supply of gas, electricity, solid fuel and home heating oil;<\/p><p>- The supply of new buildings, concrete block and ready to pour concrete;<\/p><p>- The supply of photographic services, agricultural services and photographic services;<\/p><p>- The hire of cars and boats;<\/p><p>- Beauty services such as facials, nail treatments, tanning and sunbed services.<\/p><p>The supply of goods and services not listed in the Schedules to the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 is liable to VAT at the standard rate.  Where a good or service is not specified in the Schedules mentioned then the correct rate is the standard rate.  Revenue does have a VAT rates database on its website<i>(<\/i>) that lists thousands of product and services types and gives the correct VAT rate by reference to the Schedules. <\/p><p>It is widely recognised that there are anomalies in the rates applying to goods and services and I receive Parliamentary Questions concerning particular anomalies from time to time.  Under the VAT Directive the apparent anomalies can generally only be eliminated through applying higher rates to goods and services currently liable at the zero- rate or at one of the reduced rates.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Any changes to VAT rates outside of what is currently permitted\u00a0though the EU VAT Directive must be negotiated at EU technical working groups and ultimately agreed at ECOFIN.  As with all tax files,\u00a0any changes require unanimous agreement from all Member States.  The EU Commission is planning to launch an Action Plan on VAT in the very near future\u00a0which I expect to open up the possibility of adding more flexibility to the application of VAT rates by Member States.  I expect technical discussions at an official level to begin during the current Dutch\u00a0Presidency of the EU.  My officials will engage fully in these discussions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600047#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Tax Exemptions","counter":506,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600047#WRG01350"},{"type":"question","counter":507,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[6166\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600047#WRG01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider an amendment to the local property tax to allow for a complete exemption for residents in properties that are not safe, through no fault of their own, such as Longboat Quay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Rather, NAMA has acquired loans that are secured by property, which in some cases may be residential property.  The properties that secure these loans are owned by NAMA borrowers, in the same way a homeowner owns a home which is subject to a mortgage provided by a bank.  NAMA's legal relationship to those properties is similar to a bank which holds security over a property.<\/p><p>NAMA, unlike other lenders, generally owns no residential mortgages, owner-occupier or buy-to-let, in its loan portfolio.  In a very small number of cases the principal private residence of a NAMA borrower may be pledged as security for a NAMA loan.<\/p><p>A property securing a NAMA loan may be brought to the market for sale by the borrower or receiver in one of two ways, either (1) as part of a portfolio of assets, or (2) individually, in each case to generate proceeds to repay the borrower's loan to NAMA.  Again, in much the same way a homeowner may sell their home and use the sale proceeds to repay their mortgage.  The sale of properties securing NAMA's loans is managed directly by the borrower\/property owner or, where the property is the subject of enforcement, by the appointed receiver\/administrator acting on behalf of the borrower\/property owner.  NAMA requires that the sale of properties by borrowers and receivers are openly marketed to ensure that the best available price in the market at the time of the sale is achieved.<\/p><p>In its capacity as a secured lender, I am advised that NAMA approved the sale by borrowers and receivers of 5,345 residential property units in 2015.  89% (4,783 of the 5,345 units) were sold on the open market by NAMA borrowers and receivers in individual sales transactions to individual property\u00a0purchasers. <\/p><p>I am further advised that the remaining units, 562 units (11% of the total), were sold on the open market by NAMA borrowers and receivers as part of larger group or portfolio sales.  The properties that were sold in groups or portfolios were typically already tenanted and vacant possession was not sought prior to the sale.  Such portfolios are, as a consequence, generally acquired by investors seeking long-term rental streams and therefore existing tenancy arrangements tend not to be impacted by such sales.<\/p><p>I would also\u00a0refer the Deputy\u00a0to NAMA's Annual Report and Accounts, which are available on the NAMA website, .These reports cover each full year of NAMA's operations and provide a breakdown of disposals by transaction type,\u00a0sector, and location, as well as the number of property\u00a0units disposed of by NAMA borrowers\u00a0and receivers.  In particular, I\u00a0would refer the Deputy to pages 14 -19 of NAMA's 2014 Annual Report for the most recent breakdown.  I expect that NAMA's upcoming\u00a02015 Annual Report will be published within the next two months and will contain an update of this information.<\/p><p>More generally, it is NAMA's policy that, where possible, borrowers and receivers should avoid seeking vacant possession of residential property in advance of asset sales conducted by the borrower or receiver and in loan sales conducted by NAMA in order to minimise disruption to people living in these homes.  As a consequence, such assets and loans are acquired typically by investors seeking long-term rental streams.  Therefore existing tenancy arrangements tend not be impacted by such sales.  NAMA expects\u00a0every acquirer of its loans to comply with their legal requirements to respect tenant rights in accordance with their lease terms.<\/p><p>Prior to facilitating the sale of any assets or loans secured by residential property, NAMA ensures that all avenues to use the properties for social housing have been exhausted.  The Deputy will note that NAMA made practically all of the vacant residential stock in its original loan portfolio available for social housing.  I am advised that NAMA identified 6,635 units for social housing.  Local authorities confirmed demand for 2,531 of these units and 2,042 of these have been delivered. <\/p><p>Also, before facilitating the sale of assets or loans, NAMA reviews the assets of every debtor to establish if they could be used for residential development.  In the context of a recently advertised loan sale, for instance, NAMA removed 16 borrowing connections from the proposed sale as it identified properties owned by these borrowers that could be used to deliver additional residential supply on a commercial basis, funded by NAMA.  These sites will contribute to the achievement of NAMA's stated commercial objective of funding the construction of 20,000 new homes in Ireland by 2020, subject to commercial viability.  This represents a significant contribution by NAMA, in line with its commercial mandate, to future residential supply in Ireland.  The residential\u00a0units delivered by borrowers through NAMA's residential funding programme will be sold\u00a0in individual lots on the open market. <\/p><p>Aside from the sites being developed through NAMA's residential funding programme, it is my understanding that there are relatively few loans remaining in NAMA's portfolio that are secured by\u00a0residential properties.  Furthermore, it is\u00a0decision for NAMA, in line with its independent commercial mandate, to ascertain the appropriate, value maximising strategy for any such loans.<\/p><p>It is important to highlight that the purchase or sale of a loan or a residential unit from one entity to another does not increase or reduce the supply of housing in the market.  It is through the construction of new residential units that supply is increased.  It should be noted that, in addition to repaying its debt, NAMA is using\u00a0the proceeds of loan repayments and loan sales to fund the construction of new homes on a commercial basis.  This is in accordance with NAMA's Section 10 obligation to seek to protect or enhance the value of its acquired assets.  In this way, NAMA's loan sales do contribute to increase the supply of residential units in the market.<\/p><p>Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act, 2015 was enacted on 8 July 2015.  This Act ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including those provided by various statutory codes such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, and the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600047#WRG02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Additional Voluntary Contributions","counter":516,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600047#WRG02050"},{"type":"question","counter":517,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[6217\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600047#WRG02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will allow persons who have made additional voluntary contributions and have drawn down 30% of the fund value, to draw down the remaining 70%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

These proposals reflected my\u00a0commitment to restore the pensions of retired public servants as early as economic and fiscal progress allowed.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  These PSPR ameliorative proposals were\u00a0legislated\u00a0in late 2015 under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) 2015 Act, with\u00a0changes occurring in three stages, on 1 January 2016, 1 January\u00a02017 and 1 January\u00a02018.<\/p>  <p>  On 1\u00a0January 2016,\u00a0increases in the annual\u00a0pension thresholds\u00a0before PSPR\u00a0applies were activated.  These exemption threshold increases\u00a0remove PSPR entirely\u00a0from a significant number of\u00a0pensions with relatively lower values, while those pensions which continue to be impacted by PSPR\u00a0receive a boost of &euro;400 per year.<\/p>  <p>  On 1\u00a0January 2017, additional\u00a0PSPR amelioration, acting\u00a0principally via further\u00a0exemption threshold increases,\u00a0will fully remove\u00a0PSPR from another significant tranche of public service pensions, while at the same time boosting\u00a0those pensions which\u00a0remain affected\u00a0by PSPR by &euro;500 per year. <\/p>  <p>  On 1 January 2018, the\u00a0third stage of\u00a0PSPR amelioration will ensure that\u00a0all PSPR-impacted pensions with values up to\u00a0&euro;34,132 will be fully restored, meaning that PSPR will not longer affect such pensions, while those\u00a0pensions\u00a0which continue to be impacted by PSPR will get a boost of, in most cases,\u00a0&euro;780 per year.<\/p>  <p>  These\u00a0legislated PSPR ameliorative measures, which are in the process of being implemented, constitute a fair and sound basis on which, with the restricted resources available to Government, public service pensions may benefit from significant restoration, with those on lower PSPR-impacted pensions benefitting to a greater extent.  The extent of the legislated\u00a0restoration, when fully in place from 2018, is substantial, carrying an\u00a0annual cost\u00a0estimated\u00a0at &euro;90 million, and ensuring\u00a0that only the top 20%\u00a0higher value public\u00a0service pensions will continue to be impacted by the PSPR.<\/p>  <p>  Under section 12 of the FEMPI Act 2013,\u00a0the Minister for\u00a0Public Expenditure and Reform is\u00a0required to review the necessity of the FEMPI legislation annually and cause a written report of his or her\u00a0findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.

In compliance with this duty, the OPW carries out an ongoing programme of maintenance work on the River Moy scheme.

I am pleased to report that the negotiations between the EU and the US have accelerated and significant progress has been made.  During this round, negotiators discussed all three pillars of the proposed agreement namely market access for EU and US companies, regulatory cooperation and trade rules.  The US and EU exchanged government procurement offers and continued discussions on rules of origin as well as intellectual property rights. <\/p><p>There was particular focus on two of the three pillars; regulatory cooperation and rules.  An exchange of new textual proposals on regulatory cooperation took place aimed at refining ideas about how to create a system within TTIP which facilitates current and future regulatory cooperation in both manufacturing and services. <\/p><p>Both parties also discussed the EU's revised draft chapter on good regulatory practices and other regulatory issues, such as technical barriers to trade (TBT), sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS).<\/p><p>Concerning Rules, the US tabled its proposals on labour and environment, in response to the EU's previous proposal for a sustainable development chapter.  A detailed examination of each side's proposal took place.  Discussions also covered other areas such as competition, customs and trade facilitation as well as state to state dispute settlement and Small &amp;amp; Medium Enterprises.<\/p><p>The EU presented its new and reformed approach to investment protection and investment dispute resolution for the first time in detail during this round &ndash; the Investment Court System (ICS).  The proposal is available on the Commission&rsquo;s website at .  <\/p><p>The EU Commission&rsquo;s proposal aims at safeguarding Government&rsquo;s right to regulate and creates a new system composed of a first instance tribunal and an appeal mechanism based on clearly defined rules, and operating on similar principles to the WTO Appellate Body, with qualified judges and transparent proceedings.  The ability of investors to take a case before the Tribunal would be precisely defined and limited.  The proposal also includes specific measures on access to the new system for small and medium sized companies.  The aim is to promote more two-way investment between the EU and the US with high standards of protection for investors while safeguarding government&rsquo;s right to regulate.  All of the EU&rsquo;s Free Trade Agreements seek to provide EU investors abroad with a level of protection similar to that which they would obtain in the EU.  Equally US investors in the EU expect common investment protection standards and common redress mechanisms, and not 28 different set of standards and 28 different redress procedures.<\/p><p>The advantage for Irish firms investing in the US would be that a single arbitration procedure would be available to firms under the Trade Agreement in cases of disputes over investment.

This follows on from an earlier package of measures agreed in September of last year and takes account of the ongoing difficulties being experienced in the sector, where the duration of market turbulence has gone well beyond previous expectations.<\/p>  <p>  The package reflects the majority of the demands presented by Ireland to the Commission and other Member States in advance of Council, in particular the doubling of the intervention ceiling for skimmed milk powder and butter. I also welcome the Commissioner&rsquo;s undertaking to consider further flexibilities in the PSA scheme for Skimmed Milk Powder, and to look at further flexibilities in the State Aid regime.<\/p>  <p>  At all times I remain concerned about the references to supply control in run-up to Council and in the Presidency conclusions which emerged after Council. We have been very consistent in our view that milk quotas did not serve Ireland well and their abolition was a welcome development which will allow our dairy sector reach its full potential. I am assured by the fact that the measures proposed at Council are voluntary, agreed at the level of the first purchaser of the milk and are strictly temporary in nature. They do not constitute a return to quotas and both the Commission and the Presidency were extremely clear on this point. I am also opposed to allocating new EU funding to incentivise such reductions.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of input costs at farm level, I have called on the Commission to consider looking at temporary suspension of EU import tariffs on fertilisers to reduce input costs for Irish and EU farmers and I understand that the Commissioner is looking favourably on this request.<\/p>  <p>  The Presidency conclusions also refer to the possibility of advance payments under CAP, as was done in 2015. In addition I can confirm that the direct top-up will issue to young dairy farmers in the near future. This is the final stage in the payment of &euro;26.4m direct aid to dairy farmers funded by the exchequer and the EU.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, with respect to financial instruments, I welcome the proposal for the European Investment Bank (EIB) and member states to work together with the Commission on the feasibility of an EU export credit tool. However, I believe the EIB needs to be more proactive in designing loan products in partnership with member states.<\/p>  <p>  It remains clear that we need to deal urgently and effectively with this temporary problem.

In 2015 export volumes increased by approximately 8%, with growth to the UK, Continental Europe and International markets. Export values at &euro;570 million, fell marginally by 2% during 2015 due to lower pig prices. Pigmeat prices tend to be cyclical in nature with periods of lower prices followed by a supply response and\/or a recovery in demand. My Department carefully monitors developments in the pig sector, both domestically and internationally.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure over the last year and a half and the difficulties that this is causing for producers. This is not an exclusively Irish phenomenon, and Irish prices have actually remained ahead of the EU average for the last five months. However I would also add that like any other EU Minister I do not have a role in the setting of prices. This is a function of the market.<\/p>  <p>  At the March meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels, I put forward a number of measures for the pigmeat and diary sectors which I believe were needed immediately to help producers through their current difficulties. On pigmeat my priority was to secure the re-opening of the Pigmeat Private Storage Aid Scheme as I believe its closure did not appear justified by the current state of the EU and global pigmeat market, given that the sector does not enjoy direct EU supports, market tools available in times of extreme price volatility must be deployed when necessary. I am pleased to note that the Commissioner has agreed to the re-opening of this scheme in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Russian pigmeat ban, the adverse effects of the effective closure of this market are still being felt by farmers. Ireland has requested the Commission to continue and intensify its political, technical and diplomatic efforts to unlock the Russian market for EU pigmeat. We proposed that the Commission re-engage and secure access for products outside the scope of the Presidential decree, such as pig fats and offals.  In the interim, a direct aid package payment will issue to all pig farmers in Ireland with a minimum level of supply of 200 pigs slaughtered in 2015 very shortly. This means a flat rate payment of over &euro;3,000 to each farmer. This will ensure that the payment is directed to those farmers most affected by the price volatility, thus meeting the requirements of the EU Regulations providing the funding. Furthermore, Commissioner Hogan has reiterated his determination to promote the EU&rsquo;s interests and open up new markets for EU products, with a specific &euro;30 million envelope for dairy and pigmeat available under the EU Promotion Scheme to reflect the market disturbances in those sectors. Ireland, through Bord Bia, will be making an application for a proportion of this funding in the very near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600052#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Exports","counter":939,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600052#WRM01350"},{"type":"question","counter":940,"qnumday":324,"qnumall":"[6035\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600052#WRM01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"to outline the progress made at European Union level in having additional food products exempted from the Russian ban on exports from the European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":941,"content":"<p>The adverse effects of the effective closure of the Russian market arise from the combined impact of the African Swine Fever (ASF)-related ban of February 2014 and the Presidential decree of August 2014, which imposed a ban on agricultural products and foodstuffs from countries that have adopted sanctions against Russia in the context of the situation in Ukraine.  These adverse effects are still being keenly felt by farmers.

It provides for the gradual unwinding of the pay reduction measures imposed on public servants at a cost of &euro;844m over three years. It is underpinned by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2015 (FEMPI). That Act makes the following provision for pay restoration:<\/p><p>On 1 January the exemption threshold for payment of Pension Related Deduction (PRD) increased from &euro;15,000 per annum to &euro;26,083\u00a0per annum and on 1\u00a0January 2017\u00a0it will further increase to &euro;28,750. This means for all public servants, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that by the start of 2017 remuneration below &euro;28,750 will no longer be liable to PRD which will reduce the impact\u00a0for PRD\u00a0affected public servants by &euro;1,000. By operation of the tax code those lower paid public servants\u00a0on lower rate of tax will profit to a greater extent.<\/p><p>For the majority of public servants, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to the PRD benefits outlined above, there is a significant reduction, weighted in favour of the lower paid, of the pay reductions suffered under the 2009 FEMPI legislation.\u00a0These come in the form of increases in gross pay in 2016 for those on lower pay (up to &euro;31,000) and in 2017 for all on pay up to &euro;65,000.\u00a0The 2015 FEMPI legislation also provides for the suspension of the operation of incremental pay scales in respect of any public servant who is not encompassed by a collective agreement. The application of this provision will fall to be considered in relation to those public servants who are not encompassed by the LRA come the expiry of the Haddington Road Agreement on 30 June 2015.<\/p><p>Negotiations on the LRA were facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission (now the Workplace Relations Commission) and were open to all Public Sector Unions and Associations including the Garda representative associations.<\/p><p>In relation to the pay rates applicable to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the position is that trainee Garda&iacute; are supported while completing their 2 year BA in Police Studies. For the 32 week duration of phase 1 of their training they receive a basic weekly allowance of &euro;184 and full board in the Garda College. After 32 weeks they are fully attested and move onto the first point of the Garda incremental pay scale of &euro;23,750. The incremental scale rises to &euro;42,138 per annum after 8 years with two further increments after 13 and 19 years' service which bring the maximum of the pay scale to &euro;45,793 per annum after 19 years.  It is important to recall that the Garda pay scale does not represent the full earnings of a Garda as it does not include any allowances. Garda&iacute; assigned to frontline duties work the Garda Roster which attracts unsocial hours payments. Such payments amount to between 25% and 30% of their earnings. Even at the entry level of &euro;23,750 and the lower end of unsocial hours scale, this will add almost &euro;5,950 to the salary. Other allowances may also be payable, as may overtime.<\/p><p>Regarding the 2014  finding by the European Committee of Social Rights in <i>EuroCOP V Ireland <\/i>that the State was not in compliance with a number of aspects of the Charter on Social Rights I have made it clear in the State's formal response that while the finding is not binding I am committed to seeking solutions to these issues which respect the Charter. The breaches identified were:<\/p><p>- Article 5 (the right to organise) on grounds of the prohibition against police representative associations from joining national employees' organisations<\/p><p>- Article 6.2 (the right to bargain collectively) on grounds of restricted access of police representative associations into pay agreement discussions; and<\/p><p>- Article 6.4 on grounds of the prohibition of the right to strike of members of the police.<\/p><p>The findings in relation to Articles 5 and 6.2 have been referred for consideration as part of the independent review being conducted by Mr Ray McGee, former Deputy Chairperson of the Labour Court as part of the commitment under the Haddington Road Agreement to a review of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including appropriate industrial relations mechanisms. This review is ongoing and will be completed as soon as possible. The breach of Article 6.4 (prohibition on the right to strike) is under separate consideration. It raises complex questions for the State from a legal, operational and management perspective which require detailed and considered input from various parties including the Garda Commissioner, the Attorney General and indeed Government itself.<\/p><p>All public servants, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, played a significant part in stabilising the public finances and bringing about the economic recovery and I am very conscious of their frustrations at the pace of pay restoration. However, it is essential that a prudent and sustainable approach is adopted given the current resources available and fiscal restraints on spending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600052#WRM04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rights of People with Disabilities","counter":984,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600052#WRM04650"},{"type":"question","counter":985,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[5884\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600052#WRM04700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to outline the status of Ireland's commitment to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, including the timetable for ratification by the Houses of the Oireachtas and the roadmap for its implementation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":986,"content":"<p>On 21 October 2015, I published a roadmap to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which outlines the considerable legislative changes to be undertaken to enable Ireland to ratify the Convention, along with the estimated deadline of end-2016 for ratification.

Paragraph 16(a) of Schedule 4 is the relevant provision in this case.<\/p>  <p>  The position under the Valuation Acts regarding claims from whatever source for exemption on charitable grounds, requires consideration of two issues. In order for a property occupied by an organisation to be exempt from rates under the terms of Schedule 4 - Paragraph 16(a) of the Act, that organisation must firstly, be a \"charitable organisation\" and secondly, the use of land, buildings or part thereof must be \"exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for private profit\".<\/p>  <p>  The definition of a \"charitable organisation\" in the context of Paragraph 16(a) of Schedule 4 was originally set out in section 3 of the Valuation Act 2001. This definition has been repealed  and a new definition has been substituted following implementation of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015. As a result. \"charitable organisation\" now means a charitable organisation within the meaning of Section 2 of the Charities Act 2009 that is entered in the register of charitable organisations pursuant to Part 3 of that Act. This has simplified the law in this particular regard.<\/p>  <p>  However, the other element to be satisfied under paragraph 16(a) of Schedule 4 has not been amended and still remains in place. Accordingly, the requirement that the land or building in question be used exclusively for charitable purposes, and otherwise than for private profit, continues in force.<\/p>  <p>  Shops operated by charitable organisations are rateable on the basis that conducting retail activity is not considered to be \"exclusively for charitable purposes\" within the meaning of the legislation. This is in line with established case law. As a result, a distinction has been drawn between properties which are operated by charitable organisations and used exclusively for charitable purposes and properties occupied by charitable organisations which are not used exclusively for charitable purposes, albeit where the proceeds may be used exclusively for charitable purposes.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's reference to childcare facilities, the position is that certain childcare facilities provided on a not-for-profit community basis are exempt from rates under the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015. However, a shop operated as a business or by a voluntary group is a retail activity in competition with other retail outlets and is therefore rateable and forms part of the commercial valuation base in all rating authority areas.<\/p>  <p>  If an occupier is dissatisfied with a determination of the Valuation Office, including as to whether a particular property is or is not rateable, there are a number of avenues of redress provided for in the Valuation Acts. Firstly, before a determination is made, there is a right to make representations to the Valuation Office in relation to a proposed valuation. Following consideration of the representations and determination of the valuation, there is a statutory right of appeal to the Valuation Tribunal. Finally, there is a right of appeal to the Higher Courts on a point of law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600052#WRM05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Traveller-Roma Integration Strategy ","counter":996,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600052#WRM05450"},{"type":"question","counter":997,"qnumday":344,"qnumall":"[5378\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600052#WRM05500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"to outline the status of persons (details supplied) in County Kerry regarding key issues faced by the Traveller community; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":998,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that there is a comprehensive consultation process underway, led by my Department, to develop a new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy to improve the situation for the Traveller and Roma communities.

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 provides for an extensive range of functions for IHREC, including \"to encourage the development of a culture of respect for human rights, equality and inter-cultural understanding in the State&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  A significant innovation in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 is the introduction of a positive duty on public bodies to have due regard to human rights and equality in their work and to conduct their business in a manner that is consistent with individual human rights. Under that Act (section 42), public bodies are obliged to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect human rights. The Commission will assist public bodies to comply with the positive duty, including by producing guidelines and codes of practice. This means the systematic integration of an equality and human right perspective into everyday work, including changes to organisational cultures, so that such a perspective is an integral part of the organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600052#WRM05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Spent Convictions","counter":999,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600052#WRM05650"},{"type":"question","counter":1000,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[5409\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600052#WRM05700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the Spent Convictions Act commenced; the steps a person who wishes to have a conviction considered spent should take; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":1001,"content":"<p>It is intended to commence the Spent Convictions Bill from 29th April 2016.

Under these statutory complaints structures the Law Society is, therefore, the main route of redress for aggrieved clients of solicitors, outside of the courts. The Society&rsquo;s Complaints and Client Relations Committee, which includes lay members, determines complaints in relation to misconduct, inadequate services or excessive fees made directly to it by members of the public. Under current law, therefore, it is not my function as Minister to determine or to otherwise intervene in disputes or difficulties between solicitors and their clients. Rather, these are matters to be dealt with by the designated statutory bodies or, as may be the case, through the courts. <\/p>  <p>  The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal deals with complaints of serious misconduct and such complaints are either referred to it by the Law Society or made directly to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal by members of the public. The Tribunal members are appointed by the President of the High Court and act independently of the Law Society. In more serious cases, where the Tribunal considers that a solicitor should be suspended or struck off it will make such a recommendation to the President of the High Court. Further details are available on the Tribunal&rsquo;s website www.distrib.ie. An aggrieved client can, therefore, bring a case directly to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal which in turn is amenable to the High Court.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the public who are dissatisfied with the way the Law Society has dealt with a complaint may also refer it to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (www.independentadjudicator.ie). The Office of the Independent Adjudicator was established to provide an independent point of contact to which members of the public could have recourse if dissatisfied with the manner in which the Law Society had dealt with a complaint. While it is important to note that the Adjudicator&rsquo;s role is to investigate the handling of the complaint by the Law Society and not to investigate the substance of the original complaint, the issue of delay in follow-up to a complaint is something that may be taken into appropriate consideration. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the remedies available under the statutory complaints handling framework that I have just outlined, aggrieved clients of solicitors may also choose to seek redress through the courts. This typically arises in cases of alleged negligence on the part of a solicitor which have had serious negative consequences for the client concerned. As with any court proceedings, it is considered prudent that persons considering taking such legal action seek independent legal advice on the strength or otherwise of their case and its possible cost implications. It will then be a matter for the aggrieved client concerned to decide which course of action might be best suited to the circumstances of their particular complaint. It is also understood that the Law Society maintains a list of solicitors who are prepared to act in such negligence proceedings against another solicitor and this list can be obtained upon request.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also wish to be aware that, under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, preparations are already underway for the establishment of the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority which will have responsibility for the oversight of both solicitors and barristers. There will be a new framework to deal with complaints about professional misconduct independent of both the Law Society and the Bar Council. This, in turn, will be backed up by the establishment of a new Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal which will also deal with both legal professions. Members of the public who wish to make complaints will, therefore, no longer do so through the Law Society or the Bar Council as they do at present, but through the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority. This and other reforms being made under the 2015 Act will continue to be rolled out on a phased basis between now and the end of this year. However, I would point out that any complaints against solicitors made to the Law Society prior to the forthcoming commencement of the new complaints provisions of the 2015 Act will be brought to their completion under the current law and complaints procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600053#WRN01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Deployment","counter":1024,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600053#WRN01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1025,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[5580\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600053#WRN01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the enforcement strategy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the new legislation banning smoking in cars with children; the financial resources and manpower that have been designated to ensure adherence to the law; the number of fines which have been imposed to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":1026,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that the legislation in question is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Health.

This provision introduces a new &lsquo;court review&rsquo;, where creditors such as a mortgage lender refuse an insolvent borrower&rsquo;s proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement to resolve debts which include the mortgage on their home. Previously, the creditors&rsquo; rejection was final. Under the new provision, the borrower can seek review by the relevant Court of the creditors&rsquo; refusal. The Court will consider the borrower&rsquo;s proposal using the criteria set out in <b><i><\/i><\/b>the 2015 amending legislation (Section 115A) and  the Court  may, if those criteria are satisfied, impose the personal insolvency arrangement proposed by the borrower. <\/p><p>The review provision came into effect on 20 November 2015, under  S.I. no 514\/2015 which I signed on 18 November.To coincide with the introduction of the new provisions, the Insolvency Service of Ireland held a number of training sessions around the country with Personal Insolvency Practitioners.<\/p><p>All applications for review under s. 115A are notified under the Insolvency Acts to the Insolvency Service, which will be publishing information on outcomes as part of its quarterly reports. As of 1 April 2016, 39 Circuit Court applications under s. 115A have been notified to the Insolvency Service. To date, nine of these have been determined by the Courts or settled between the parties. My officials will, of course, be carefully monitoring the operation in practice of this important reform.<\/p><p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Court review is also being complemented by a new Scheme of access to independent legal and financial aid and advice for those in home mortgage arrears, which I announced on 22 January this year. Intensive work on implementing this Aid and Advice Scheme has been under way across Government Departments and other relevant bodies. This has been led by my Department and by the Department of Social Protection, with the participation of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, the Legal Aid Board, the Citizens&rsquo; Information Board and MABS, the Money and Budgeting Service. It builds on a network of Dedicated Mortgage Arrears Advisers established in MABS offices across the country, which was announced by the Tanaiste and Minister for Social Protection in December 2015. <\/p><p>MABS will act as a single Government gateway to the new  Scheme, for people who are deep in debt and are at risk of losing their homes due to mortgage arrears. MABs advisers will help these borrowers, and advise them on their best options for returning to solvency and where possible for remaining in their homes. The MABS adviser will refer them, as needed, for financial advice to a Personal Insolvency Practitioner from a panel supervised by the Insolvency Service or an accountant  from a panel overseen by the Department of Social Protection, and for legal aid and advice to a solicitor from a panel operated by the Legal Aid Board. The Scheme will also provide for support in Court for an insolvent borrower subject to repossession proceedings affecting their home, under a new &lsquo;duty solicitor&rsquo; service, also operated by the Legal Aid Board. The aid and advice will be provided by the panel professional under a &lsquo;voucher&rsquo; system, and without charge to the borrower. A key element of the Scheme is a component which provides for legal aid to an insolvent homeowner in relation to the new Court review under s.115A of the Personal Insolvency Acts. This will also be operated by the Legal Aid Board.<\/p><p>Work on implementation is almost complete, and I expect the  Scheme to become operational in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600053#WRN04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":1059,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600053#WRN05000"},{"type":"question","counter":1060,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[5929\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600053#WRN05100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the residency status and eligibility of a person (details supplied) in County Limerick; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":1061,"content":"<p>The person concerned lodged an application for asylum at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner on 19th November 2014.

I met with Cystic Fibrosis Ireland on Monday 25th January to discuss the matter.<\/p>  <p>  Orkambi is a combination drug for the treatment of CF in patients with two copies of a specific CF gene mutation.  The drug was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2015 and by the European Medicines Agency on the 19th of November 2015.  In other words, Orkambi has only been licensed for use in the European Union within the last few months.  To date, it has not been approved for reimbursement by any public health service in Europe. <\/p>  <p>  Each country has its own process for approval. The Irish process is laid down in law in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  Under this law, the HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products under the community drug schemes in accordance with the provisions of the law.  It is appropriate that these should not be political decisions and that a scientific and evidence based approach is taken to determine the extent to which patients would benefit from treatment with expensive new drugs.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness, and the resources available to the HSE.  The process for approval of high-tech new drugs in Ireland involves three steps.  The first step involves a Rapid Review, which has been done.  The second involves a full Health Technology Assessment by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  This expert assessment is scientific and objective and will evaluate whether the claims being made about the benefits of a new drug are valid, and to what extent, in terms of its impact on life expectancy, quality of life, reducing hospital admissions, reduced need for transplants etc.  The NCPE will also consider which patient groups might benefit, how the drug compares with existing treatments and if it is cost-effective at the price being quoted by the manufacturer.  This usually takes about 90 days.  Orkambi's manufacturer, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, submitted an application to the HSE on 3 February 2016.  I have requested the NCPE to expedite this part of the process to less than 90 days, and the Director has confirmed that he believes this can be achieved.  However, it is not possible to provide status updates on the NCPE assessment while the assessment is still ongoing. <\/p>  <p>  Once the assessment is complete, a recommendation is made to the HSE, which may then engage in price negotiations with the manufacturer. <\/p>  <p>  A similar process is carried out in England by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which does not expect to make a recommendation until July.<\/p>  <p>  The process being followed is the same as that for other CF drugs like Kalydeco, new drugs to treat cancer and other rare diseases.  Orkambi will be treated in the same way as these were, and has to be, under the law.  This process is designed to secure the best value for the HSE, and the savings that accrue from this process can be used to fund other health service developments, for example isolation rooms for CF and cancer patients, better ambulance services, home supports for the elderly and safer maternity services.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that it will be possible for Orkambi to be approved for patients who will benefit from it, and at a fair price, but it must go through the normal approval procedure first, like all other high-tech medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600055#WRP02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":1217,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600055#WRP02750"},{"type":"question","counter":1218,"qnumday":422,"qnumall":"[5375\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600055#WRP02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the actions he is taking to improve care for patients with brain injuries (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1219,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.

Usually, the applicant furnished her birth certificate and copies of hospital records establishing that she had undergone a symphysiotomy.<\/p>  <p>  Hospital records received by the Scheme were copy documents and any medical reports obtained by the applicant&rsquo;s solicitor in support of a claim for significant disability were also copy documents.  The Scheme did not receive any originals of these records and the original documents remain in the hospitals&rsquo; records storage, local and national archives and in GP offices.  Contrary to recent reports in the media, it is important to note that the integrity of applicants' original records is not affected in any way by receipt of copy documents by the Scheme for the purpose of carrying out assessments.<\/p>  <p>  Over the last few weeks the Scheme has been writing to each applicant regarding her records.  More than two thirds of the women concerned have replied by the end of March, with 70% of the women seeking the return of their personal documents and 30% asking for the records to be confidentially shredded.  The Scheme is cognisant of an applicant&rsquo;s right to privacy protected by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and in line with this will ensure that documents containing personal information are not returned to anyone other than the woman herself. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Assessor of the Scheme received these copy records for the purpose of determining awards to women who met the criteria of the Symphysiotomy Payment Scheme only.  The Assessor is not at liberty to hold the records, or to request that they be archived, for any other purpose.  The Data Protection Commissioner has confirmed that data may only be used for the purpose for which it was supplied and for no other purpose.<\/p>  <p>  I have not received a request to meet the Groups representing the women affected by symphysiotomy to discuss the shredding of records.  Copies of records containing personal information were submitted to the independent Scheme directly by the women themselves, or their legal advisors.  Accordingly the Department does not have ownership or control of the documents and could not therefore have any role in the process.   <\/p>  <p>  The Assessor to the Scheme has informed my officials that she is aware that some applicants may have very particular and personal reasons for the non-delivery of documents to their home and the Scheme will respect those wishes.  Accordingly, the documents will be returned either to the applicant herself or, will be disposed of confidentially in accordance with the applicant&rsquo;s wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600055#WRP03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Marriages of Convenience","counter":1231,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600055#WRP03750"},{"type":"question","counter":1232,"qnumday":426,"qnumall":"[5418\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600055#WRP03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 496 of 20 October 2015, the progress made relating to the issue arising; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Any incident or allegation of abuse must be investigated by the provider and policies must be in place for the prevention, detection and response to abuse.  Furthermore, nursing home providers must notify HIQA of any allegation, suspected or confirmed, of abuse of any resident within 3 working days of its occurrence. <\/p><p>HIQA takes into account and uses all information received to inform and plan its regulatory activity.  Its programme of both scheduled and unannounced inspections helps to ensure standards are maintained, and where issues of non-compliance arise, these are addressed and rectified.  If a nursing home is found not to be in compliance with Regulations it can either fail to achieve or lose its registration status.<\/p><p>The HSE's <i>National Policy and Procedures for Safeguarding Vulnerable Adults<\/i>published in 2014, sets out a consistent approach to safeguarding and protecting persons at risk of abuse across both older people and disability services.  A National Office for Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons was established in the HSE in 2015.  In each Community Healthcare Organisation, a Safeguarding and Protection Team will work closely with all relevant service providers to support the timely and appropriate responses to concerns of abuse or neglect. <\/p><p>Services in the Sligo\/Leitrim area are an operational matter for the HSE and that aspect of your question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  <\/p><p>However, should the Deputy feel there is cause for serious immediate concerns he should contact Mr. Paschal Moynihan, Specialist and National Safeguarding Office, Tel: 061 461165 \/Email: paschal.moynihan@hse.ie<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600055#WRP04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1240,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600055#WRP04350"},{"type":"question","counter":1241,"qnumday":429,"qnumall":"[5449\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600055#WRP04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a person (details supplied) in County Longford will receive a hospital appointment for a medical procedure.","asker":"1250","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1242,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The process for approval of high-tech new drugs in Ireland involves three steps.  The first step involves a Rapid Review, which has been done.  The second involves a full Health Technology Assessment by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  This expert assessment is scientific and objective and will evaluate whether the claims being made about the benefits of a new drug are valid, and to what extent, in terms of its impact on life expectancy, quality of life, reducing hospital admissions, reduced need for transplants etc.  The NCPE will also consider which patient groups might benefit, how the drug compares with existing treatments and if it is cost-effective at the price being quoted by the manufacturer.  This usually takes about 90 days.  Orkambi's manufacturer, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, submitted an application to the HSE on 3 February 2016.  I have requested the NCPE to expedite this part of the process to less than 90 days, and the Director has confirmed that he believes this can be achieved. <\/p>  <p>  Once the assessment is complete, a recommendation is made to the HSE, which may then engage in price negotiations with the manufacturer. <\/p>  <p>  A similar process is carried out in England by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which does not expect to make a recommendation until July.<\/p>  <p>  The process being followed is the same as that for other CF drugs like Kalydeco, new drugs to treat cancer and other rare diseases.  Orkambi will be treated in the same way as these were, and has to be, under the law.  This process is designed to secure the best value for the HSE, and the savings that accrue from this process can be used to fund other health service developments, for example isolation rooms for CF and cancer patients, better ambulance services, home supports for the elderly and safer maternity services.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that it will be possible for Orkambi to be approved for patients who will benefit from it, and at a fair price, but it must go through the normal approval procedure first, like all other high-tech medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600056#WRQ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages","counter":1286,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600056#WRQ02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1287,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[5510\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600056#WRQ02200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive in County Clare is processing and awarding home care packages; the number of applications which were awarded in March 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1288,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable.  It is estimated that in up to 5% of cases it is necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences.  Patients are assessed by the HSE Orthodontic Service under the modified Index of Treatment Need.  Patients with the greatest level of need are provided with treatment by the HSE.  At the end of Q4 2015, waiting times in the HSE South region were as follows:<table><tr><th>Waiting time from assessment to commencement of treatment<\/th><th>Less than 2 years<\/th><th>2 to 4 years<\/th><th>More than 4 years<\/th><th>TOTAL<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Number of patients<\/td><td>2,483<\/td><td>1,364<\/td><td>164<\/td><td>4,011<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>In line with the HSE's aim to reduce the proportion of patients on the treatment waiting list for longer than four years, the number of patients waiting more than 4 years has fallen from 7.3% (306 patients) in Q3 2015 to 4.1% (164 patients) in Q4 2015.  Following a national procurement process, a panel of independent practitioners will be contracted by the HSE in the coming weeks to provide treatment for certain categories of misalignment.  The practitioners will be under contract over the next three years, with consideration of an extension to four years.  This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for four years or longer who are generally 16 years and over.  It is expected that this initiative will have a positive impact on waiting times. <\/p><p>In addition, a pilot scheme in the Dublin North East area (DNE), which involves upskilling staff to work as orthodontic therapists is currently under way.  A dental hygienist and a dental nurse qualified as orthodontic therapists in September 2015 and are now working in the HSE under the supervision of specialist orthodontists.  The scheme is currently undergoing an evaluation, which includes consideration of how the scheme is affecting waiting lists.  Figures are currently being collated and early indications are positive.  It is planned to extend the scheme nationally after the evaluation has been completed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600057#WRR00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1355,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600057#WRR00550"},{"type":"question","counter":1356,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[5631\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600057#WRR00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of the future of kidney transplants; the number of such transplants performed in each of the past five years; if a second transplant hospital will be immediately designated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1357,"content":"<p>The kidney transplant programme continues at Beaumont Hospital.

This year the Government will provide &euro;1.56 billion for health-funded services and supports to enable each individual with a disability to achieve their full potential and maximise their independence.  The quantum of service to be provided, together with key deliverables and priorities, are outlined in the HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2016.  The HSE is committed to protecting front-line services for people with disabilities, with targeted improvement in priority areas:<\/p><p>- the reconfiguration of children's therapy services, for which an additional &euro;4m has been provided;<\/p><p>- the provision of services for 1,500 young people on leaving school and rehabilitative training, which has been allocated an additional &euro;7.25m;<\/p><p>- the development of alternative respite models, with &euro;1m targeted funding;<\/p><p>- the reconfiguration of residential services, supported by &euro;20 million in capital funding, and<\/p><p>- quality improvements to increase compliance with <i>National Standards for Residential Centres for Children and Adults with Disabilities<\/i>.<\/p><p>Disability service provision is moving towards a community-based and inclusive model of person-centred supports, as recommended in the <i>Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services in Ireland<\/i>, and is being implemented through the<i>Transforming Lives<\/i>programme.

This new approach will be underpinned by a more effective method of assessing need, allocating resources and monitoring resource use.<\/p><p>The allocation of dedicated capital funding of &euro;100m for disability services over the period 2016&ndash;2021 (including the &euro;20m in 2016 for reconfiguration of residential services), together with the establishment of a Service Reform Fund which has been agreed between Atlantic Philanthropies, the DoH, HSE (Social Care and Mental Health Services) and Genio will support the phased transition to the person-centred model of services and supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600058#WRS04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1478,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600058#WRS04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1479,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[5894\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600058#WRS05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a surgical procedure will take place for a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":1480,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The report recommended that the number of critical care beds in the system should increase from 289 to 579 over the period 2010 to 2020 and the development of a  &lsquo;hub-and-spoke&rsquo; Model of Care for Adult Critical Care.  Since its establishment the HSE critical care clinical  programme has been working with service providers to develop the hub and spoke model whereby the more complex work is undertaken in the larger regional hospitals and critical care services in the some of the smaller hospital have been decommissioned.  The Model of Care for critical care was launched in October 2014. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme has carried out an annual census of critical care capacity and activity.  Based on the recently completed 2015 national census, there are currently 237 adult critical care beds in public hospitals.  It is acknowledged that there is a need to address the overall critical care bed capacity requirements.  The initial approach underway in the HSE is to work to opening the 25 exiting critical care beds that are closed due to nursing shortages and difficulties in recruiting nurse for critical care.  The HSE is putting in place a Critical Care Nursing Career Pathway initiative, facilitated by the Critical Care Programme, aimed at increasing the number of critical care nurses.     <\/p>  <p>  While it has not been possible in 2016 to provide for additional resources for critical care within the limited envelope of additional funding and competing priorities for acute services I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department and the HSE are committed to working together to try to address the capacity deficit over the coming years by prioritising this area for capital and revenue investment.   <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular queries raised by the Deputy regarding capacity and waiting times, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.

The Taoiseach also took the opportunity to address the issue of immigration reform in his speech at the Speaker&rsquo;s lunch at Capitol Hill, where he urged Republicans and Democrats to work together to find a way to resolve the plight of the undocumented Irish in the United States.  I also raised this issue during my visit to Washington and New York for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.<\/p>  <p>  Following my visit to Washington DC in September 2015, a Bill was tabled by Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner in the US House of Representatives.

The course is delivered in seminar  sessions\/group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design.  <\/p><p>  Sign language is an option in the Leaving Certificate Applied. There is also an opportunity for students to learn sign language in the course of Transition Year.  <\/p><p>  In addition, the Post-Primary Languages Initiative has developed a specification for a short course in Irish Sign Language (ISL) which is available as part of the new Junior Cycle.  The emphasis is on developing communication skills in ISL at level A1 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages).  This course develops students' ability to understand ISL in live and in recorded situations, to produce the language and to interact with other signers in a simple way and on familiar topics.  A link to the course is available at:  .<\/p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published its Policy Advice on the Education of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children in Ireland which makes a number of recommendations for the improvement of educational provision for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children, including recommendations relating to ISL provision.  This policy advice is available on the NCSE's website www.ncse.ie.  A number of the recommendations contained in the policy advice on the Education of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Children have been, or are currently in the process of being implemented.  My Department will continue to implement the recommendations in conjunction with other Departments and agencies where necessary, subject to the availability of resources. <\/p><p>  The National Council for Special Education has also published a parental information leaflet for parents of children who are Deaf of Hard of Hearing, which provides details of the supports which are available for such children.  <\/p><p>  Finally, the Deputy may be aware that assessment, rehabilitation and information services for children with hearing impairment and their families are funded by the Health Service Executive (HSE), either directly or indirectly.  Services provided include communication therapy and lip reading classes as well as sign language classes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600062#WRW02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1325"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Summer Works Scheme Applications","counter":1799,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600062#WRW02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1800,"qnumday":626,"qnumall":"[5354\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600062#WRW02500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of an application by a school (details supplied) in County Kerry under the summer works programme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1325"},{"type":"speech","counter":1801,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has no record of receiving an application from the school to which he refers under the Summer Works Scheme (SWS) 2016 and 2017.  <\/p><p>  While the school did not apply for any works under the recent SWS, it will be open to the school, if it so decides, to make an application under a future scheme.

The previous Government decided to reduce the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.  Overall, the removal of qualification allowances had the effect of further reducing the pay of new entrant teachers by between 5 and 7 percent.<\/p>  <p>  The measures above &ndash; which applied to new entrants only and which were in addition to the pay reductions imposed on public servants generally - were implemented at a time of extraordinarily difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State.  It is estimated that some 6,700 teachers who entered the profession since 2011 have been affected by the measures.<\/p>  <p>  The Haddington Road Agreement re-aligned the pay scale for teachers who entered teaching between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 with that of pre-2011 entrants.  An improved pay scale for post-1 February 2012 entrants was also agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement will begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years.  The flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement are proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600063#WRX05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1325"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Educational Psychological Service","counter":1949,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600063#WRX05950"},{"type":"question","counter":1950,"qnumday":677,"qnumall":"[5695\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600063#WRX06000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to investigate the case of a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1240","askee":"1325"},{"type":"speech","counter":1951,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychology service to all primary and post primary schools through an assigned NEPS psychologist and in some cases through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.<\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Equal Status Act, schools are not permitted to discriminate in admission on any of the grounds set out in the Act.  However the Act contains an exemption which permits schools in which the objective is to provide education that promotes certain religious values, to admit a student of a particular religion in preference to others. <\/p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2015 published in April of last year contained a number of important changes to make enrolment policies fairer and more transparent.  The issue of the need to amend the Equal Status Act was not a feature of the consultation paper published in advance of the Admission to Schools Bill. When the Oireachtas committee considered this matter, it simply noted that \"there is a potential tension between Articles 42 (Education) and 44 (Religion) of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, and this poses a particular difficulty when legislating in this policy area.\"  No amendment to the Equal Status Act has been included in the published Admission to Schools Bill.

This Government has made considerable progress in implementing the recommendations set out in the Strategy, significantly advancing the goal of achieving a modernised, more flexible and responsive higher education system that is accountable for high quality performance across the full range of higher education activities. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the institute of technology sector, the Strategy recommended significant reforms to position the sector to meet national strategic objectives.  In particular, the Strategy recommended consolidation within the sector and a pathway of evolution for those consolidated institutes of technology, to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria and to apply to become technological universities. <\/p>  <p>  The main purpose of the Technological Universities Bill, which was published in December 2015, is to give effect to the recommendations set out in the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 with regard to the institute of technology sector, including the development of a new technological university model.  In addition, the Bill provides for a number of important reforms to the governance and operation of the existing institutes of technology.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill sets out the process for the establishment of technological universities.  These institutions will be distinctly different from traditional universities and institutes of technology by virtue of their mission. This differentiated mission includes &ndash;<\/p>  <p> - a systematic focus on the preparation of graduates for complex professional roles in a changing technological world, <\/p>  <p> - the advancement of knowledge through applied research and scholarship and the dissemination of this knowledge to meet the needs of society and enterprise, and <\/p>  <p> - the particular contribution the university will make to the needs of the region in which it is located. <\/p>  <p>  The Technological University Bill, as published, reflects technological universities' multi-campus nature and their regional focus.  Merging institutes will be multi-campus entities which will continue to provide a broad range of programmes of education and training in each of their campuses.  These institutions will be linked to industry, and will have an enormous impact on our capacity to create and retain jobs in regions such as the South-East and the North-West.<\/p>  <p>  I want to be very clear on this point - the development of technological universities has the potential to deliver greater opportunity to students in these regions, to staff working in the institutions, and to the broader local economy and society.  While merging institutes will be required to establish unified governance and management structures, they will be multi-campus entities which will continue to provide a broad range of programmes of education and training in each of their campuses.  Indeed, by creating institutions of greater scale and strength, high quality multi-campus technological universities will be able to bring greater social and economic benefits to their respective regions through the delivery of a broad range of high quality education and training in each of their campuses.  <\/p>  <p>  I would also like to underline that this is much more than a rebranding exercise &ndash; the institutions concerned are required to merge and to achieve high standards across a range of areas before being designated as technological universities.  These include standards relating to the qualifications of staff, the quality of research output, the proportion of students engaged in lifelong learning, and other relevant issues.<\/p>  <p>  I would also note that the policy underpinning the Technological Universities Bill has been developed over a significant period.  The National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 was adopted in 2011, the Programme for Government included a commitment to the establishment of a multi-campus technological university in the South East, the Higher Education Authority published the criteria for designation as a technological university in 2012, the General Scheme of the Bill was published, and was subject to Oireachtas Scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection in April of 2014.  I am aware that the TUI participated in this process, and many of the Committee's recommendations have been taken into account during the drafting of the Technological Universities Bill. <\/p>  <p>  The procedure for application for designation as a technological university, as set out in the Technological Universities Bill 2015, is a reiteration of the fourth and final stage of the earlier published 'process and criteria for designation as a technological university'.  The proposed consolidations now emerging within the institute of technology sector, and the development of technological universities as a result, will protect and enhance the distinctive career and enterprise focused missions of institutions in the traditional institute of technology sector while also enhancing their strength and scale.  This improvement in scale will be particularly important in relation to the challenge that applicants for technological university status must address in improving their competitive position nationally and internationally.<\/p>  <p>  Two of the consortiums have successfully passed stage 3 of the four-stage process which involved the assessment of their project plans by an international panel of experts.  These are the TU4Dublin consortium, made up of Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology, Tallaght and the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown, and the Munster Technological University consortium, made up of Cork Institute of Technology and the Institute of Technology Tralee. <\/p>  <p>  As these proposals have progressed through the four stage process I have reiterated the importance of, and the need for, a process of consultation and engagement with all staff and students. <\/p>  <p>  The mergers outlined above cannot proceed until the Technological Universities Bill has been enacted and the relevant provisions commenced.  Therefore this Bill, in providing the legislative underpinning for those institutes of technology who have established partnerships and wish to merge, represents an essential milestone in the modernisation and reform agenda for higher education institutions.<\/p>  <p>  I would also like to point out that institutes of technology which do not choose to follow the evolutionary path set out in the National Strategy for Higher Education, and in this Bill, will continue to make an important contribution to higher education and particularly to the development of their region. <\/p>  <p>  The National Strategy recommended that the governance structures of all higher education institutions should be reformed to ensure that they are fit for purpose and have the expertise relevant to the governance of a modern higher education institution.  The Technological Universities Bill 2015 sets out a detailed and appropriate legislative framework for the reform of the institute of technology sector and for the establishment of a new type of higher education institution, technological universities.<\/p>  <p>  I am firmly of the view that its passage will enable the technological sector to continue to provide high quality education and research as part of a more coherent and coordinated higher education system.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the position of the Technological Universities Bill, this Bill was at Report Stage at the time of dissolution of the previous D&aacute;il in February 2016.  There is no finalised timeframe for the enactment of this legislation; however, since the Committee Stage of the Bill, my Department has engaged directly with the TUI on its concerns in relation to the Bill.  I have also met directly with TUI representatives.  As a result of this engagement and the Committee Stage debate, I tabled a number of amendments at Report Stage to deal with some of the concerns raised directly with me.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to re-iterate that the TUI, as staff representatives, have consistently sought a full process of consultation in relation to both the process and the legislation, and this has been followed through on by myself, as Minister, the Department and the respective institutes involved in the process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600064#WRY04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1325"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Enrolments Data","counter":2025,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600064#WRY04950"},{"type":"question","counter":2026,"qnumday":703,"qnumall":"[5981\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600064#WRY05000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of children who were unsuccessful in securing a junior infant place in a school (details supplied) in County Dublin for the year 2016-2017; the number of these children who were in category 1, Catholics in the immediate catchment area; the number in category 2, non-Catholics in the immediate catchment area; the actions she is taking to increase primary school capacity given the number of children who failed to secure a local school place and the future housing developments in the area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1325"},{"type":"speech","counter":2027,"content":"<p>My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area.

The enrolment policy must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.  However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary and this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.

Being tentative in nature, this estimate is not sufficiently robust for use as a final estimated expenditure figure.  As I noted in my reply, it is difficult to accurately forecast final expenditure on this programme as it will run until next September and public beneficiary bodies generally fund the cost of EGF measures from national budgets and subsequently submit expenditure declarations\/claims during and following completion of the programme.  I did however, indicate that take-up of EGF support measures was less than anticipated.  Lower take-up will result in lower than expected expenditure.<\/p><p>The 3rd implementation report on the programme, published on the dedicated website <i>www.egf.ie<\/i>, recorded 352 participants in EGF programme measures by mid-December 2015, including 215 former workers and 137 young people under 25 years who are not in employment, education or training (NEETS).  Compared with the targets of assisting 250 former workers and 200 young people, these figures suggest a reach of 86% and 68% respectively.  In terms of the former workers, the report notes the evidence of the improving national economic climate in the re-integration into employment of 65% of the LTAI workforce as at December 2015.  While a positive development, a high re-integration rate will reduce the need to call on EGF supports.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware the Andersen Ireland EGF programme closes next month.  The published implementation reports on that programme indicate a reach of 96% of former workers and 95% of young unemployed people.  The re-integration into employment rate for Andersen former workers at October 2015 was 69%.<\/p><p>The PWAI EGF programme is at an earlier stage of implementation and will run until June 2017.<\/p><p>While I am arranging for details of my Department's internal working estimates to be forwarded to the Deputy as requested, I would similarly caution that the figures are tentative and liable to change.<\/p><p>Efforts will continue until the end of all current EGF programmes to maximise the supports provided to programme beneficiaries.  Each programme has a consultative forum in place, with an independent chairperson, worker and NEET representatives as well as the relevant State bodies and service providers.  These structures facilitate programme implementation to be monitored and the proposal of new measures within the relevant EGF programmes.  Increased emphasis is being placed on supporting NEET persons within the current EGF programmes, with ongoing engagement with both mainstream public and private service providers, the Department of Social Protection and various community and voluntary organisations.  In this context a number of new tailored programmes are currently being developed for NEET persons.<\/p><p>The EGF process in Ireland was comprehensively reviewed by the Department in 2012 including a public consultation element.  A survey of those eligible under the current EGF programmes is being commissioned by the SOLAS National EGF Coordination Unit.  The results of these surveys will be examined prior to considering the need for a further review of the programmes.<\/p><p>There are a range of support measures available to eligible beneficiaries under the approved EGF programmes.  Ultimately the take-up of supports is dependent on a large measure of personal choice by, and the personal circumstances of, hundreds of individuals across a two year timeframe.  Where the take-up of EGF measures turns out to be less than initially estimated two years previously, including where different, sometimes less costly or shorter term measures are availed of by individual beneficiaries, this impacts on final expenditure.  Therefore, a range of factors, including the prevailing national, regional or local economic and employment situations, dictate final expenditure on any EGF programme.<\/p><p>This situation is not unique to Ireland with the majority of EU Member States returning co-funding balances at programme end.  For example, the average EGF budget implementation rate for all 73 EGF programmes encompassed by the European Commission's ex-post evaluation report 2007 &ndash; 2013, which was published in August 2015, stood at 55%, with the lowest being only 3%, whereas the average rate for the first seven completed Irish EGF programmes was 60%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600065#WRZ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1264"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2068,"content":"<p>Question No. 719 answered with Question No. 702.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":2069,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600065#WRZ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":2070,"qnumday":720,"qnumall":"[6109\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600065#WRZ02200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her plans to provide a new building for a school (details supplied) in County Meath.","asker":"1218","askee":"1325"},{"type":"speech","counter":2071,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that a major building project for the school to which he refers was included on the six-year Construction Plan announced last November and is expected to proceed to construction in 2019-2021.

All mainstream primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources under the GAM to cater for children with high incidence special educational needs or learning support needs.  In post primary schools, similar general allocations have been made to schools to support pupils with high incidence, or learning support, needs.<\/p><p>  It is a matter for individual schools to use their professional judgement to identify pupils who will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils.  Schools are supported in this regard by guidance from the National Educational Psychological Services.<\/p><p>  Separately, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocates additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular SP. Ed 02\/05. <\/p><p>  I am advised that the diagnosis of Global Development Delay is generally reserved for children under the age of 5 years, when the clinical severity level cannot be reliably assessed during early childhood.  This category is diagnosed when an individual fails to meet expected developmental milestones in several areas of intellectual functioning, and applies to individuals who are unable to undergo systematic assessment on intellectual functioning, including children who are too young to participate in standardised testing.  This category requires reassessment after a period of time.<\/p><p>  Pupils who have learning support needs, and who have a diagnosis of Global Development Delay, may therefore receive resource teaching\/learning support from a schools General Allocation Model, pending further assessment. <\/p><p>  Where pupils with Global Development Delay may be subsequently assessed as having a low incidence special educational need, such as a moderate general learning difficulty, or one of the other categories of low incidence disability set out in DES Circular 02\/05, an additional allocation of resource teaching time may be made to the school to support the child. <\/p><p>  The criteria for the provision of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support is set out in my Departments Circular DES 30\/2014. <\/p><p>This Circular details that SNA support will be provided to assist children with special educational needs, who also have assessed additional and significant care needs, in an educational context.  As such, support is provided on a basis of an assessment of special educational care needs, as opposed to being based primarily on a diagnosis of a particular disability.  Pupils who have Global Development Delay, and who also have been assessed as having significant care needs may therefore qualify for SNA support, if required.<\/p><p>  The NCSE will consider all applications for SNA or resource teaching support made by schools.  Schools will be advised of their resource teaching allocations for the 2016\/17 school year, prior to the end of the current school year.<\/p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.

The housing units are secured under long-term leases\/availability arrangements between local authorities and AHBs.<\/p><p>In addition, capital support is made available to AHBs through the Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF), which provides an up-front capital payment of up to 30% of the relevant construction or acquisition cost of a project, facilitating AHBs in raising private finance, including from the Housing Finance Agency (HFA), to acquire or build new social housing units.  The capital advance is repayable by the AHB to the local authority at the end of a payment and availability agreement, usually 30 years.  All proposals for CALF are submitted to my Department by AHBs for review and to ensure that the project complies with the terms of the CALF and that there are sufficient funds available.

The introduction of pay-by- weight (PBW) charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure.<\/p><p>From 1 July 2015, the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2015 required that household kerbside waste collected in approved reusable receptacles (such as bins or caddies) must be weighed by appropriate weighing systems and that this weight reported to the householder at a frequency of at least once a month.<\/p><p>Roll-out of those requirements was very positive, with local authorities and industry engaging on an extensive compliance assistance programme.

The primary purpose of the Scheme was to assist in the gradual unwinding of loans taken out by housing authorities to purchase land for the social and affordable housing investment programme.  <\/p><p>Applications to the value of some &euro;163 million in loans were accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme. In respect of &euro;111 million, the loans were fully redeemed by local authorities with funding recouped from my Department, under the original terms of the Scheme.  The remaining &euro;52 million is in the form of annuity loans, for which local authorities are making repayments to the Housing Finance Agency.  Such annuity repayments are recoupable from my Department subject to the local authority complying with the terms of the Scheme.<\/p><p>In 2013, following a review of the Scheme carried out in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it became evident that further expenditure on the Land Aggregation Scheme, in terms of accepting new applications, was no longer a sustainable option.  The review concluded with the issuance of Circular 35\/2013 on 11 December 2013, notifying Local Authorities of the discontinuance of the Scheme in respect of new applications.<\/p><p>The focus of the Scheme has now shifted to the management and future utilisation of the lands included in the Scheme.  The Housing Agency is the primary body with responsibility for bringing forward recommendations for the optimum utilisation of LAGS lands in consultation with relevant local authorities and subject to Ministerial approval. Details of the sites accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme are set out in the tables below.<\/p><p>The Housing Agency, in consultation with my Department and local authorities, is updating data and developing a detailed database and GIS map of local authority owned lands, as well as the Land Aggregation Scheme lands, showing their location, size, boundaries and other information.<\/p><p>The Housing Agency is also responsible for managing the transfer process including technical and legal aspects.  Of the 73 sites accepted into the Scheme, 67 have now fully transferred to the ownership of the Agency.  The remaining 6 sites are at an advanced stage in the transfer process.<\/p><p>It is a matter for the relevant local authority and the Housing Agency to resolve all outstanding matters affecting the transfer.  In particular, each local authority must ensure that transfer conditions are met.  The Housing Agency must satisfy itself that any required actions have been satisfactorily undertaken prior to any land transfer taking place.<\/p><p>My Department maintains regular contact with the Agency regarding progress made on land transfers and the potential development of such lands.  I have asked the Agency to continue to prioritise the transfer of lands and to work with the local authorities concern ed in finalising outstanding transfers.<\/p><p><b>Table 1: Sites accepted under the first phase of the Scheme<\/b>(<b>Loan capital &amp;amp;

This policy is set out in the White Paper published in 2015, Ireland&rsquo;s Transition to a Low Carbon Future 2015-2030.  The Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy is a charge on all electricity consumers and is a support mechanism used for two very important objectives.  Firstly, it supports electricity generation which was constructed for security of supply purposes, including peat generation.  Secondly, it supports the development of renewable electricity, which is important for both security of supply and for reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation.  The PSO levy is vital to enable Ireland to meet its 40% target for electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020, which in turn is important for the achievement of Ireland's 16% EU 2020 target for renewable energy.<\/p>  <p>  The levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers.  It has been in place since 2001. The legal basis for the PSO levy and its method of calculation are set out in regulations made under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (S.I. 217 of 2002).  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) determines the PSO levy in accordance with the legislation, which is a charge on all electricity customers without exception.  Electricity consumers are classified into the following three groups: i) households ii) small users (maximum import capacity of less than 30 kVA) and iii) medium to large users (maximum import capacity of equal to or greater than 30 kVA).  The annual PSO levy amount for 2015\/2016 is &euro;325.3 million compared to &euro;335 million in 2014\/2015.  This equates to &euro;60.09 per annum for residential customers, &euro;214.50 per annum for small business consumers and &euro;30.14\/kVA for medium and large business users.<\/p>  <p>  While I fully understand and appreciate concerns about the cost of the PSO levy to customers, it is the Government&rsquo;s position that increasing the share of renewable energy in electricity generation in Ireland will enable Ireland to reduce its fossil fuel dependence and vulnerability to rises in international fossil fuel prices.\u00a0 The PSO levy supports that development and increased security of supply in electricity generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600067#WRBB05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mobile Telephony Services","counter":2286,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600067#WRBB05650"},{"type":"question","counter":2287,"qnumday":797,"qnumall":"[6073\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016040600067#WRBB05700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the outcome of discussions he has had with the Commission for Communications Regulation or with mobile telephone companies regarding the inadequate mobile telephone coverage particularly in County Cavan and in County Monaghan; if he has any proposals to improve coverage without further delay; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
