Ms Hazel Sheridan, superintending veterinary inspector, will speak on the animal health regulation.  Mr. Tom Loftus is a principal officer in the meat hygiene division and will address the fees element of my presentation.  Mr. Donal Coleman is a senior inspector of plant reproductive material.  We do not have one official with us that perhaps we should have to speak on plant health law, but he was called away to a meeting in Vilnius.  He will be available if the committee feels the needs to speak to him.  I am a senior veterinarian and my main area of responsibility is food safety in the veterinary area.  I will address the proposal on official controls.  We will all say a few words and then take questions.<\/p><p>  I thank the Chairman for inviting us.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is happy to have this opportunity to discuss these proposals with the committee to ensure the application of food and feed law, rules on animal health, plant health, plant reproductive material and plant protection products.  As indicated in the information note provided for the committee, Ireland welcomes the broad thrust of the draft proposal on officials controls, subject to consideration of the detail of each article which is taking place in Brussels.  On 6 May, after much internal discussion, the Commission adopted a series of proposals which have been called, A New Package for Healthier Animals and Plants for a Safer Food Chain, a racy title.  The package consists of four proposals on rules for specific sectors and official controls in these sectors and also a fifth relating to the management of expenditure in these sectors, which is separate.  The four proposals are on plant health law; rules on seeds and propagating plants; animal health law; and rules on official controls that will apply in each area.  All four are being debated in Council working groups and will in the near future also be debated in committees of the European Parliament.  I understand the proposals on plant health law, animal health and welfare and plant propagation products will be discussed by the agriculture committee, while the proposal on official controls will go to the environment committee.<\/p><p>  I will comment on the proposal relating to the rules on official controls.  Regulation 882\/2004 on official controls is in place and performs to ensure compliance by operators with food and feed rules, animal health and animal welfare.  If agreed, this proposal will replace that regulation.  The regulation will be addressed to competent authorities.  Essentially, it is designed to tell us how we perform our duties and will lay down rules for how these authorities must implement official controls and perform other official activities relating to operators, including farmers, food companies, feed companies, restaurants, caterers, retailers etc.  The competent authorities affected by this proposal will be the Department, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority in the context of fisheries, the Health Service Executive in the context of restaurants and retail establishments and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.<\/p><p>  Under the proposal, the competent authority must have sufficient resources; officers must be properly trained and controls must operate according to documented procedures, be risk-based, as much as possible, be unannounced and carried out in an efficient manner without creating undue difficulty or putting undue expense on the operators.  A report must be generated after every control and a copy given to the operator in order that he or she will know the outcome of the inspection or audit.  Operators must be given an opportunity to appeal the outcome of a control and annual reports must be produced on the activities carried out.<\/p><p>  This proposal will differ slightly from the existing regulation in so far it will have a broader scope.  It will cover plant health law and plant reproductive material, which the existing regulation does not, and will concern the new rules for these areas when they are agreed.  In addition, the new regulation will apply to the new rules on animal health when they are agreed.  Ms Sheridan will comment on these.  This will include rules relating to residues of veterinary medicines.<\/p> <p>It will apply common rules to all animals and goods of animal and plant origin entering and leaving the EU.  Implementation will be carried out in border control posts, which is slightly different to the current system.  The regulation will apply \"Lisbonisation\" rules by allowing for the introduction of implementing rules and delegated rules and the conversion of some existing regulations into implementing acts or delegated acts, as appropriate.  It will commit to the development of integrated information management systems across the community.  The regulation will require that the carrying out of official controls be self-financing through the collection of fees.  There will be exceptions for micro-industries - namely, those employing less than ten people and with an annual turnover of less than &euro;2 million - and certain rules in other sectors, such as organic products.  My colleague will address the matter of fees.<\/p><p> There will be tougher penalties for non-compliance, which in general must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.  Where intentional violations of the provisions of the regulation are discovered, financial penalties must at least offset the economic advantage sought by the operator through the violation.  This is an attempt to address food fraud.<\/p><p> The proposal was developed by the Commission through a series of working group meetings with experts from member states during the course of 2012.  In the early part of 2013, all of the internal discussions took place within the Commission's services.  They were quite protracted.  It was not until 6 May of this year that the proposal was published.  That left very little time for the Irish Presidency to make any progress on it.  On 7 and 8 May, the days following publication, a two-day seminar was held in Brussels under the auspices of the Irish Presidency and COPA-COGECA, the umbrella body for industry stakeholders, to discuss the proposals.  We had one meeting of a Council working group during the Irish Presidency, which I chaired.  Two subsequent meetings were held during the summer and in September.  Two further meetings will take place during the Lithuanian Presidency and then we will have to see how we get on when the Greek Presidency begins.<\/p><p> The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is representing Ireland at these meetings.  I generally speak at the meetings.  We work in consultation with the Department of Health and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  We have pre-meetings with both agencies.  In addition, there was a period of public consultation and we received a number of submissions from stakeholders.  The public consultation period ended on 27 September and we received four submissions on the proposal.  The proposal is a long one.  There are 162 articles and to date we have only reached Article 24.  Progress is difficult because of the widened scope of the regulation and there are many stakeholders even among the competent authorities that are affected by it.  Discussions are slow and it will be some years before finality is reached.  That is as far as we have got.  If I may, I will hand over to my colleague who will discuss fees.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013100800003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381237800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman.  The opportunity to discuss the European Commission proposals relating to official controls along the agrifood chain, and particularly the proposals relating to fees for such controls, is welcome.  I will cover the current cost recovery regime, proposals for change, and the Department's current position on the proposals.<\/p><p>  Current EU rules under Regulation (EC) No. 882\/2004 require charging of mandatory inspection fees only for a limited range of official control activities; principally, controls in the meat and milk sectors and controls at borders.  Historically, these were the areas in which methods of control by various member states were first harmonised at EU level.  External research, carried out in 2009 for the EU, concluded that the overall objective of ensuring that adequate financial resources are provided to perform official controls is not being met throughout the EU.  It also pointed out the unfairness of a system to which only certain sectors contribute and which does not discriminate effectively between compliant and non-compliant behaviour.  A further study in 2011 highlighted the difficulty in quantifying overall control costs, and a diverse spread in cost recovery between member states.<\/p><p>  The Commission proposal is designed to ensure full cost recovery by extending mandatory fees to cover all controls performed on businesses operating under food and feed hygiene regulations, as well as operators defined in plant health and plant reproductive material, PRM, law.  Microenterprises would be exempt in order to fulfil a commitment to lower the burden on very small businesses.<\/p><p>  The rationale behind the Commission proposal is as follows: to generate a reliable flow of funding to maintain controls at a level justified by the risks; to ensure that business activities that benefit from efficient controls participate in financing them; to minimise dependency on funding from public finances; and to prevent discriminatory treatment between operators located in a member state where the user-pays rule applies and those located in a member state where that is not the case.  It is proposed that fees may either be calculated at a flat rate, on the basis of the overall costs being spread across all operators in a particular category, or on the basis of direct application of the actual costs of each individual official control.<\/p><p>  The two main areas where cost is recovered in Ireland at present are the meat and milk sectors.  The amount recovered from the milk sector, through a levy of 0.1 cent per litre of processed milk, was &euro;5.2 million in 2012.  These receipts are sufficient to fully recover the cost of the Department's food safety inspection service in the sector.  Fees paid in the meat sector are mainly based on the level of throughput - for example, unit fees for animals slaughtered, ranging from &euro;5 for cattle to &euro;0.01 for small poultry.  The amount recovered by the Department from the meat sector in 2012 was &euro;15.2 million.  There has been a significant change in the Department's meat inspection service in recent years, both in how the service is delivered and in the associated costs.  The cost of the service has been reduced from &euro;41.9 million in 2008 to &euro;29.5 million in 2012.  Cost recovery consequently increased from 35% to 52% over the same period.<\/p><p>  As indicated in the information note for the committee, Ireland welcomes the broad thrust of the draft proposal, subject to consideration of the detail of each proposal, which is now under way.  Ireland welcomes the focus on improving the link between fees and compliance but, in common with other member states, has some concerns about the proposals relating to the introduction of new fee arrangements.  Specific concerns of the Department relate to the proposed extension of full mandatory fee collection within the food and feed sectors and on to the plant sectors; the prescriptive nature of the proposed new collection system - flexibility should be provided to retain existing systems, which work well, have industry acceptance and can deliver equivalent results; the consequence of a diverse spread of cost recovery between member states persisting under the new regime, which will be that industries in member states which most thoroughly implement the new regulation will be at a competitive disadvantage; the difficulty of achieving full cost recovery across the board, which, for practical reasons, might be better phased in over a period of years.<\/p><p>  In addition to detailed discussions now under way in Brussels, the Department is liaising with the FSAI and the Department of Health on this matter and is also engaging with industry representatives.  It is to be expected that the Department's and Ireland's position will evolve as discussions progress.  That concludes my statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013100800004#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Loftus"},{"type":"speech","time":1381237800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Are members happy for us to take the other two general statements?

We are seeking to consolidate existing legislation in the area, particularly in terms of the technical aspect of the work.  At the moment the relevant areas are covered by 12 specific directives.<\/p> <p>The current proposal aims to consolidate these into one overarching Council regulation with enabling provisions.  It should fit in very much with the terms of the overall package on healthier animals and plants in a safer food chain.  The Commission is aiming for a certain amount of coherence in what it does rather than fundamental change.  It is a more evolutionary process in the plant area.<\/p><p> I will go through the technical changes, or substantive changes, that are being proposed in the plants area.  A register of professional operators, largely processors and propagators, is to be put in place.  To avoid duplication or excessive bureaucracy, it will be same register my colleagues will use for plant health matters in respect of traceability.  We will have a one-stop-shop in terms of the registration of professional processors.<\/p><p> I am very conscious that small growers, private growers and those who exchange materials, including amateur gardeners, will not be excessively controlled in that they will not be required to register material.  They will be able to buy, sell, trade and exchange material very much as they can at present.  There is a specific feeling that we should not be overly bureaucratic or regulatory in that manner.<\/p><p> Forestry is coming under the broad remit for the first time.  There will be no specific or fundamental change to the forestry regulations.  Forestry will be covered under plant reproductive material purely because, as with other plants, materials in this sector are the first part of the chain, be it for food or industrial production.  There is coherence in the approach.<\/p><p> It is proposed that there should be a lesser burden on professional operators such as processors and assemblers by making it possible to devolve certain activities and tasks, currently being carried out largely by the Department and regulatory bodies, if the industry wants this under the supervision of the competent authority.  It would allow a little more flexibility and efficiency within the industry, if the industry so requires it.<\/p><p> We want to enhance availability and promote biodiversity in terms of so-called niche or local small-scale production.  I refer to small-scale locally adapted varieties.  I refer to heterogeneous material, which is another term for local populations of plants adapted to local use.  We want conservation varieties to be marketed with a very low level of interference or control so there will be a balance between the overall approach to control of commercial production and the allowance of local small-scale production.  <\/p><p> There will be a new EU register of new varieties.  This is more a technical development than a substantive one.  We will allow for the sustained testing of new varieties.  The ministry currently tests for value for cultivation and use.  I refer to largely commercial evaluation of new crop varieties.  The new regulation will also provide for widening the scope of evaluation to take into account sustainability factors, such as pest resistance and ability to thrive in low-input systems, such that a more comprehensive range of material can be offered by us, certainly in the coming environment.<\/p><p> With regard to specific provisions, the Community Plant Variety Office has a limited range of functions in this area.  They mainly concern plant breeders&rsquo; rights.  The scope of its work will now be extended to provide some supports, training and administration in this area to member state authorities.<\/p><p> I will not deal specifically with the mandatory fees and controls, which comprise a horizontal issue across all the four areas.  Progress on the regulation is very much analogous to the position outlined by my colleagues.  Bearing in mind the Irish Presidency's open discussion on it, it will take a long time, or some years, before the overarching regulation and detailed implementing rules are all agreed.  The European Parliament agriculture committee has had at least two short views of the regulation and is beginning to prepare its response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013100800004#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Donal Coleman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381238400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I invite Ms Hazel Sheridan to address COM (2013) 260, a proposal for an animal health regulation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013100800005#D00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381238400,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I will read a short statement to deal with the background and core components of the regulation and the timescale envisaged.<\/p><p>  The text in relation to the proposed animal health regulation was first presented to the European Council in May of this year.  The background and aims of the proposal are described in the earlier information note for the committee. The proposed animal health regulation, when it comes into force, will be the main legislative instrument implementing the goals and objectives of the EU animal health strategy. The regulation will not be implemented for three years after the date of its adoption.  It is envisaged that it will take two years to work its way through the various committees.  We are now in year one of that process.  The period of three years after the regulation is published is to allow the Commission time to draw up and agree the many delegated and implementing Acts mentioned in the regulation.<\/p><p>  The regulation seeks to consolidate and simplify existing rules by creating a single regulatory framework that will replace more than 40 existing directives and regulations.  As well as taking account of existing rules, the regulation seeks to provide for the future and for differences between member states by laying down a set of general principles for the prevention and control of animal diseases.  These general principles will be fleshed out in a series of delegated and implementing Acts.  In the words of the European Commission, the regulation represents evolution, not revolution.<\/p><p>  The regulation will apply not just to production animals; it will also apply to fish, wild animals and pet animals.  The regulation contains increased emphasis on prevention rather than cure, which is consistent with the overall vision of the EU animal health strategy.  Prevention measures focus on increased bio-security at farms during transport and at the borders of the European Union; enhanced surveillance; requirements for disease notification and reporting; and a clearer policy on the use of vaccines and other veterinary medicinal products for disease control and prevention.<\/p><p>  The regulation focuses on preparedness, laying down requirements in relation to contingency planning, simulation exercises and prescribed disease-eradication programmes.  The regulation contains a suite of emergency measures that can be implemented at member state or EU level when the need arises.  It provides for an enhanced response to emerging diseases, beginning with surveillance and contingency planning, and disease control measures in the event of the outbreak of an emerging disease.<\/p><p>  The regulation uses a risk-based approach to deal with animal diseases.  At the centre of the regulation will be a list of diseases of EU significance.  The list is currently being drawn up by the Commission as part of a joint exercise with the OIE, the international body for animal health in the context of the WTO arrangement.  This list will be contained in an implementing Act.  The regulation provides for a hierarchy of control measures and each disease will be attached to one or more sets of control measures, depending on its significance within the Union.<\/p><p>  At the core of the regulation is the principle that primary responsibility for animal health lies with animal owners and industry.  In that context, the regulation lays down responsibilities not just for competent authorities but also for operators, animal professionals, pet keepers, veterinarians and aquatic animal health professionals.<\/p><p>  The regulation is designed to facilitate trade by providing for enhanced convergence with international standards, principally those laid down in the OIE code.  This convergence extends to terrestrial animals the use of compartments, a concept that has been used in the fish and poultry sectors to facilitate the continuation of trade during outbreaks of an exotic disease, most recently avian influenza.<\/p><p>  The regulation is part of a package and, as such, it is very closely allied to the proposed official controls regulation in that the latter will require the competent authority - in this case, staff - to carry out official controls on all operators to ensure compliance with the provisions of the animal health regulation.  In addition, the official controls regulation will regulate activities that fall under the definition of other official activities carried out by the Department, as provided for in the animal health regulation.<\/p><p>  The first reading of the draft animal health regulation began with a meeting held in June under the Irish Presidency and has continued with two further meetings, one held in July and one held in September.<\/p> <p>Three further meetings are planned for this year, in October, November and December, by which time it is expected the first read-through of the legislation will have been completed.  Once the first read-through has been completed, it is expected the Presidency and the Council will produce a revised text incorporating the comments of member states.<\/p><p> A number of member states have expressed concern about the number of delegated and implementing Acts mentioned in the regulation, commenting that it is very difficult to assess the implications of the legislation without knowing what will be included in the delegated and implementing Acts.  In response, the Commission has suggested that drafting the delegated and implementing Acts ahead of agreeing the general principles is to put the cart before the horse.  However, it has agreed to produce a draft of the implementing Acts that will list the diseases considered to be of EU significance and decide what control measures will apply to each disease.  It intends to present this document to the chief veterinary officers before year end.  In the context of the delegated and implementing Acts, Ireland has commented on the need to provide for flexibility at member state level with regard to certain provisions.<\/p><p> In summary, we are in the very early stages of the process.  The regulation will have to be adopted by co-decision procedure and, as I said, the timeframe for adoption is two years, followed by three further years of delay to give the Commission time to draw up the various implementing and delegated regulations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013100800005#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Hazel Sheridan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381239000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Sheridan.

Ms Sheridan used the phrase \"co-decision\" which definitely means it will take a while.  In essence, what we are trying to do is condense a lot of existing legislation into four regulations.

I am sure there is not a farmer in the country who would not wish to have a healthier product, but this seems heavy handed to the extent that responsibility is being laid, disproportionately, at the door of farmers.<\/p> <p>A significant amount of training and information would need to be given to farmers to get them to a point where they would be able to keep to these requirements.

The articles often contain phrases such as &ldquo;the Commission shall be empowered to introduce delegated or implementing Acts&rdquo;.  That is where the detail will be described.  To some extent, we do not quite know exactly how these details will work out.  We are agreeing on how the principles will be included in new legislation.

The animal health regulation lays down the rules on the identification of animals and so forth.  Farmers are used to having these inspections and this will continue to be provided for under the official controls regulation.<\/p><p>  One of the new provisions in the animal health regulation is the requirement for animal health visits, which is causing concern among some member states.  The visit will involve a veterinarian advising a farmer on biosecurity and how to protect his or her animals from disease.  Most of the livestock farms in this country already have regular inspections by veterinarians for welfare, TB testing and other matters.  It is not envisaged that these animal health visits will be something extra on top of existing visits.  It will just be an expansion of existing visits to cover the important aspects of biosecurity and disease prevention and control.<\/p><p>  As I stated, the focus of this regulation is that prevention is better than cure.  It is more cost effective to stop a disease coming in rather than dealing with it once it is here.  It is about getting farmers to be more aware of what they need to do to protect their herds and flocks.  Most professional farmers would be very clear on the need for this already.<\/p> <p>This relates to Senator O'Keeffe's point that it sounds like a heavy burden.  It is not a heavy burden.  It is formalising what already exists because most professional farmers will understand that to buy in animals from unregulated sources is a substantial risk in terms of disease transmission.  It is accepted in the regulation that professional farmers know this.  There is a requirement for training but it is accepted that farmers who have been farming for generations have that knowledge and it is not envisaged that there would be something extra imposed on them.  It is saying that there is a responsibility on operators to understand how disease is transmitted and how they can protected their herds and flocks from it.  The regulation attempts to do that.<\/p><p> In terms of the same standards applying within the EU and to products coming into the EU, the animal health regulation lays down rules on imports of live animals and products of animal origin, which can also transmit animal diseases.  The principle is that products or animals coming in will have to meet EU standards.  Those rules are built on four pillars - the listing of countries; the listing and approval of establishments; laying down animal health requirements that animals or products will have to meet; and the requirement for certificates to accompany imports of animals and products.  The final component will be official checks that would be carried out at border inspection posts of the EU.<\/p><p> Deputy Martin Ferris asked about compensation.  None of the regulations we are dealing with today deals with financial compensation, which is dealt with solely under the financial regulation.  There is a fundamental linkage between animal health regulation and financial regulation in that there will be a veterinary fund to provide for the control and prevention of the diseases listed in the animal health regulation.  The financial regulation is the same as the rest of the regulations and its details are still being worked out.<\/p><p> Senator O'Neill asked whether the five-year timescale is too long.  It seems a long timescale.  On the plant health regulation the Commission is adopting a slightly different approach where it is doing the general principles and the delegated and implementing acts in parallel.  That is a huge workload and the Commission has only a certain number of staff working on these.  It is logical to first agree the principles and then examine the details.  It is such a very large task, for example in animal health alone it is 40 directives and regulations, bringing in all the requirements, having discussions and agreeing them.  It would be hard to get that done in less than five years.<\/p><p> On the animal health regulation provisions as they relate to veterinary medicines and other veterinary medicinal products, it does not relate to residues.  The provisions in the regulation relate to the use of these products for disease prevention and control.  For example, every time there is an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK there is a discussion on whether emergency vaccination should be used to control the disease rather than slaughtering herds.  The regulation is providing in a very general principle sense for the use of emergency vaccination or antibiotics.<\/p><p> Animal health regulation has no involvement in the regulation of animal remedies.  That is a separate regulation which is not part of this package.  The same applies to animal welfare, which is dealt with in a separate legislation and is not part of this package.  The animal health regulation is about the control of animal diseases only.<\/p><p> Senator O'Keeffe asked a good question about the application to pet and wild animals.  It regulates for this in the context of controlling diseases of EU significance.  We had a recent outbreak of bluetongue disease on the European Continent, which is transmitted by a vector, biting insects.  The suite of controls for bluetongue includes measures such as using products to try to kill off the vectors.  The regulation provides for these controls.  It is not trying to suddenly legislate for all the diseases in pet animals, but provides a mechanism to deal with pet animals which are involved in a disease being transmitted to farm animal or to humans.  That is related to my initial statement that this is preparing for the future.  It is setting down a set of principles that, hopefully, will last the community for ten to 30 years and deal with all possible future eventualities.<\/p><p> I have dealt with the responsibility of farmers.  It is not envisaged that this is anything new.  We understand how technology can be a challenge, particularly for small farmers.  At the same time at the heart of this regulation is a need for rapid transfer of information on where animal diseases are.  The only way to do that is through electronic means.  It is at a very early stage.  There is mention of the transfer of information but the details are very broad.  Only in the next five years, when we see how those broad principles are translated into detailed rules, will we be able to work out the implications for individual operators.<\/p><p> The Chairman raised mandatory reduction in antibiotic usage.  None of the regulations under this deals with that issue.  It is dealt with under the animal remedies regulations.  On high profile cases where there have been incidents relating to herd health, the focus of this regulation is on transmissible diseases, caused by viruses, bacteria or whatever, that are of international significance.  Its focus is primarily on transmissible diseases.  It provides emergency measures for other types of hazards for animal health in a general context, so there are some general rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2013100800007#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Hazel Sheridan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381240200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Do the standards applied to imports in the regulations include traceability outside the EU as well as environmental controls in jurisdictions outside the EU?

As has been stated, even though the relevant articles have not been discussed in detail our expectation is the micro-enterprise exemption will apply to the vast bulk of farmers in this country.  With regard to the implications for cost recovery, because we already have 100% cost recovery with regard to the milk processing sector there will be no net impact.  This is not to say the way in which the charge is applied will not cause a change, but there will be no net overall impact.  With regard to meat processing, which is our biggest single contributor paying 52% of costs and amounting to &euro;15.2 million out of the &euro;29.5 million cost, full cost recovery would lead to an implication of approximately &euro;14 million additional cost recovery.  This is a big issue to be considered as we go through the process.<\/p><p>  Senator O'Neill asked specifically about whether costs are passed back because at present the costs are charged to the processing sectors.  It is not a matter for the Department as to whether they are, but reputedly it is the case in some instances, particularly in the meat sector, that costs are passed back to farmers.<\/p><p>  The general point to make on costs and cost recovery, which is one of the bigger issues to be considered, is that these are early days and we and other member states have significant reservations about what is being proposed.

The plant propagation material legislation expressly provides for exact equivalence, in other words that EU standards on quality, disease, freedom and plant material would be exactly the same for any third country as for EU countries.  Imports must be analogous.  The Food and Veterinary Office in Grange will be the competent authority to decide where a third country wants to have a commercial arrangement with the EU with regard to plants, and it will carry out some of the external audits and controls. As Ms Sheridan stated earlier with regard to compensation for outbreaks of diseases in plants, it is covered by a different regulation and the person who deals with it is not here today.  The Chairman may invite our colleague in this area to come before the committee on another occasion to deal with it.  This ties into the question from Senator O'Neill on ash dieback disease, or chalara, which is a related area.  I do not work in the area of plant health but the register kept by my section and that kept by the section dealing with plant health are integrated, which enhances our ability to react to an issue.<\/p><p>  With regard to producer costs, plant reproduction is a slightly different area and is not normally covered by unannounced farm inspections.  The primary cost is with regard to controlling seed assembly, seed houses and plant reproductive garden centres.  This is where the cost element is.<\/p> <p>To confirm the plant reproductive aspect for Deputy Pringle, it is not anticipated within that regulation that farmers and other seed producers would be regarded as microenterprises but would rather be regarded as farmer growers of seed.  That is clear enough.<\/p><p> Deputy McNamara asked about our obligations concerning the database of species and its cost.  There is a national obligation to maintain the national catalogue of agricultural species of plants and the vegetable species of plants, and that will not change.  The cost of that catalogue is currently borne by the State.  While it is early days in terms of the new regulation, the element of cost that might or might not be incurred by commercial applicants would be at a very low level.  It is anticipated for those producing - let us say - small-scale local indigenous material that there would not be any charge if they wished to bring forward a new variety and register it, or in some cases there might be an extremely low charge.  Certainly, the cost of regulation would be extremely low as well.

While there would be some low-level controls, I hasten to add that our approach is very specifically two-pronged.  First, it would be to give just enough information to protect the consumer at all times, so consumers would know what they were getting, which would strike a balance.  Second, we want to ensure traceability in such a way that we, as the competent authority, are not heavily involved.

We have the country divided into 13 operational divisions and I thought it would be helpful for members to hear what is happening on the ground.  I hope that between us we will be able to deal with the questions.<\/p><p>  I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to appear before the joint committee today to discuss the Pathways to Work strategy.  The Department has a very broad remit to provide income supports and services to people right across the age spectrum from childhood to working age to retirement age, including jobseekers, people with disabilities, families and carers.<\/p><p>  The Pathways to Work strategy is targeted at those people in the working age category who have a capacity to work.  It sets out our approach to labour market activation - in other words, our approach to encouraging people to stay engaged with the labour market and supporting them in finding employment.  In this regard it is important to note that labour market activation is one of three main functions of the Department.  The second main function is payment delivery, and the third is the control of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system.  While the three functions are equally important, a balance must be struck between them.  Today, I will concentrate primarily on the Pathways to Work activity, and I am pleased to provide for the committee's information a presentation pack which outlines how the Pathways to Work strategy has evolved over the past few years.  I do not intend to go through it but I am quite happy to discuss later any aspects of it that members wish.<\/p><p>  By way of context, committee members will be aware that Pathways to Work was first launched in February 2012, at a point in time when the unemployment rate stood at 15%, the number of people unemployed as measured by the Central Statistics Office stood at 322,000 and the number of people on the live register claiming jobseeker's payments - which includes people in part-time employment - stood at 439,000.  These unemployment figures reflected the dramatic reversal in our nation's fortunes during the period 2008 to 2012, when the level of employment fell from just under 2.2 million to just over 1.8 million.<\/p> <p>This reversal in our nation's fortunes led to a dramatic increase in demand for the State's welfare and employment services, which up to 2012 were provided by three separate organisations: the Department of Social Protection, the primary provider of core jobseeker income support payments; the community welfare service of the HSE, the primary provider of supplementary and emergency welfare payments; and F&Aacute;S, the primary provider of employment support and training services.  As an example of the demands faced by these services, the number of jobseeker claims received by the Department of Social Protection increased more than threefold during the period 2006 to 2009 and the annual increase in the number of beneficiaries across all welfare schemes - that is, the number of new beneficiaries being added to the claim load each year - grew from just under 40,000 in 2006 to more than 270,000 in 2009.<\/p><p> This huge increase in demand for services placed significant pressure on the three State agencies involved in service provision.  Partly in response to this pressure but also in response to the recommendations contained in various reports from bodies such as the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, it was decided to merge the three agencies in order to provide a one-stop-shop service to customers.  This merger, in addition to simplifying the service proposition to customers, facilitated the redesign and reconfiguration of service so as to improve the quality of service.  In particular, it enabled the Department to ensure that jobseekers registering for income supports would have earlier access to employment services, and that our scarce case-worker resources would, in line with all international research evidence, be targeted towards those newly unemployed jobseekers who were most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.  This reconfiguration and prioritisation of service capacity was at the heart of the Pathways to Work strategy for 2012 and continues to be core to the ongoing transformation of service in the Department.  A key challenge in implementing this transformation is to ensure that the job of activation is aligned with and does not detract from the equally important functions of payment delivery and control.<\/p><p> Pathways to Work is one of the twin-pronged approaches adopted by the Government to address the employment challenge that I have just set out.  The other element is the Action Plan for Jobs, which is focused on the task of creating a demand for labour by encouraging and supporting entrepreneurial activity and investment in the Irish economy, and has set a target of adding a net 100,000 jobs to the Irish economy by 2016.  Pathways to Work, in contrast, addresses the supply side of the labour market, with a focus on trying to ensure that as many as possible of the new jobs and other vacancies in the economy are filled by candidates taken from the live register.  There are a number of key elements to this approach, which were set out the Pathways to Work 2012 document, including the development of the one-stop-shop Intreo to integrate welfare and employment services and deliver an improved customer-focused service to jobseekers; the implementation of client profiling to inform tailored delivery of services; the roll-out of group and one-to-one engagements to inform and advise jobseekers; the affirmation of the concept of rights and responsibilities, via a statement of mutual undertakings, to establish the basis of the relationship between the State and jobseekers; the roll-out of enhanced identity management - the public services card - to help detect and minimise fraud; the introduction of penalty rates of payment for unemployed people who do not engage with the State's employment supports, to reinforce the concept of rights and responsibilities; the roll-out of new employment supports such as JobBridge; the targeting of places on employment and training schemes such as community employment, T&uacute;s and Momentum at long-term unemployed people; the development of closer links with employers as a means of securing work opportunities to which job-seekers can be referred; and full integration of the community welfare service, F&Aacute;S employment services and the Department of Social Protection to form a new Department of Social Protection organisation.<\/p><p> These developments, when taken as a whole, represent a significant programme of transformation requiring substantial IT, process, staff, organisation and physical infrastructure changes.  Notwithstanding that some commentators have questioned the pace at which the Department is implementing this programme, experience in other countries where similar change initiatives have been implemented, such as the UK, France and Norway, indicates a timeline for delivery of five years or more.  Given the urgency of the unemployment situation in Ireland we have set ourselves a deadline of the end of next year for completion.  So far we have made good progress.  F&Aacute;S employment services and the community welfare service - some 2,000 staff - were transferred to the Department of Social Protection on time and within budget.  New organisation and management reporting structures were implemented during 2012 and the services are now integrated within the Department.  The<b><\/b>new Intreo model of operation - integrating the relevant employment and payment services - was developed and roll-out commenced in October 2012.  Fifteen Intreo<b><\/b>offices, serving some 25% of our client base, have been completed to date and our target is to have more than 40 offices fully operational by the end of this year.  Group engagement and individual profiling is now fully operational in all Department local offices in advance of the roll-out of the full Intreo<b><\/b>service.  Also in advance of the roll-out of the full Intreo<b><\/b>service, the integrated welfare decisions process is operational in 37 offices and has been instrumental in reducing decision times on welfare claims from around three weeks to around three days in most of the offices concerned.  The statement of mutual undertakings<b><\/b>is now in force, with penalty rates of payment introduced for jobseekers who do not engage with the State's employment or training services.  The national internship scheme, JobBridge, has been rolled out and is delivering a clear pathway to employment for many people.  More than 20,000 people have benefited from this scheme, with a rate of progression to employment of more than 60%.  The Momentum<b><\/b>programme to provide work-focused training to long-term unemployed people was developed, tendered and rolled out - more than 4,000 people are now benefiting from this programme.  The number of places available on activation schemes such as CE, T&uacute;s and JobBridge was increased by 10,000, an increase of 30%, as part of budget 2013.  The Springboard<b><\/b>programme has supported more than 10,000 unemployed people in improving their skills for emerging employment opportunities.<\/p><p> Turning now to Pathways to Work 2013, this is a 50-point action plan published in July 2013 which seeks to augment the focus on newly unemployed jobseekers by increasing and intensifying our level of engagement with people who are already long-term unemployed.  Among the planned actions that reflect this focus on long-term unemployment are: profiling all clients on the live register, not just new entrants, with a total of 420,000 profiles; developing an Intreo programme for engaging with clients who are long-term unemployed; increasing the number of new clients engaged in group interviews from 30,000 to 85,000 and in one-to-one interviews from 130,000 to 185,000; doubling, through internal redeployment, the number of case workers employed within the Department on activation duties to increase the capacity to engage long-term unemployed people; finalising and implementing proposals for contracting additional capacity from third-party service providers for employment services; implementing reforms to housing support under the new housing assistance payment; eliminating backlogs in the family income supplement, FIS, scheme; implementing the JobsPlus<b><\/b>incentive for employers to recruit people who are long-term unemployed; monitoring and encouraging recruitment from the live register by client firms of the Enterprise Development agencies; establishing a labour market council of external policy experts, senior industry figures and representatives of client groups to advise on the implementation and further development of the Pathways to Work approach; and developing and implementing a plan to give effect to the EU youth guarantee in Ireland.  Detailed targets have been set to measure the impact of the 50 actions under Pathways to Work 2013, and these are published at quarterly intervals on the Department's website. The report for the end of quarter 2 is included in the presentation pack and, as can be seen, we are on track to deliver most of the targets set out.<\/p><p> Following years of job losses, there are now tentative, though welcome, signs of progress in the labour market. There was an annual increase in employment of 33,800 in the year to the second quarter of 2013.  Unemployment fell by 22,200 in the same period, to 300,700, continuing a downward trend that began at the start of 2012.  By the end of September, the number of people on the live register had fallen to 408,000 from a peak of 466,000 in 2010.  The unemployment rate, at 13.3%, is down from a peak of 15.1% in early 2012.  Despite this progress, however, the jobs and unemployment challenge continues to loom large and remains the primary focus of the Department's transformation agenda.<\/p> <p>I trust my comments and the presentation are of benefit to the committee in its consideration of the challenge we all face.  I hope I have adequately set out, and given a sense of, the determination and commitment of the Department and its staff to respond to this challenge.  I also hope the presentation gives all members an understanding of the scale and complexity of the transformation programme in the Department and, above all, reassures them that we are implementing the programme with energy and at pace.<\/p><p> My colleagues, Mr. McKeon and Mr. Carroll, and I will be pleased to answer questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800003#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Vaughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381236300,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Vaughan for the presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800005#F00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1381236300,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I, too, thank Ms Vaughan and her colleagues for the presentation.

The change to which the Deputy referred is that previously an intern could do two internships for a maximum duration across both of nine months.  We got feedback in the Indecon report and directly from interns and host organisations that circumstances could arise in which an internship ceases for some reason, such as when the host organisation does not satisfy its side of the bargain, or the organisation and the intern are both genuine but are not a good fit.  If an intern has completed, say, four months of an internship it effectively precludes him or her from undertaking another, because interns must have a minimum of six months to sign up.  In order to give interns a second chance where an internship did not work out the first time, we decided to increase the aggregate duration that an intern could spend on internships to 18 months, but the individual duration is still a maximum of nine months.  That is the change we made and it is for the purpose of giving interns a second chance.  It was a strong recommendation from interns.<\/p><p>  In regard to the point raised about the experience of people on internships, an unfortunate consequence of the recession is that 95%-plus of those on the live register have previous employment experience.  It is not the same as previous recessions, when many people came into the labour market and never worked.  This time there has been a huge loss of jobs.  Therefore, a large number of people on the live register have much experience.  I do not think we can preclude people who have been unemployed for at least three months out of a period of six months from participating on an internship just because they have experience.  We do not have statistics on this, but anecdotally - I try to meet as many jobseekers as possible - many of those who work find internships work best for them.  They may be people in their mid-40s to mid-50s who have been made unemployed and cannot get back on the employment ladder because employers are seeking recent graduates.  A person in that age group will be accepted on an internship and then it is discovered that they have far more experience and better life skills than a graduate.  Some people have found that is the only way for them to get back to work.  Some of the success stories have been people in the mid-40s to early-60s category.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800006#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1381236900,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I share Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne's concern about community welfare offices.

I understand it was debated as a Topical Issue recently and there have been many parliamentary questions on the matter.  I do not underestimate the concerns expressed by the Deputy.  In my opening statement I referred to the fact that there must be a balance between what the Department does on the delivery, activation and control sides, all of which are of equal importance, but at times the balance shifts.  Part of what we are talking about is a balance between delivery and activation and getting people back to work via enhanced training and engagement with them.  As part of the Intreo service, there is a better service available which has certainly reduced in certain areas the work of the community welfare service.<\/p><p>  On the question of geography, there is also the issue that some of the clinics that have been streamlined were literally open for an hour, if not less, per week, and people had to travel.  We are looking at what is the most efficient use of the Department from a business point of view to provide a better service.  Streamlining has been done in all divisions taking account of geography, public transport arrangements, etc., and what is available and done by the local divisional managers - for example, Mr. Carroll's equivalent in the Deputy's area, or wherever.  They are people who know what they are talking about and, to be fair to them, know the geography and are trying to achieve a balance in what we are seeking to deliver.  It is not only outside Dublin that we have difficulties; there are difficulties in Dublin also.  Dublin Deputies are not necessarily happy with everything we are doing, but the principle and the criteria are providing a better service.<\/p><p>  What happens in the case of a person who cannot attend the office?  We may be able to do business with that person over the telephone or by e-mail.  The community welfare service can respond in a difficult situation or crisis such as a flood event, and that will remain the case.  This relates to the fundamental function of the community welfare service.  I am aware there are discussions about it and people may have concerns in that area.  If a person needs to be visited because he or she cannot attend an Intreo office or a local office, that will be arranged.  The streamlining of services to provide a better service in order that the community welfare service can be open for longer hours, albeit in fewer locations, is happening throughout the country in consultation with former staff of the HSE and public representatives.  We are engaging with public representatives about it and explaining it.  I am aware that in Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne's area, the divisional manager, Mr. Carroll's equivalent, will attend a meeting arranged by the Deputy to bring people together to discuss the issue.  The divisional manager will explain the plans.  Is it all set in stone?  It would be wrong to say that, because we have to review it.<\/p><p>  When the community welfare service of the HSE came into the Department, there were 900 community welfare service clinics around the country.  We have closed 260 of them.  Some would have been open only for an hour here or an hour there.  Now we have more business opening hours available to people.  I am not saying it is perfect, and I am not saying we do not need to review it.  The reason we are doing it is to provide a better service and to free up staff for activation and for the case officers.  The Deputy looked at me earlier when I mentioned the number of case officers we have.  We are trying to double the number, but that will not give us enough, as I said in my opening statement.  We are looking at contracting out activation or employment services.  We have to maintain a balance, we have to be agile and we have to look at the business.  We have to see how the business can best meet people's needs, and that is what this is about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800006#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Vaughan"},{"type":"speech","time":1381237500,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Does that cover all of Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne's questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800007#H00100","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381237500,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. McKeon to speak about the youth guarantee.

It is an agreement that the Heads of State and Government of Europe will work together to try to address the issue of youth unemployment, which is currently running from a level of approximately 22% to 23% around Europe.  In Ireland it is 29% and in countries such as Spain and Greece possibly in excess of 60%, whereas in others such as Germany it is approximately 8% or 9%.  These levels of unemployment mean that there are approximately 5.5 million young people between the ages of 16 and 24 years who are not at work, education and training.  This represents a loss of productive capacity in Europe of a couple of percentage points of GDP.  The proposal is that governments should work together to try to get to a situation where no young person would spend more than four months out of work without receiving an offer of further education, training or work.  This is an ambitious objective and in recognition of this, the European Union has provided a fund of &euro;6 billion across its member countries which are being asked to prepare implementation plans to bid for some of this money.  We are in the process of preparing an implementation plan for Ireland which must be submitted by the end of December.  A departmental group of senior officials is involved in preparing the plan supported by the OECD which we have engaged to help us draft it.  <\/p><p>  I caution against expecting that Ireland will receive a significant amount of money under the scheme because there is a precise formula for how much a country can receive, even with the best plan in the world.

We are hopeful we will receive some funding from the European Union, but we will not have the plan prepared until December when we will bring it to the Government for submission to the Union at the end of that month.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800007#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1381237500,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for attending and congratulate the Department on establishing a labour market council or group which has already met and will oversee implementation of the revised strategy for 2013.  I know the council has a good blend of people from industry who have experience of creating jobs and from the policy side who know all about unemployment.<\/p><p>  I recognise there are limited resources within the Department of Social Protection and that it can only deal with the cards it has been dealt up to now.  There is a process and an outcome.  However, I have a concern that there is more of a focus in the Department - possibly because there are limited resources - on the outcome, in other words, getting somebody into a job, rather than on the process of engagement.  If we really want to ensure people will not end up back on the live register, we need to spend time working with them on developing a career path in order that they can fend for themselves.  We need to help them to discover their innate talents and improve on them.  The current process of engagement does not allow this happen.<\/p><p>  The committee was previously known as the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education and when all of these changes were happening in 2011, we suggested to the various Departments that career guidance should be a crucial element of any future labour activation measure being developed in so far as it was possible to do so within the limited resources available.  However, the Department is not in a position to offer that essential element which would allow people to become independent and take charge of their career path.  Much of the time, through no one's fault, there is no equality of focus between the process and the outcome.  In some cases, we are putting people into jobs that will not suit them.  As time passes, we will need to apply to the Exchequer for more resources to help us to focus more on the development of a career path because not enough is being spent in this area.  I am not pointing the figure at anyone here.  I recognise that the Department is doing what it can with the resources it has available, but both it and the Deputies present need to point out that if we are serious about reducing long-term unemployment and helping those who have recently become unemployed to ensure they will not return to Intreo offices, we must focus on allowing them to take the lead and give them the required skills.  Unless we give them appropriate career guidance, we cannot do this.<\/p><p>  My next question is related to the allocation of resources to various offices.  To make an analogy, in the education area the DEIS programme allocates resources based on need to improve equality of outcomes in education.  I suggest that formula might work at local level, as it would recognise that in various parts of the country there was a greater need or greater level of unemployment and that there was a need to focus on the unemployed in these areas.  They are much further away from the labour market that they need more assistance.  Is it recognised that some offices throughout the country deal not only with large numbers of unemployed persons but also with a number of people who will find it extremely difficult to find work because they are so far removed from employment?  More work needs to be done with the people concerned.  Does the Department recognise this and are resources allocated according to need?  If not, should we not look at doing this?  In other words, do Ballymun and Blackrock receive the same resources or is there a recognition that there may be different needs and different levels of need?  Are resources pumped in according to need to give people the best chance possible to move a step nearer to finding a job?<\/p><p>  In regard to the JobBridge programme, Mr. McKeon has mentioned the anecdotal evidence that people who are in their 40s or older find the programme a much better avenue in regard to labour market activation.  It is great to hear this.  Is there room for flexibility in the rules and regulations that might prohibit some people from taking up jobs, for example, in a case where somebody might have been employed by the company offering work previously, perhaps 20 years ago?  Somebody in his or her 40s or 50s might have the opportunity to avail of an internship, but because he or she worked in a company previously, he or she might be prohibited from availing of it because of the rule about working with a previous employer.  I do not want to get into the nuts and bolts of this issue, but is it possible local offices can be flexible or will whoever makes the decision recognise that some individuals may not fit within the rules and that if some discretion or flexibility is allowed, the person concerned will get the opportunity to become involved and work?<\/p> <p> My final question is on the JobsPlus initiative.  The following is one of the faults and failings of any of the initiatives that came before JobsPlus.  By the way, JobsPlus is a really good initiative.  What is the capacity of the Department of Social Protection to ensure that as many employers as possible know the ins and outs of the JobsPlus scheme, which is a much more streamlined system from which many employers could benefit?  I say this in recognition of the fact that the Department is playing the cards it was dealt, does not have unlimited resources and is doing what it can.  That is the basis on which I ask these questions.<\/p><p> This is not a finger-pointing exercise.  I am genuinely concerned that the Department has gone through the biggest social reform ever in our history.  The Department is doing what it can.  No doubt it needs more resources.  It is something about which I always argue here, although I do not hold the purse strings.  If I could get some response to some of those, I would be fairly happy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800007#H00400","speaker":"1023","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381238100,"counter":108,"content":"<p>It is a long list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800008#J00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381238100,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. McKeon and Mr. Carroll to help me out as we go along.<\/p><p>  I am interested in what Deputy Lyons stated about the balance, as he sees it, between the outcome and the process of engagement.  As I said, the intensity of engagement is all a work in progress.  As I speak, we have a training programme for new case officers whom we are redeploying from other work within the Department.<\/p><p>  The process of engagement is how we deal with individuals.  I would like to think that our staff have great pride in how they deal with people and that they deal well with people.  I hear the point Deputy Lyons is making as to how skilled and trained are they to do it, and with regard to career guidance.  Just so I am clear, as this could be something of a language issue, the Department of Social Protection is not involved in career guidance as I would traditionally understand the term.  What we are involved in is one-on-one engagement with people to see what are their skills and where they need training, and we try to refer them to what is most appropriate.  In that regard, as I stated earlier, we work closely with employers.  It is all local.  If I were doing this in Ballymun, it would be different from doing it somewhere with a totally different catchment area.  We are also involved with what are now the local education and training boards, ETBs.  I would like to think that we are trying to improve our skills in the process of engagement through our own staff training and through the staff who came to us from F&Aacute;S who are skilled in this area, many of whom have formal qualifications in guidance.<\/p><p>  The issue of outcomes goes to the core of whether it is a matter of placing people in any job and whether we merely want to place people in jobs, in which case they may come back because the jobs do not suit them.  This is an engagement and it depends on the capabilities and characteristics of the individuals with whom we are dealing.  We know that people have been placed in good jobs but have cycled back to our office, and it is not that they were placed in the wrong job but that they needed more support to stay in it.  My colleagues feel strongly that as we engage more with those who are unfortunately long-term unemployed, the whole business of getting up and getting out, and doing it, will be more difficult for people.  That is an area we certainly have to keep under review.<\/p><p>  We are of the view that a job is better than no job, but we will not mismatch people totally, and that is what the engagement process is about.  We have to be realistic as well with regard to the capabilities of the person and what he or she thinks he or she is suited for, and if there are employment prospects in that area.  My colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills, in the ETBs and in SOLAS, which is about to be formed, are very much in this space as well and very much of the view that it is wrong to refer somebody to a training programme that he or she is not able for.  There will be vetting in the ETBs in that regard.  Therefore, I would say to Deputy Lyons that we are concerned.<\/p><p>  The purpose of the probability of exit, PEX, profiling is that everybody gets treated the same, in the sense that it looks at one's individual characteristics.  The process will be the same whether one turns up in the Ballymun Intreo office, the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Intreo office or the Limerick Intreo office.  What I would say is that all offices are different in the sense that they are physically different and we are trying to get a model service within our physical structures.  We have taken a pragmatic approach to this and we are working with the buildings we have, including our own former F&Aacute;S buildings.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked whether the resources were matched to the needs of the catchment areas.  I would like to think that by and large the answer is \"Yes,\" but my own staff tell me \"No,\" and I need to get a better handle on that.  For example, the largest local office that will be an Intreo office next year is Cork.  It is our biggest office.  It is too big.  We need two offices in Cork to deliver a proper service.  That is merely an example.  We will do that and we will have that next year.  That is merely an example of how we respond to issues in the catchment areas.<\/p><p>  Different offices - such as the Ballymun office, with which Deputy Lyons is familiar, and the Finglas office - are well matched to the needs of their communities.  As to whether they could be better, all offices could be better.  As to whether the service could be better, of course it could, and that is what we are trying to work towards.  As to whether there is some sort of other issue going on, I do not think so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800008#J00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Vaughan"},{"type":"speech","time":1381238100,"counter":110,"content":"<p>If I might reply to that, I suppose it is not about looking out for one's area or anything like that.

It is perhaps not fully understood, but when stuff is progressing and there are difficulties, one can see the scale of what is happening.  The Croke Park agreement facilitated some of what we were able to do, while the staff of the three organisations involved facilitated the change.  Having said that, Mr. McKeown headed up the IR negotiations and it was not a small or simple piece of work, but there was agreement.  I learned that there was agreement at every level to have a focus on providing a better customer service and that is what drove people forward.  That was the prize and we were able to fix  issues as we moved along.  <\/p><p>  We like to have our Irish model of social protection, which is the best of everything.  In preparing for the Intreo service we looked at the arrangements in other countries.  We have a long way to go to reach a Scandinavian model and much of it comes back to the fact that it is a totally different system.  The rates of social insurance paid are totally different, as are the benefits.  Everything is different, but we are looking at what works in other countries.<\/p> <p>We obviously view a lot of the developments in the UK, the EU, Australia and further afield.  Certainly, in terms of contracting out, we have looked at what has been going on in countries that have been doing this for many decades.  There is an advantage in coming to this later than perhaps we should have.  That is just by way of explanation.<\/p><p> Deputy Lawlor referred to Newbridge and he knows better than I that the situation there is very difficult.  I said earlier that we are trying to make Intreo work.  Ideally, we would like the Intreo service to be in one physical location because that works best.  However, that is not possible in many of our locations and we are going to have to make it fit in whatever way we are configured.  However, it is a particular challenge in Newbridge, as I am aware.<\/p><p> The OPW is the body that sources accommodation for us and enables our accommodation to be fitted out, re-kitted and so on.  We and the OPW are working hard on the Intreo programme in order to achieve the establishment of more than 40 Intreo offices at the end of this year.  While that is very challenging, it remains the target, and the OPW is confident it can reach that target.  We can supply the committee with a list of the offices that are already Intreo or are to be Intreo-ed this year and next year.  The plan is to finish by the end of next year.  I can separately supply the secretariat with that, if it suits.  I do not particularly want to say much more about Newbridge at this point.  There are a lot of issues there and I am well aware of them.  We and the OPW are doing our best.<\/p><p> With regard to F&Aacute;S and the check-backs, I made some reference to this issue earlier.  We are working on this as we move forward with the ETBs.  People need to be selected for courses and training for which they are suitable.  As I said to Deputy Lyons, support needs to be given to people who have been longer out of the workforce.  There is a check-back.  People who have been placed in jobs have come back into the office and we are aware of that.  People are spoken to again by the case officer to see why they did not stick it out.  As I said earlier, my education colleagues are very much of the view that people need to be vetted for certain training courses to make sure they are suitable for them.

In terms of the specific progression measures we agree with an individual, that is really a function of the interview that takes place.  It may well be that somebody is in fact highly skilled and job-ready, despite having lost a job.  No course would be required in that instance; what is required is perhaps assistance in polishing his or her interview skills.  In looking at the range of service provision in an area, one of the first things we do is to map the service provision, in that a case officer maps the totality of opportunities available in an area.  For example, in Swords and Balbriggan we found there was no jobs club.  There were people who were highly skilled but were failing at interview, so we recognised the need for a jobs club and we have worked towards the development of a new model of a week-long jobs club.<\/p><p>  We recognise that some of the courses were not suitable, or if they were suitable for some, there were gaps in service provision.  We have liaised with F&Aacute;S, the ETBs and the partnerships to fill those gaps.  Again, if I was to talk about Swords and Balbriggan - this does tend to happen at local level - the area manager engaged with the manager of the F&Aacute;S centre in Baldoyle and agreed the development of a six-week career planning course.  There were people who simply did not know what they wanted to do.  Rather than refer them on to a long course that they might find halfway through was not suitable, we now have this six-week career planning course.  Again, there was a recognition that there was a gap in service provision for young people, so my staff are in discussions with F&Aacute;S and they have finally agreed on a basic skills foundation course, again for six weeks, that F&Aacute;S will roll out next year.<\/p><p>  We were engaging with a fairly large employer who had a number of opportunities in the security industry, and we hosted a major event for him by drafting in 500 people with security skills.  On foot of that day, 60 people got jobs on the spot.  He is an employer who operates nationwide and we act as an account manager for him so, for example, when he was in a position to say he had 35 jobs in Cork and 35 in Waterford, and asked whether we could help him, one of my staff, acting as an account manager, liaised with colleagues in Waterford and Cork.  Having used our databases to identify everybody in the division - that is, the 500 people in the division who had some kind of security-related qualification or skill - we found that not all of them were suitable for those jobs, because the employer had a range of jobs available at the upper end of the scale, where higher industry standards were required.  Again, we sat down with F&Aacute;S, which has agreed as part of its programme for contracted training for 2014 that it will provide a security skills course.  While it is not necessarily for that employer, that employer has had an involvement in terms of course design because there are jobs available.<\/p><p>  It is difficult to speak on a very general basis.  There might be people with a range of skills but we would not have the same intervention for all of those people.  For example, Deputy Lyons might require a jobs club to just polish his skills, whereas somebody else cannot read or write.  That is why we are engaging with the National Adult Literacy Agency to come up with strategies to deal more effectively with people who have literacy or numeracy issues.  To talk again about Swords and Balbriggan on an area basis, there are significant numbers of non-nationals there with English language difficulties.  We have sat down with the Fingal Leader partnership company and it now provides English language assessment courses for people, and the City of Dublin VECs provide further training thereafter.  It is a multidisciplinary approach based on ascertaining what the needs are, what the skills base is locally and what jobs are available both locally and nationally, and then trying to bridge that gap to engage with other service providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800011#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Carroll"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381239900,"counter":141,"content":"<p>All of what Mr. Carroll describes is what his other 12 divisional managers and their staff are doing around the country.

I had a speaking engagement in the Seanad and could not attend.  I welcome the delegation to the committee which published a report a number of weeks ago entitled, Southeast Economic Development Strategy 2013-2023.  It made a number of recommendations for the south east, although it would be logical to apply some of these across the State.  Some of them might be of interest to the delegates because they relate to their Department.<\/p><p>  We consulted across the south east.  We met SOLAS, people who worked in the VECs, the colleges of further education, the institutes of technology and so on.  One thing that concerned almost everybody working in the sphere was that the area was in a state of flux.  There might, therefore, be a need for awareness-raising campaigns on what the new bodies do, especially the education and training boards and the Intreo offices, and the services they provide.  That is something for the Department to look at, with the many other proposals made.<\/p><p>  It is important to say action is required and that we need to support the creation of full-time employment.  There is a risk in blaming the unemployed for the lack of opportunities.  It is regrettable that I sometimes hear in political discourse and beyond that people who are unemployed are responsible because they are not looking for work and so on.  We must recognise the scale of unemployment and emigration and the lack of job creation and see the issue in that context. <\/p><p>  I want to hear the delegates' views on a number of points.  The first is on the success of the various measures.  We want to benchmark success.  How are all of the labour activation measures and programmes working and impacting on people's lives?  What percentage of those going through the activation measures will find work?  What is the difference between the schemes?  What percentage of those on JobsBridge, T&uacute;s and F&Aacute;S training schemes enter full-time employment?  <\/p><p>  There is also the matter of interaction with Government priorities.  If one looks at the Government's focus on hi-tech and export-led firms, what are relations like between IDA Ireland-sponsored companies, for example?  How many of these are involved in job activation?  How many people find employment in IDA Ireland-supported companies?  When IDA Ireland-supported companies make an announcement, has the Department put in place, for example, pre-employment training programmes for the long-term unemployed?  Do they fit the needs of companies?  An issue that arose strongly in the consultations in the south east was the need to ensure labour activation measures also extended to people furthest away from the jobs market.  <\/p><p>  There were also interesting observations from NALA, National Adult Literacy Agency, on people's numeracy and literacy skills and how we sometimes did not integrate these areas into labour activation measures.  We need to ensure at all times that we reach out to the greatest breadth of people who need supports.  <\/p><p>  Issues were raised about PRSI and part-time workers.  Can we have details about the success of incentivising employees to take up work, including the breakdown by part-time and full-time work?  It was mentioned that the PRSI scheme provided a perverse incentive for employers to break full-time work into part-time work.  That matter has been discussed by the committee a number of times.  Is it a problem?  How is the Department looking at the issue?   <\/p><p>  We also need to look more at apprenticeships.  We have taken a particular view of them that has not been all that good.  However, if one looks at what Germany and other countries do, one will see that they are an awful lot better at it because apprenticeships are seen to be workable, not only for manufacturing but also IT and all sorts of different areas.  Is the Department looking at this issue, too?  <\/p><p>  I appreciate that the delegates may not have information on all the questions I have asked; therefore, they might be able to send it on after the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800012#N00400","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381240500,"counter":148,"content":"<p>It would be extremely helpful to look at the committee's report and we will do so.

I presume the committee's report touched on that issue, too.<\/p><p>  On IDA Ireland companies and employers and what has been brought into regions, that is a space we are getting into.  Our area and divisional managers meet local enterprise groups and IDA Ireland; therefore, we are joined up.  We are clear that the Department of Social Protection is very much looking at the supply side.

I accept the Senator's points in that regard.  <\/p><p>  Late last week I met NALA and discussed both issues at a policy, strategic and individual level.  As it happens, work is being done in some of Mr. Carroll's offices with NALA and it is quite satisfied in that space.  <\/p><p>  I will ask Mr. McKeon to say a little about apprenticeships and the success of the measures taken.

I am aware from my colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills that a review is under way which will report by the end of the year.  In fact, apprenticeships and traineeships are being reviewed.  Mr. Duffy is chairing the review of apprenticeships; therefore, that issue is very much on the radar.<\/p><p>  What members are seeing, in the very fact that the Department of Social Protection is rightly reporting to the committee, is a joined-up approach in jobs, education and social welfare payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800012#N00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Vaughan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381241100,"counter":151,"content":"<p>In regard to the success of the measures, as Ms Vaughan said, it is probably too early to say whether the Intreo approach to the process of group engagement, early engagement, one-to-one profiling is delivering over and above other approaches.  We started to roll out the approach only last October and currently we have 15 offices live out of 60.  It takes some time working in any office to try to assess it properly.  We have set ourselves some targets and performance against those targets.  It is in the pack circulated to the committee.  We set targets against, for example, moving people from long-term unemployment into employment.  When we set the target the run rate at that stage would have been that 37,500 people would have moved out of long-term unemployment to employment.  We set a target doubling that number to 75,000 and we are on track to reach that target.  We set ourselves a target on reducing the persistence rate, that is, the rate at which people who are short-term unemployed continue into long-term unemployment.  We are on track with that target.  Similarly, we set a target to increase the exit rates of people who are long-term unemployed.  In aggregate, they are targets which will measure the overall impact.  We set ourselves what, I believe, are ambitious targets on each of those relative to performance and we are on track with them.  There are some where we are not on track.  They are mainly input measures such as the number of people on scheme places and so on.<\/p><p>  With regard to the progression rates, the most recent evaluation we have had done of any scheme is of JobBridge.  We commissioned a report by Indecon Economic Consultants, a specialist consultancy firm.  It tendered for and won the contract.  It does much work for various governments, not just the Irish Government.  It estimated that the progression rate into employment is 61%, which is about double the European average for such schemes.  It appears to be working well.<\/p><p>  In regard to the PRSI incentive scheme, members will probably be aware we have changed it to the JobsPlus scheme which commenced in July.  Initial indications are that it is working well.  There is a lower rate of PRSI for salaries up to a certain level.  I think that is what was meant by the reference to person centred.  That is a difficult one to judge.  Certainly there would be some who argue, for example, in Germany that it is better to have two people doing one job, rather than one person doing one job.  In other words, two people are taken out of unemployment.  The European Union would push that line.  Whether one considers it to be a perverse incentive or a correct incentive, I am not sure that it is an incentive at all.  There is no real hard evidence that employers are deliberately cutting salaries off at a certain level.  I cannot see it and I have looked at the numbers.<\/p><p>  On the apprenticeship issue, a review of apprenticeships is being undertaken by the Department of Education and Skills.  It is certainly looking at the German model as being one issue.  In respect of the German model, which has been much quoted, it is important to be aware that it has been in place since the 18th century and has to do with guilds and chambers of commerce and is very much a tripartite relationship between employers, the public sector and trade unions in towns and villages.  That is the construct for it.  It is also based on streaming people at 14 and 15 years of age into either vocational education or into education which ultimately leads to the third level stream.  In Ireland, certainly in the past, we took a decision to move into the third level type stream.  As a personal aside, it would be a very brave person who would tell the mammies and daddies of Ireland that their children are not going to university, that they are going the vocational route instead.  That is what is done in Germany.  It is a serious issue and one that should be looked at and, obviously, the Department of Education and Skills is looking at it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800013#O00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1381241100,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions but I will go through them quickly.  In the original Pathways to Work the aims were hope and we all had great hopes and ambitions.  In 2013 it is coming together.  It was a little sluggish along the way because of delays with offices and so on but, in fairness, as other members have said, the service is kicking in now.  I think we have always believed in it.  It is a matter of rolling it out to as many as possible as quickly as possible.  I know the witnesses share this view.<\/p><p>  There is a delay with the offices which I understand from the Minister has to do with getting offices in some cases or getting them kitted out.  Is there anything we can do to move that along?  It appears strange given the availability of so much office space that we cannot do anything in the short term to fill the gap.  The Intreo service is great.  It would be nice to have it available everywhere.  I know there are plans for 2014 but it would be good to get there as quickly as possible.  Is there anything we can do on that issue?<\/p><p>   During the initial crash when numbers increased dramatically, there were probably times when, due to various reasons, the engagement between the client and staff did not work out and some people did not have great experiences.  There will always be cases of that in any service.  I have come across people who have an opinion of the service or an opinion of the various policies and they are out of date.  Is there anything we can do to target people on our list and let them know that the service has changed or the options have changed, that it is easier to take on part-time work and go off the social welfare payment and go back on it.  That message is out there.  I still come across people who have turned down work because they say it will take ages to back on social welfare.  However, it does not.  In fairness to the witnesses, that is corrected, but that message is not out there.  Perhaps in the engagement with clients it may be possible to get a simple straight-forward letter setting out the update on what is available and the options.  It could probably be targeted at those who are in the system a long time. <\/p><p>  I turn to case workers.  I appreciate there has been much movement of staff in the Department, the majority of whom I compliment.  The overwhelming majority have adapted but there are always a few who have not adapted and we have to let the witnesses know about them when we come across them.  What type of training is provided for case workers?  They are into career guidance at this stage.  Do they get much guidance or retraining?  The work they do is a delicate operation when trying to advise a person on a career, where he or she will go and so on.  In the actions for the year ahead, the witnesses mentioned contracting more additional capacity.  Is that in the case managers, career guidance, or profiling?  Where is it hoped to used the additional capacity?  How soon will that happen?  I am aware the capacity needed is not available.  What areas is it intended to target with the additional capacity from the private sector?<\/p><p>  There was also a question on course adaption.  The Department is engaging with others to adapt courses.  It is great to see that. <\/p><p>  We often speak here about having common sense.  An issue that has arisen a few times is the back-to-education allowance and the various rules that apply.  Are there any plans to examine the rules.  The one that has come to light this year is that one has to be out of the education system for two years.  There are other rules relating to how long one is out of work.  I have a couple of clients who, for whatever reason, got mixed advice but they are now in colleges and on a place.  They have been told they will not qualify for it because of the rules and yet they will leave that college course for this year and go back on jobseekers.  There is no difference in the cost to the Department but because they do not tick the box they will leave the college course.  I have a couple of cases and I know others have cases also.  Is there a little bit of scope to do something given that it is cost neutral?  I thought at this stage we could adapt the rules if the need arose, when it was obvious and common sense applied.  I am told by people on the front line in the service that this is quite common.  Sometimes it is due to a mix up.  I accept they may have enrolled incorrectly in the course but perhaps some way of resolving the issue could be looked at. <\/p><p>  There are still differences in the service across the country.  I am aware of the number of offices in operation and the number of staff involved.  It would be ideal if we could have the same standard of service everywhere.  I appreciate due to office layout and various pressures that is not always possible.  We should soon be at the stage where the level of service is the same everywhere.  I do not mean the roll-out of Intreo but the service in general.  I still come across cases around the country where the staff at the front line are not up to date on basic information they should have.  They are then not in a position to pass it on to somebody.  There are people who, on their first engagement with the service, do not get the best information.  That should not happen given all the new equipment available.  There are many good schemes in place.  The staff at the front line need to know them and need to talk about them and sell them if possible.  I acknowledge they are posted on the walls and available to read.  I am conscious that some clients cannot follow the poster or cannot read it.  We should always be at the point of sale.  If one goes into a bank one is always asked if one wants to buy insurance.  It is constantly trying to sell something to customers.  We probably need to get to that stage with our staff, where they will ask clients, \"Do you know of...\" and keep pressing it.  <\/p><p>  Mr. McKeon engaged a great deal with JobBridge.<\/p> <p>It seems to be a very adaptable scheme and the feedback so far seems to be very positive.  However, some employers have told me that they are coming across a lot of graduates in interviews who, on principle, will not sign on.  They will not claim social welfare for three or four months and therefore cannot avail of the scheme.  I know that the Department must deal with the people before it and can only work with those who are on the list.  However, there are people out there who will just not sign on and there is a danger that they will fall through the cracks.  Graduates coming out of college will miss out on the potential for work experience because they have not been signing on for three months.  A number of employers have raised this issue with me but I am not sure if there is a solution to it.  I am simply bringing the issue to the attention of the witnesses, who may have come across this problem themselves.  <\/p><p> Representatives of the Crafts Council of Ireland appeared before this committee on a number of occasions in the last 12 months.  The council told us that it was engaging with the Department to determine whether the rules of JobBridge could be adjusted to make allowances for the circumstances of its members, many of which do not employ anyone else.  Has any progress been made on that issue?  Was a solution found?<\/p><p> This committee drew up a report last year on youth unemployment, which was sent to the Department.  The part-time job initiative that was run by the Department in the early 1990s was flagged as a very successful programme.  Has that been considered for reintroduction?  My understanding is that a person was given a limited number of hours' work in a given area and would continue to be paid his or her social welfare entitlement while receiving an hourly rate of pay.  It was cost-neutral from the Exchequer's point of view, but the individual concerned received valuable work experience and was closer to the job market.  It was not unlike some of the schemes currently in place.  That might be one to reconsider.  The feedback this committee received suggested that it was a very successful scheme.  I was still in school at the time of its operation but judging from the feedback we received, it was very good.  I ask the witnesses for their thoughts on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800013#O00200","speaker":"1078","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381241700,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I will respond to some of the Chairman's questions and Mr. John McKeon will take the remainder.<\/p><p>  On the question of Intreo being sluggish, I accept that criticism.  Nobody is as frustrated about that as the Minister and the Department.  It is sometimes hard to know why things take so long but, to be fair, in some instances planning permission, fire certificates and refurbishment are required, all of which take time.  I do not think there is anything this committee can do to speed up the process.  The OPW has said it will have the 43 centres by the end of the year.  As I said earlier, that is very ambitious, but it is what we are working towards.  There is work for both the OPW and ourselves to do in this regard.  In my opening statement and the accompanying information pack we outline what will be required to get us to the full Intreo service, but all offices have been touched by significant elements of the Intreo service already.  It is not a black-or-white scenario.  We will have to determine where we are at the end of the year.  We are very conscious that many of the Intreo offices are scheduled to come on stream in the last month of 2013, which is challenging in itself.  We will assess the situation again at the end of the year.  There is no lack of will on our part or that of the OPW but I take the point the Chairman made.  This is something the Minister raises with us regularly.  She asks about buildings, why there are delays and so forth.  She is looking for an increased pace in this area.<\/p><p>  The Chairman raised a number of points regarding customer service.  One of the things our staff pride themselves on is good engagement.  However, I accept that there can be pockets or instances of poor customer service, to which the Chairman has drawn our attention.  We will examine the points raised, but with 7,000 staff, it is not always going to be perfect.   All working conditions are not ideal either, it must be said.  <\/p><p>   It is many years since I was before Deputy English when he was Chairman of another committee and we discussed the issue of people being concerned that they would be in a long queue to receive their social welfare payments again if they took up temporary work.  We tell people that this is no longer the case, but they must tell us in advance.  We suspend claims now when people take up short-term jobs.  This is especially relevant in the lead-up to Christmas.  It is important that people tell us they are taking up such posts, but I accept the point made by the Chairman.  He is not the only public representative who has told us that this is causing difficulties.  We have tried to do a lot in that space, but we will do more if necessary.<\/p><p>  We have a very intensive training course for case workers.  We have just finished a pilot of the course, which went quite well, and Mr. McKeon will elaborate further on that.  However, I must repeat what I said to Deputy Lyons earlier, namely, that we do not see ourselves getting involved in career guidance as such.  We see our role as a directive one.  Perhaps we are speaking the same language on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800014#P00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Vaughan"},{"type":"speech","time":1381241700,"counter":155,"content":"<p>Is it the job of the Department to help people to access some of the opportunities that are available?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800014#P00300","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381241700,"counter":156,"content":"<p>Absolutely, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800014#P00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Anne Vaughan"},{"type":"speech","time":1381241700,"counter":157,"content":"<p>The Department is not there to pick careers for people-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2013100800014#P00500","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381241700,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Correct.  The Department's role is to try to place people in jobs.  Our case officers pause matters when a person is trying to improve their skills, retrain or develop new skills in an area in which there are no jobs.  We are quite clear in this.  Our colleagues in the education space may take a different perspective on the value of education but we are very much focused on jobs and the live register.<\/p><p>  Mr. McKeon will deal in more detail with the contracting-out proposals.  It will take us until some time next year to get people and services on board.  Again, the focus will be in the long-term space.  Indeed, all of our efforts are in the long-term space.  <\/p><p>  To return to the question of education, it formed part of the review of the various activation schemes that we undertook.  It would probably be best if we analysed the particular cases to which the Chairman referred.  The plan now is that the placing of people on all schemes, including the back-to-education scheme and the CE programme, will be done through case officers.  It will not be a case of people going off and matching themselves up to various schemes.  They will not be able to do that.<\/p><p>  The Intreo service should be the same regardless of the physical appearance of individual offices.  To be fair, if I am delivering Intreo over two offices, it is slightly more tricky than delivering it over one.  I know there are difficulties in the Chairman's own area in terms of trying to secure accommodation.  The front-line staff are very much up for this and are very customer-focused.  I could not say enough for them.  The situation is difficult.<\/p><p>  I will ask Mr. McKeon to address the questions about JobBridge.  The Chairman is correct that there was a part-time job incentive scheme.  It formed part of our review and it will be part of the future plan, which will be based on fewer schemes and building on the success of what we have.

Renewable energy provided by wind turbines is seen as one of the prime energy sources for the future.  The energy is clean, plentiful and renewable, and this country is ideally placed to generate large quantities of it, not just to satisfy domestic needs but also to provide a supply at European level.  Wind turbines are not a new phenomenon.  They are located around the world, with very large wind farms in China and parts of the United States of America.  They produce massive amounts of clean energy.  For example, the Gansu wind farm in China has a capacity of more than 5,000 MW and it is hoped to increase this to 20,000 MW by 2020.  The EU has a total installed capacity of approximately 94,000 MW, comprised of more than 29,000 MW in Germany in 2011, 22,000 MW in Spain and between 6,000 MW and 7,000 MW in France, Italy and the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>  According to Met &Eacute;ireann, the wind at any particular location can be influenced by a number of factors such as obstruction by buildings, the nature of the terrain and deflection by nearby mountains or hills.  The average annual wind speeds in Ireland range from 10.8 km\/h in south Leinster to more than 20.8 km\/h in the very north of the island.  These are very strong winds and they provide an opportunity for Ireland to develop its economy and to provide sustainable jobs through the provision of wind farms in ideal locations.  I do not think anyone disputes that, but what is in dispute and what we are here to consider today is the location of wind farms and their impact and potential benefit or detriment to local communities.  I now invite Mr. Duncan to address the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100800003#C00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381238400,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Thank you, Chairman.

I very much appreciate the opportunity to address the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht on the significant community concerns we have about industrial wind farm developments in the midlands.  Mr. Andrew Duncan has just been introduced.  He is from a solicitor's firm which goes back to 1918.  Dr. Chris Hanning is an honorary consultant in sleep disorders to the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS trust in the UK.  Mr. Dick Bowdler is an acoustic consultant and is also part of a working group that reports to the British Government on noise.  He has been involved with acoustics since 1977.  Ms Nora Fagan is a solicitor in commercial law from Westmeath.<\/p><p>  I will go through the background and set the context of our concerns.  Essentially, there is a proposal to develop a wind farm in the Irish midlands generating 8,000 MW of energy for export to the UK to help meet its binding 2020 renewable energy targets.  Mainstream Renewable Power, via the Energy Bridge project, intends to develop 5,000 MW of generation using 500-ft. turbines, while Element Power, via the Greenwire project, intends to develop 3,000 MW of generation using 600-ft. turbines.  These developments alone would mean that up to 2,400 industrial turbines would be placed through the Irish midlands.  That is subject to an intergovernmental agreement in quarter one and also to the completion of a strategic environmental assessment, SEA, as part of the national policy context.<\/p><p>  The intention is to submit planning applications in late 2014, based on SEA completion, and to commence development on approval.  The developments are proposed for a mix of mostly open flat farmland, some forested areas and peatland.  The current proposal includes development in areas with significant residential rural populations.  They are core to the concerns we bring to the committee.  If the proposals go ahead many communities will be surrounded by clusters of wind farms, with turbines allowed to be situated 500 m from a resident's front door or back door.<\/p> <p> We represent the majority view in Ireland, which favours renewable energy.  We are not anti-wind energy.  We consider ourselves to be rational and objective people who have had to work tirelessly to extract information and disseminate it to our communities in the absence of formal consultation.  This has cost us countless hours when we should be getting on with family life instead of having to work on this.<\/p><p> We reject the slur of the energy development companies, which described citizens who were concerned about proposals to place more than 2,500 turbines for domestic supply and export in the midlands as NIMBYs.  Such a project represents significantly more than backyard development.  However, we recognise with a strong degree of positivity the comments by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources at the IWEA conference last week when he acknowledged the concerns of the community, which was hugely beneficial, and mentioned the unthinking communication by some developers.  We also welcome his view that there will be a preponderance of wind turbines clustered on State lands far removed from people's homes.  This is the core of our presentation, which is a vision of responsible development that we want transformed into a formal policy underpinned by clear and unambiguous guidelines and appropriate legislation aligned with various directives.<\/p><p> The hard-pressed communities of the midlands have only become aware of the proposed developments through newspaper articles and word of mouth over the past six to nine months and certainly not through formal consultation with a responsible Department or the energy companies.  Token lip service has been paid to a form of consultation but it has been one-way, with limited information given to communities.  This is despite the fact that most of the landowners who are required to sign up to the option contracts have done so.  Approximately 1,000 landowners were signed up before communities became aware of what was happening.  In the midlands, approximately 35 community groups have sprung up over the past six to nine months, at a rate of one group every ten days, as people have become aware of the proposed developments.  We find that as each community becomes aware and people start to drill down into the issues, as Mr. Duncan, myself and others have done, they begin to realise that the proposals will have a cascade of consequences.  We have brought experts with us to review the impact of these consequences, including on noise, health and property values, as well as other legal concerns.  If time permits, we can provide examples of misleading information that has been given to communities and of the clear lack of information provided by developers.  We can also provide numerous examples of division in the community, which is being caused left, right and centre by these proposals.  Even as recently as yesterday evening, I got a call from a landowner living several miles away who would not give his name but who said the proposals were ripping his family apart.  It was difficult to listen such a stressful account of what is happening.<\/p><p> We welcome the revision of the 2006 wind energy guidelines, as they were significantly out of date when first implemented.  We have three significant concerns.  The first is that this is just a targeted review examining shadow flicker, noise impact and separation distance.  A tendered study by the SEAI will consider noise impact, but this is a desktop study, which is wholly inappropriate given the anecdotal evidence around the country.  Some field studies should at least be done, with appropriately qualified people visiting those areas.  A desktop study would be weak.  Mr. Bowdler will go into this in more detail as he has made a submission to the 2006 guidelines review.<\/p><p> The second concern is that a number of items are not included in the guidelines, and because of the targeted review they will still not be included.  I refer to article 3 of the 1985 environmental assessment directive, which deals with the assessment of impact on material assets and on health.  That is not covered at all.  One element that is included in the review is landscape, which is dealt with in Chapter 6 of the guidelines.  This is our third concern.  The chapter is specific and states: \"It is important that wind energy development [...] is never perceived to visually dominate.\"  On that basis alone, developers would not be coming in on top of our communities to build these turbines in residential areas.  They would stay where they like to say they belong, which is in the distant background - on mountain ridges, etc. - rather than in residential communities, as facilitated by the current guidelines, with a separation distance of 500 metres.<\/p><p> While reference is made to a balanced, responsible and democratic approach, I draw the committee's attention to what is currently in train in County Westmeath, where almost 900 submissions were made to the 2014 county development plan, the majority of which related to wind turbine and industrial wind development.  Consequently, the final draft of the plan strictly directs industrial wind development to cutaway bogs and appropriate and responsible step-back distances from people's homes.<\/p><p> We ask the committee to support a number of key actions that the Government should take: to provide of a clear timetable for the development of the strategic environmental assessment; to complete a comprehensive review of the 2006 wind energy guidelines, taking into account the issues I raised; to ensure the 2012 draft guidelines on environmental impact assessment and the 2002 EIS guidelines for developers are fully updated and in compliance with Article 3 of the EIA directive; to impose a moratorium until full and comprehensive compliance with the Aarhus Convention is ensured; to enact the Environment and Public Health (Wind Turbines) Bill 2012; and to provide an amnesty for farmers who wish to withdraw from the wind farm contracts they signed where they have not sought sufficient and independent legal advice.<\/p><p> Communities in Ireland and, in particular, in the midlands, feel they are being besieged by aggressive wind farm developers who are exploiting weak and outdated guidelines as well as the lack of specific legislation to govern wind energy development.  The majority of people support renewable energy development, but it must be done responsibly, transparently and to the mutual benefit of all stakeholders, with affected host communities to the fore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100800003#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daryl Kennedy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381239000,"counter":192,"content":"<p>There is considerable interest in this topic and, therefore, I will ask members to restrict their contributions to questions in order that we can engage actively with the delegation.

Essentially, one starts by measuring the background noise and then one assigns a level above that which the turbine shall not exceed.  What has also happened here and in the United Kingdom is that in very quiet areas a lower level has been set.  In that way, one ends up with a noise limit which is five decibels above the level of background noise, for example, but it varies with wind speed.  As wind speed increases, the noise levels of the turbines can be higher.  At the very low noise levels, one finds that the guidance puts a lower limit on the turbines.  There may be a lower limit of 35 to 45 decibels, irrespective of background noise levels.  One of the implications of this is that in quiet rural areas the position is very different from that in residential or mixed residential-industrial areas and urban areas generally.  In urban areas background noise levels tend to be higher and people living in such areas are more used to the noise of traffic and so forth.  Noises such as those generated by traffic have a similar character or noise spectrum to turbine noise, whereas in rural areas ideally a different method of assessment is needed.  People living in rural areas are not used to high levels of background noise and live in a much quieter environment.  They are not used to intruding noise from traffic, industrial production and so forth.<\/p><p>  On the question of set-backs, in the current Irish guidance there are lower limits, irrespective of background noise levels.  The limit is 35 to 40 decibels in areas that are relatively quiet, 43 at night and 45 in a rather undefined way.  It is not clear from the guidance when the figure of 45 decibels is to be used.  In addition, there is a set-back of 500 m.  The problem with set-back is that when the guidance was written, the level of turbine noise at source might have been, for example, 103 decibels, but the sort of turbines about which we are now talking can emit noise at between 107 and 110 decibels at source.  Therefore, we are talking about much noisier turbines and because of this, the original set-back distance is probably wrong.  I am not keen on having a set-back distance for that very reason and believe setting a noise limit would be a better approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100800005#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dick Bowdler"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381239600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Perhaps Mr. Bowdler might now comment on what he would recommend in terms of setting a noise limit based on the noise emissions from turbines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100800005#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daryl Kennedy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381239600,"counter":200,"content":"<p>We really should be setting a noise limit relative to background noise levels and should not have the lower levels.

That means that the noise level from the turbines could be up to 15 decibels higher than the level of background noise.  When one refers to decibel levels, people's eyes will often glaze over because the concept is hard to grasp, but if I say any increase of ten decibels is a doubling of loudness levels, 15 decibels is about three times as loud.  That means that in some situations the noise levels of turbines could easily be three times as loud as the background noise level, which is why people are complaining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100800005#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dick Bowdler"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381239600,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Mr. Hanning will now deal with the questions on sleep disorders and general health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100800005#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Daryl Kennedy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381239600,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Before dealing with the questions posed, I will expand a little on my expertise to speak on this issue.  The committee has heard that I am a retired consultant in sleep disorders medicine.  I am also a published author in the field of wind turbine research and health.  I have given evidence at planning inquiries in Ireland, England and Canada.  I have also given evidence before the Australian Senate.<\/p><p>  The purpose of set-backs and guidelines is to protect the human population.  Therefore, we should examine the effect on the human population in determining what is an appropriate distance between turbines and human beings.<\/p> <p>To answer the second questioner first, for some time I have held the view that 1.5 km is an appropriate set-back distance.  I understand a Bill has been tabled to allow for a distance ten times the height of turbines, which is equally satisfactory.  That estimate is based on existing research on real human beings and real wind farms.  The guideline noise levels tend to have been derived from studies of traffic noise.  Wind turbine noise is several times more annoying than traffic noise at the same sound pressure level.  They do not seem to have the same effect on humans.  Wind turbine noise is more annoying and has a greater effect.  Therefore, it is not appropriate to use data derived from studies of traffic to devise noise guidelines in respect of wind farms.  The evidence we have is that if people are exposed to an external noise level of 43 dB, they are at high risk of sleep disturbance.<\/p><p> Deputy Willie Penrose also asked about low-frequency noise and infrasound.  This is a slightly unsettled area.  For many years we have known that research shows low-frequency noise and infrasound adversely affect human sleep and human health.  The mechanism is unknown, but there are preliminary ideas from Professor Salt in America that the ear responds to inaudible sound.  It does not matter what has caused the harm, whether it is low-frequency noise, audible noise or pulsatile noise.  We do not wait to take action on public health issues until every aspect of the causation has been settled.  We have sufficient evidence of harm from the studies carried out of existing wind farms to take action now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100800005#E00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Chris Hanning","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1381240200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Perhaps Mr. Duncan might try to cover as many questions as he can in his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100800006#F00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381240200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Should I take questions from one Deputy at a time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100800006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Duncan"},{"type":"speech","time":1381240200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>As Mr. Duncan has the floor, he should deal with as many as he can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100800006#F00400","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381240200,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I am a professionally qualified auctioneer, not a solicitor, as Mr. Kennedy referred to me.  <\/p><p>  Much of the empirical evidence on the impact of wind turbines on property values is based on large data pools, predominantly from the United States, covering a large area.  The data include transactions up to ten miles from wind farms.  When looking closely at the data and the areas 2 km from wind farms, even the reports from proponents of wind farm development indicate an average diminution figure of 25%.  It is a consistent figure throughout the reports.<\/p><p>  The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the United Kingdom has commissioned a report on the impact of renewable energy projects on the rural economy.  It has been reported that the report has been suppressed by the Department of Energy and Climate Change because the impact of wind farm developments on nearby properties is so drastic that it may damage wind farm development proposals.  We hope the report will be published to bring clarity to the matter.<\/p><p>  The studies predominantly put forward as evidence from wind farm developers that there are no issues with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory studies and they are flawed.  They look for the problem ten miles away when the problem is within 2 km.  The Danish experience involves a compensation scheme.  The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors in England has carried out a survey of its membership and the consensus in the auctioneering profession is that there is an impact on property values.  It is predominantly based on the overall size and dominating impact of the turbines and their proximity.<\/p><p>  With regard to the question on spatial distribution asked by Deputy Catherine Murphy, we need only look at Ireland's spatial distribution to see the actual impact.  In the case of one wind farm in Killucan, County Westmeath, we have analysed the figures for 200 homes within 2 km.  Based on property tax estimates, the value of each home is &euro;175,000.  Using the figure of 25%, this amounts to average equity taken out of the homes of &euro;8 million to &euro;10 million.  If we transpose this figure across the 100 proposed wind farms in the midlands, a serious problem is looming.<\/p><p>  Article 3 of the environmental impact assessment relates to the Deputy Catherine Murphy's question.  Ireland could very well find itself involved in a case for compensation payments.

For those unfamiliar with the convention, it originated in Denmark in 1998 to ensure access to information and public participation in decision-making in environmental matters for those individuals and communities affected.  Unfortunately, it was not brought into effect in this country until late 2012.  One of the criticisms of the 2006 guidelines is that they do not incorporate the consultation required under the convention.  To go from the European example of Denmark to the local example of what is happening in County Westmeath, if the guidelines had been complied with, I would not have had another farmer standing in my kitchen yesterday evening.  He had been told that a turbine of approximately 75 m was to be put on his residential farm and was extremely distressed to discover through information in the newspapers that, in fact, it would be a turbine of 185 m.  This shows how European legislation must impact on the guidelines and the effect on local communities.  That answers one question from Deputy James Bannon on how farmers have been conned, as he said himself.<\/p><p>  Deputy Robert Troy asked how farmers were signing up to avail of these options.  They are being advised on their doorsteps that over a period of 30 years they can expect to gain an income in the region of over &euro;1 million if they choose to pledge 1 ha of land to a wind farm company.  However, the actual options and the leases they sign up to are grossly different from these representations.  Unfortunately, that is how so many of these options have been signed up to.  Farmers and rural communities are hard-pressed; margins are much tighter and they see this as perhaps the means to educate their children to third level or whatever it may be.<\/p><p>  My first criticism of the guidelines is that they do not incorporate the requirements under the Aarhus Convention.  Other criticisms are that they do not provide for wind turbine farms of differing height, scale and output thresholds.  They are rather like a blunt hammer in that they do not deal with the different megawatt capacities or the scale of wind farms, nor do they make any distinction between large-scale commercial operations such as the ones coming to the midlands and community-led initiatives.  They do not deal with the issue of landscape sensitivity.  For example, to impose - which is how people in the midlands perceive it - 2,500 turbines with an average height of over 150 m is totally disproportionate given the landscape sensitivity of these counties.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, the guidelines do not deal with such issues.  Another guideline that is not dealt with relates to our national monuments.  Everybody is familiar with a recent profile showing a small round tower relative to the enormous size of one of the wind turbines.  There will be an impact on tourism and the perception of Ireland and particularly the midlands will be grossly distorted.  We would be going from a rural landscape to what is perceived to be an industrial landscape.  One of the other members of the committee will deal with the impact on tourism.

I am not aware of any report in Ireland covering this, although there are a number out there.  All the peer-reviewed studies of existing wind farms have shown harm, including the Japanese example that has just been mentioned.  Approximately three years ago, the Japanese Government instituted a programme of research into the health effects of low-frequency noise from wind turbines.  Reports are just beginning to come to light and they show that harm occurs.  As has been mentioned, the study suggests that a setback distance of approximately 1 km or 1.5 km is reasonable.<\/p><p>  Deputy Troy essentially asked about sensitive receptors.  It is important to realise that not everybody exposed to wind turbine noise necessarily gets sick or is affected in terms of sleep.  We vary in our sensitivity to noise, and some people are more sensitive than others.  That does not mean they are somehow bad or mad; it is just a case of people being more sensitive, as some are less sensitive.  We know that people sensitive to noise tend to congregate in quiet, rural areas because that is where they feel better, and introducing new noise pollution is not good for such people.<\/p><p>  Deputy Troy specifically asked about autistic spectrum disorder, which is not an uncommon phenomenon.  It is certainly true that young people and children with this condition are more sensitive to the effects of wind turbines for two reasons.  First, it is very common for these individuals to be fixated with rotating objects, and if they see a wind turbine, it can utterly distract them from doing anything else.  Second, they all have poor sleep, and if a person already has poor sleep and is subjected to turbine noise, there could be further effects.<\/p><p>  Deputy Troy also asked about the Danish scheme.  This is a political decision.  If there are smaller set-back distances, with a recognition that some people will be harmed and appropriately compensated, it may amount to a reasonable answer.  Until such a system is put in place, realistic set-back distances that protect the vast majority of people are appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100800008#H00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Chris Hanning"},{"type":"speech","time":1381241400,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I asked two specific questions that were not answered.

The two multinationals in the midlands are competing for land as part of the export project.  I am not saying anything unusual, as this is a matter of record, but these two competing companies are already selling their options on to third-party investors.  What is particularly unusual about the leases and of great concern with regard to contracts is that all of them are for a minimum of 30 years; normally, the farmer or landowner retains full control over subsequent tenants or sub-tenants, but that control of assignment of leases is not contained in the documentation.  Therefore, farmers would have absolutely no control over the third-party multinational investors - whoever they may be - who can come in as tenants on the leases for the land.  In Leitrim, Mainstream has sold a wind farm option to IKEA.  This is about selling on the options, and I am quite sceptical as to whether the wind farm companies intend to stay in the long term, as they have the full right to assign the leases on and attract investors in order to sell options on a farmer's land and generate income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100800008#H00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Nora Fagan"},{"type":"speech","time":1381241400,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Will Mr. Kennedy address the issues raised by Deputy Bannon regarding the balance of public meetings?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2013100800008#H00800","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381241400,"counter":228,"content":"<p>With regard to balanced debate, from the first community meeting I attended in April - I believe the Deputy was there - I extended a welcome by e-mail and telephone to developers, but they did not come along.

With regard to the bond, guidelines currently state that the cost of decommissioning could be covered by the cost of scrap metal.  Ms Fagan is clear that the contracts stipulate that the turbines remain the assets of the development company.  Some kind of index-linked bond should be put in place to cover decommissioning.<\/p><p>  Subsidies are being threatened with removal or reduction every week and technology is being upgraded all the time.<\/p> <p>We do not know where we will be a decade from now and it is quite likely there could be considerable redundancy.

None the less, their lobby group, the IWEA, made a specific submission on the county development plan asking the county council not to prescribe that cabling be put underground.

We calculate what the noise level will be at the receptors, and that is our starting point.  There is a fixed decibel level at the turbine itself but that is not the level one would get in communities.  One would never get more than 55 dB or 60 dB, even underneath a turbine.  Fifty-five or 60 dB would be what would be heard underneath a turbine.  The noise level in a quiet rural area quite a distance from main roads at night when there is no wind would typically be 15 dB.  During the day in rural areas, there might be 25 dB approximately, provided there are no roads nearby.  As soon as one gets close to roads or other activity, there is approximately 30 dB or 35 dB, or even more.  In towns, there is a noise level of approximately 50 dB to 55 dB.

While it works on a specific area in County Westmeath, it is aware of problems in other counties.<\/p><p>  Wind energy is one of a suite of alternative energy resources including biomass, solar, wave and gas.  It is the job of the CER, Commission for Energy Regulation, to guarantee safe means and methods of producing energy, to improve choice and competition and ultimately, benefit the consumer.  The midlands region is historically synonymous with energy and power generation with Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB.  Peat supplies are diminishing.  The public service obligation payments to Bord na M&oacute;na will expire in the coming years and alternative uses are required for cutaway bogs.  There is the potential for a jobs dividend in these developments.  It may not necessarily be to the extent portrayed by many of the companies pursuing this line.  There is also the potential for a local rates dividend to the local authorities concerned, giving them new sources of income to deliver the services and facilities which cannot delivered as many councillors would have hoped and many of our public expect.<\/p><p>  For this process to move forward, progress must be on a consensual basis rather than by imposition on an area in the midlands.  The memorandum of understanding undertaken by the Government with its UK counterparts was overstated and may be too presumptuous with regard to the timescale and the level of energy export that may be achieved.<\/p><p>  It is pleasing to hear moratoriums being discussed.  Is it constitutionally viable for this to be the case, however?  Is it not the case that anyone, irrespective of who they are, is entitled to make a planning application to a local authority?  It might be thrown out but I do not think we can interfere with that process.  It is only proper that the correct legal advice and response to that proposal is examined.<\/p><p>  Many county councils were responsible in how they dealt with this issue in their development plans.  In 2009 County Offaly devised a wind energy strategy with designated areas within the county which may be suitable to be considered for applications.  In the context of being considered, it is up to the planning authorities thereafter to adjudicate on the various issues discussed today.<\/p><p>  It is concerning that many of the companies referred to today have considered approaching landowners outside of designated wind farm areas, making promises to them that they may not be able to keep and having no regard for the efforts of local authorities in designating areas.  Unfortunately, we cannot interfere with the commercial reality of making agreements and devising contracts with farmers.  Are these companies, however, legally bound to advise a landowner to seek legal advice before committing to a deal?  If that is the case, then they have abdicated a legal responsibility and the agreement could be voided.  What is Ms Fagan&rsquo;s view on that?<\/p><p>  In recent years, there have been advances in wind farm technology and size.  The height required for the wind farms in the midlands is actually quite high and is not represented in the existing guidelines.  That is why they have to be amended by the Minister.  The revised guidelines must be cognisant of the advancements made in wind farm size and technology, as well as location, set-back, environmental and property impact and health implications.<\/p> <p>Adequate weight must be given to local authority development plans and the efforts by the councillors on behalf of those they represent to be responsive in the manner in which they put policy and designate areas.  None of them is against wind energy.  They only want a responsible means and method by which it is provided and by which we can all benefit.<\/p><p> My county recently made an effort to tighten up its development plan with a view to the next phase seeking buffer zones of 2 km from the core of towns and villages.  That does not cater for the one-off house in the countryside and how to get a happy medium on that.  There is a responsibility on the Department and the Minister to have the guidelines in place as soon as possible not only for large developments but for any developments because the local community might wish to avail of wind energy as a means by which it can pool together to reduce its energy costs.  The cynics will say if we allow that, they are open to be bought up by big developers as a means by which they can gain access to the market.  Leadership must emanate from the Department on this and adequate weight must be given to local development plans and the efforts of local councillors who get the brunt of sentiment at many of these public meetings and are trying to be responsive in how they deal with the sentiments expressed.  Ultimately they have a responsibility, like the rest of us, to provide alternative energy sources in a safe manner which can be delivered to provide adequate competition at a rate that is available to all consumers.<\/p><p> My question is on the legalities of any contracts that have been entered into.  If it is such that the companies that wrote those contracts did not say they had to get legal advice, are they in trouble?  Is there a role for the Law Society of Ireland in this?  It is about informing the public about their legal rights regarding a commercial transaction.  There must be some synergy between the five counties involved in the midlands region regarding their development plans.  Westmeath had no wind energy strategy in its existing development plan and had to contravene its plan to meet the situation that arose recently.  It has designated cutaway bogs, which is commendable.  In Offaly the cutaway bogs are predominantly in the east of the county but there are also towns and villages in the midst of that where the people are fearful of the impact it might have on them.  As the Minister said, much of this will be properly tested only when full applications are made and adequate reports cited on the part of those who make the applications and the State which must have adequate guidelines for the reports to tie in with.

It is important to point out that we have had significant challenges just trying to unravel what is supposed to happen, as dictated by the 1985 directive on EIAs.  It is apparent even talking to senior planners in the local council that there is confusion in terms of what needs to be done.  It now seems quite clear that the EIA directive would say that the environmental impact statement, EIS, which is produced by the developer as part of the planning application is then subject to an environmental impact assessment, not just the EIS but also that the competent planning authority would tackle all of the direct and indirect effects of the development on the environment.  The 2006 guidelines cover landscape and some of the elements but it does not cover the impact on material assets.  That is required under Article 3 of the EIA directive.  It also does not examine the impact on humans.<\/p><p>  In response to Deputy Penrose&rsquo;s question on how it would happen on the ground, one would expect that the developer&rsquo;s contract body would identify sensitive receptors within a certain distance of wind farms and that they would assess the current base level of health of those sensitive receptors.

One could get a baseline reading and look at the impact on material assets.

That is the clear context at the moment.

I am not aware of any, but neither am I in a position to be.  It is clear from the case in March 2011 in the European Court of Justice that there is a lack of formal implementation of the EIA directive.  The directive is now in place but there are some weaknesses.  Currently, we do not see an open and transparent mechanism for the impact on material assets, humans and flora and fauna and the interaction of those effects and how they can all be taken together.

The presentation we will go through is exactly the same as was given to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on two occasions in recent weeks.  It sets out the latest economic trends by way of background and includes the Department's forecasts for this year and next year.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has a mandate to endorse forecasts for T and T+1 and nothing beyond this is written into the legislation.<\/p><p>  The forecasts for next year are based on the purely technical assumptions of consolidation amounting to &euro;3.1 billion being implemented.  The reason for this is it is the latest formally articulated Government policy as set out in the stability programme published last April.  On this basis we expect output GDP growth of 1.8% for next year in real terms.  By way of clarification, I stress it is our position that we cannot comment on the budgetary situation, the budgetary numbers, or what the composition of consolidation is likely to be.

These include the six-pack and the fiscal compact.  In particular the two-pack, which has been on the Statute Book since the end of May, provides for forecasts to be outsourced from treasuries within the euro area or endorsed by an independent authority.  To the best of my knowledge most, if not all, euro area countries are going down the same route as Ireland, namely, the endorsement route.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has been assigned the task of endorsement by way of an amendment to the Fiscal Responsibility Act passed by the Oireachtas over the summer.  IFAC is a statutorily independent body with a role in assisting greater fiscal transparency and improved fiscal governance.  However, decisions on budgetary policy obviously and clearly remain in the domain of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>  To operationalise the endorsement process we have drawn up a memorandum of understanding between the Department and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  It was drawn up over the summer and has been put on the websites of both organisations.  I understand the process in many euro area countries is similar.  The memorandum of understanding sets out that we provide the council and the secretariat with our provisional economic forecasts.  We do not discuss budgetary projections or consolidation; nothing like this enters our discussions with IFAC.  It is purely a macroeconomic discussion.  Formal presentations were provided by the team to the secretariat of the council on 25 September and to the full council on 30 September as provided for in the memorandum of understanding.  On foot of these interactions at a technical level, I can confirm a letter was issued by the chair of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council last Friday to the Secretary General of the Department confirming the forecasts were in an endorsable range.  This letter will be put on our website on the day of the budget.<\/p><p>  My team and I will now go through the exact same presentation provided to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  Ms Dalton is the specialist on the international side, Mr. Enright works on domestic developments and Mr. Sweeney works on price developers.

It also shows a set of macro forecasts which we call the stability programme update, commonly abbreviated to SPU.  In the SPU we forecasted GDP growth of 1.3% this year based on a stabilisation in domestic demand and an increase in exports.  Since then we have had a number of observations and hard economic data from the CSO which gave us cause to change a little the view we had of the economy for 2013.  The first column on the left is the provisional outturn for 2012 released by the CSO in March.  The next column is the actual outturn as estimated in June.  The CSO revised down the total level of activity or growth in 2012.  This brings us to 2012 with less momentum than we thought we had.  We also had data for Q1 and Q2 of this year, and it is fair to say these numbers came in a little below expectations not least the contraction in exports we have seen in the first half of the year.  It was negative in the first quarter and positive in the second.  This has led us to change our assessment of growth prospects for this year.<\/p> <p>Obviously, that means pushing into next year as well, which we will touch on in a little while when we get to the outlook.  I will pass over to my colleague, Ms Mary Dalton, who will talk about developments in the international economy in the intervening period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013100800004#D01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Enright","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381254000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>To take members through some of the assumptions that underpin our forecasts on the external assumptions slide, looking first to exchange rates, these are purely technical assumptions.  What we do is take a ten day moving average, so this is the same presentation we gave to IFAC and these were taken at the end of September.  In terms of the difference between the current forecasts and our last set of forecasts from the SPU, we see a slight downward revision in the sterling exchange rate in 2014 but the same for this year.  In terms of the US dollar exchange rate, again, we see a slight change from SPU time, with an appreciation of the euro in both 2013 and 2014, but again very marginal.<\/p><p>  Looking at Brent crude oil prices, this is a purely technical assumption that we use as we make the assumption that oil prices move in line with future prices.  Again, we see a very small difference between our forecast at the time of the SPU in April and our current outlook, so it is &euro;82 and &euro;78 for 2014.<\/p><p>  Turning to developments in our key trading partners, we have set out the position for the US, the UK and the euro area, which roughly account for 80% of our exports.  The story is broadly similar.  We saw that activity in Q2 surprised on the upside.  The graph shows that the US is at 0.6%, the UK at 0.7% and the euro area at 0.3%.  While this is positive, Q1 was worse than expected so, roughly, for the year as a whole we are where we expected to be in April.<\/p><p>  Moving on to the next slide, PMI data is seen as a leading indicator for activity in the economy.

Obviously, this did not come out in time for us to include in our forecasts but in terms of where the IMF sees activity in the global economy, growth is quite weak at the moment but, for the advanced economies, it sees growth picking up in the US, the UK and the euro area in 2014.  Nevertheless, it is important to point out that economic growth in our key export markets remains fragile.

To give a sectoral explanation, service exports, which are about equal in the basket to goods exports, are continuing to grow.  Goods exports appear to have peaked in late 2011 and have been on a downward path since.  Essentially, if we go to the next slide, we see this is being driven by developments in the pharma-chem sector.  As members know, Ireland has a high specialisation in pharmaceutical outputs.  The patent cliff is essentially sweeping through the sector and that is impacting on measured output from Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013100800005#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Enright"},{"type":"speech","time":1381254000,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I am conscious this is being broadcast live and people are watching.

There are charts here which illustrate some of the developments.  Exports to the US are leading the decline and we think this is indicative of the patents story, given that patents are generally filed in the US first and expire in the US first as well.<\/p><p>  To run through developments in the domestic economy in recent months, we are looking here at core retail sales.  We tend to focus on core retail sales, which exclude cars as car purchases are quite volatile and are entirely imported in the Irish context.  They have been in positive territory in the first nine months of the year, with some weakness over the early summer, possibly weather related, but there has been reasonable growth of over 1% in the last number of months.  The retail sales inform our view in the forecasts of where we think private consumption for the year is going to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013100800005#E00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Enright"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381254000,"counter":322,"content":"<p>A key point worth emphasising is that while we are all aware of a reasonably strong export performance over the past couple of years and that domestic demand has been very weak given the legacy of the crisis, the charts on view show there is now fairly firm evidence that domestic demand is on a modest recovery.  We see a modest improvement in consumption and the chart on view shows this is translating into real tangible improvements in the labour market.  I am not getting carried away and, obviously, there is a long way to go, but the employment story is a very good story.  Employment in the second quarter was up by 1.8% in year-on-year terms, it is the third consecutive quarter of annual growth and it is broad based across sectors, given the CSO reports on 14 sectors, nine of which had employment growth.  The only employment losses were in sectors typically associated with the public sector, so the private demand for employment is moving in the right direction.<\/p><p>  Importantly, employment growth was concentrated for the first time since the crisis began in full-time employment.  We have seen some modest increases in part-time employment but it is now translating into full-time employment, and so is indicative of an improvement in labour demand.  That, in turn, is feeding through into an improvement in the unemployment situation.  Unemployment is down by 1.75% since its peak.  In the first half of this year the bulk of the decline in unemployment is accounted for by a decline in long-term unemployment - that is, those who are unemployed by over a year - so things are moving in the right direction.  I am not getting carried away.  Some of it is certainly due to outward migration and so forth but, nonetheless, it is moving in the right direction on the labour market and the employment fronts.<\/p><p>  To come back to domestic demand, the next chart shows the household savings rate.  Members will know that, since the crisis kicked in, households have ramped up both their rainy day savings - so-called precautionary savings, given the probability of suffering an income shock has increased - but also savings for balance sheet repair.  There has been a massive destruction in household net wealth.  In Ireland most household wealth is held in the form of housing assets, which have fallen by about 50%.  There has been a massive destruction in household net wealth, so households have responded by trying to build up financial assets and reduce financial liabilities, in other words, keeping the savings rate high.  Certainly, there is now some evidence that the precautionary element is beginning to ease off as confidence begins to improve.  Obviously, the balance sheet repair element is going to be there for the foreseeable future given the high level of public indebtedness.<\/p><p>  On wages, to complete the labour market situation, and the time series only begins in 2008, there is no evidence that nominal wage reductions at an aggregate level were a feature of the crisis.  Essentially, if we look at the private sector, it pretty much oscillated around &euro;19.50 per hour at an aggregate level right throughout the crisis, and the chart shows it moving around the average for the past four or five years.  That pattern has continued into the early part of this year, with very little wage growth and no pressure on that side.<\/p><p>  I will hand over to Mr. Enright on the investment front.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013100800005#E01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381254600,"counter":323,"content":"<p>The next slide shows the growth in investment, which tends to be very volatile on a quarterly basis.  We have tried to break it down into its components.  The key explanation for the volatility is aircraft.  Aircraft imports in the Irish context tend to be large and to fluctuate wildly.  There were few aircraft imported in the first two quarters of this year, which depressed aggregate investment, but when one excludes this one can see an underlying recovery.  Building and construction activity has begun to show some kind of consistent return to year-on-year growth, and the grey bar represents machinery and equipment, which excludes aircraft.  This represents everything physical that businesses need to operate.  The return to growth in both of those components of investment is encouraging on the employment side, which we will turn to a little later, but also in terms of the productive capacity of the economy over the medium term.<\/p><p>  The final slide on the domestic side illustrates the tourism story.  From January to August 2013, we had a 7% year-on-year growth in visitors to Ireland.  That surprised everyone involved.  It has been broad-based across a number of destinations, but the number of visitors from North America in particular is up quite a bit.  My colleague Mr. John McCarthy will now discuss our outlook for this year and 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013100800006#F00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Enright"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381254600,"counter":324,"content":"<p>We will now focus on the key chart, which contains our forecasts for the main macro variables on the real side, as well as labour market variables, and on the nominal side also.  For this year we are looking at real GDP growth of about 0.2%.  We just got the figures this morning and the consensus is that it will be zero for the year as a whole, a minor difference.  It must be borne in mind that in an economy like Ireland, where figures are very volatile, there is very little difference between +0.2% and zero.  I would  not call that a really strong difference.  Crucially, in the outlook for 2014, I mentioned at the outset that we are looking at output growth of 1.8%, which is a downward revision, because at the time of the SPU last April we were looking at GDP growth of 2.4%.  The main reason for the downward revision is a fall in exports, which was partly due to the very weak international economy in the opening quarter of the year.  Another factor is sector-specific issues, particularly the patent cliff, which has been mentioned.  We have incorporated downward revisions to the figures for both this year and next year.<\/p><p>  Now there is a better story.  The employment situation is a great deal better than we thought at SPU time.  We are expecting employment growth of 1.6%, which is an upward revision.  We have reduced the unemployment projection from 14% at SPU time to about 13.5% now.  We expect a percentage point reduction in next year's unemployment figure as well, so there is a good news story.<\/p><p>  Members may ask, if GDP is recovering and employment rising, whether that implies negative productivity growth.  We have had that once in 50 years.  It is an unusual story and it is very difficult to rationalise.  We think it is due to the composition of growth.  There are productivity puzzles emerging in a number of countries, such as the UK, which also faces this issue.  It is an interesting feature of the situation.  It is something that cannot continue over the medium term, but we can probably see negative productivity on a once-off basis.  We think it is due to the composition of growth - in other words, the pharma-chem issue is decreasing overall GDP, but this is not really having a labour market impact because the labour share of this sector is quite small relative to its profit share.  I will hand over to Mr. Enright to speak on the next chart.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013100800006#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381254600,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I mentioned the divergence between goods and services exports.  We are expecting a small contraction in exports this year of about 0.6%.  We have split that figure into services and goods.  In respect of services we were expecting reasonably healthy growth, although not as strong as last year, but goods exports will exert a negative drag on overall exports both this year and next year, primarily due to the contraction in the pharma-chem sector, and there is not enough growth in the rest of our goods exports to compensate for the contraction that we are seeing in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013100800006#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Shane Enright"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381254600,"counter":326,"content":"<p>The chart showing household income is not as important as some of the others.  What we are trying to do is to look at household disposable income and break it down into its individual components.  The biggest component of household disposable income is labour income - what we all earn from wages.  The key point is that after very sharp falls in disposable income in 2010 and 2011, disposable income now appears to be levelling off in the household sector.<\/p><p>  The fiscal council is interested in modelling the labour market.  Okun's law relates the unemployment rate to developments in GDP.  The fit of the model is reasonably good from the 1960s onwards.  There seems to be a little bit of a break in later years - in other words, the elasticity of unemployment with respect to GDP seems to be lower than the historical norm.  That is probably explained by the composition of output.<\/p><p>  The next chart illustrates what I was alluding to earlier.  Negative productivity is very unusual both in Ireland and in many other countries.  We are looking at negative productivity of the order of 1.25% to 1.5% for this year.<\/p><p>  The following chart compares the unemployment rate projections at the time of the SPU last April with our current projections.  As I said earlier, we are moving in the right direction, but an unemployment rate of between 13.5% and 12.5% is still far too high.  Our key point is that we are moving in the right direction.<\/p><p>  With regard to the labour market, one issue that needs to be borne in mind is what we call the endogeneity of labour supply in Ireland.  Essentially, if employment growth picks up, we will typically see in an Irish context that labour supply also picks up.  Once the demand for labour picks up, we will see people who have migrated returning to Ireland, as well as non-Irish nationals.  We will also see participation rates pick up.  We have seen a dramatic fall in participation rates, in layman's terms, during the downturn.  During the bubble years, people aged 17 and 18 who did not go to college went straight into construction and the participation rate went up.  They are now staying on in college, so the participation rate is going down.  Once things begin to stabilise, we will see that the labour supply tends to increase.  It is a feature of the Irish labour market and we try to incorporate it into our analysis.  The key point is that even if there is employment growth, there will be an increase in labour supply, so we do not expect a dramatic reduction in the unemployment rate.<\/p><p>  The next chart may be overly technical, for which I apologise.  We try to model exports as a function of export market growth, based on GDP growth in the UK, the US and the eurozone as well as competitiveness variables such as unit labour costs.  The model performs reasonably well.  I have looked at research in other countries in which there is a better fit.  The problem is that Ireland is so small that sector-specific issues can drive a wedge between model-based results and actual results.  The model suggests that exports will be very strong in later years, but we know we have an issue in the pharmaceutical sector, which accounts for 25% of our exports, and this is having an impact.<\/p> <p>It is just impossible to model that on a short-term basis.<\/p><p> The next chart shows something that we think is important.  While we are incorporating downward revisions on the real side, we are also incorporating downward revisions to the deflator.  There is less inflation in the system, which means that the overall money amount of GDP is actually lower than previously thought.  That has implications for the debt ratio and for fiscal variables expressed as a percentage of GDP.  It is something that we keep an eye on and it is important.<\/p><p> The next chart shows the current account and GNP projections.  We are looking at GNP growth of about 1% this year.  It is better than the GDP forecast.  The profit outflows are not as large as in previous years due to some technical factors.  We have had a very strong balance of payments surplus over the past couple of years.  We have seen a big increase in exports, but we have seen a compression of imports because domestic demand has been so weak, and that has driven a very large current account surplus of 4.5%, which is one of the largest in the EU.  Mr. Sweeney would now like to say a bit about inflation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013100800006#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381255200,"counter":328,"content":"<p>The next chart shows the quarterly composition of the HICP - harmonised index of consumer prices - which is the Europe-wide measure of inflation, allowing comparisons between different eurozone countries.  The story in 2013 has been broadly of modest services inflation.  We can take services generally as a measure of domestically-driven inflation, whereas goods can be taken as a proxy for imports inflation.  Services have recorded modest inflation in the year to date, whereas there has been a drag on the inflation rate of goods exports over the three quarters.  This largely reflects bilateral exchange rate movements <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i> sterling in the first quarter of the year, so we see that deflationary effect kick into goods.  When we compare 2013 to last year, we see more benign energy price inflation.  It has been about 1% in the year to date, whereas it was about 9% last year.  We are broadly expecting HICP inflation this year to be somewhere in the region of 0.7%, picking up over the next year based on a number of assumptions, including a fall in the exchange rate impact.  The projection of a rise in services inflation is mostly based on an assumption of a reversal of the jobs initiative VAT reduction for tourism, so it is conditional on that.  We are expecting a HICP rate of about 1.5% for next year.<\/p><p>  When we forecast inflation, we tend to use a bottom-up approach.  When we use more granular data we can measure product-specific developments, but we test the robustness of our forecasts by using this top-down approach, and this is broadly in line with what we forecast in the bottom-up approach.  This does not take into account budgetary measures such as the VAT increase, so that explains the differential there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013100800007#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gavin Sweeney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381255200,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I will skip the next slides as they are too detailed.  They are to do with modelling export prices and so on.<\/p><p>  The overall story is one of a modest, gradual recovery taking hold in the short term, with broadly similar contributions from domestic demand and from net exports.  The positive thing we can take from it is that there is very strong evidence of stabilisation of domestic demand and a modest recovery under way in both consumption and investment.  The improvements in external demand should support some improvement in export growth next year, but there are some sector-specific issues that are likely to have an impact as well.<\/p><p>  We mentioned earlier that a recovery is under way internationally, but that recovery is fragile and subject to downside risk.  I believe it is the same in Ireland.  As a very small and very open economy - our exports are in excess of 100% of GDP - we are very reliant on what goes on in three regions, so if there were any sort of re-intensification of the eurozone crisis, or if the overall policy mix in the US were to become more problematic, then we could see downward revisions to growth in our major trading partners.  Domestically, there is the risk of an intensification of the pharmaceutical patent cliff issue.  There is also the issue of household debt restraining consumption growth for the foreseeable future.  There could be a flip in the savings rate.  Our baseline assumption is that the savings rate comes back gradually, but that is very sensitive to what goes on in the labour market and what goes on internationally.  If that were to turn, we could see an increase in the savings rate, with negative implications for consumption and overall GDP.  On the upside, there is always the possibility of stronger growth in the UK, the US and in the eurozone, but that is certainly not built into our baseline assumptions.<\/p><p>  The next chart shows what the risks mean.  We asked our colleagues in the ESRI to use their macroeconomic model, known as HERMES, to simulate a number of scenarios, such as what would happen to growth in Ireland if world growth was weaker.  It is typically one for one, so if world growth was 1% weaker that would translate into a 1% reduction in GDP in Ireland.  Let us suppose the household savings rate were to increase or even fall - it is broadly symmetrical.  A fall would translate to 0.25% growth, or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  The high level of indebtedness in the economy means that we are very exposed to interest rate changes - both market rates and policy rates - so the impact on GDP of any changes there would be fairly stark.  We have included those as scenarios.  They are not our baseline assumption, but they illustrate some of the risks and try to quantify what would happen if any of these risks were to materialise.<\/p><p>  I thank committee members for their attention.

If we get GDP growth, that translates to a reduction in unemployment by a certain amount.  The model holds very well over time, but there seems to be a little bit of a breakdown in later years.  We also use a bottom-up approach whereby we look at employment growth and labour supply issues.  We try to model labour supply.  There are three components of labour supply.  The first is the natural increase - we know the number of people who are 15, so we know they will enter the 16-64 cohort of the population one year later.  We then try to relate our migration to this.  Historically there is a strong correlation between migration in Ireland and the Ireland-UK unemployment gap.  If that rises, we see outward migration.  If it falls, people come home.

I stress there is no sector in the report called the public sector, but there is a sector called health care and the assumption can be made that that is essentially, but not exclusively, the public sector.  We are looking at modest employment increases in the manufacturing sector.  We are looking at very modest increases in the construction centre - we are never going back to building 90,000 units of housing, so we will never see again the levels of employment that we had in the bubble years.  We are probably looking at increases in employment in what we call market services, but we are looking at reductions in non-market services, which are essentially the public sector, given the moratorium on public sector employment.  The increases will be essentially private-sector-driven over the next couple of years.<\/p><p>  The Chairman is right in saying that people will focus on the unemployment figure.  I think we can stand over those figures.  If one looks at what happened to the live register over the summer, one is looking at an annual decline in the order of 20,000.  If we look at August this year compared with August last year, the number on live register had decreased by around 20,000; ditto in September.  The pace of decline in the live register has picked up over the summer.  There are positive signs in the labour market, but I stress that we are not getting carried away - we do not see unemployment coming back to single digits any time soon.  There are problems with mismatches - the skills of the unemployed need to be better matched with areas where demand for labour is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013100800008#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1381255800,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I want to move on.

If there has been a reduction in unemployment and an increase in investments, why would the Department foresee a reduction in consumption?  It projected a 0.2% increase in consumption and the figure is -0.2%.  On Government spending, the Department projected a decrease of 2.1% and the figure is 0.9%.  On exports, it projected an increase of 2.3% and the figure is -0.6%.  On imports, it projected a decrease of 0.4% and the figure is 1.8%.  Even though unemployment has decreased as a percentage, the Department projected an increase in employment of 1.6%, but the figure is 0.4%.

It was supposed to increase by 0.2%, but it is down by 0.2%.  How does that feed into the growth projections?  Will Mr. McCarthy give his overall perspective as to where he sees the economy next year?  What measures does he believe have worked?

In the second half of last year there was a deterioration in the external environment which, unfortunately, gained momentum in the opening part of this year, with the result that we had a very negative first quarter figure.  We would not have had this at the time of the stability programme.  However, consumption has since picked up.  It picked up in the second quarter, when there was a quarter on quarter growth rate of 0.7%.  Over the summer the retail sale figures indicated a very strong consumer spend.  It appears that if one ignores the first quarter, the underlying position is a little better.  Obviously, consumption would have been affected by the change in registration regimes which would have affected car sales in the opening quarter but boosted them mechanically in the third quarter.  We have to take into account the fact that the figures for the first quarter were a source of disappointment and, on foot of this, we have revised downwards the overall modest growth rate of 0.25% to -0.25%.  It is not a massive change, but I believe we are moving in the right direction in consumption.<\/p><p>  With regard to the drivers of consumption, the figure for disposable income is flattening out.  The savings rate seems to be coming down.  There are modest increases in household wealth, although the literature tends to say the margin of propensity to consume from household wealth is fairly small.  Nonetheless, it is moving in the right direction.<\/p><p>  The Deputy correctly raised the issue of employment growth.

Employment is one component, with 30,000 people employed in the sector, but we have not seen massive lay-offs in the sector.

The pharmaceutical sector amounts to 25% of our exports and the slide presentation shows that exports have reduced by 4%.  This is one of the reasons the Department has downgraded the economic forecast for this year.  We all knew that the patent cliff was happening.  How did the Department underestimate the size of the patent cliff?  I refer to our discussion about the growth in joblessness.  The CSO figures show that something could be wrong, that the figures for either economic growth or jobs could be wrong.  Mr. McCarthy referred to the volatility of quarter on quarter numbers and these have been adjusted in the past.  For example, we thought there was growth last year and it was downgraded but it can work the other way.  Is the Department in any way optimistic that we will see an adjustment of previous quarters which will actually show growth in the economy?  My final question is linked.  I do not think we have ever had the Department ratcheting up the growth outturn.  There is an evident pattern which is that growth is downgraded for this year, that modest growth or a reasonable growth for next year is projected.  In April it is downgraded a bit and closer to the budget it gets downgraded more.  That has happened for the past number of years.  There is something wrong.  We can blame external forces as much as we wish but there is a problem in terms of economic forecasting and that is not just within the Department.  I appreciate all the difficulties and I would not like to change places with the witnesses.  In a way, some of this is false hope.  If we actually had the real economic growth figures from 2008 to 2013 painted in black and white, we would have taken a different direction.  However, we have been fed the notion that next year will be better if we hold on and tighten the belt a wee bit but when next year comes there is no growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013100800014#O02400","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1381259400,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the easy questions.

Let me give an example.  The Deputy is right about what happened in the past couple of years.  The figure for 2011 has been revised to 2.2%; we indicated at the time that it would be 1.3% or 1.4%, but it came in stronger than we would have thought at one stage.  Last year the initial estimate was 0.9%, but it was brought down to 0.2%.  That makes our job difficult, but the CSO has a difficult job to do and the quarterly figures are extremely volatile in an Irish context.  If the cut-off point for the supply of data by firms is the 15th day of the month and data from a large multinational come in on the 16th day of the month, they cannot be incorporated.  It is a very difficult job.<\/p><p>  With regard to not achieving the macro forecasts, we are not unique, as the Deputy acknowledges.  The International Federation of Accountants has conducted some research and we have been too negative in our outlook for exports, as they have tended to over-perform relative to our forecasts, but this has been more than compensated for by our being too optimistic on the domestic demand.  In other words, we assumed domestic demand would recover more rapidly than it has.  It is a balance sheet recession problem and there is the question of the turning point which is very difficult to predict.  I mentioned that there were tentative signs of a modest recovery in domestic demand.  If that occurs, people will feel it on the ground and there will be more tax-rich and employment growth.  Trying to predict this is very difficult and we have got it wrong, as others have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013100800015#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1381260000,"counter":478,"content":"<p>The other question was on the pharmacy sector.
