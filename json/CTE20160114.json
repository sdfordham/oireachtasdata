The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of technological universities which is a new type of higher education institution to be formed through the consolidation and merger of existing institutes of technology.  The Bill also provides for the revision of the governance arrangements of the Dublin Institute of Technology and the institutes of technology, under the Dublin Institute of Technology Act 1992 and the Regional and Technological Colleges Act 1992, respectively.  The Bill is comprised of 117 sections that are divided into seven Parts together with two Schedules.  Members will recall that the joint committee considered the proposed Bill in 2014 as part of its pre-legislative scrutiny procedures.  After that committee heard from a range of witnesses it produced a report which included recommendations for consideration by the Minister.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and officials from her Department to the meeting.  I reiterate that members and guests should place their telephones on aeroplane or safe mode or completely switch them off for the duration of the meeting.  I propose that if possible, the sub-committee concludes its consideration of Committee Stage during today's meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.

Many of the points made at the time have been taken on board in the drafting of the Bill.  A number of amendments relate to more general issues rather than to the specific purpose of the Bill and certainly will be considered in the context of other legislation.  It is probable that there will not be any other legislation in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il but certainly the Quality and Qualifications Ireland Assurance (Education and Training) Act has to be amended and a higher education reform Bill is planned.  They may be appropriate places for some of the points that will be raised during the course of the debate.  For the technological universities and the consortia that are interested in becoming technological universities, they need this legislation before they can move to the final stages.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy has said, he is seeking to insert new definitions into section 2 while amendment No. 6 would have the effect of deleting the phrase \"or appointed\" from the definition of \"student\" as currently set out in the Bill.  However, amendments Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 5 would insert definitions for words which are not actually used in the Bill nor in any of the other amendments tabled by the Deputy, and for that reason I believe they are unnecessary.  Amendment No. 3 would insert a limited definition for the word \"programme\", a word which is used in the Bill.  However, the term \"programme of education and training\" is defined in the Bill, by reference to the extensive definition of the term set out in the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act  2012.  Introducing an additional definition of the word \"programme\" would, therefore, introduce uncertainty with regard to the correct definition of the term.  Amendment No. 6, which would have the effect of deleting \"or appointed\" from the definition of \"student\", would unnecessarily limit the scope of that definition.  For these reasons, I cannot support the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12016011400004#C00600","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1452765900,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I will be pushing the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12016011400004#C00700","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1452765900,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy have any further questions or comments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12016011400004#C00800","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1452765900,"counter":17,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12016011400004#C00900","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1452765900,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Does any other Member wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12016011400004#C01000","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1452765900,"counter":19,"content":"<p>Following on from the Minister's general comments, I understand - correct me if I am wrong - the mergers can go ahead but there is no guarantee they will get the status of a technical university following the merger.

Chapter 3 of Part 2 provides a general mechanism for the merging of consortiums of institutes of technology to form new institutions of greater scale.  This mechanism includes assessment by an expert panel of their application to merge.  In 2014, consortiums in Dublin, made up of DIT and the institutes of technology in Blanchardstown and Tallaght, and in Munster, made up of Cork Institute of Technology and the Institute of Technology, Tralee, were assessed by an international expert panel and found to be on a clear trajectory to meet the very robust performance and quality criteria that had been set down for merging institutes which wished to apply for the new technological university status.<\/p> <p>Therefore, these consortiums have already completed the stage of the process set down in Chapter 3 of Part 2 and are working towards a full merger in the near future.  For that reason, Chapter 1 provides for the merging of DIT with IT, Blanchardstown and IT, Tallaght while Chapter 2, including sections 10 and 11, provides for the merging of CIT and IT, Tralee, as the next steps of the process on which those institutions have embarked.  To be clear, these are not forced mergers, as characterised by some.  Each of the consortiums has of its own accord come together to work towards achieving technological university status.  The purpose of Chapters 1 and 2 of Part 2, including sections 10 and 11, is simply to ensure that these consortiums are not required to go back to square one and be reassessed by an expert panel.  For that reason, the proposal by the Deputy that sections 7 and 10 be deleted from the Bill cannot be supported.

The joint committee conducted pre-legislative scrutiny on this Bill and there was significant discussion on the issue of how the governing bodies should be constituted.  One of the principles is that they should not be too large so that they can be effective in terms of size.  There were Seanad Members on that committee.  I have nothing against Seanad Members but I am concerned a number of proposals in these amendments would add to the size of governing authorities.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the amendment in the name of Deputy O'Sullivan, I understand the intention is to provide that certain members of the governing body would be appointed by the Minister rather than by the governing body.  There are differing views on that.  One of the purposes of the reform of the governing structures of higher education institutions in the technological sector is to grant governing bodies greater autonomy in the appointment of their members, within the parameters of a competency framework to be agreed by the governing bodies and the HEA.  Providing that the Minister, rather than the governing bodies, is responsible for those appointments diminishes that autonomy.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to the second proposed amendment to amendment No. 12, the Bill currently provides that each governing body shall have between one and three academic staff as members.  Those members will be elected by the staff themselves.  As I said earlier, this proposal could serve to increase the size of the governing body, which runs counter to the policy for governing authorities of higher education students to be smaller and more effective.  The suggestion that staff representatives be appointed from each of the institutes of technology involved does not accord with the establishment, through the merger of institutes of technology, of multi-campus technological universities with unified and integrated management and governance structures.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the point made about members being \"recommended\" rather than \"nominated\", this might create uncertainty.

This ensures that there is legal certainty around the continuation of such processes.<\/p> <p> In regard to the amendment to the amendment, amendment No. 21 provides for the continuation of any processes relating to the suspension or dismissal of staff which may be ongoing in an institute of technology at the time of its dissolution, so that those processes can continue.  Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment to amendment No. 21 does not relate to such situations, but to the ongoing arrangements which would apply to staff of a technological university and for that reason I cannot support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED12016011400019#S02800","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1452771600,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 21:<\/p><blockquote>To insert the following new subsection (1):&ldquo;(1) A Technological University may suspend or dismiss any employee but only in accordance with procedures and subject to any conditions made following consultation through normal industrial relation structures operating in the technological university with Trade Unions which procedures or conditions may provide for the delegation of powers relating to suspension or dismissal to the President and shall provide for the tenure of officers.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><p>This brings us back to the concerns of people who are working currently in the institutes of technology.
