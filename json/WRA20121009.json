The service consolidates, co-ordinates, develops and delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support structures for school personnel working with students with special educational needs including teachers of children with ASD who teach in a variety of educational settings. These settings include mainstream primary and post-primary schools, special schools and special classes.<\/p><p>  SESS provides a wide range of supports and interventions in the area of Autism via online training, face-to-face training, phone advice and individualised support for schools identified with CPD needs. The approaches include Language and Communication, Managing Inclusion, Curriculum Access for Pupils with General Learning Disabilities and Autism, Sensory Integration, PECS, TEACCH, Social Stories, and Applied Behaviour Analysis. Delivery of this CPD begins prior to their entry to the units and continues following the opening of the unit with ongoing in school support as well as programmes of CPD.  Since 2008 SESS has provided over 19,400 CPD places to teachers of students with ASD which include in-school support, seminars, online courses, ABA and Asperger's Syndrome.

However, even with the best possible systems in place, securing equilibrium between demand and supply is not an exact science, and is subject to quite a number of variables.  Recent developments, such as the EU rules on mutual recognition of qualifications, have also meant that supply is more difficult to control and predict.<\/p><p>  The level of student intake to the state-funded primary Colleges of Education is determined annually by my Department and it takes account of the supply of, and demand for, primary teachers. The level of intake has decreased in recent years in light of available resources and factors impacting on demand. This situation is subject to review.  <\/p><p>  As education at post-primary level is on the basis of subjects, the situation is complex and therefore difficult to predict and plan for.  Post-primary teachers are generally qualified to teach more than one subject but may not be deployed to teach these in equal measures at school level.  School management authorities have the flexibility to deploy teachers to meet demands.  Schools are also responsible for deciding what subjects and programmes to offer and this can vary from school to school in accordance with local need.  This in turn, determines the type of teacher competencies\/specialisms required.  While the numbers of PDE (formerly the H.Dip) places have remained fairly constant over recent years, there can be particular subjects which, over time, become more or less in demand and this can lead to a surplus or deficit of teachers of that discipline. I understand that in the present climate, there are newly qualified teachers not yet holding teaching positions in schools. The selection processes required of schools, and the imminent commencement of Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act depend on there being a supply of suitable individuals within the marketplace.  <\/p><p>  Measures have been taken to alleviate difficulties for new teachers. My Department has introduced regulations which oblige schools to recruit unemployed teachers ahead of retired ones.

The Department of the Taoiseach has undergone significant restructuring to better support our goals, including the establishment of a new office to monitor the Programme for Government.<\/p><p>Significant changes have also been introduced underlining the Government's commitment to D&aacute;il reform.

The Passport Service also currently provides emergency out-of-hours passport services in Dublin and Cork.  The Department also operates an out of hours Duty Officer arrangement to deal with consular and other non-passport emergencies.  The need to assess all services with a view to achieving cost savings has given rise to a full review of the Department&#8217;s duty officer services in Ireland.  This has resulted in a proposal for a new integrated duty officer service based in Dublin which will deal with all emergencies, including emergency passport services to the country as a whole.  The cost of maintaining emergency passport duty officer services in Dublin and Cork separate from the diplomatic duty officer is no longer seen as justified from a cost\/benefit perspective.  For example, the emergency service in Cork costs &#8364;575 per week and has issued approximately 1.3 passports per week in the year to date.  Departmental management and the Staff Side unions are working together to finalise the operational aspects of the proposed new integrated duty officer service.

Principal contractors are defined in the legislation (section 530A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997) as including &#8220;any board or body established by or under statute &#8230; and funded wholly or mainly out of funds provided by the Oireachtas&#8221;.  As such, school Boards of Management are principal contractors for the purposes of RCT.  Under VAT law, where a principal contractor (generally as defined for RCT purposes) receives services consisting of construction operations (again generally as defined for RCT purposes) the principal is an accountable person and is liable to pay the VAT chargeable on those services on a reverse charge basis.  In this regard, where a school Board of Management receives services consisting of construction operations the Board must register for VAT and account for VAT on the received services.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am also informed that Finance Act 2011 did not introduce any change in terms of the obligations of Boards of Management to operate RCT or VAT.  Nor did the Revenue Commissioners issue a directive in this regard.  Principal contractors, including school Boards of Management are, and always were, required to deduct tax from the payments made to subcontractors and pay it over to Revenue.  As it is recognised that it would be undesirable to deduct tax from compliant subcontractors, provision is made for compliant subcontractors to receive payments without deduction of tax.  The need to ensure tax compliance by subcontractors is particularly important where the Exchequer is the ultimate source of the funds being paid out by school Boards of Management and other principal contractors.  RCT and the VAT reverse charge system play an important role in ensuring tax compliance by subcontractors in these sectors.<\/p><p><br \/>  From 1 January 2012, the Revenue Commissioners have substantially modernised the operation of RCT following the introduction of a dedicated online facility which offers principal contractors a fast, efficient and paper free system.  This has streamlined the process for the submission of information and payments to Revenue and has had the effect of significantly reducing the administrative burden associated with RCT.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are aware of the difficulty some school Boards of Management may be having in fulfilling their obligations under the RCT and VAT systems.  Revenue has met with the Department of Education and Skills regarding the obligations of Boards of Management under the RCT and VAT systems and has also met with representatives of some Boards of Management.  In addition, Revenue has participated in a series of seminars throughout the country during September\/October 2012 organised by the<font color=\"#5F5F5F\"> <\/font>Joint Managerial Board in conjunction with the Catholic Primary School Management Association.  These seminars are aimed at school Principals, members of boards of management, bursars and secretarial\/accounts personnel who are likely to be in receipt of State funding for construction projects with a view to assisting them with their RCT and VAT responsibilities.

This report was circulated to Oireachtas Members and published by me in July.  Given the wide variation in the estimated revenue yield from an FTT when different factors are taken into account and the uncertainty as to the form the tax would take, the report states that more detail would be needed on the final shape and scope of the tax before a definitive conclusion could be reached about its impact on the Irish financial system and taxation revenue.  The report indicates that the &#8220;net revenue gain for Ireland from the introduction of an FTT &#8230; is likely to be modest&#8221;. Based on assumptions used by the Commission, including their proposed rates (the proposed rate on the exchanges of shares and bonds was 0.1% and the proposed rate of derivative contracts was 0.01%), the report estimates the potential yield from the FTT to be between &#8364;490m and &#8364;730m.  Under the Commission&#8217;s proposal, 2\/3rd of this yield would have gone directly to the EU to fund its Budget.  Based on the report&#8217;s estimate, the net yield to Ireland from an FTT where we retained only 1\/3 of the total collected here would be in the region of &#8364;163m to &#8364;243m &#8211; not dissimilar to the current yield from Stamp Duty on share transfers (&#8364;195m in 2011) which would have been abolished had we accepted the Commission proposal.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The Commission&#8217;s rates, on which the ESRI\/Central Bank report&#8217;s estimate is based, vary from the rates suggested in the Deputy&#8217;s question.  <\/p><p><br \/>  The report identified the following downsides and potential downsides to the introduction of an FTT:<i>  Financial sector impact<\/i>  : An FTT could displace financial sector activity, especially when alternative locations are readily available &#8211; in this case the UK. This would pose a real risk to Ireland given the financial services sector accounts for 10% of GDP; <i>Macro-economic impact<\/i>: An FTT would likely lead to a lower level of economic activity in the financial sector, which might also result in lower receipts from income tax and corporation tax; <i>Exchequer impact: <\/i>A 1% stamp duty applies on transfers of shares in Irish companies. As indicated above, the Commission&#8217;s proposal would involve the abolition of this tax and the loss of existing Stamp Duty revenue, c. &#8364;180 m in 2010 and &#8364;195m in 2011. <\/p><p><br \/>  I have stated from the outset of discussions on the FTT that any such tax would have to apply on a wide international basis and at a minimum on an EU-wide basis to avoid distortionary and behavioural impacts.

It provides for the establishment by the Euro Area member states of the ESM as an intergovernmental organisation under public international law.  Legislation is required for Ireland to ratify the ESM Treaty. The ESM Act passed all stages of the Oireachtas, and was signed into law by the President on 3rd July. <\/p><p>  The ESM Treaty and the underlying legislation in the ESM Act, as well as the European Council Decision from March 2011 proposing an amendment to Article 136 TFEU concerning stability mechanisms, was the subject of an extensive legal challenge in the High Court in June, and a subsequent comprehensive appeal in the Supreme Court in July, relating to its compatibility with the Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and also with the EU Treaties and the validity of the European Council Decision.  The challenge in relation to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann was unsuccessful, as was a request for an injunction to restrain Ireland&rsquo;s ratification.  A number of questions of EU law were referred by the Irish Supreme Court to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland ratified the treaty on August 1st by lodging the instrument of ratification with the Depositary.<\/p><p>  The ESM Treaty, at article 48.1 provides that the ESM will enter into force when instruments of ratification, approval or acceptance have been deposited by signatories whose initial subscriptions represent no less than 90% of the total subscription.  The ESM Treaty accordingly entered into force on 27th September 2012 following its ratification by 16 of the 17 Euro area member states, representing over 99.8% of its subscribed capital base.  All 17 Euro Area Member States have now ratified the ESM Treaty. <\/p><p>  The ESM Treaty provides that it shall have a capital base of &euro;700 billion of which &euro;80 billion is paid in capital. Ireland&rsquo;s share of this paid in capital is &euro;1.27 billion, based on the contribution key of 1.5922% set out in annex 1 of the ESM Treaty.  The Treaty provides that this contribution is to be paid in five equal tranches. The Euro Group Finance Ministers agreed in March 2012 that two of the five equal tranches would be paid this year, and subsequently agreed, in September 2012, that both of these tranches should be paid in October 2012.  For Ireland, these two tranches will amount to &euro;509.508 million in accordance with our contribution key %, and this amount will be paid this week, in accordance with our obligations following our ratification of the ESM Treaty and its entry into force.<\/p><\/span><\/td> \t\t\t\t\t<\/tr>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900057#WRF04300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":366,"content":"<p>Question No. 186 answered with Question No. 176.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Loans Sale","counter":367,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900058#WRG00300"},{"type":"question","counter":368,"qnumday":187,"qnumall":"[43357\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900058#WRG00400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the properties at a location (details supplied) in County Dublin on which the Health Service Executive has confirmed that a new lease has been signed for a new primary care centre are under the control of the National Asset Management Agency; if the property is currently for sale; the person who will benefit from the sale; and if money from the sale will be used to reduce the debt of the property's current owner","asker":"1066","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":369,"content":"<p>I am advised by the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) that information relating to its debtors and\/or their properties is, within the meaning of Sections 99 and 202 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, confidential and that it is therefore precluded from providing the information sought by the Deputy.

A precondition for a resumption of balanced economic growth is sustainable public finances. As such, the Government is committed to cutting the deficit and maintaining debt at sustainable levels. However, the objective of Government has been to ensure that any consolidation necessary is implemented in a credible manner, while seeking to minimise the impact on the economy and the labour market. In line with the economic literature and the broad consensus amongst various economic agencies - including the IMF, the ESRI and the Fiscal Advisory Council - we believe the most effective and growth friendly way to implement such consolidation measures is by concentrating the majority of the adjustments on the expenditure side.<\/p><p>  Looking forward to Budget 2013, the Government believes a continuation of this focus on expenditure cuts is necessary to limit the negative impact on the economy and the labour market. Consequently, two-thirds of the forthcoming adjustment is expected to be realised from the expenditure side.<\/p><p>  It should be acknowledged that while restoring the public finances to a sound footing is crucial for Ireland&rsquo;s future, consolidation will have a negative short-run impact on the economy.

In the delivery of the new junior cycle programme in schools, curriculum, assessment, teaching and learning must provide opportunities for students to be creative and innovative.  The learning outcomes for students at the core of the Framework for Junior Cycle are described in twenty-four statements of learning.   One of these states that the student \"takes initiative, is innovative and develops entrepreneurial skills\".  There is, therefore, a clear underpinning for innovative and entrepreneurial skills in the  Framework.  Innovation and entrepreneurial skills can be addressed either through the existing subjects or through short courses. A number of short courses are being prepared by the NCCA but in addition short courses can be developed at school level, meeting agreed criteria, which will address the individual needs and local contexts of schools and their students.<\/p><p>  In senior cycle students taking the Transition Year option, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme and the Leaving Certificate Applied are provided with specific opportunities to acquire enterprise skills.

The Code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years.

My Department has committed to the development of such a database in it's Data Strategy 2008-2010. As part of the development of the Data Strategy consultations were carried out with many of my Department's agencies to discuss how data could best be collected and shared in a manner which reduces the overall administrative burden for the school and allows for the most efficient operation and provision of services to the pupil. <\/p><p>  There have been a number of developments in recent years in the area of pupil data collection from post-primary schools. My Department is currently in the process of streamlining the post-primary returns process to allow for a live online system allowing for easy exchange of information that reflects the up-to-date situation in regard to enrolment at any one time and to cut down on administrative burden and the scale of paper-based information flows across the Department and its associated agencies. It is intended to pilot this development in the 2012\\2013 academic year.<\/p><p>  My Department intends to proceed, as soon as timing and resources permit, to extend this development to primary level schools. Once this is done, my Department will have access to an integrated live Learners database covering primary and post-primary level, which will allow for the effective monitoring of progression, and for enhanced policy planning using real-time data.

My Department is very focussed on improving its systems and requirements to ensure that the administrative burden for schools and for the Department itself is minimised as far as possible. To this end, a range of initiatives have been and continue to be undertaken by my Department.<\/p><p>  One such example is the introduction of electronic submission of primary schools' annual enrolment returns resulting in significant administrative efficiencies to this annual process for both schools and my Department. Another example is the recently introduced reforms to the teacher allocation process.  At primary level this involved combining the separate learning support (GAM) and language support allocation processes into a single and simplified allocation process thus reducing administrative workload.  A similar approach was also implemented at post-primary level.<\/p><p>  Developments in recent years in the Department's payroll area have included the introduction of an Online Claims System (OLCS) for teacher payroll and the payment of part-time teachers through the Department's payroll. The latter ended the previously burdensome system under which each school, funded by grant payments, was required to make its own arrangements to pay part-time teachers.  Across all areas of my Department, we are continuously seeking to identify opportunities, ranging from small administrative changes to the more significant and major reforms, to streamline our processes, achieve better value for money and ultimately improve the education provided to our students.

I am very conscious that the cost of textbooks is a considerable burden on families. Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, I have attempted to take steps to reduce the burden on families. Shortly after coming into office I met with members of the Irish Educational Publishers' Association and impressed on them the need to limit the cost of textbooks. I have also stressed to them the real need to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.<\/p><p>  The Association has responded positively to my approaches and have agreed a voluntary Code of Practice among their members. The Code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years. The publishers have also given assurances to me that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts in the range 10% to 17.5% so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes. All these developments are welcome, and I look forward to seeing the members of the Association implement these commitments. In May my Department published research which shows that there is a high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary school level. The research indicates that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme and I want to encourage this practice across all schools. Results at second level are not as conclusive.<\/p><p>  My Department provided approximately &euro;15m in total to first and second level schools by way of book grants in 2012.

This document contains details of my plans to reform the junior cycle in post-primary schools. One element of the plan relates to assessment.  We know that under the current system in third year, the Junior Certificate examination dominates the experiences of students; the focus of learning narrows, the emphasis is on rote learning and for many students, the examination does not lead to positive learning experiences and outcomes. The reality is that the Junior Certificate is no longer a high stakes examination. That is why I believe it no longer serves the eduational needs of every young person.<\/p><p>  It is also the case that current assessment practice at the end of junior cycle (or lower secondary education) in Ireland is out of line with best practice in many countries with high-performing educational systems.   It is my intention that the terminal Junior Certificate Examinations will be replaced with a school-based model of assessment where the emphasis will be on the quality of students' learning experiences and outcomes.  This replacement will happen, taking a phased approach, with English being the first subject to be introduced to First Year students in 2014.  Short courses will also be available. The new Junior Cycle will include on-going classroom assessment for learning where high quality feedback will be provided to students and their parents during the junior cycle.  It will also include a school work component for all subjects reflective of students' work over the course of the final two years for the purposes of certification.  All the evidence indicates that this will give students a better learning experience and outcomes at Junior Cycle. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRK03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":569,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRK03050"},{"type":"question","counter":570,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[43368\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRK03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which he expects to be in a position to replace temporary prefabricated structures and facilities throughout the country in the coming year; if he is satisfied that the programme to date is likely to achieve its objectives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":571,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[43373\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRK03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the total number of primary and second level pupils or students currently accommodated in temporary or prefabricated accommodation; the extent to which the programme to replace such facilities particularly those that have remained in situ for a number of years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":572,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 264 and 269 together.<\/p><p>  My Department does not hold information on the numbers of pupils in individual schools who currently occupy temporary accommodation; this depends on the organisation of class groups by schools within available accommodation and may vary from year to year.

Schools that do not currently have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS. In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a student be referred for individual psychological assessment\/intervention. Such intervention address both learning needs and\/or needs in relation to the area of social &amp; emotional competence.This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more students indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that students are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. <\/p><p>  In addition NEPS has provided guidance to all schools and school communities in relation to structures and processes to be put in place in the event of critical incidents. Upon request by school authorities NEPS psychologists provide direct on-site assistance to schools in coping with the aftermath of such traumatic events.<\/p><p>  NEPS currently directly employs some 168 psychologists sited in 22 local and Regional offices countrywide and assigned to schools in their respective catchment areas. I can inform the Deputy that my Department is currently engaging with 10 additional candidates with a view to their recruitment to NEPS in the current academic year bringing the total staffing complement to its highest level ever. I am satisfied that the NEPS service is responding adequately to the needs of schools. <\/p><p>  I acknowledge that the reduction in resources to second level schools is challenging for schools. However, the budget measure that requires schools to manage the provision of guidance and counselling from within their standard staffing allocation, the alternative to which was to make an adjustment to the standard staffing schedule, must be seen in the context of our very difficult budgetary constraints. As part of the budgetary measure my Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students. I am confident schools will act in the best interest of students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRK03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Policy","counter":577,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRK03650"},{"type":"question","counter":578,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[43370\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRK03700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he is satisfied regarding the adequacy of primary, secondary and third level education here in the context of preparing the young generation for an increasingly competitive place in the workforce; if comparisons have been made with other educational systems throughout Europe and globally with a view to identification of the best practice to achieve the best results; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":579,"content":"<p>I believe that in an ever changing world we need to strive for constant improvement in our education system.  Last year I launched Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life which is the national strategy to improve literacy and numeracy in schools.  We know both from domestic evidence and international comparisons through PISA that the literacy and numeracy standards of some of our students are not up to the standard which we would wish.  I have moved swiftly to bring in measures through the Strategy which are aimed at improving literacy and numeracy. <\/p><p>  Last week I announced a root and branch reform of Junior Cycle drawing from best practice at international level.  The Framework for Junior Cycle responds to compelling international evidence that shows more students will perform better by moving away from terminal high stakes exams at this point in their education. A number of the principles in my Framework acknowledge the importance of &quot;continuity and development&quot; and of &quot;Learning to learn&quot; from one sector of education to another so as to meet the challenges of life beyond school and, in particular, of working life. Students as they experience the new Junior Cycle programme, will be provided with opportunities to take initiative, to be innovative and to develop entrepreneurial skills. My Framework has been warmly welcomed by IBEC which commented that business needs employees with the capacity to analyse, communicate, be creative, manage information and work with others. IBEC believes that the new Junior Cycle should provide an opportunity to develop these types of attributes and skills from an early age. The change at junior cycle in turn presents an opportunity for a refocusing of efforts at senior cycle towards more varied forms of assessment across all examinations subjects. <\/p><p>  At third level, one of the core missions of the higher education system is to ensure the continued alignment of graduate output with the evolving skills needs of the economy and to provide the research infrastructure and graduates to support innovation, and foster enterprise development.  To ensure relevance of higher education provision, it is standard practice for institutions to establish content advisory panels with industry input for programme development. It is also common practice for institutions to develop bespoke programmes in collaboration with individual enterprises.   Engagement with enterprise is one of the core pillars of the National Strategy for Higher Education and a detailed framework and range of recommendations to ensure the system continues to provide graduates that are equipped to take their place in the modern workplace are being implemented.  Our high numbers of young skilled graduates has led Ireland to be ranked 1st for the availability of skilled labour in this year's IMD World Competitiveness Survey. This was backed up by the 2012 Talent Shortage Survey conducted annually by the Manpower Group, which ranked Ireland as the global leader for the availability of skills and the least difficult location, globally, in which to find talent. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRK03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":580,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRK03850"},{"type":"question","counter":581,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[43371\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRK03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he is satisfied regarding the adequacy of resources at his disposal to meet the challenge of the increase in population and consequent requirement for the provision of adequate school places and facilities at all levels; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":582,"content":"<p>Based on my Departments most recent projections (July 2012) it is expected that enrolments will increase at primary level by almost 76,800 pupils by 2018, from circa 516,000 pupils in the 2011\/12 school year.

Dismissals in other areas of the Public Sector are a matter for the relevant sector.<\/p><p>Prior to 2006, disciplinary and dismissal procedures were for the civil service as set out in Circular 1\/1992. Under these procedures, it was the responsibility of the Government to decide whether a civil servant should be dismissed.  Under these procedures my Department submitted each case to Government and so had an overview of the number of dismissals in the Civil Service.  During the period 2002 to 2009, there were sixteen dismissals under these procedures (see attached table).  (Where disciplinary proceedings had already commenced prior to July 2006 the case continued to be dealt with under the disciplinary procedures in Circular 1\/1992).<\/p><p>Under the provisions of the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005, each Secretary General\/Head of Office,  has the authority, responsibility and accountability for carrying out a range of duties in their Departments\/Offices.  Among these are the management of all matters pertaining to the appointment, performance, discipline and dismissals of staff below the grade of Principal.  The Disciplinary Code was revised in July 2006 to reflect the legislative changes and procedures for discipline and dismissals are now detailed in Circular 14\/2006.

Accordingly my Department does not have any details in relation to dismissals under the revised procedures introduced in 2006.

It is long established practice that Ministers do not get involved with its adjudication function.  However, having made enquiries, I understand that the EAT received a redundancy claim from the person concerned on 31 July, 2012 under the Redundancy Payment Acts.<\/p><p>  I wish to point out that the payment of statutory redundancy lump sums is the responsibility of the employer in the first instance.  However, where an employer genuinely cannot afford to pay an employee their entitlement, the employer and employee can apply directly to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) for a Redundancy Lump Sum using form RP50.  Proof of inability to pay must be submitted with the RP 50.  The Redundancy Payments Section in the Department of Social Protection (Block C, Earlsfort Centre, Lower Hatch Street, Dublin 2) has responsibility for the administration of statutory redundancy payments from the SIF.  Where an employer refuses to pay an employee their statutory redundancy entitlement or there is a dispute regarding an employees&rsquo; entitlement to a statutory redundancy payment, the employee must apply to the EAT for a hearing under the Redundancy Payments Acts.<\/p><p>  In the present case, I would suggest that this person may also wish to contact the Redundancy Payments Section within the Department of Social Protection to establish if she can satisfy the legislative requirements which would allow her claim for a statutory redundancy payment to be processed directly from the SIF without the requirement to have the appeal adjudicated upon EAT.  The EAT has seen a significant increase in its caseload in recent years, as it is one of the front-line services directly impacted upon by the economic downturn.  The current waiting period for a hearing in respect of redundancy claims in Limerick, is approximately 90 weeks from the date of application.  All appeals are listed for hearing in accordance with their date of lodgment with the Tribunal.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the efforts of the EAT to reduce its existing backlogs, I believe the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.  This is one of the reasons I am undertaking a root and branch reform of all five Workplace Relations Bodies. The Reform Programme I have commenced will deliver a Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.

An examination of the &#8216;fair use&#8217; doctrine to see if it would be appropriate in an Irish\/EU context was part of the Terms of Reference of the Committee.<br \/><br \/>The Committee published a comprehensive Consultation Paper in February 2012 based on submissions received and it requested more information on the issues raised including fair use. In the region of 180 submissions were received in relation to the Consultation Paper in which many complex and substantial matters, including fair use, were advanced and these are currently being appraised by the Committee.<br \/><br \/>The Committee has indicted that it expects to present its final Report before March 2013.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will reform the Joint Labour Committee structure, beginning with the appointment of independent chairpersons to JLCs, who will retain a casting vote. Reform options will examine the rate of pay for atypical hours. <\/td><td>Independent Review of JLC\/REA mechanisms published in April 2011. Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 giving effect to reforms enacted with effect from 1 August 2012.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will reduce the cost of Government imposed red-tape on business, in part by streamlining regulatory enforcement activities out of a merger and rationalisation of existing structures. We will create a Business Inspection and Licensing Authority that absorbs the existing business inspection activities of the Health and Safety Authority, and the National Consumer Agency. <\/td><td>In relation to this commitment, please note that my Department is responsible only for reducing &#8220;Government imposed red tape&#8221; not for merging existing structures.<br \/><br \/>Significant progress has been made by my Department, with a reduction in administrative burdens of 24.8% already achieved in the areas of Employment Law, Company Law and Health &amp; Safety Law; this amounts to annual savings for business of almost &#8364;207 million.<br \/><br \/>My Department also coordinates the cross-Government measurement and reduction of administrative burdens towards the 25% target by the end of 2012. A project to measure the burden imposed by regulation under the responsibility of seven Departments and Revenue was initiated in September 2011.  Following completion of its measurement exercise, each participating Department must then set out how it will achieve the remaining reductions necessary to reach the target and report to Government with its Simplification Plan. The current estimated overall reduction is just over 15% which includes the 24.8% achieved by my Department, 25% achieved by Revenue and 30% achieved by the Central Statistics Office. <br \/><br \/>The reform of the State's Workplace Relations Services will deliver a simplified two-tiered structure comprising a single body of first instance, the Workplace Relations Commission, and a single body of appeal, in effect an enhanced Labour Court.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will develop a Unique Business Identifier for use by all government departments and agencies that will facilitate the sharing of information within Government and reduce repetitive information requests from businesses. <\/td><td>Legislative proposals to facilitate data sharing currently being considered. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will introduce new legally binding voluntary commercial debt plan structures to allow small businesses to restructure debts without recourse to expensive court procedures.<\/td><td>I asked the Company Law Review Group (CLRG) to examine the feasibility of introducing such a scheme. The CLRG reported back at the end of September and I am considering that report. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will implement a temporary, partial credit guarantee scheme that will provide a level of insurance to banks against losses on qualifying loans to job-creating firms to get banks lending again to industry and entrepreneurs. <\/td><td>The launch of the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme is imminent. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will construct a &#8364;100 million Microfinance Start-Up Fund that will provide start-up loans and equity that draws funding from the NPRF and private institutional funds. <\/td><td>The Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme was launched on the 27th September 2012.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will support the development of a more dynamic, venture capital industry in Ireland by seeking to attract top tier venture financing and investment companies to Ireland, such as Silicon Valley Bank. <\/td><td>Given how close the current funding cycle is to completion, work is being progressed on delivering policy clarity on the future of the VC Schemes<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will work to promote a greater appreciation of the co-operative model as a distinct form of organisation, ensure a level playing field between co-operatives and the other legal options for structuring enterprise activities, and provide a conductive framework for the full potential of the co-operative model to be realised, including in areas such as childcare, education, housing, energy retrofitting, environmental protection, transport and healthcare. <\/td><td>My Department&#8217;s role is to provide the legislative framework within which business entities can operate, and a number of legal options are available to those considering establishing themselves in business. It is up to each individual operation to choose the model that best suits the nature of the business and the desired ethos of the entity. My Department does not promote one corporate form over another.  <br \/><br \/>In June 2011, I secured the agreement of Government to draft legislation to ease the regulatory burden on co-operative societies and to make it easier to start up and run a co-operative as an alternative form of enterprise organisation, and a draft Bill is now with the OPC for drafting. In this way, my Department plays its part in facilitating the development of co-operatives in the International Year of Co-operatives (2012).   Individual Departments will engage directly with the promotion or development of co-operatives in a particular field where they consider the co-operative model may bring particular benefit.<br \/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will legislate to ban a number of unfair trading practices in the retail sector, such as &#8216;hello money&#8217; from food suppliers. <\/td><td>Building on the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 which bans certain anti-competitive practices in the grocery goods sector, an enabling provision which will allow me as Minister to promulgate Regulations to establish a code of practice to regulate particular trading practices in the grocery goods sector, will be included in the Consumer and Competition Bill.  The Bill, the draft heads of which were approved by Government in July 2011, is currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and it is expected that the Bill will be published later this year.  The promulgation of any Regulations is expected to follow shortly after the enactment of the primary legislation.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will seek to establish Ireland as a renewable manufacturing hub to attract international and domestic investment. <\/td><td>Enterprise Ireland provides support to companies in the cleantech sector and is continuously assisting companies to find new export opportunities for energy-efficient and related products.  The Government&#8217;s plan for the development of the Green Economy will also support this commitment.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The Government will promote the development of a vibrant and effective social enterprise sector. We will instruct agencies to view social enterprises as important stakeholders in rejuvenating local economies. We will continue support for social innovation projects for young people through education, community and voluntary structures. <\/td><td>Forf&aacute;s carried out a review of the social enterprise sector and will be reporting to the Minister before the year end.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will make good corporate governance the law, not an optional extra, and enact legislation to provide for binding code of practice for corporate governance, which will be obligatory for companies wishing to be listed on Irish stock exchange.<\/td><td>Any company that wishes to list on the Irish Stock Exchange&#8217;s main market must implement the UK Corporate Governance Code and its Irish annex. This Code is subject to regular review and update, with the most recent amendments being made in September of this year. While the legal obligation to implement the Code only applies to companies listed on the main market, the Irish Stock Exchange&#8217;s own Listing Rules require companies on the secondary market to report on how they have applied the principles of the Code or, where they have not, to explain why. <br \/><br \/>Meanwhile, work is progressing on the Companies Bill, which will consolidate and reform the existing canon of company law. One novel feature of the Bill is that it will bring together into one statutory provision all the existing fiduciary duties of directors, to make them more accessible and comprehensive to all. <br \/><br \/>At the same time, the European Commission is examining the need for EU wide company law and governance measures and this is expected to yield proposals later this year. Where these are for legislation, we will be implementing them into Irish Law.  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will strengthen corporate governance legislation and enforcement. <\/td><td>Please see commitment above.<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRN00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Statistics","counter":682,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRN00850"},{"type":"question","counter":683,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[43002\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of Industrial Development Agency supported jobs created and lost in County Kerry in each of the past 10 years; the position that County Kerry ranks in order of counties for new jobs; if he finds these statistics satisfactory; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":684,"content":"<p>The Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment survey reports on jobs gained and lost in companies supported by the enterprise development agencies.

Commercially viable, well performing micro, small and medium enterprises that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services, thereby demonstrating their ability to repay the loan is the target of the scheme.  <\/p><p>  Decision making on commercial viability of the SME and all credit assessments will be fully devolved to the accredited lenders.  The individual loan transaction between Lender and Borrower is delivered in an almost identical fashion to any other comparable commercial lending transaction between the parties, with the only difference being the supplementary arrangements necessary for payment of the 2% premium charge by the borrower to the State.  Term loans, other instruments with term loan-like structures, and performance bonds will be covered by the Scheme.

The Reform Programme, which I announced in July, 2011, will among other matters, address a number of criticisms levelled over the years at the existing system.  These include:<\/p><p>- Five organisations with overlapping, but completely separate, objectives and operations.<\/p><p>- Claims are often referred to the wrong forum or under the wrong statute.<\/p><p>- Lack of consistency between the bodies regarding degree of formality of hearings, rules of evidence and use of adversarial or inquisitorial procedures.<\/p><p>- Overly legalistic and so complex that experienced practitioners find it difficult to comprehend.<\/p><p>- Excessive delays.<\/p><p>- Duplication of functions between the bodies results in &ldquo;forum shopping&rdquo;.<\/p><p>- Poor value for money.<\/p><p>  My objective is to establish a world-class Workplace Relations Service.  I am happy to report that substantial progress has been made to date and a number of important priority actions have been successfully delivered within the target timescale. These include:<\/p><p>- A new single contact portal called &ldquo;Workplace Relations Customer Services&rdquo; has replaced the five separate entry points. <\/p><p>- Complaints are now acknowledged, on average, within a week of receipt. This was previously taking up to eight months in some cases.<\/p><p>- The employer is also notified, on average, within a week of the complaint being lodged thus increasing the possibility of a resolution being reached without the need for a hearing.<\/p><p>- There are now no backlogs for Rights Commissioner hearings.<\/p><p>- A Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use.<\/p><p>- A new workplace relations interim website is in place.<\/p><p>- A pilot Early Resolution Service is now seeking to resolve disputes at an early stage without the need for adjudication.<\/p><p>- A major Business Process Review is at an advanced stage. This will identify the procedures, processes and systems which will underpin the new structures. <\/p><p>  My intention is to continue to progress the reform programme. The next major step is to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure. This will involve two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five. We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court. The WRC will replace the LRC, NERA, the Equality Tribunal and undertake the first instance functions of the EAT. The labour Court will take on the appellate functions of the EAT.  While considerable progress has been achieved to date on an administrative basis, completing the proposed reform requires the enactment of detailed legislation. This is necessary in order to provide the statutory basis for the new structures and processes.<\/p><p>  Last year I undertook a public consultation process that concluded in September 2011. The responses, overall, demonstrated a strong consensus around the need for reform and the shape that reform should take. The many positive suggestions that emerged from that process have helped to inform the design and delivery of the reform to date. They also influenced the proposals set out in the Blueprint to Deliver a World-Class Workplace Relations Service (Blueprint) which I published in April of this year.<\/p><p>  The Blueprint document set out, in considerable detail, how I propose to reform the workplace relations structures and processes. I published the Blueprint in order to provide a further opportunity for consultation. I am happy to have received 32 responses to the document. They include many supportive, useful and constructive suggestions and comments. All contributions made have received careful consideration and helped inform the preparation of the Policy Document &ndash; Legislating for a World-Class Workplace Relations Service which I submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in order to give the Committee an early opportunity to shape the legislation.  I had a constructive dialogue with the Committee on the basis of the document. <\/p><p>  Work has commenced on the legislative programme and detailed design to deliver the reform.  A significant amount of work has been completed on the legislative programme and the General Scheme of Bill was approved by Government for priority drafting at the Cabinet meeting on 24th July, 2012. I expect publication before the end of quarter one of next year. This would enable the proposed new structures to be put in place by early 2013.   <\/p><p>  In the meantime, I intend to continue to progress the reform on an administrative basis.  I am now proceeding to introduce a further tranche of specific projects and initiatives which can be progressed and implemented in advance of the enabling legislation. These include:   <\/p><p>- Transfer responsibility for the Equality Tribunal from the Minister for Justice and Equality to myself <\/p><p>- Publish the permanent  Workplace Relations Website to replace the six sites currently in place<\/p><p>- Establish a Single Hearings Management and Scheduling Unit<\/p><p>- Establish a Single\/Shared Corporate Services Unit for the Workplace Relations Bodies.<\/p><p>- Provide a version of Workplace Relations Complaint Form that can be submitted online (e-Complaint Form)<\/p><p>- Enhance  Adjudication Arrangements and reduction of backlogs in the Equality Tribunal<\/p><p>- Develop and deliver an accredited training programme for adjudicators<\/p><p>- Implement new business processes in the Workplace Relations Bodies<\/p><p>- Implement a Code of Practice and Conduct for adjudicators<\/p><p>- Introduce standard templates for Rights Commissioners&rsquo; decisions\/Equality Tribunal and EAT Determinations<\/p><p>- Review and revise, as necessary, existing statutory instruments (SIs) <\/p><p>- Rationalise hearings venues<\/p><p>- Develop a Single Determinations Database<\/p><p>- Put in place a Single Complaints Management System<\/p><p>  I am determined to progress the next phase of the reform and the enactment of the legislation with the same determination and priority that has delivered excellent results to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permit Applications","counter":694,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRN01650"},{"type":"question","counter":695,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[43439\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRN01700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if work is on-going on the creation of a visa for professionals in the ICT sector which is necessary in order that the world's top ICT companies can continue to be attracted and retained here.","asker":"1110","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":696,"content":"<p>Irish labour market policy is to ensure that general labour and skills needs are met from within the workforce of the EEA (comprising of the Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein).  Current Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand for strategic skills\/labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors such as healthcare, information technology and financial services. <\/p><p><br \/>  ICT is a key sector for Ireland due to the importance of its on-going levels of employment and exports and its future potential. As such, the availability of high-level ICT skills for the ICT sector is of strategic economic importance to Ireland in terms of continued growth in investments from foreign companies.  <\/p><p><br \/>  However, recruitment challenges have emerged for high-level ICT skills and it is estimated that there are in excess of 1,500 job vacancies in the ICT sector.  While increasing the supply of high-level skills from domestic sources is the most sustainable way forward in the long term, in the short term, companies will continue to rely on inward migration for sourcing ICT personnel.  A range of employment permits initiatives have been put in place to address this skills issue. The <b>Green Card Employment Permit Scheme<\/b>   is used by Ireland to meet labour market requirements where skills shortages have been identified by reference to analyses undertaken by the ESGFN. It is designed to attract highly skilled and highly paid individuals into the labour market with the aim of encouraging them to take up permanent residence in the State.

Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).   Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%). <\/p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.   The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&ndash;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.  One of the issues examined in the 2010 Review was the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contributions rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.  The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.<\/p><p>  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.  The scope of the review did not extend to costing of these benefits on a voluntary or optional basis.<\/p><p>  Any proposals to extend additional cover to the self-employed will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  Last year I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.   The Advisory Group will, inter alia, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.<\/p><p>  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed.<\/p><p>  Self-employed workers may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRN02800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Funding","counter":711,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRN02850"},{"type":"question","counter":712,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[42599\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRN02900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"with regard to local Social Employment Schemes formerly under F&Aacute;S, if she will consider measures to change where local community group members are been asked by Banks to act as guarantors because the last month's wages payments of a scheme are withheld pending audits; if she will engage with community groups to ensure a better system can operate between the scheme operators, her Department and the Banks.","asker":"1082","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":713,"content":"<p>Community Employment (CE) schemes work on annual contracts.

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice. The first two involve the enhancement of the website    and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears.  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.<\/p><p><br \/>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main accountancy bodies and the lenders. The general scope of the advice will be limited to the borrower&#8217;s principal private residence. <\/p><p><br \/>  The advisory framework has commenced with practicing accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.  <\/p><p><br \/>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as requested by borrowers. While the advisory framework will be monitored on an on-going basis, it is not intended to conduct a full review of the service before the due date of June 2013. The review will be undertaken to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and will encompass all aspects of the service including if participation is extended to other interested parties, the criteria that would be required in terms of relevant qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc.   The accountancy bodies have notified their members about the new service and a panel is available on a county by county basis on the website <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">.<\/font><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRN04600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":738,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":739,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[42701\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision on an appeal for invalidity pension will issue in respect of a person (details supplied)in Dublin 16; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1027","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":740,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 3 July 2012.

This BPI project is focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs.  Initial focus was placed on clearing the backlog of carer&rsquo;s allowance claims awaiting scanning and registration.  Over July and August 2012, 4,414 claims were scanned and registered -clearing the backlog completely.  Claims are now scanned within a day or two of being received.<\/p><p>  The focus has now moved to the processing of new claims.  Processing of claims has been divided into two streams. One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processing these without delay.   The second stream works on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and progress after 5 weeks of operation is very encouraging.<\/p><p>  During the month of September 2012 1,147 carer&rsquo;s allowance claims were received, while 1,317 claims were decided.

Two fundamental principles apply:<\/p><p>- The contributory principle whereby there is a direct link between contributions paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions that are payable as a right if and when particular contingencies arise; and<\/p><p>- The solidarity principle whereby contributions paid by insured persons are not actuarially linked to benefits but are instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable. It is an expression of solidarity between both earning groups and generations. The non-contributory pension falls into this category.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Budget 2012 announced changes to State pension provision including new rate bands for claimants who become eligible for State pension after 1st September 2012.<\/p><p>Prior to the September 1st changes this year, a person with an average of between 20 and 47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. This is not equitable.<\/p><p>The reform introduced additional rate bands for new customers who become eligible for State pension (transition) and State pension (contributory), and associated increases for qualified adults from 1st September 2012.  This affects those who have smaller yearly average of social insurance contributions as they spent fewer years at work.<\/p><p>The maximum rate remains unchanged and the rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year also remains unchanged.  However, those who have fewer than 40 contributions per year will receive a lower rate of pension. If claimants have an income need they may, following a means test, qualify for a higher rate on the State pension (non-contributory).<\/p><p>People who qualify for the State pension (contributory) based on either of the top two rate bands i.e. a yearly average of 48 PRSI contributions or more and a yearly average of between 40 and 47 PRSI contributions qualify for a weekly personal payment of &euro;230.30 and &euro;225.80 respectively, both of which are greater than the maximum rate of the State pension (non-contributory) pension which is &euro;219.00 per week.<\/p><p>Similarly, those who qualified for the State pension (contributory) before 1st September based on either of the top two rate bands qualified for a personal payment of &euro;230.30 per week and &euro;225.80 per week.  These were based on yearly average of 48 PRSI or more contributions and a yearly average of between 20 and 47 PRSI contributions respectively.  The maximum personal rate of the State pension (non-contributory) is &euro;219.00 per week and is paid to people who have a weekly means of &euro;30 or less.  The weekly rate of payment is reduced by &euro;2.50 for every &euro;2.50 means assessment over &euro;30.00.  The minimum personal rate payable is &euro;4.00 per week which is paid to people whose weekly means amounts to over &euro;242.50 and up to &euro;245.00.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the State pension is a very valuable benefit and the change to State pension rate bands means that pension payments will be more closely related to PRSI payments made over a working life.  This ensures that those who contribute more during their working life will benefit more in retirement, thereby ensuring equity in the social welfare system.<\/p><p>It is also important to note the significant long term challenges facing the Irish pension system.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two to one by 2050.  People aged 65 years and over will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion of working age is expected to decline.  People are living longer with healthier lives and growing numbers of people want to work, or may need to work beyond State Pension age.   While this is a welcome development it does have obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population.  The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system, and these reforms are essential to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability.<\/p><p><table><tr><th colspan=\"3\"><b>Rates of payment from January &#8211; August 2012<\/b><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)<\/td><td>Personal Rate<\/td><td>State Pension <br \/>(Non-contributory)<\/td><td>Personal Rate<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>48 cons or over <\/td><td>&#8364;230.30<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20 - 47<\/td><td>&#8364;225.80<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15 &#8211; 19<\/td><td>&#8364;172.70<\/td><td>Weekly Means up to &#8364;30.00<\/td><td>&#8364;219.00 (maximum rate)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10 &#8211; 14<\/td><td>&#8364;115.20<\/td><td>Weekly Means of over &#8364;30.00 &amp; up to &#8364;32.50 <\/td><td>&#8364;216.50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)<\/td><td><\/td><td>State Pension<br \/>(Non Contributory)<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>48 cons or over<\/td><td>&#8364;230.30<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>24 &#8211; 47<\/td><td>&#8364;225.80<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><b>Rates of Payment from 1st September 2012<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)<\/td><td>Personal Rate<\/td><td>State Pension <br \/>(Non-contributory)<\/td><td>Personal Rate<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>48 cons or over <\/td><td>&#8364;230.30<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>40 - 47<\/td><td>&#8364;225.80<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>30 - 39<\/td><td>&#8364;207.00<\/td><td>Weekly Means up to &#8364;30.00<\/td><td>&#8364;219.00 (maximum rate)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20 - 29<\/td><td>&#8364;196.00<\/td><td>Weekly Means of over &#8364;30.00 &amp; up to &#8364;32.50 <\/td><td>&#8364;216.50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15 &#8211; 19<\/td><td>&#8364;150.00<\/td><td>Weekly Means of over &#8364;32.50 &amp; up to &#8364;35.00<\/td><td>&#8364;214.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10 - 14<\/td><td>&#8364;92.00<\/td><td>Weekly Means of over &#8364;35.00 &amp; up to &#8364;37.50 <\/td><td>&#8364;211.50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)<\/td><td><\/td><td>State Pension<br \/>(Non Contributory)<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>48 cons or over<\/td><td>&#8364;230.30<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>40 &#8211; 47<\/td><td>&#8364;225.80<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>30 &#8211; 39<\/td><td>&#8364;207.00<\/td><td>Weekly Means up to &#8364;30.00<\/td><td>&#8364;219.00 (maximum rate)<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code Issues","counter":788,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRP01350"},{"type":"question","counter":789,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[42907\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRP01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will change legislation so property\/capital will be disregarded as means for jobseeker's allowance if the person in question is not in receipt of any income from it; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":790,"content":"<p>In assessing means for social assistance payments including jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, account is taken of the value of capital and property belonging to the person and their spouse or partner.

The Department's objective in this area is to raise educational and skills level among the long term unemployed in order to help them to meet the requirements of the modern labour market. Included in the supports available is the back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme which is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education.  The scheme is open to those on certain social welfare payments for a specified time and who otherwise meet the conditions of the scheme. These other conditions include, the nature of the course being pursued and the qualification sought, and progression by reference to the level of education previously held.  The scheme covers a wide range of full-time courses of education in approved colleges spanning basic foundation courses to third level courses across all disciplines. <\/p><p>  BTEA guidelines are, in the main, in line with the mechanisms in place for similar student supports administered by the Department of Education and Skills and require student progression from one qualification level to a higher one.  This is necessary to ensure displacement does not occur, in that courses could be offered to students who are not progressing at the cost of students progressing from a lower education level.  <\/p><p>  It is important to note that the BTEA scheme is not intended to be an alternative form of funding for those wishing to enter or re-enter the education system. It is not possible, within the scope of the scheme, to authorise an application for payment where the basic qualifying conditions have not been satisfied and progression is not evident.<\/p><p>  If a person wishes to pursue a part time education course they may be able to do so while still obtaining their jobseekers payment.  They must apply at their local social welfare office and verify that participation on the course does not reduce their availability for work.  In the case of jobseekers benefit, participation on a course does not grant any extension to the normal period for which jobseekers benefit is paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRP02300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Waiting Times","counter":802,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRP02350"},{"type":"question","counter":803,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[42959\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRP02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the average length of time taken by the Social Welfare Appeals Office to process appeals in respect of applications for invalidity pension, disability allowance, carer's allowance, domiciliary care allowance and jobseeker's allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":804,"content":"<p>The current processing times of appeals in respect of applications for invalidity pension, disability allowance, carer's allowance, domiciliary care allowance and jobseeker's allowance at the end of September 2012 are listed in the table below.<\/p><p>Generally the vast majority of cases fall within these average times but extenuating factors, often outside of the control of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, will cause greater delays in some cases.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, from about early 2009 the number of appeals received by that Office has increased dramatically and by 2011 had more than doubled from an average of 15,000 pa to. 31,241 in 2011.

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 90,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement, for which the Government has provided &euro;436m in 2012.<\/p><p>  Historically rent supplements have been administered at a local level by the Community Welfare Service directly to the customer. As a result of the large increase in claims being made in recent years, with the number of persons in receipt of the allowance increasing by 62% during the period from 2007 to 2011, it was considered that the processing of rent supplement claims could be delivered more efficiently through centralised units. Departmental officers who were formerly community welfare officers continue to assess applications for rent supplement within the centralised units. The establishment of rent units also supports front line staff to focus in the delivery of basic payments and exceptional and urgent needs payments. <\/p><p>  Customers living in one of the areas covered by a rent unit can obtain a rent pack from their local departmental representative. This pack contains detailed information and all the relevant application forms. This rent pack can also be requested by phone from the relevant unit. Information on the areas covered by rents units throughout the country is available on the Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p><p>  The timescale for determining individual applications for rent supplement is dependant, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements, information from landlords, etc. In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required. Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information. The Deputy&rsquo;s particular concern is probably referring to the Bishop&rsquo;s Square Central Unit which did experience an increase in application waiting times over the last number of weeks. This is in part due to the on-going process of rationalising rent and mortgage interest supplements services for the greater Dublin area with a few to improving efficiency in service delivery. The temporary issue of waiting times in the Bishop's Square office has since been resolved.<\/p><p>  A key objective of the transfer of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive to my Department on 1 October 2011 is to provide a streamlined, consistent and enhanced service to the customer. The process of integration is on-going and significant progress has already been made with a unified service, the National Employment and Entitlements Service, is now in the process of being delivered in four offices. The delivery of services in relation to processing rent supplement applications is also subject to on-going review. However, I have no plans at this time to reverse the establishment of some centralised rent units.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that staff makes every effort to decide rent supplement claims in an efficient, effective and timely manner. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Payments","counter":859,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRQ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":860,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[43261\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRQ02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if rent supplement is now being paid in arrears rather than in advance in view of the fact that this is putting persons under significant pressure.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":861,"content":"<p>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.

The Department relies on the knowledge and expertise of its staff to deliver these services and, in view of their crucial role, the numbers of staff required to deliver a quality customer service is kept under constant review.  <\/p><p>  In the period since May 2008, some 1,045 staff have been redeployed to the Department to fill critical vacancies in scheme areas, local offices, central support units and the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate to deal with the increased volume of claims due to the downturn in the economy.  The Department also makes judicious use of overtime and employs temporary staff as appropriate to address particular service issues as they arise.<\/p><p>  In general across departmental schemes delays are kept to an absolute minimum.  In August 2012, for instance, 96% of domestic State Pension Contributory claims being decided by the date of entitlement and 98% of illness benefit claims were decided within 1 week.   However, customers for some other Departmental schemes such as family income supplement and carer&rsquo;s allowance are experiencing lengthy delays at present. <\/p><p>  Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria for the scheme involved.  In order to meet the dual challenges of increased claim volumes and the demand for shorter processing times, the Department has embarked on a major programme of process redesign and modernisation involving the development and roll-out of new computer systems and streamlined work practices.  In addition, a programme of business improvement process projects is underway in the Department&rsquo;s Longford Headquarters, which deals with long-term disability, carer&rsquo;s and family income supplement schemes.  This programme is aimed at eliminating excessive delays and began with invalidity pension.  A significant reduction in the number of new invalidity pension claims awaiting decision has been achieved with numbers reducing from 7,007 at the start of June 2012 to 5,372 at the end of September 2012.  Similar projects are currently underway in the carer&rsquo;s allowance and family income supplement areas.<\/p><p>  I should also point out that in order to offer a more streamlined, efficient and integrated service to customers, the Department is undergoing a process of intensive planning and organisational change in establishing the new National Employment and Entitlements Service (NEES).  This service brings together the Community Welfare Service (CWS), the Employment Services and Community Employment Programmes of F&Aacute;S, the Rural Social Scheme and Community Services Programme from the former Department of Community, Equality and the Gaeltacht and the Redundancy and Insolvency schemes from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.<\/p><p>  The new NEES model will integrate all employment and benefit support services in a single delivery unit and will provide a coherent integrated and more personalised service to customers. It will also serve to eliminate the duplication of work that characterised services which were provided separately in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRQ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Applications","counter":867,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRQ02750"},{"type":"question","counter":868,"qnumday":369,"qnumall":"[43347\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRQ02800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if job-seeker's allowance payment will be granted in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":869,"content":"<p>The jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance application of the person concerned was closed as the deciding officer was not satisfied that she resided at the address provided on her application.

The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately &euro;1.6 billion in avoided energy costs for the economy in 2020.  The second Action Plan, which I will be bringing to Government shortly, provides a progress report on delivery of the national energy efficiency objectives and shows that Ireland is on track to deliver the 20% energy savings target by 2020.  The Plan will also set out a range of energy saving actions in the public sector, which will be prioritised between now and 2020.<\/p><p>  My Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) have established a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system whereby all energy usage in the Public Sector will be accounted for and progress will be systematically recorded.  Last month I wrote to the head of each of the public bodies, reminding them of their obligation to report annually their energy usage to SEAI.  Enclosed with each letter was the SEAI report: &lsquo;Energy Use in the Public Sector&rsquo;, which outlines savings achieved to date across the public sector to end-2010 amount to 650 GWh.<\/p><p>  The public sector is estimated to spend more than &euro;500 million per annum on energy.  Achieving our 33% savings target for the public sector would save &euro;150 million each year in expenditure.  This Government remains firmly committed to meeting this target.  This year SEAI has targeted the top 135 public bodies, which account for over 95% of public sector energy consumption.  These organisations will submit detailed energy and activity data to SEAI.  From this data detailed progress scorecards will be produced for each organisation.  From 2013 on, an SEAI online energy data system will facilitate all public bodies and schools to report detailed energy data and allow SEAI to prepare detailed scorecards for all public bodies.<\/p><p>  Since 2009, my Department through SEAI has supported over 140 public sector retrofit projects.  This year the Better Energy Workplaces 2012 Fund has offered support to 145 projects &ndash; 44 of which are in the public sector.  This scheme has developed public sector and market competence and capacity for pay-as-you-save type models.  I recently approved the formation of an action group to develop a framework for energy performance contracting, which will stimulate mass scale retrofitting projects across the public sector.  This has been complemented by the Government decision to require all public sector bodies to go out to the market for energy services if their energy spend is more than &euro;500,000 per year.  The energy performance contracting framework will allow public bodies to implement projects whilst not relying on additional public expenditure to do so, thus not impacting on their capital budgets whilst also reducing their operating costs.<\/p><p>  Through all of the measures outlined, the exemplary role of the public sector will stimulate investment in energy efficient technologies and the development of a market for energy services and products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRR01900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exploration Licences","counter":915,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRR01950"},{"type":"question","counter":916,"qnumday":386,"qnumall":"[43213\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRR02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the persons who will have rights to any gas extracted from beneath Coillte owned lands in the Lough Allen Basin.","asker":"1047","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":917,"content":"<p>For clarity, I would like to advise the Deputy that neither an Exploration Licence nor a Petroleum Lease has been granted with respect to any land in the Lough Allen Basin.<\/p><p>  On a general note, the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960 provides that all petroleum vests in the State.

The measures are installed as appropriate, following a survey of eligible households, by installers drawn from a panel of Community Based Organisations (CBOs) and private contractors.

Consumers can also take steps to improve the efficiency of their electricity usage which delivers demonstrable savings.  The CER is also working with energy suppliers to ensure that vulnerable customers are protected through, inter alia, the installation of Pay As You Go meters.<\/p><p>  The long term policy responses for Ireland to combat vulnerability to high and volatile gas prices continue to be increasing the use of renewables, better energy efficiencies and reducing the reliance on gas in the fuel mix.  Implementation of the measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s Affordable Energy Strategy is also key to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers.<\/p><p>  The Affordable Energy Strategy was published in November 2011 and developed by the Inter-Departmental\/Agency Group on Affordable Energy (IDGAE) as part of the Departments commitment in the Programme for Government to help mitigate energy poverty.  The Affordable Energy Strategy provides a framework for building upon the many measures already in place to protect households at risk from the effects of energy poverty, which include the thermal efficiency-based measures delivered through the Better Energy: Warmer Homes programme.<\/p><p>  There are forty-eight actions identified in the strategy to be implemented over the life-time of the report (3 years).  Five priority measures are identified including a commitment to review the National Fuel Scheme in the context of examining the feasibility of aligning income supports with the energy efficiency and income of the home, the phased introduction of minimal thermal efficiency standards for rental accommodation, ensuring greater access to energy efficiency measures, reforming the eligibility criteria for energy efficiency schemes and the introduction of an area based approach.<\/p><p>  I have allocated &euro;23.647 million in 2012 to the alleviation of energy poverty which will be disbursed through a combination of community based organisations, private contractors and via an area-based approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRR03900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":946,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRR04000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services Funding","counter":945,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRR03950"},{"type":"question","counter":946,"qnumday":396,"qnumall":"[42631\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRR04000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his Department will engage with local authorities in the provision of services; and if so, the details of same.","asker":"1102","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":947,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[42632\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRR04100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his Department will work with local authorities in the delivery of services; and if so the details of same.","asker":"1102","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":948,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 396 and 397 together.<\/p><p>  I refer to the reply to Questions Nos.167 and 170 of 4 October 2012 which set out the position in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRR04150","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Non-Principal Private Residence Charge Collection","counter":950,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRS00250"},{"type":"question","counter":951,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[42791\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRS00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if the non-principal private residence charge will increase; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":952,"content":"<p>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on non-principal private residences.

That office is an office of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (I.N.I.S.) and it handles all aspects of visa applications including appeals.  In general business visas are processed within two to five working days of receipt and visit visa applications for Chinese nationals within one to three weeks.  This time frame is dependent on all the required documentation being provided with no queries remaining outstanding.  It should also be noted that the approval rate for Irish visa applications lodged in China is in excess of 90%.<\/p><p>  Guidelines on the visa application process for nationals of China, including details of the required supporting documentation can be found on the website www.embassyofireland.cn.    I would also draw the Deputy's attention the following initiatives which are in operation in the Visa Office in China currently:<\/p><p>- The Short-stay Visa Waiver Programme, which allows tourists or business people who have lawfully entered the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.  The Government decided on 12 March to extend the Programme for a further period of four years i.e. to end October 2016, in light, particularly, of the positive response from tourism agencies and operators.  The Visa Waiver Programme covers nationals of a total of sixteen countries, including China, where  it has been a particular success.  For example, I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, that since the introduction of the Programme, 36 new tour operator itineraries to Ireland from China have been established, while existing itineraries have also experienced growth.<\/p><p>- With effect from 1 August, 2012, a more liberal multi-entry visa regime for business travellers and other visitors was implemented in the Irish Visa Office in Beijing.  The regime allows for the issue of scaled term multi-entry visas of up to three years duration depending on the applicant's previous international visa history.<\/p><p>- In recognition of the growing number of independent tourists from China, a scheme was introduced in the Beijing Visa Office earlier this year under which independent travellers who had no connection with Ireland could apply for a visa, whereas previously they had to have an invite or be a member of an official Approved Destination Status (ADS) tour.  The requirements for such a visa have been simplified and I am informed that Tourism Ireland has welcomed this initiative.<\/p><p>- For several years now, the Embassy in Beijing has been operating a scheme for Approved Destination Status (ADS) tourists.  ADS group tourism visas were the main tourist visa obtained by Chinese citizens to travel worldwide - the approval to travel for their citizens must come from the Chinese authorities.  Several measures were introduced to encourage this type of tourist to Ireland resulting in an ADS visa being one of the most straightforward and quickest Irish visa to obtain with processing times being less than three working days normally.  The success of the Visa Waiver Programme has, to a large extent, eliminated the use of ADS visas for travel to Ireland alone.<\/p><p>  My Department is constantly seeking ways in which the visa system can facilitate increased business and tourist visas from growing markets such as China and, in this regard, meets regularly with tourism and business promotion agencies to discuss initiatives in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Status Applications","counter":1075,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRU00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1076,"qnumday":443,"qnumall":"[42692\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRU00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there are alternative options available in terms of identification to those whose applications for asylum are refused and their photo IDs are removed from their possession; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1077,"content":"<p>When an asylum applicant arrives in the State they are provided with a Temporary Residence Card (TRC).

The Direct Provision system provides asylum seekers with full board accommodation, free of utility or other costs.  Currently, there are 36 asylum accommodation centres in the State accommodating just under 5,000 persons.  Seven of the centres are State owned and the remainder are owned by private companies.  All centres are managed, under contract to RIA, by private companies employing their own staff.  All companies are contractually required to comply with legal requirements in relation to health and safety, food safety and so on.  As is normal, companies have their own management rules and practices and once these do not conflict with RIA requirements, RIA does not seek to interfere.<\/p><p><br \/>  Plainly, how a centre is managed is determined by a number of factors, not least the profile of persons being accommodated and the physical layout of the centre.  Of the current 36 asylum centres in RIA's portfolio, only 3 were specifically built for the sole purpose of accommodating asylum seekers i.e. were 'system built'.  All other centres must operate within the physical limitations of the premises' original use e.g. hotel, college dormitory, hostel, etc.  While all conform, at the very least, to minimum contractual and legislative standards, there are necessarily a range of facilities available in centres in the overall RIA portfolio, deriving from this original use.  This being the case, a number of centres have developed their own rules which complement and act in tandem with the RIA requirements, as explained below, and these are generally geared towards providing information on the routine in the specific centre concerned.<\/p><p><br \/>  The following RIA-produced documents - all available on its website <i>www.ria.gov.ie<\/i> - set out the basic requirements which must be satisfied by a contractor:<\/p><p>(i) The contract itself.

This describes the standards of professional practice required of persons working in accommodation centres as they go about their daily work.  The Code ensures that workers know what standards of practice employers, colleagues, service users and the public expect of them.  <\/p><p>(iv) Child Protection Policy \/ Garda Vetting.

Some 721 applications were returned because either the declaration on the application form was unsigned or the appropriate fee was not tendered.  Many of these applications were subsequently resubmitted and at present the Authority has 5,107 applications on hand.<\/p><p>  Section 99 of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 provides that persons, who were lawfully providing a property service prior to the coming into effect of the new licensing system on 6 July 2012, could continue to provide such property service pending a determination of their licence application by the Authority.  Consequently, before undertaking the detailed examination of the licence applications it was necessary for the Authority to carry out an initial examination to determine which applicants came within the remit of section 99 of the Act.  On completion of this examination all applicants were written to and informed whether or not they were covered by the provisions of section 99.  Of the 5,107 licence applicants, 301 were informed that they could not avail of section 99 as they had not provided sufficient evidence of their having been lawfully providing property services prior to 6 July 2012.<\/p><p>  All applications have now been input into the database, the application details have been verified and the process of detailed vetting of the applications is underway.  To date it has been necessary to write to over 60% of applicants due to the fact that applications have either been incorrectly completed or relevant documentation has not been supplied.  The reasons why applications have not been accepted are myriad including the failure of applicants to provide: sufficient evidence of qualifications; evidence of being tax compliant; appropriate Accountant's Report; appropriate Professional Indemnity Insurance; Certificate of Incorporation in the case of companies; Business Registration Certificate; Appropriate answers to certain questions relating to criminal convictions, etc.  In a number of instances applicants failed to indicate the licence type being applied for and furnish photographs.  Because it has been necessary to write to so many applicants the licensing process has taken much longer than originally anticipated.  However, to date letters have issued to over 350 applicants informing them of the Authority's intention to grant a licence.  It is hoped to have the process complete in the next 8 to 10 weeks.<\/p><p>  Great care must be exercised in this, the first year of licensing to ensure that only those who fully meet the new licensing requirements are approved.  As a consequence the process is time consuming.  While it is recognised that this time of change involves more input from the industry, the greater care taken in these initial stages will ensure that in future years the process will be more streamlined and simpler for applicants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRU02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":1101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRU02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1102,"qnumday":453,"qnumall":"[42802\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRU02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to issue a technology visa in order to fill any existing technology skills deficit here.","asker":"1099","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1103,"content":"<p>I would refer the Deputy to my answer to Parliamentary Questions 31684\/12 and 31686\/12 on 3 July last, which is reproduced for the Deputy's information.<\/p><p>  While I am not averse in principle to the establishment of an immigration regime specifically geared to the technology sector, it would have to be on the basis that there was concrete evidence of a particular skills deficit in the labour market that cannot be filled by Irish or EU citizens.

At that time there was approximately 22,000 citizenship applications awaiting decision, approximately 17,000 of which had been awaiting decision for in excess of 6 months with an average waiting time of 26 months.  <\/p><p>  The series of measures I introduced have resulted in a major improvement in the position with decisions having being made on some 33,000 applications since coming into office.   Over a comparable period, between March 2009 and October 2010 a total of 18,500 cases were decided representing an almost 80% increase in throughput.  Moreover, approximately 4,000 of the 2009 case-load related to ineligible minors that involved minimal processing.   <\/p><p>  Almost 30,000 of these applications were approved after due process, while around 3,000 were deemed ineligible or were refused because they did not comply with the statutory criteria such as being of good character, lawful residence and so forth. It is important to note that the grant of citizenship is not a right; indeed it is a privilege and is given in accordance with the law.<\/p><p>  In considering the volume of cases currently in hand a number of factors have to be taken into account including, as detailed above, the volume of cases processed as well as new cases coming on hand. Also to be taken into account is the peaks and troughs of decision making which is linked to the timing of our citizen ceremonies.  Accordingly, there are wide variations in the statistics of cases on hand from one week to the next.  For example, next week will see the 56th, 57th and 58th citizenship ceremonies being held with a further series of ceremonies planned for early December. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate there has been a major improvement on what hitherto had been unacceptable delays in the system.  We are still on course to meet the very ambitious target of processing 70% of all standard non-complex cases within six months of receipt of applications.   I am determined that we achieve that target and go on to build on the excellent progress to date.   Considerable resources continue to be deployed to process applications and huge credit is due to the staff in the area for taking on the challenge. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that alongside the improvements in processing, in June 2011, I introduced formal citizenship ceremonies for the first time since the foundation of the State. The ceremonies, which are being met with universal approval, allow candidates for citizenship make their declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State and receive their certificate of naturalisation in a meaningful and dignified manner which befits the importance and solemnity of the occasion. I was pleased to note that the Citizenship Division of the Immigration Service was this summer awarded one of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Public Service Excellence awards of 2012 for their work over the past year and for their enthusiastic embracing of the reforms that have taken place. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRV03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Recruitment","counter":1157,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRV03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1158,"qnumday":472,"qnumall":"[42974\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRV03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"since he took office, the number of internees that have been recruited to his Department including those processing applications for Irish citizenship; the number been offered permanent posts and the number of currently working in the Department.","asker":"998","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1159,"content":"<p>My Department is actively engaging in the Government&rsquo;s jobs activation programme through participating in the National Internship Scheme &ndash; JobBridge.

All accommodation costs, together with the costs of meals, heat, light, laundry and maintenance are paid directly by the State. Asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation also receive a weekly cash allowance which takes account of board and lodgings and other ancillary benefits provided through the direct provision system. Asylum seekers can also apply to Community Welfare Officers for assistance to meet a particular once-off need by way of an exceptional needs payment under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme. Payments under this category cover once-off costs such as back-to-school clothing and footwear.<\/p><p>  Overall demand for RIA services is declining. At the beginning of 2009, RIA was accommodating an overall number of 7,002 asylum seekers. Currently, it is accommodating just under 5,000 persons, a reduction of almost 29% during this period.  <\/p><p>  In essence, RIA accommodates all those who make a claim for protection and seek accommodation until such time as they:<\/p><p>(i) leave voluntarily; (ii) are removed &ndash; either by way of deportation or Dublin II transfer; (iii) are granted refugee status or subsidiary protection; or (iv) are granted leave to remain, either through the process set out in the Immigration Act, 1999 or by way of a special scheme such as the 2005 IBC scheme.   It is not possible to specify exactly how long each person has resided in RIA accommodation.  Protection applicants i.e. asylum seekers or other applicants under the immigration acts are not required to live in RIA accommodation and in many cases, may move in and out of the direct provision system as their circumstances change. <\/p><p>  On the matter of application processing times and consequent length of time spent in the direct provision system, some cases can take significantly longer to complete owing to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.<\/p><p>  For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to point out that persons who are refused a declaration under section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, enter what is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;leave to remain&rdquo; process which generally has two elements to it: an application for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. This is separate from the asylum or refugee status determination process. The processing of cases at this point is also complex and extremely resource intensive and there are no quick or easy decisions to make. Given the life changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.<\/p><p>  I have taken steps to speed up the processing of applications, primarily by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies. The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 which I intend to republish in the near future provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State. This should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements. This reorganisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":1195,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRW00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Recruitment","counter":1194,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRW00750"},{"type":"question","counter":1195,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[42638\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRW00800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if a person who has psoriasis would be turned down as a recruit to the Irish Defence Forces.","asker":"1011","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":1196,"content":"<p>All applicants for entry to the Permanent Defence Force must be in good mental and bodily health and free from any physical defect, abnormality, physiological condition, or past history of serious illness likely to interfere with the efficient performance of his\/her duties in accordance with Defence Force Regulations.    <\/p><p>  The professional advice of the medical Military Authority is that each applicant&rsquo;s medical history is looked at on a case by case basis.

The Commission has yet to table a specific proposal in respect of rural development funding, but the envisaged use of a combination of past performance and objective criteria could reduce our allocation. We are strongly resisting any such reduction. Ireland has said that the distribution of rural development funding between Member States should be based on past performance over the whole period 2007 &ndash; 2013.  We take the view that any further movement from this point should: use the same methodology as the Commission has proposed for Pillar 1, i.e. adjustment of support levels per hectare of potentially eligible area, and   ensure that no Member State with below-average Pillar 2 payments per hectare loses in any redistribution, and no Member state loses under both pillars. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRW02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":1218,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRW02350"},{"type":"question","counter":1219,"qnumday":492,"qnumall":"[43980\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRW02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if there will be a retention of taxation incentives to help achieve growth targets by supporting farm transfer, land mobility and farm investment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":1220,"qnumday":508,"qnumall":"[42904\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRW02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if taxation incentives relating to supporting farm transfer, land mobility and farm investment will be retained; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1221,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 492 and 508 together.<\/p><p>  Taxation policy is a matter for the Minister for Finance and will be dealt with in the context of the annual budget.  However, I am aware of the importance of improving land mobility and of encouraging greater transfer of land, and of the existing challenges in this regard.  In order to assist meeting the ambitious targets set out in Food Harvest 2020, new taxation measures were introduced in last year&rsquo;s budget aimed at improving land mobility and farm consolidation, and encouraging transfers to younger, more progressive farmers.  Stamp duty on agricultural land was reduced from 6% to 2%.  In addition, half the rate (1%) is now applicable on transfers to close relatives until the end of 2014. This change substantially reduced the stamp duty payable on transfers of farm land by gift or by sale. The measure promotes inter-generational transfer, as the cost of lifetime transfer to transferees who do not qualify for the young trained farmer stamp duty relief has been reduced considerably.<\/p><p>  Budget 2012 also restructured the retirement relief available on Capital Gains Tax in order to incentivise the earlier transfer of farm assets to the next generation, and to encourage the sale of land by those farmers with no successors. <\/p><p>  Retirement relief was restructured in order to encourage farmers around the normal retirement age, who have successors, to transfer their land and holdings to young, innovative, ambitious, prospective farmers. This measure encourages an improvement in the age profile of farmers, and should ensure that farmland is put to more productive use.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that there has been no change to the very important 90% agricultural relief on Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT). This means that farms worth up to &euro;2.5 million will continue to be fully exempt from CAT with regard to transfers to a child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRW02600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":1222,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRW02650"},{"type":"question","counter":1223,"qnumday":493,"qnumall":"[42597\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRW02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cork has not yet received their disadvantaged area payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1224,"content":"<p>An application under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 9 May 2012.  <\/p><p>  However, payment has not yet issued as, at this stage, the holding of the person concerned has not yet satisfied the Scheme minimum stocking density requirements, which have been notified to all Scheme applicants.

The CCS is implemented under the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP).  The NCIP programme succeeded the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) which was a joint EU\/Exchequer funded childcare programme introduced in 2000.<\/p><p>  The key elements of the EOCP included the provision of capital assistance to community based not-for-profit childcare facilities and the provision of grant assistance towards the staffing costs for community facilities, which were identified as being in areas of significant disadvantage.  The increase in childcare places, which this investment provided for, ensured that parents who were disadvantaged or on low incomes had access to affordable and quality childcare which otherwise they would not have been in a position to avail of. <\/p><p>  The NCIP, which is Exchequer funded only and which was introduced in 2006, built on the success of the EOCP and continued to support the development and maintenance of community childcare facilities. The CCS provides targeted funding towards disadvantaged parents and in the region of &euro;40 million annually is provided by my Department to support this programme.  <\/p><p>  As already stated funding is also provided to support the ECCE programme and CETS programme to which all childcare services, both community and commercial, have access.  Almost &euro;200 million is provided annually to support these programmes and in excess of 4,300 childcare services, which includes private and commercial providers, throughout the country are participating.  The capitation provided under these programmes, which is paid to participating services in advance of each school term or commencement of training courses, is a guaranteed source of income and is a very beneficial support for the private childcare sector at this time.<\/p><p>  The Government has made a very significant commitment to maintaining all three childcare support programmes despite the current budgetary situation.

Approximately 2,200 new cases are diagnosed each year, and it is cause of death in around 950 people each year. Colorectal screening works on two fronts: it provides early detection and therefore earlier and more effective treatment, and it helps to prevent cancer in the first place by detecting pre-cancerous growths such as polyps. It is therefore imperative that the programme commences and continues on a sustainable basis. <\/p><p>  Plans for the implementation of a national colorectal screening programme are at an advanced stage within the HSE-National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) and the programme will be introduced on a phased basis in quarter four 2012, as stated in the HSE Service Plan 2012.  When fully implemented the programme will offer free screening to men and women aged 55-74 every two years.  As 50% of cancers within this age group are found in people aged 60-69 the programme will begin with this age cohort (a population of approximately 500,000). <\/p><p>  The screening programme is the first call\/ recall screening programme in Ireland to be offered to men as well as women.  Organised population-based call, re-call screening for colorectal cancer is complex and to ensure quality and safety it is imperative that it is introduced in a carefully managed and monitored way to ensure that risks to patients are minimised and best clinical outcomes are maximised.  Over time the phasing of the programme will allow development of colonoscopy capacity to cater for the full 55-74 year old population.<\/p><p>  The HSE-NCSS and the Special Delivery Unit in my Department have been working together to develop the appropriate capacity in colonoscopy services nationwide to support the introduction, sustainability and growth of the screening programme, while maintaining and enhancing the capability of the symptomatic endoscopy service.

Ultimately, this Government is committed to introducing an Irish model of universal health insurance that best fits the Irish system. <\/p><p>  It is also important that we look to other countries that have developed health insurance-based funding models and that we build on best international experience.  This is reflected in the membership of the UHI Implementation Group.  The UHI Implementation Group comprises a mix of those with executive responsibilities within our health services and external expertise, including international experts working with the World Health Organisation and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies.

This objective, as reflected in the HSE Service Plan 2012, is realised through various community based services such as Mainstream Home Help, enhanced Home Care Packages, Meals-on-Wheels and Day or Respite Care. These services not only meet the preferred wishes of many vulnerable older people, but also are intended to reduce pressures elsewhere on the wider care system. The demand for these services will continue to increase as the demographics, and complex needs, of older people change.<\/p><p>  It has long been the case that the HSE has worked in partnership with the Not-for-Profit and Private sectors to augment its valuable services to older people at  local level where, for whatever reason, the Executive is not in a position to do so itself. This may include, for example, where there are  resource limitations locally or in order to ensure care in the evenings or weekends.  The HSE has been developing various operational initiatives to improve nationally its approach to all relevant aspects of its Home Supports services. These include various new guidelines for Home Care, and a new Procurement Framework for approved agencies providing services on its behalf. While on-going developments have been designed to standardise and maximise the use of limited resources in the face of increasing demand, they are also intended to enhance quality, safety and other relevant aspects of service for both providers and care recipients alike.   This has obviously been a challenging year for the health services overall, including maintaining services in line with evolving resource pressures.The overall provision of home support services is therefore regularly reviewed at national and local levels, in the context of client need and resource availability.    <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the recently announced reduction in HSE Home Support provision for the remainder of 2012, investment in these services remains significant with expenditure of around &euro;330 million expected for Home Help and Home Care Packages this year.  All measures are being taken by Local Health Offices to ensure that as many people as possible receive a prioritised service, in line with assessed individual needs. The HSE partnership approach, working with both non-profit and private companies, has not changed, and there is no concerted effort to privatise this service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRDD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Issues","counter":1562,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRDD01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1563,"qnumday":614,"qnumall":"[42910\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRDD01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of medical assessors assessing medical card applications in the primary care reimbursement service in Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1564,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRDD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Bed Numbers","counter":1565,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRDD01838"},{"type":"question","counter":1566,"qnumday":615,"qnumall":"[42913\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRDD01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of cystic fibrosis isolation inpatient beds at Temple Street and Beaumont hospitals, Dublin","asker":"1021","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1567,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRDD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":1568,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRDD02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1569,"qnumday":616,"qnumall":"[42914\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRDD02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding home help care in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1570,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRDD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1571,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRDD02213"},{"type":"question","counter":1572,"qnumday":617,"qnumall":"[42932\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRDD02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will examine a document (details supplied) in respect of reforming and saving costs in the Health Service Executive and social services; his views on this document; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1573,"content":"<p>The Department has received the correspondence referred to by the Deputy.

The outcome of the negotiations with the consultant representative bodies is that detailed proposals have been agreed between the parties.  Amongst the key provisions of this agreement are: Consultants' co-operation with measures to improve patient flow through the hospital system with the potential to deliver a saving of 220,000 bed days per annum; Consultants' availability for rostering for any five days out of seven as opposed to weekdays as at present; Rostering of consultants where required on a 16\/7 (8 a.m. to midnight) or 24\/7 basis in services where this is required; Clinical Directors will have a much strengthened management role in respect of consultants; Consultants commit to expeditious processing and signing of claims for submission to private health insurers; More cost-effective arrangements for funding of continuing medical education.<\/p><p>  These flexibilities are centred on enhancing productivity and efficiency on an ongoing basis and on maximising the availability of consultants, as key clinical decision makers.  A range of other measures is being pursued to address the HSE's budgetary issues.  Separate from the negotiations with the consultant representative organisations, I have announced that new consultants will be appointed at a significantly reduced rate, involving a 30% reduction in salary for future appointees.

The programme will be delivered in a phased manner and a series of Technical Guidance documents will issue to all hospitals covering amongst others (a) Governance and Accountability structures (b) the Management of Referrals (c) the Management of Waiting Lists, Booking and Scheduling (d) the Management and Delivery of Outpatient Clinics (e) the Management of DNAs (f) Clinical Outcome Management and (g) Discharging Patients from Outpatient Services. The first Technical Guidance Document issued on August 20th, 2012, with the key focus on putting governance and accountability structures in place, minimising risk and beginning the process of making robust the manner in which patient referrals are handled and triaged.

The DNA rate is calculated by taking the number of missed appointments (DNAs) as a percentage of the total number of attendances and missed appointments combined.

Approval has recently issued for the 2012 Plan and details will be posted on the HSE's website as soon as is practicable.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is understood that the Deputy, in asserting that a PCC was to be delivered in Rowlagh by way of the HSE's capital programme may be referring to lists reported in the media.  It is important to state that these lists related to work that was ongoing; that they were work in progress.  The prioritisation exercise was a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation.<\/p><p><br \/>  An assessment\/evaluation of each proposed primary care centre location was undertaken with the infrastructural requirement evaluated under three headings: 1) accommodation assessment; 2) service priority; and 3) deprivation index.  The selection of a delivery mechanism was not, however, solely dependent on the resultant priority or ranking.  The delivery mechanism selected for each location was based on suitability and the availability of funding (insofar as it is known at any point in time). The following considerations were taken into account:<\/p><p>- agreements for lease in place - where there were good prospects of the leased centre being delivered - these locations remained as lease strategy;<\/p><p>- The size of the centre - the larger centres are more attractive to PPP bidders;<\/p><p>- Extensions to existing facilities or refurbishment of existing buildings are not suitable projects for PPP.<\/p><p><br \/>  The delivery method for a potential PCC in Rowlagh\/North Clondalkin changed in the lists reported in the media and published by the Department as part of the Government's Infrastructure Stimulus Package.  This change was on the advice of the Head of Estates in the HSE as PPP was considered to be the method by which progress in this development could potentially commence quickest.  However, as mentioned above, the method and timescale for delivery of PCCs is dependent on a number of factors and the list will continue to be reviewed and revised as necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRFF01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1674,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 654 to 657, inclusive, answered with Question No. 611.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1675,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 658 to 661, inclusive, answered with Question No. 653.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":1676,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRFF01288"},{"type":"question","counter":1677,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[43154\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRFF01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the information campaign that has been carried out by the Health Service Executive in relation to newborn screening cards; the number of cards that have been destroyed and the number retained by consent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1105","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1678,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRFF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Services","counter":1679,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRFF01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1680,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[43171\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRFF01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when new residential care \/ nursing home for elderly people at the Old Richmond Barracks site in Inchicore, Dublin 8 will be fully operational to meet local needs","asker":"1031","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1681,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRFF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Redundancies","counter":1682,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRFF01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1683,"qnumday":664,"qnumall":"[41675\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRFF01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to concerns being raised by home helps with regards to their lack of contracts and conditions of employment; his plans to take action regarding same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1684,"qnumday":665,"qnumall":"[41674\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRFF01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to ensure that there are standard contracts with detailed terms and conditions for workers in the home help sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1685,"content":"<p>Contracts for home helps employed by external (non-HSE) providers are a matter for the individual provider.

Prozac (fluoxetine) is indicated in children and adolescents aged 8 years and above for moderate to severe major depressive episode, if depression is unresponsive to psychological therapy after 4&ndash;6 sessions.  Fluoxetine should be offered to a child or young person with moderate to severe depression only in combination with a concurrent psychological therapy.  In children and adolescents aged 8 years and above treatment should be initiated and monitored under specialist supervision.

The prescribing information sets out specific criteria for diagnosis.  Treatment must be initiated under the supervision of a specialist in childhood and\/or adolescent behavioural disorders.  Methylphenidate treatment is not indicated in all children with ADHD and the decision to use the drug must be based on a very thorough assessment of the severity and chronicity of the child&rsquo;s symptoms in relation to the child&rsquo;s age.  The clinical indications also address the issue of long term (more than 12 months) use in children and adolescents, pre-treatment screening and on-going monitoring.  In addition, methylphenidate is tightly controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation in recognition of its potential for abuse.  These controls include that prescriptions must be handwritten, must be retained by the pharmacist who dispenses it and no instalment may be supplied later than two months after the date of the prescription.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRGG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Applications","counter":1745,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRGG03150"},{"type":"question","counter":1746,"qnumday":688,"qnumall":"[43356\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRGG03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on the most recent changes to the stock of occupational therapy home care aids and appliances in the Health Service Executive Dublin North East area; if he will detail the procurement process which was followed in advance of the most recent changes of suppliers; if he is satisfied that this process compiled with all the necessary protocols; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1747,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRGG03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Delays","counter":1748,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRGG03350"},{"type":"question","counter":1749,"qnumday":689,"qnumall":"[43444\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRGG03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of discretionary medical cards that were in place in each of the years 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1750,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRGG03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Issues","counter":1751,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRGG03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1752,"qnumday":690,"qnumall":"[43446\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRGG03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive will facilitate the transfer of parental leave to nurses who work in hospitals from their spouses who may work in other parts of the public service specifically An Garda Sioch&aacute;na to enable the HSE employee to take the parental leave and are there any rules preventing this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":1753,"qnumday":693,"qnumall":"[43470\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900060#WRGG03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive will facilitate the transfer of parental leave to nurses who work in hospitals from their spouses who may work in other parts of the public service specifically An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that the HSE employee can take the parental leave; if there are rules preventing this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1754,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 690 and 693 together.<\/p><p>  Parental leave entitlements and their implementation are set out in  the Parental Leave Acts 1998 and 2006.

My Department is very focussed on improving its systems and requirements to ensure that the administrative burden for schools and for the Department itself is minimised as far as possible. To this end, a range of initiatives have been and continue to be undertaken by my Department.<\/p><p>  One such example is the introduction of electronic submission of primary schools' annual enrolment returns resulting in significant administrative efficiencies to this annual process for both schools and my Department. Another example is the recently introduced reforms to the teacher allocation process.  At primary level this involved combining the separate learning support (GAM) and language support allocation processes into a single and simplified allocation process thus reducing administrative workload.  A similar approach was also implemented at post-primary level.<\/p><p>  Developments in recent years in the Department's payroll area have included the introduction of an Online Claims System (OLCS) for teacher payroll and the payment of part-time teachers through the Department's payroll. The latter ended the previously burdensome system under which each school, funded by grant payments, was required to make its own arrangements to pay part-time teachers.  Across all areas of my Department, we are continuously seeking to identify opportunities, ranging from small administrative changes to the more significant and major reforms, to streamline our processes, achieve better value for money and ultimately improve the education provided to our students.

I am very conscious that the cost of textbooks is a considerable burden on families. Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, I have attempted to take steps to reduce the burden on families. Shortly after coming into office I met with members of the Irish Educational Publishers' Association and impressed on them the need to limit the cost of textbooks. I have also stressed to them the real need to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.<\/p><p>  The Association has responded positively to my approaches and have agreed a voluntary Code of Practice among their members. The Code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years. The publishers have also given assurances to me that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts in the range 10% to 17.5% so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes. All these developments are welcome, and I look forward to seeing the members of the Association implement these commitments. In May my Department published research which shows that there is a high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary school level. The research indicates that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme and I want to encourage this practice across all schools. Results at second level are not as conclusive.<\/p><p>  My Department provided approximately &euro;15m in total to first and second level schools by way of book grants in 2012.

This document contains details of my plans to reform the junior cycle in post-primary schools. One element of the plan relates to assessment.  We know that under the current system in third year, the Junior Certificate examination dominates the experiences of students; the focus of learning narrows, the emphasis is on rote learning and for many students, the examination does not lead to positive learning experiences and outcomes. The reality is that the Junior Certificate is no longer a high stakes examination. That is why I believe it no longer serves the eduational needs of every young person.<\/p><p>  It is also the case that current assessment practice at the end of junior cycle (or lower secondary education) in Ireland is out of line with best practice in many countries with high-performing educational systems.   It is my intention that the terminal Junior Certificate Examinations will be replaced with a school-based model of assessment where the emphasis will be on the quality of students' learning experiences and outcomes.  This replacement will happen, taking a phased approach, with English being the first subject to be introduced to First Year students in 2014.  Short courses will also be available. The new Junior Cycle will include on-going classroom assessment for learning where high quality feedback will be provided to students and their parents during the junior cycle.  It will also include a school work component for all subjects reflective of students' work over the course of the final two years for the purposes of certification.  All the evidence indicates that this will give students a better learning experience and outcomes at Junior Cycle. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900061#WRK03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":1862,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900061#WRK03050"},{"type":"question","counter":1863,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[43368\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900061#WRK03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent to which he expects to be in a position to replace temporary prefabricated structures and facilities throughout the country in the coming year; if he is satisfied that the programme to date is likely to achieve its objectives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":1864,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[43373\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900061#WRK03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the total number of primary and second level pupils or students currently accommodated in temporary or prefabricated accommodation; the extent to which the programme to replace such facilities particularly those that have remained in situ for a number of years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":1865,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 264 and 269 together.<\/p><p>  My Department does not hold information on the numbers of pupils in individual schools who currently occupy temporary accommodation; this depends on the organisation of class groups by schools within available accommodation and may vary from year to year.

Schools that do not currently have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS. In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a student be referred for individual psychological assessment\/intervention. Such intervention address both learning needs and\/or needs in relation to the area of social &amp; emotional competence.This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more students indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that students are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. <\/p><p>  In addition NEPS has provided guidance to all schools and school communities in relation to structures and processes to be put in place in the event of critical incidents. Upon request by school authorities NEPS psychologists provide direct on-site assistance to schools in coping with the aftermath of such traumatic events.<\/p><p>  NEPS currently directly employs some 168 psychologists sited in 22 local and Regional offices countrywide and assigned to schools in their respective catchment areas. I can inform the Deputy that my Department is currently engaging with 10 additional candidates with a view to their recruitment to NEPS in the current academic year bringing the total staffing complement to its highest level ever. I am satisfied that the NEPS service is responding adequately to the needs of schools. <\/p><p>  I acknowledge that the reduction in resources to second level schools is challenging for schools. However, the budget measure that requires schools to manage the provision of guidance and counselling from within their standard staffing allocation, the alternative to which was to make an adjustment to the standard staffing schedule, must be seen in the context of our very difficult budgetary constraints. As part of the budgetary measure my Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students. I am confident schools will act in the best interest of students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900061#WRK03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Policy","counter":1870,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900061#WRK03650"},{"type":"question","counter":1871,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[43370\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900061#WRK03700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he is satisfied regarding the adequacy of primary, secondary and third level education here in the context of preparing the young generation for an increasingly competitive place in the workforce; if comparisons have been made with other educational systems throughout Europe and globally with a view to identification of the best practice to achieve the best results; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":1872,"content":"<p>I believe that in an ever changing world we need to strive for constant improvement in our education system.  Last year I launched Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life which is the national strategy to improve literacy and numeracy in schools.  We know both from domestic evidence and international comparisons through PISA that the literacy and numeracy standards of some of our students are not up to the standard which we would wish.  I have moved swiftly to bring in measures through the Strategy which are aimed at improving literacy and numeracy. <\/p><p>  Last week I announced a root and branch reform of Junior Cycle drawing from best practice at international level.  The Framework for Junior Cycle responds to compelling international evidence that shows more students will perform better by moving away from terminal high stakes exams at this point in their education. A number of the principles in my Framework acknowledge the importance of &quot;continuity and development&quot; and of &quot;Learning to learn&quot; from one sector of education to another so as to meet the challenges of life beyond school and, in particular, of working life. Students as they experience the new Junior Cycle programme, will be provided with opportunities to take initiative, to be innovative and to develop entrepreneurial skills. My Framework has been warmly welcomed by IBEC which commented that business needs employees with the capacity to analyse, communicate, be creative, manage information and work with others. IBEC believes that the new Junior Cycle should provide an opportunity to develop these types of attributes and skills from an early age. The change at junior cycle in turn presents an opportunity for a refocusing of efforts at senior cycle towards more varied forms of assessment across all examinations subjects. <\/p><p>  At third level, one of the core missions of the higher education system is to ensure the continued alignment of graduate output with the evolving skills needs of the economy and to provide the research infrastructure and graduates to support innovation, and foster enterprise development.  To ensure relevance of higher education provision, it is standard practice for institutions to establish content advisory panels with industry input for programme development. It is also common practice for institutions to develop bespoke programmes in collaboration with individual enterprises.   Engagement with enterprise is one of the core pillars of the National Strategy for Higher Education and a detailed framework and range of recommendations to ensure the system continues to provide graduates that are equipped to take their place in the modern workplace are being implemented.  Our high numbers of young skilled graduates has led Ireland to be ranked 1st for the availability of skilled labour in this year's IMD World Competitiveness Survey. This was backed up by the 2012 Talent Shortage Survey conducted annually by the Manpower Group, which ranked Ireland as the global leader for the availability of skills and the least difficult location, globally, in which to find talent. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900061#WRK03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1873,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900061#WRK03850"},{"type":"question","counter":1874,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[43371\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900061#WRK03900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he is satisfied regarding the adequacy of resources at his disposal to meet the challenge of the increase in population and consequent requirement for the provision of adequate school places and facilities at all levels; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":1875,"content":"<p>Based on my Departments most recent projections (July 2012) it is expected that enrolments will increase at primary level by almost 76,800 pupils by 2018, from circa 516,000 pupils in the 2011\/12 school year.

Dismissals in other areas of the Public Sector are a matter for the relevant sector.<\/p><p>Prior to 2006, disciplinary and dismissal procedures were for the civil service as set out in Circular 1\/1992. Under these procedures, it was the responsibility of the Government to decide whether a civil servant should be dismissed.  Under these procedures my Department submitted each case to Government and so had an overview of the number of dismissals in the Civil Service.  During the period 2002 to 2009, there were sixteen dismissals under these procedures (see attached table).  (Where disciplinary proceedings had already commenced prior to July 2006 the case continued to be dealt with under the disciplinary procedures in Circular 1\/1992).<\/p><p>Under the provisions of the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005, each Secretary General\/Head of Office,  has the authority, responsibility and accountability for carrying out a range of duties in their Departments\/Offices.  Among these are the management of all matters pertaining to the appointment, performance, discipline and dismissals of staff below the grade of Principal.  The Disciplinary Code was revised in July 2006 to reflect the legislative changes and procedures for discipline and dismissals are now detailed in Circular 14\/2006.

It is long established practice that Ministers do not get involved with its adjudication function.  However, having made enquiries, I understand that the EAT received a redundancy claim from the person concerned on 31 July, 2012 under the Redundancy Payment Acts.<\/p><p>  I wish to point out that the payment of statutory redundancy lump sums is the responsibility of the employer in the first instance.  However, where an employer genuinely cannot afford to pay an employee their entitlement, the employer and employee can apply directly to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) for a Redundancy Lump Sum using form RP50.  Proof of inability to pay must be submitted with the RP 50.  The Redundancy Payments Section in the Department of Social Protection (Block C, Earlsfort Centre, Lower Hatch Street, Dublin 2) has responsibility for the administration of statutory redundancy payments from the SIF.  Where an employer refuses to pay an employee their statutory redundancy entitlement or there is a dispute regarding an employees&rsquo; entitlement to a statutory redundancy payment, the employee must apply to the EAT for a hearing under the Redundancy Payments Acts.<\/p><p>  In the present case, I would suggest that this person may also wish to contact the Redundancy Payments Section within the Department of Social Protection to establish if she can satisfy the legislative requirements which would allow her claim for a statutory redundancy payment to be processed directly from the SIF without the requirement to have the appeal adjudicated upon EAT.  The EAT has seen a significant increase in its caseload in recent years, as it is one of the front-line services directly impacted upon by the economic downturn.  The current waiting period for a hearing in respect of redundancy claims in Limerick, is approximately 90 weeks from the date of application.  All appeals are listed for hearing in accordance with their date of lodgment with the Tribunal.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the efforts of the EAT to reduce its existing backlogs, I believe the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.  This is one of the reasons I am undertaking a root and branch reform of all five Workplace Relations Bodies. The Reform Programme I have commenced will deliver a Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court.

An examination of the &#8216;fair use&#8217; doctrine to see if it would be appropriate in an Irish\/EU context was part of the Terms of Reference of the Committee.<br \/><br \/>The Committee published a comprehensive Consultation Paper in February 2012 based on submissions received and it requested more information on the issues raised including fair use. In the region of 180 submissions were received in relation to the Consultation Paper in which many complex and substantial matters, including fair use, were advanced and these are currently being appraised by the Committee.<br \/><br \/>The Committee has indicted that it expects to present its final Report before March 2013.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will reform the Joint Labour Committee structure, beginning with the appointment of independent chairpersons to JLCs, who will retain a casting vote. Reform options will examine the rate of pay for atypical hours. <\/td><td>Independent Review of JLC\/REA mechanisms published in April 2011. Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 giving effect to reforms enacted with effect from 1 August 2012.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will reduce the cost of Government imposed red-tape on business, in part by streamlining regulatory enforcement activities out of a merger and rationalisation of existing structures. We will create a Business Inspection and Licensing Authority that absorbs the existing business inspection activities of the Health and Safety Authority, and the National Consumer Agency. <\/td><td>In relation to this commitment, please note that my Department is responsible only for reducing &#8220;Government imposed red tape&#8221; not for merging existing structures.<br \/><br \/>Significant progress has been made by my Department, with a reduction in administrative burdens of 24.8% already achieved in the areas of Employment Law, Company Law and Health &amp; Safety Law; this amounts to annual savings for business of almost &#8364;207 million.<br \/><br \/>My Department also coordinates the cross-Government measurement and reduction of administrative burdens towards the 25% target by the end of 2012. A project to measure the burden imposed by regulation under the responsibility of seven Departments and Revenue was initiated in September 2011.  Following completion of its measurement exercise, each participating Department must then set out how it will achieve the remaining reductions necessary to reach the target and report to Government with its Simplification Plan. The current estimated overall reduction is just over 15% which includes the 24.8% achieved by my Department, 25% achieved by Revenue and 30% achieved by the Central Statistics Office. <br \/><br \/>The reform of the State's Workplace Relations Services will deliver a simplified two-tiered structure comprising a single body of first instance, the Workplace Relations Commission, and a single body of appeal, in effect an enhanced Labour Court.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will develop a Unique Business Identifier for use by all government departments and agencies that will facilitate the sharing of information within Government and reduce repetitive information requests from businesses. <\/td><td>Legislative proposals to facilitate data sharing currently being considered. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will introduce new legally binding voluntary commercial debt plan structures to allow small businesses to restructure debts without recourse to expensive court procedures.<\/td><td>I asked the Company Law Review Group (CLRG) to examine the feasibility of introducing such a scheme. The CLRG reported back at the end of September and I am considering that report. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will implement a temporary, partial credit guarantee scheme that will provide a level of insurance to banks against losses on qualifying loans to job-creating firms to get banks lending again to industry and entrepreneurs. <\/td><td>The launch of the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme is imminent. <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will construct a &#8364;100 million Microfinance Start-Up Fund that will provide start-up loans and equity that draws funding from the NPRF and private institutional funds. <\/td><td>The Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme was launched on the 27th September 2012.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will support the development of a more dynamic, venture capital industry in Ireland by seeking to attract top tier venture financing and investment companies to Ireland, such as Silicon Valley Bank. <\/td><td>Given how close the current funding cycle is to completion, work is being progressed on delivering policy clarity on the future of the VC Schemes<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will work to promote a greater appreciation of the co-operative model as a distinct form of organisation, ensure a level playing field between co-operatives and the other legal options for structuring enterprise activities, and provide a conductive framework for the full potential of the co-operative model to be realised, including in areas such as childcare, education, housing, energy retrofitting, environmental protection, transport and healthcare. <\/td><td>My Department&#8217;s role is to provide the legislative framework within which business entities can operate, and a number of legal options are available to those considering establishing themselves in business. It is up to each individual operation to choose the model that best suits the nature of the business and the desired ethos of the entity. My Department does not promote one corporate form over another.  <br \/><br \/>In June 2011, I secured the agreement of Government to draft legislation to ease the regulatory burden on co-operative societies and to make it easier to start up and run a co-operative as an alternative form of enterprise organisation, and a draft Bill is now with the OPC for drafting. In this way, my Department plays its part in facilitating the development of co-operatives in the International Year of Co-operatives (2012).   Individual Departments will engage directly with the promotion or development of co-operatives in a particular field where they consider the co-operative model may bring particular benefit.<br \/><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will legislate to ban a number of unfair trading practices in the retail sector, such as &#8216;hello money&#8217; from food suppliers. <\/td><td>Building on the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 which bans certain anti-competitive practices in the grocery goods sector, an enabling provision which will allow me as Minister to promulgate Regulations to establish a code of practice to regulate particular trading practices in the grocery goods sector, will be included in the Consumer and Competition Bill.  The Bill, the draft heads of which were approved by Government in July 2011, is currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and it is expected that the Bill will be published later this year.  The promulgation of any Regulations is expected to follow shortly after the enactment of the primary legislation.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will seek to establish Ireland as a renewable manufacturing hub to attract international and domestic investment. <\/td><td>Enterprise Ireland provides support to companies in the cleantech sector and is continuously assisting companies to find new export opportunities for energy-efficient and related products.  The Government&#8217;s plan for the development of the Green Economy will also support this commitment.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>The Government will promote the development of a vibrant and effective social enterprise sector. We will instruct agencies to view social enterprises as important stakeholders in rejuvenating local economies. We will continue support for social innovation projects for young people through education, community and voluntary structures. <\/td><td>Forf&aacute;s carried out a review of the social enterprise sector and will be reporting to the Minister before the year end.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will make good corporate governance the law, not an optional extra, and enact legislation to provide for binding code of practice for corporate governance, which will be obligatory for companies wishing to be listed on Irish stock exchange.<\/td><td>Any company that wishes to list on the Irish Stock Exchange&#8217;s main market must implement the UK Corporate Governance Code and its Irish annex. This Code is subject to regular review and update, with the most recent amendments being made in September of this year. While the legal obligation to implement the Code only applies to companies listed on the main market, the Irish Stock Exchange&#8217;s own Listing Rules require companies on the secondary market to report on how they have applied the principles of the Code or, where they have not, to explain why. <br \/><br \/>Meanwhile, work is progressing on the Companies Bill, which will consolidate and reform the existing canon of company law. One novel feature of the Bill is that it will bring together into one statutory provision all the existing fiduciary duties of directors, to make them more accessible and comprehensive to all. <br \/><br \/>At the same time, the European Commission is examining the need for EU wide company law and governance measures and this is expected to yield proposals later this year. Where these are for legislation, we will be implementing them into Irish Law.  <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>We will strengthen corporate governance legislation and enforcement. <\/td><td>Please see commitment above.<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900064#WRN00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Statistics","counter":1975,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900064#WRN00850"},{"type":"question","counter":1976,"qnumday":306,"qnumall":"[43002\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900064#WRN00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of Industrial Development Agency supported jobs created and lost in County Kerry in each of the past 10 years; the position that County Kerry ranks in order of counties for new jobs; if he finds these statistics satisfactory; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":1977,"content":"<p>The Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment survey reports on jobs gained and lost in companies supported by the enterprise development agencies.

The Scheme, which is Statutory Instrument number 343 of 2012, sets out the terms and conditions, and was laid before the Oireachtas on 13th September.<\/p><p>  The Scheme is intended to address two distinct barriers to lending: inadequacy of collateral (Pillar 1) and inadequacy of understanding of the novelty of a business model, market, sector or technology (Pillar 2).

Commercially viable, well performing micro, small and medium enterprises that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services, thereby demonstrating their ability to repay the loan is the target of the scheme.  <\/p><p>  Decision making on commercial viability of the SME and all credit assessments will be fully devolved to the accredited lenders.  The individual loan transaction between Lender and Borrower is delivered in an almost identical fashion to any other comparable commercial lending transaction between the parties, with the only difference being the supplementary arrangements necessary for payment of the 2% premium charge by the borrower to the State.  Term loans, other instruments with term loan-like structures, and performance bonds will be covered by the Scheme.

The Reform Programme, which I announced in July, 2011, will among other matters, address a number of criticisms levelled over the years at the existing system.  These include:<\/p><p>- Five organisations with overlapping, but completely separate, objectives and operations.<\/p><p>- Claims are often referred to the wrong forum or under the wrong statute.<\/p><p>- Lack of consistency between the bodies regarding degree of formality of hearings, rules of evidence and use of adversarial or inquisitorial procedures.<\/p><p>- Overly legalistic and so complex that experienced practitioners find it difficult to comprehend.<\/p><p>- Excessive delays.<\/p><p>- Duplication of functions between the bodies results in &ldquo;forum shopping&rdquo;.<\/p><p>- Poor value for money.<\/p><p>  My objective is to establish a world-class Workplace Relations Service.  I am happy to report that substantial progress has been made to date and a number of important priority actions have been successfully delivered within the target timescale. These include:<\/p><p>- A new single contact portal called &ldquo;Workplace Relations Customer Services&rdquo; has replaced the five separate entry points. <\/p><p>- Complaints are now acknowledged, on average, within a week of receipt. This was previously taking up to eight months in some cases.<\/p><p>- The employer is also notified, on average, within a week of the complaint being lodged thus increasing the possibility of a resolution being reached without the need for a hearing.<\/p><p>- There are now no backlogs for Rights Commissioner hearings.<\/p><p>- A Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use.<\/p><p>- A new workplace relations interim website is in place.<\/p><p>- A pilot Early Resolution Service is now seeking to resolve disputes at an early stage without the need for adjudication.<\/p><p>- A major Business Process Review is at an advanced stage. This will identify the procedures, processes and systems which will underpin the new structures. <\/p><p>  My intention is to continue to progress the reform programme. The next major step is to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure. This will involve two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five. We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court. The WRC will replace the LRC, NERA, the Equality Tribunal and undertake the first instance functions of the EAT. The labour Court will take on the appellate functions of the EAT.  While considerable progress has been achieved to date on an administrative basis, completing the proposed reform requires the enactment of detailed legislation. This is necessary in order to provide the statutory basis for the new structures and processes.<\/p><p>  Last year I undertook a public consultation process that concluded in September 2011. The responses, overall, demonstrated a strong consensus around the need for reform and the shape that reform should take. The many positive suggestions that emerged from that process have helped to inform the design and delivery of the reform to date. They also influenced the proposals set out in the Blueprint to Deliver a World-Class Workplace Relations Service (Blueprint) which I published in April of this year.<\/p><p>  The Blueprint document set out, in considerable detail, how I propose to reform the workplace relations structures and processes. I published the Blueprint in order to provide a further opportunity for consultation. I am happy to have received 32 responses to the document. They include many supportive, useful and constructive suggestions and comments. All contributions made have received careful consideration and helped inform the preparation of the Policy Document &ndash; Legislating for a World-Class Workplace Relations Service which I submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in order to give the Committee an early opportunity to shape the legislation.  I had a constructive dialogue with the Committee on the basis of the document. <\/p><p>  Work has commenced on the legislative programme and detailed design to deliver the reform.  A significant amount of work has been completed on the legislative programme and the General Scheme of Bill was approved by Government for priority drafting at the Cabinet meeting on 24th July, 2012. I expect publication before the end of quarter one of next year. This would enable the proposed new structures to be put in place by early 2013.   <\/p><p>  In the meantime, I intend to continue to progress the reform on an administrative basis.  I am now proceeding to introduce a further tranche of specific projects and initiatives which can be progressed and implemented in advance of the enabling legislation. These include:   <\/p><p>- Transfer responsibility for the Equality Tribunal from the Minister for Justice and Equality to myself <\/p><p>- Publish the permanent  Workplace Relations Website to replace the six sites currently in place<\/p><p>- Establish a Single Hearings Management and Scheduling Unit<\/p><p>- Establish a Single\/Shared Corporate Services Unit for the Workplace Relations Bodies.<\/p><p>- Provide a version of Workplace Relations Complaint Form that can be submitted online (e-Complaint Form)<\/p><p>- Enhance  Adjudication Arrangements and reduction of backlogs in the Equality Tribunal<\/p><p>- Develop and deliver an accredited training programme for adjudicators<\/p><p>- Implement new business processes in the Workplace Relations Bodies<\/p><p>- Implement a Code of Practice and Conduct for adjudicators<\/p><p>- Introduce standard templates for Rights Commissioners&rsquo; decisions\/Equality Tribunal and EAT Determinations<\/p><p>- Review and revise, as necessary, existing statutory instruments (SIs) <\/p><p>- Rationalise hearings venues<\/p><p>- Develop a Single Determinations Database<\/p><p>- Put in place a Single Complaints Management System<\/p><p>  I am determined to progress the next phase of the reform and the enactment of the legislation with the same determination and priority that has delivered excellent results to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900064#WRN01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Permit Applications","counter":1987,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900064#WRN01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1988,"qnumday":310,"qnumall":"[43439\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900064#WRN01700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if work is on-going on the creation of a visa for professionals in the ICT sector which is necessary in order that the world's top ICT companies can continue to be attracted and retained here.","asker":"1110","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":1989,"content":"<p>Irish labour market policy is to ensure that general labour and skills needs are met from within the workforce of the EEA (comprising of the Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein).  Current Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand for strategic skills\/labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors such as healthcare, information technology and financial services. <\/p><p><br \/>  ICT is a key sector for Ireland due to the importance of its on-going levels of employment and exports and its future potential. As such, the availability of high-level ICT skills for the ICT sector is of strategic economic importance to Ireland in terms of continued growth in investments from foreign companies.  <\/p><p><br \/>  However, recruitment challenges have emerged for high-level ICT skills and it is estimated that there are in excess of 1,500 job vacancies in the ICT sector.  While increasing the supply of high-level skills from domestic sources is the most sustainable way forward in the long term, in the short term, companies will continue to rely on inward migration for sourcing ICT personnel.  A range of employment permits initiatives have been put in place to address this skills issue. The <b>Green Card Employment Permit Scheme<\/b>   is used by Ireland to meet labour market requirements where skills shortages have been identified by reference to analyses undertaken by the ESGFN. It is designed to attract highly skilled and highly paid individuals into the labour market with the aim of encouraging them to take up permanent residence in the State.

Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).   Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%). <\/p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.   The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&ndash;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.  One of the issues examined in the 2010 Review was the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contributions rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.  The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.<\/p><p>  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.  The scope of the review did not extend to costing of these benefits on a voluntary or optional basis.<\/p><p>  Any proposals to extend additional cover to the self-employed will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  Last year I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.   The Advisory Group will, inter alia, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.<\/p><p>  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed.<\/p><p>  Self-employed workers may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband\/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900064#WRN02800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Funding","counter":2004,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900064#WRN02850"},{"type":"question","counter":2005,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[42599\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900064#WRN02900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"with regard to local Social Employment Schemes formerly under F&Aacute;S, if she will consider measures to change where local community group members are been asked by Banks to act as guarantors because the last month's wages payments of a scheme are withheld pending audits; if she will engage with community groups to ensure a better system can operate between the scheme operators, her Department and the Banks.","asker":"1082","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2006,"content":"<p>Community Employment (CE) schemes work on annual contracts.

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice. The first two involve the enhancement of the website    and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears.  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.<\/p><p><br \/>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main accountancy bodies and the lenders. The general scope of the advice will be limited to the borrower&#8217;s principal private residence. <\/p><p><br \/>  The advisory framework has commenced with practicing accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.  <\/p><p><br \/>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as requested by borrowers. While the advisory framework will be monitored on an on-going basis, it is not intended to conduct a full review of the service before the due date of June 2013. The review will be undertaken to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and will encompass all aspects of the service including if participation is extended to other interested parties, the criteria that would be required in terms of relevant qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc.   The accountancy bodies have notified their members about the new service and a panel is available on a county by county basis on the website <i><font color=\"#0000FF\">.<\/font><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900064#WRN04600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Appeals","counter":2031,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900065#WRO00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2032,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[42701\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900065#WRO00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision on an appeal for invalidity pension will issue in respect of a person (details supplied)in Dublin 16; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1027","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2033,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 3 July 2012.

This BPI project is focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs.  Initial focus was placed on clearing the backlog of carer&rsquo;s allowance claims awaiting scanning and registration.  Over July and August 2012, 4,414 claims were scanned and registered -clearing the backlog completely.  Claims are now scanned within a day or two of being received.<\/p><p>  The focus has now moved to the processing of new claims.  Processing of claims has been divided into two streams. One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processing these without delay.   The second stream works on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.

Two fundamental principles apply:<\/p><p>- The contributory principle whereby there is a direct link between contributions paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions that are payable as a right if and when particular contingencies arise; and<\/p><p>- The solidarity principle whereby contributions paid by insured persons are not actuarially linked to benefits but are instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable. It is an expression of solidarity between both earning groups and generations. The non-contributory pension falls into this category.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Budget 2012 announced changes to State pension provision including new rate bands for claimants who become eligible for State pension after 1st September 2012.<\/p><p>Prior to the September 1st changes this year, a person with an average of between 20 and 47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. This is not equitable.<\/p><p>The reform introduced additional rate bands for new customers who become eligible for State pension (transition) and State pension (contributory), and associated increases for qualified adults from 1st September 2012.  This affects those who have smaller yearly average of social insurance contributions as they spent fewer years at work.<\/p><p>The maximum rate remains unchanged and the rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year also remains unchanged.  However, those who have fewer than 40 contributions per year will receive a lower rate of pension. If claimants have an income need they may, following a means test, qualify for a higher rate on the State pension (non-contributory).<\/p><p>People who qualify for the State pension (contributory) based on either of the top two rate bands i.e. a yearly average of 48 PRSI contributions or more and a yearly average of between 40 and 47 PRSI contributions qualify for a weekly personal payment of &euro;230.30 and &euro;225.80 respectively, both of which are greater than the maximum rate of the State pension (non-contributory) pension which is &euro;219.00 per week.<\/p><p>Similarly, those who qualified for the State pension (contributory) before 1st September based on either of the top two rate bands qualified for a personal payment of &euro;230.30 per week and &euro;225.80 per week.  These were based on yearly average of 48 PRSI or more contributions and a yearly average of between 20 and 47 PRSI contributions respectively.  The maximum personal rate of the State pension (non-contributory) is &euro;219.00 per week and is paid to people who have a weekly means of &euro;30 or less.  The weekly rate of payment is reduced by &euro;2.50 for every &euro;2.50 means assessment over &euro;30.00.  The minimum personal rate payable is &euro;4.00 per week which is paid to people whose weekly means amounts to over &euro;242.50 and up to &euro;245.00.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the State pension is a very valuable benefit and the change to State pension rate bands means that pension payments will be more closely related to PRSI payments made over a working life.  This ensures that those who contribute more during their working life will benefit more in retirement, thereby ensuring equity in the social welfare system.<\/p><p>It is also important to note the significant long term challenges facing the Irish pension system.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two to one by 2050.  People aged 65 years and over will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion of working age is expected to decline.  People are living longer with healthier lives and growing numbers of people want to work, or may need to work beyond State Pension age.   While this is a welcome development it does have obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population.  The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system, and these reforms are essential to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability.<\/p><p><table><tr><th colspan=\"3\"><b>Rates of payment from January &#8211; August 2012<\/b><\/th><th><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)<\/td><td>Personal Rate<\/td><td>State Pension <br \/>(Non-contributory)<\/td><td>Personal Rate<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>48 cons or over <\/td><td>&#8364;230.30<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20 - 47<\/td><td>&#8364;225.80<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15 &#8211; 19<\/td><td>&#8364;172.70<\/td><td>Weekly Means up to &#8364;30.00<\/td><td>&#8364;219.00 (maximum rate)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10 &#8211; 14<\/td><td>&#8364;115.20<\/td><td>Weekly Means of over &#8364;30.00 &amp; up to &#8364;32.50 <\/td><td>&#8364;216.50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)<\/td><td><\/td><td>State Pension<br \/>(Non Contributory)<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>48 cons or over<\/td><td>&#8364;230.30<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>24 &#8211; 47<\/td><td>&#8364;225.80<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><b>Rates of Payment from 1st September 2012<\/b><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)<\/td><td>Personal Rate<\/td><td>State Pension <br \/>(Non-contributory)<\/td><td>Personal Rate<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>48 cons or over <\/td><td>&#8364;230.30<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>40 - 47<\/td><td>&#8364;225.80<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>30 - 39<\/td><td>&#8364;207.00<\/td><td>Weekly Means up to &#8364;30.00<\/td><td>&#8364;219.00 (maximum rate)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>20 - 29<\/td><td>&#8364;196.00<\/td><td>Weekly Means of over &#8364;30.00 &amp; up to &#8364;32.50 <\/td><td>&#8364;216.50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>15 &#8211; 19<\/td><td>&#8364;150.00<\/td><td>Weekly Means of over &#8364;32.50 &amp; up to &#8364;35.00<\/td><td>&#8364;214.00<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>10 - 14<\/td><td>&#8364;92.00<\/td><td>Weekly Means of over &#8364;35.00 &amp; up to &#8364;37.50 <\/td><td>&#8364;211.50<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)<\/td><td><\/td><td>State Pension<br \/>(Non Contributory)<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>48 cons or over<\/td><td>&#8364;230.30<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>40 &#8211; 47<\/td><td>&#8364;225.80<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>30 &#8211; 39<\/td><td>&#8364;207.00<\/td><td>Weekly Means up to &#8364;30.00<\/td><td>&#8364;219.00 (maximum rate)<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900066#WRP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code Issues","counter":2081,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900066#WRP01350"},{"type":"question","counter":2082,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[42907\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900066#WRP01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if she will change legislation so property\/capital will be disregarded as means for jobseeker's allowance if the person in question is not in receipt of any income from it; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"981","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2083,"content":"<p>In assessing means for social assistance payments including jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, account is taken of the value of capital and property belonging to the person and their spouse or partner.

The Department's objective in this area is to raise educational and skills level among the long term unemployed in order to help them to meet the requirements of the modern labour market. Included in the supports available is the back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme which is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education.  The scheme is open to those on certain social welfare payments for a specified time and who otherwise meet the conditions of the scheme. These other conditions include, the nature of the course being pursued and the qualification sought, and progression by reference to the level of education previously held.  The scheme covers a wide range of full-time courses of education in approved colleges spanning basic foundation courses to third level courses across all disciplines. <\/p><p>  BTEA guidelines are, in the main, in line with the mechanisms in place for similar student supports administered by the Department of Education and Skills and require student progression from one qualification level to a higher one.  This is necessary to ensure displacement does not occur, in that courses could be offered to students who are not progressing at the cost of students progressing from a lower education level.  <\/p><p>  It is important to note that the BTEA scheme is not intended to be an alternative form of funding for those wishing to enter or re-enter the education system. It is not possible, within the scope of the scheme, to authorise an application for payment where the basic qualifying conditions have not been satisfied and progression is not evident.<\/p><p>  If a person wishes to pursue a part time education course they may be able to do so while still obtaining their jobseekers payment.  They must apply at their local social welfare office and verify that participation on the course does not reduce their availability for work.  In the case of jobseekers benefit, participation on a course does not grant any extension to the normal period for which jobseekers benefit is paid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900066#WRP02300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Waiting Times","counter":2095,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900066#WRP02350"},{"type":"question","counter":2096,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[42959\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900066#WRP02400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the average length of time taken by the Social Welfare Appeals Office to process appeals in respect of applications for invalidity pension, disability allowance, carer's allowance, domiciliary care allowance and jobseeker's allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2097,"content":"<p>The current processing times of appeals in respect of applications for invalidity pension, disability allowance, carer's allowance, domiciliary care allowance and jobseeker's allowance at the end of September 2012 are listed in the table below.<\/p><p>Generally the vast majority of cases fall within these average times but extenuating factors, often outside of the control of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, will cause greater delays in some cases.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, from about early 2009 the number of appeals received by that Office has increased dramatically and by 2011 had more than doubled from an average of 15,000 pa to. 31,241 in 2011.

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 90,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement, for which the Government has provided &euro;436m in 2012.<\/p><p>  Historically rent supplements have been administered at a local level by the Community Welfare Service directly to the customer. As a result of the large increase in claims being made in recent years, with the number of persons in receipt of the allowance increasing by 62% during the period from 2007 to 2011, it was considered that the processing of rent supplement claims could be delivered more efficiently through centralised units. Departmental officers who were formerly community welfare officers continue to assess applications for rent supplement within the centralised units. The establishment of rent units also supports front line staff to focus in the delivery of basic payments and exceptional and urgent needs payments. <\/p><p>  Customers living in one of the areas covered by a rent unit can obtain a rent pack from their local departmental representative. This pack contains detailed information and all the relevant application forms. This rent pack can also be requested by phone from the relevant unit. Information on the areas covered by rents units throughout the country is available on the Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p><p>  The timescale for determining individual applications for rent supplement is dependant, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements, information from landlords, etc. In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required. Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information. The Deputy&rsquo;s particular concern is probably referring to the Bishop&rsquo;s Square Central Unit which did experience an increase in application waiting times over the last number of weeks. This is in part due to the on-going process of rationalising rent and mortgage interest supplements services for the greater Dublin area with a few to improving efficiency in service delivery. The temporary issue of waiting times in the Bishop's Square office has since been resolved.<\/p><p>  A key objective of the transfer of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive to my Department on 1 October 2011 is to provide a streamlined, consistent and enhanced service to the customer. The process of integration is on-going and significant progress has already been made with a unified service, the National Employment and Entitlements Service, is now in the process of being delivered in four offices. The delivery of services in relation to processing rent supplement applications is also subject to on-going review. However, I have no plans at this time to reverse the establishment of some centralised rent units.<\/p><p>  I am satisfied that staff makes every effort to decide rent supplement claims in an efficient, effective and timely manner. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900067#WRQ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Payments","counter":2152,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900067#WRQ02150"},{"type":"question","counter":2153,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[43261\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900067#WRQ02200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if rent supplement is now being paid in arrears rather than in advance in view of the fact that this is putting persons under significant pressure.","asker":"1028","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2154,"content":"<p>The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.

The Department relies on the knowledge and expertise of its staff to deliver these services and, in view of their crucial role, the numbers of staff required to deliver a quality customer service is kept under constant review.  <\/p><p>  In the period since May 2008, some 1,045 staff have been redeployed to the Department to fill critical vacancies in scheme areas, local offices, central support units and the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate to deal with the increased volume of claims due to the downturn in the economy.  The Department also makes judicious use of overtime and employs temporary staff as appropriate to address particular service issues as they arise.<\/p><p>  In general across departmental schemes delays are kept to an absolute minimum.  In August 2012, for instance, 96% of domestic State Pension Contributory claims being decided by the date of entitlement and 98% of illness benefit claims were decided within 1 week.   However, customers for some other Departmental schemes such as family income supplement and carer&rsquo;s allowance are experiencing lengthy delays at present. <\/p><p>  Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria for the scheme involved.  In order to meet the dual challenges of increased claim volumes and the demand for shorter processing times, the Department has embarked on a major programme of process redesign and modernisation involving the development and roll-out of new computer systems and streamlined work practices.  In addition, a programme of business improvement process projects is underway in the Department&rsquo;s Longford Headquarters, which deals with long-term disability, carer&rsquo;s and family income supplement schemes.  This programme is aimed at eliminating excessive delays and began with invalidity pension.  A significant reduction in the number of new invalidity pension claims awaiting decision has been achieved with numbers reducing from 7,007 at the start of June 2012 to 5,372 at the end of September 2012.  Similar projects are currently underway in the carer&rsquo;s allowance and family income supplement areas.<\/p><p>  I should also point out that in order to offer a more streamlined, efficient and integrated service to customers, the Department is undergoing a process of intensive planning and organisational change in establishing the new National Employment and Entitlements Service (NEES).  This service brings together the Community Welfare Service (CWS), the Employment Services and Community Employment Programmes of F&Aacute;S, the Rural Social Scheme and Community Services Programme from the former Department of Community, Equality and the Gaeltacht and the Redundancy and Insolvency schemes from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.<\/p><p>  The new NEES model will integrate all employment and benefit support services in a single delivery unit and will provide a coherent integrated and more personalised service to customers. It will also serve to eliminate the duplication of work that characterised services which were provided separately in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900067#WRQ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Applications","counter":2160,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900067#WRQ02750"},{"type":"question","counter":2161,"qnumday":369,"qnumall":"[43347\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900067#WRQ02800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if job-seeker's allowance payment will be granted in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":2162,"content":"<p>The jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance application of the person concerned was closed as the deciding officer was not satisfied that she resided at the address provided on her application.

The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately &euro;1.6 billion in avoided energy costs for the economy in 2020.  The second Action Plan, which I will be bringing to Government shortly, provides a progress report on delivery of the national energy efficiency objectives and shows that Ireland is on track to deliver the 20% energy savings target by 2020.  The Plan will also set out a range of energy saving actions in the public sector, which will be prioritised between now and 2020.<\/p><p>  My Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) have established a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system whereby all energy usage in the Public Sector will be accounted for and progress will be systematically recorded.  Last month I wrote to the head of each of the public bodies, reminding them of their obligation to report annually their energy usage to SEAI.  Enclosed with each letter was the SEAI report: &lsquo;Energy Use in the Public Sector&rsquo;, which outlines savings achieved to date across the public sector to end-2010 amount to 650 GWh.<\/p><p>  The public sector is estimated to spend more than &euro;500 million per annum on energy.  Achieving our 33% savings target for the public sector would save &euro;150 million each year in expenditure.  This Government remains firmly committed to meeting this target.  This year SEAI has targeted the top 135 public bodies, which account for over 95% of public sector energy consumption.  These organisations will submit detailed energy and activity data to SEAI.  From this data detailed progress scorecards will be produced for each organisation.  From 2013 on, an SEAI online energy data system will facilitate all public bodies and schools to report detailed energy data and allow SEAI to prepare detailed scorecards for all public bodies.<\/p><p>  Since 2009, my Department through SEAI has supported over 140 public sector retrofit projects.  This year the Better Energy Workplaces 2012 Fund has offered support to 145 projects &ndash; 44 of which are in the public sector.  This scheme has developed public sector and market competence and capacity for pay-as-you-save type models.  I recently approved the formation of an action group to develop a framework for energy performance contracting, which will stimulate mass scale retrofitting projects across the public sector.  This has been complemented by the Government decision to require all public sector bodies to go out to the market for energy services if their energy spend is more than &euro;500,000 per year.  The energy performance contracting framework will allow public bodies to implement projects whilst not relying on additional public expenditure to do so, thus not impacting on their capital budgets whilst also reducing their operating costs.<\/p><p>  Through all of the measures outlined, the exemplary role of the public sector will stimulate investment in energy efficient technologies and the development of a market for energy services and products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900068#WRR01900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exploration Licences","counter":2208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900068#WRR01950"},{"type":"question","counter":2209,"qnumday":386,"qnumall":"[43213\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900068#WRR02000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the persons who will have rights to any gas extracted from beneath Coillte owned lands in the Lough Allen Basin.","asker":"1047","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":2210,"content":"<p>For clarity, I would like to advise the Deputy that neither an Exploration Licence nor a Petroleum Lease has been granted with respect to any land in the Lough Allen Basin.<\/p><p>  On a general note, the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960 provides that all petroleum vests in the State.

The measures are installed as appropriate, following a survey of eligible households, by installers drawn from a panel of Community Based Organisations (CBOs) and private contractors.

The CER is also working with energy suppliers to ensure that vulnerable customers are protected through, inter alia, the installation of Pay As You Go meters.<\/p><p>  The long term policy responses for Ireland to combat vulnerability to high and volatile gas prices continue to be increasing the use of renewables, better energy efficiencies and reducing the reliance on gas in the fuel mix.  Implementation of the measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s Affordable Energy Strategy is also key to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers.<\/p><p>  The Affordable Energy Strategy was published in November 2011 and developed by the Inter-Departmental\/Agency Group on Affordable Energy (IDGAE) as part of the Departments commitment in the Programme for Government to help mitigate energy poverty.  The Affordable Energy Strategy provides a framework for building upon the many measures already in place to protect households at risk from the effects of energy poverty, which include the thermal efficiency-based measures delivered through the Better Energy: Warmer Homes programme.<\/p><p>  There are forty-eight actions identified in the strategy to be implemented over the life-time of the report (3 years).  Five priority measures are identified including a commitment to review the National Fuel Scheme in the context of examining the feasibility of aligning income supports with the energy efficiency and income of the home, the phased introduction of minimal thermal efficiency standards for rental accommodation, ensuring greater access to energy efficiency measures, reforming the eligibility criteria for energy efficiency schemes and the introduction of an area based approach.<\/p><p>  I have allocated &euro;23.647 million in 2012 to the alleviation of energy poverty which will be disbursed through a combination of community based organisations, private contractors and via an area-based approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900068#WRR03900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":2239,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900068#WRR04000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services Funding","counter":2238,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900068#WRR03950"},{"type":"question","counter":2239,"qnumday":396,"qnumall":"[42631\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900068#WRR04000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his Department will engage with local authorities in the provision of services; and if so, the details of same.","asker":"1102","askee":"967"},{"type":"question","counter":2240,"qnumday":397,"qnumall":"[42632\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900068#WRR04100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if his Department will work with local authorities in the delivery of services; and if so the details of same.","asker":"1102","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2241,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 396 and 397 together.<\/p><p>  I refer to the reply to Questions Nos.167 and 170 of 4 October 2012 which set out the position in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900068#WRR04150","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Non-Principal Private Residence Charge Collection","counter":2243,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900069#WRS00250"},{"type":"question","counter":2244,"qnumday":398,"qnumall":"[42791\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900069#WRS00300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if the non-principal private residence charge will increase; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1019","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2245,"content":"<p>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, as amended, broadened the revenue base of local authorities by introducing a charge on non-principal private residences.

That office is an office of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (I.N.I.S.) and it handles all aspects of visa applications including appeals.  In general business visas are processed within two to five working days of receipt and visit visa applications for Chinese nationals within one to three weeks.  This time frame is dependent on all the required documentation being provided with no queries remaining outstanding.  It should also be noted that the approval rate for Irish visa applications lodged in China is in excess of 90%.<\/p><p>  Guidelines on the visa application process for nationals of China, including details of the required supporting documentation can be found on the website www.embassyofireland.cn.    I would also draw the Deputy's attention the following initiatives which are in operation in the Visa Office in China currently:<\/p><p>- The Short-stay Visa Waiver Programme, which allows tourists or business people who have lawfully entered the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.  The Government decided on 12 March to extend the Programme for a further period of four years i.e. to end October 2016, in light, particularly, of the positive response from tourism agencies and operators.  The Visa Waiver Programme covers nationals of a total of sixteen countries, including China, where  it has been a particular success.  For example, I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, that since the introduction of the Programme, 36 new tour operator itineraries to Ireland from China have been established, while existing itineraries have also experienced growth.<\/p><p>- With effect from 1 August, 2012, a more liberal multi-entry visa regime for business travellers and other visitors was implemented in the Irish Visa Office in Beijing.  The regime allows for the issue of scaled term multi-entry visas of up to three years duration depending on the applicant's previous international visa history.<\/p><p>- In recognition of the growing number of independent tourists from China, a scheme was introduced in the Beijing Visa Office earlier this year under which independent travellers who had no connection with Ireland could apply for a visa, whereas previously they had to have an invite or be a member of an official Approved Destination Status (ADS) tour.  The requirements for such a visa have been simplified and I am informed that Tourism Ireland has welcomed this initiative.<\/p><p>- For several years now, the Embassy in Beijing has been operating a scheme for Approved Destination Status (ADS) tourists.  ADS group tourism visas were the main tourist visa obtained by Chinese citizens to travel worldwide - the approval to travel for their citizens must come from the Chinese authorities.  Several measures were introduced to encourage this type of tourist to Ireland resulting in an ADS visa being one of the most straightforward and quickest Irish visa to obtain with processing times being less than three working days normally.  The success of the Visa Waiver Programme has, to a large extent, eliminated the use of ADS visas for travel to Ireland alone.<\/p><p>  My Department is constantly seeking ways in which the visa system can facilitate increased business and tourist visas from growing markets such as China and, in this regard, meets regularly with tourism and business promotion agencies to discuss initiatives in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900071#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Status Applications","counter":2368,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900071#WRU00750"},{"type":"question","counter":2369,"qnumday":443,"qnumall":"[42692\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900071#WRU00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if there are alternative options available in terms of identification to those whose applications for asylum are refused and their photo IDs are removed from their possession; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2370,"content":"<p>When an asylum applicant arrives in the State they are provided with a Temporary Residence Card (TRC).

The Direct Provision system provides asylum seekers with full board accommodation, free of utility or other costs.  Currently, there are 36 asylum accommodation centres in the State accommodating just under 5,000 persons.  Seven of the centres are State owned and the remainder are owned by private companies.  All centres are managed, under contract to RIA, by private companies employing their own staff.  All companies are contractually required to comply with legal requirements in relation to health and safety, food safety and so on.  As is normal, companies have their own management rules and practices and once these do not conflict with RIA requirements, RIA does not seek to interfere.<\/p><p><br \/>  Plainly, how a centre is managed is determined by a number of factors, not least the profile of persons being accommodated and the physical layout of the centre.  Of the current 36 asylum centres in RIA's portfolio, only 3 were specifically built for the sole purpose of accommodating asylum seekers i.e. were 'system built'.  All other centres must operate within the physical limitations of the premises' original use e.g. hotel, college dormitory, hostel, etc.  While all conform, at the very least, to minimum contractual and legislative standards, there are necessarily a range of facilities available in centres in the overall RIA portfolio, deriving from this original use.  This being the case, a number of centres have developed their own rules which complement and act in tandem with the RIA requirements, as explained below, and these are generally geared towards providing information on the routine in the specific centre concerned.<\/p><p><br \/>  The following RIA-produced documents - all available on its website <i>www.ria.gov.ie<\/i> - set out the basic requirements which must be satisfied by a contractor:<\/p><p>(i) The contract itself.

This describes the standards of professional practice required of persons working in accommodation centres as they go about their daily work.  The Code ensures that workers know what standards of practice employers, colleagues, service users and the public expect of them.  <\/p><p>(iv) Child Protection Policy \/ Garda Vetting.

Some 721 applications were returned because either the declaration on the application form was unsigned or the appropriate fee was not tendered.  Many of these applications were subsequently resubmitted and at present the Authority has 5,107 applications on hand.<\/p><p>  Section 99 of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 provides that persons, who were lawfully providing a property service prior to the coming into effect of the new licensing system on 6 July 2012, could continue to provide such property service pending a determination of their licence application by the Authority.  Consequently, before undertaking the detailed examination of the licence applications it was necessary for the Authority to carry out an initial examination to determine which applicants came within the remit of section 99 of the Act.  On completion of this examination all applicants were written to and informed whether or not they were covered by the provisions of section 99.  Of the 5,107 licence applicants, 301 were informed that they could not avail of section 99 as they had not provided sufficient evidence of their having been lawfully providing property services prior to 6 July 2012.<\/p><p>  All applications have now been input into the database, the application details have been verified and the process of detailed vetting of the applications is underway.  To date it has been necessary to write to over 60% of applicants due to the fact that applications have either been incorrectly completed or relevant documentation has not been supplied.  The reasons why applications have not been accepted are myriad including the failure of applicants to provide: sufficient evidence of qualifications; evidence of being tax compliant; appropriate Accountant's Report; appropriate Professional Indemnity Insurance; Certificate of Incorporation in the case of companies; Business Registration Certificate; Appropriate answers to certain questions relating to criminal convictions, etc.  In a number of instances applicants failed to indicate the licence type being applied for and furnish photographs.  Because it has been necessary to write to so many applicants the licensing process has taken much longer than originally anticipated.  However, to date letters have issued to over 350 applicants informing them of the Authority's intention to grant a licence.  It is hoped to have the process complete in the next 8 to 10 weeks.<\/p><p>  Great care must be exercised in this, the first year of licensing to ensure that only those who fully meet the new licensing requirements are approved.  As a consequence the process is time consuming.  While it is recognised that this time of change involves more input from the industry, the greater care taken in these initial stages will ensure that in future years the process will be more streamlined and simpler for applicants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900071#WRU02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Applications","counter":2394,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900071#WRU02550"},{"type":"question","counter":2395,"qnumday":453,"qnumall":"[42802\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900071#WRU02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to issue a technology visa in order to fill any existing technology skills deficit here.","asker":"1099","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2396,"content":"<p>I would refer the Deputy to my answer to Parliamentary Questions 31684\/12 and 31686\/12 on 3 July last, which is reproduced for the Deputy's information.<\/p><p>  While I am not averse in principle to the establishment of an immigration regime specifically geared to the technology sector, it would have to be on the basis that there was concrete evidence of a particular skills deficit in the labour market that cannot be filled by Irish or EU citizens.

At that time there was approximately 22,000 citizenship applications awaiting decision, approximately 17,000 of which had been awaiting decision for in excess of 6 months with an average waiting time of 26 months.  <\/p><p>  The series of measures I introduced have resulted in a major improvement in the position with decisions having being made on some 33,000 applications since coming into office.   Over a comparable period, between March 2009 and October 2010 a total of 18,500 cases were decided representing an almost 80% increase in throughput.  Moreover, approximately 4,000 of the 2009 case-load related to ineligible minors that involved minimal processing.   <\/p><p>  Almost 30,000 of these applications were approved after due process, while around 3,000 were deemed ineligible or were refused because they did not comply with the statutory criteria such as being of good character, lawful residence and so forth. It is important to note that the grant of citizenship is not a right; indeed it is a privilege and is given in accordance with the law.<\/p><p>  In considering the volume of cases currently in hand a number of factors have to be taken into account including, as detailed above, the volume of cases processed as well as new cases coming on hand. Also to be taken into account is the peaks and troughs of decision making which is linked to the timing of our citizen ceremonies.  Accordingly, there are wide variations in the statistics of cases on hand from one week to the next.  For example, next week will see the 56th, 57th and 58th citizenship ceremonies being held with a further series of ceremonies planned for early December. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate there has been a major improvement on what hitherto had been unacceptable delays in the system.  We are still on course to meet the very ambitious target of processing 70% of all standard non-complex cases within six months of receipt of applications.   I am determined that we achieve that target and go on to build on the excellent progress to date.   Considerable resources continue to be deployed to process applications and huge credit is due to the staff in the area for taking on the challenge. <\/p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that alongside the improvements in processing, in June 2011, I introduced formal citizenship ceremonies for the first time since the foundation of the State. The ceremonies, which are being met with universal approval, allow candidates for citizenship make their declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State and receive their certificate of naturalisation in a meaningful and dignified manner which befits the importance and solemnity of the occasion. I was pleased to note that the Citizenship Division of the Immigration Service was this summer awarded one of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Public Service Excellence awards of 2012 for their work over the past year and for their enthusiastic embracing of the reforms that have taken place. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900072#WRV03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Recruitment","counter":2450,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900072#WRV03600"},{"type":"question","counter":2451,"qnumday":472,"qnumall":"[42974\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900072#WRV03700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"since he took office, the number of internees that have been recruited to his Department including those processing applications for Irish citizenship; the number been offered permanent posts and the number of currently working in the Department.","asker":"998","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2452,"content":"<p>My Department is actively engaging in the Government&rsquo;s jobs activation programme through participating in the National Internship Scheme &ndash; JobBridge.

All accommodation costs, together with the costs of meals, heat, light, laundry and maintenance are paid directly by the State. Asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation also receive a weekly cash allowance which takes account of board and lodgings and other ancillary benefits provided through the direct provision system. Asylum seekers can also apply to Community Welfare Officers for assistance to meet a particular once-off need by way of an exceptional needs payment under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme. Payments under this category cover once-off costs such as back-to-school clothing and footwear.<\/p><p>  Overall demand for RIA services is declining. At the beginning of 2009, RIA was accommodating an overall number of 7,002 asylum seekers. Currently, it is accommodating just under 5,000 persons, a reduction of almost 29% during this period.  <\/p><p>  In essence, RIA accommodates all those who make a claim for protection and seek accommodation until such time as they:<\/p><p>(i) leave voluntarily; (ii) are removed &ndash; either by way of deportation or Dublin II transfer; (iii) are granted refugee status or subsidiary protection; or (iv) are granted leave to remain, either through the process set out in the Immigration Act, 1999 or by way of a special scheme such as the 2005 IBC scheme.   It is not possible to specify exactly how long each person has resided in RIA accommodation.  Protection applicants i.e. asylum seekers or other applicants under the immigration acts are not required to live in RIA accommodation and in many cases, may move in and out of the direct provision system as their circumstances change. <\/p><p>  On the matter of application processing times and consequent length of time spent in the direct provision system, some cases can take significantly longer to complete owing to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.<\/p><p>  For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to point out that persons who are refused a declaration under section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, enter what is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;leave to remain&rdquo; process which generally has two elements to it: an application for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. This is separate from the asylum or refugee status determination process. The processing of cases at this point is also complex and extremely resource intensive and there are no quick or easy decisions to make. Given the life changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.<\/p><p>  I have taken steps to speed up the processing of applications, primarily by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies. The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 which I intend to republish in the near future provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State. This should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements. This reorganisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900073#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Defence","counter":2488,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900073#WRW00800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Recruitment","counter":2487,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900073#WRW00750"},{"type":"question","counter":2488,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[42638\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900073#WRW00800","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Minister for Defence","question":"if a person who has psoriasis would be turned down as a recruit to the Irish Defence Forces.","asker":"1011","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2489,"content":"<p>All applicants for entry to the Permanent Defence Force must be in good mental and bodily health and free from any physical defect, abnormality, physiological condition, or past history of serious illness likely to interfere with the efficient performance of his\/her duties in accordance with Defence Force Regulations.    <\/p><p>  The professional advice of the medical Military Authority is that each applicant&rsquo;s medical history is looked at on a case by case basis.

The Commission has yet to table a specific proposal in respect of rural development funding, but the envisaged use of a combination of past performance and objective criteria could reduce our allocation. We are strongly resisting any such reduction. Ireland has said that the distribution of rural development funding between Member States should be based on past performance over the whole period 2007 &ndash; 2013.  We take the view that any further movement from this point should: use the same methodology as the Commission has proposed for Pillar 1, i.e. adjustment of support levels per hectare of potentially eligible area, and   ensure that no Member State with below-average Pillar 2 payments per hectare loses in any redistribution, and no Member state loses under both pillars. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900073#WRW02300","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":2511,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900073#WRW02350"},{"type":"question","counter":2512,"qnumday":492,"qnumall":"[43980\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900073#WRW02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if there will be a retention of taxation incentives to help achieve growth targets by supporting farm transfer, land mobility and farm investment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":2513,"qnumday":508,"qnumall":"[42904\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900073#WRW02500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if taxation incentives relating to supporting farm transfer, land mobility and farm investment will be retained; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1064","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2514,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 492 and 508 together.<\/p><p>  Taxation policy is a matter for the Minister for Finance and will be dealt with in the context of the annual budget.  However, I am aware of the importance of improving land mobility and of encouraging greater transfer of land, and of the existing challenges in this regard.  In order to assist meeting the ambitious targets set out in Food Harvest 2020, new taxation measures were introduced in last year&rsquo;s budget aimed at improving land mobility and farm consolidation, and encouraging transfers to younger, more progressive farmers.  Stamp duty on agricultural land was reduced from 6% to 2%.  In addition, half the rate (1%) is now applicable on transfers to close relatives until the end of 2014. This change substantially reduced the stamp duty payable on transfers of farm land by gift or by sale. The measure promotes inter-generational transfer, as the cost of lifetime transfer to transferees who do not qualify for the young trained farmer stamp duty relief has been reduced considerably.<\/p><p>  Budget 2012 also restructured the retirement relief available on Capital Gains Tax in order to incentivise the earlier transfer of farm assets to the next generation, and to encourage the sale of land by those farmers with no successors. <\/p><p>  Retirement relief was restructured in order to encourage farmers around the normal retirement age, who have successors, to transfer their land and holdings to young, innovative, ambitious, prospective farmers. This measure encourages an improvement in the age profile of farmers, and should ensure that farmland is put to more productive use.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that there has been no change to the very important 90% agricultural relief on Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT). This means that farms worth up to &euro;2.5 million will continue to be fully exempt from CAT with regard to transfers to a child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900073#WRW02600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":2515,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900073#WRW02650"},{"type":"question","counter":2516,"qnumday":493,"qnumall":"[42597\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900073#WRW02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Cork has not yet received their disadvantaged area payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"986","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":2517,"content":"<p>An application under the 2012 Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received from the person named on 9 May 2012.  <\/p><p>  However, payment has not yet issued as, at this stage, the holding of the person concerned has not yet satisfied the Scheme minimum stocking density requirements, which have been notified to all Scheme applicants.

The CCS is implemented under the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP).  The NCIP programme succeeded the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) which was a joint EU\/Exchequer funded childcare programme introduced in 2000.<\/p><p>  The key elements of the EOCP included the provision of capital assistance to community based not-for-profit childcare facilities and the provision of grant assistance towards the staffing costs for community facilities, which were identified as being in areas of significant disadvantage.  The increase in childcare places, which this investment provided for, ensured that parents who were disadvantaged or on low incomes had access to affordable and quality childcare which otherwise they would not have been in a position to avail of. <\/p><p>  The NCIP, which is Exchequer funded only and which was introduced in 2006, built on the success of the EOCP and continued to support the development and maintenance of community childcare facilities. The CCS provides targeted funding towards disadvantaged parents and in the region of &euro;40 million annually is provided by my Department to support this programme.  <\/p><p>  As already stated funding is also provided to support the ECCE programme and CETS programme to which all childcare services, both community and commercial, have access.  Almost &euro;200 million is provided annually to support these programmes and in excess of 4,300 childcare services, which includes private and commercial providers, throughout the country are participating.  The capitation provided under these programmes, which is paid to participating services in advance of each school term or commencement of training courses, is a guaranteed source of income and is a very beneficial support for the private childcare sector at this time.<\/p><p>  The Government has made a very significant commitment to maintaining all three childcare support programmes despite the current budgetary situation.

Approximately 2,200 new cases are diagnosed each year, and it is cause of death in around 950 people each year. Colorectal screening works on two fronts: it provides early detection and therefore earlier and more effective treatment, and it helps to prevent cancer in the first place by detecting pre-cancerous growths such as polyps. It is therefore imperative that the programme commences and continues on a sustainable basis. <\/p><p>  Plans for the implementation of a national colorectal screening programme are at an advanced stage within the HSE-National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) and the programme will be introduced on a phased basis in quarter four 2012, as stated in the HSE Service Plan 2012.  When fully implemented the programme will offer free screening to men and women aged 55-74 every two years.  As 50% of cancers within this age group are found in people aged 60-69 the programme will begin with this age cohort (a population of approximately 500,000). <\/p><p>  The screening programme is the first call\/ recall screening programme in Ireland to be offered to men as well as women.  Organised population-based call, re-call screening for colorectal cancer is complex and to ensure quality and safety it is imperative that it is introduced in a carefully managed and monitored way to ensure that risks to patients are minimised and best clinical outcomes are maximised.  Over time the phasing of the programme will allow development of colonoscopy capacity to cater for the full 55-74 year old population.<\/p><p>  The HSE-NCSS and the Special Delivery Unit in my Department have been working together to develop the appropriate capacity in colonoscopy services nationwide to support the introduction, sustainability and growth of the screening programme, while maintaining and enhancing the capability of the symptomatic endoscopy service.

Ultimately, this Government is committed to introducing an Irish model of universal health insurance that best fits the Irish system. <\/p><p>  It is also important that we look to other countries that have developed health insurance-based funding models and that we build on best international experience.  This is reflected in the membership of the UHI Implementation Group.  The UHI Implementation Group comprises a mix of those with executive responsibilities within our health services and external expertise, including international experts working with the World Health Organisation and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies.

This objective, as reflected in the HSE Service Plan 2012, is realised through various community based services such as Mainstream Home Help, enhanced Home Care Packages, Meals-on-Wheels and Day or Respite Care. These services not only meet the preferred wishes of many vulnerable older people, but also are intended to reduce pressures elsewhere on the wider care system. The demand for these services will continue to increase as the demographics, and complex needs, of older people change.<\/p><p>  It has long been the case that the HSE has worked in partnership with the Not-for-Profit and Private sectors to augment its valuable services to older people at  local level where, for whatever reason, the Executive is not in a position to do so itself. This may include, for example, where there are  resource limitations locally or in order to ensure care in the evenings or weekends.  The HSE has been developing various operational initiatives to improve nationally its approach to all relevant aspects of its Home Supports services. These include various new guidelines for Home Care, and a new Procurement Framework for approved agencies providing services on its behalf. While on-going developments have been designed to standardise and maximise the use of limited resources in the face of increasing demand, they are also intended to enhance quality, safety and other relevant aspects of service for both providers and care recipients alike.   This has obviously been a challenging year for the health services overall, including maintaining services in line with evolving resource pressures.The overall provision of home support services is therefore regularly reviewed at national and local levels, in the context of client need and resource availability.    <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the recently announced reduction in HSE Home Support provision for the remainder of 2012, investment in these services remains significant with expenditure of around &euro;330 million expected for Home Help and Home Care Packages this year.  All measures are being taken by Local Health Offices to ensure that as many people as possible receive a prioritised service, in line with assessed individual needs. The HSE partnership approach, working with both non-profit and private companies, has not changed, and there is no concerted effort to privatise this service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRDD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Issues","counter":2855,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRDD01650"},{"type":"question","counter":2856,"qnumday":614,"qnumall":"[42910\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRDD01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of medical assessors assessing medical card applications in the primary care reimbursement service in Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2857,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRDD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Bed Numbers","counter":2858,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRDD01838"},{"type":"question","counter":2859,"qnumday":615,"qnumall":"[42913\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRDD01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of cystic fibrosis isolation inpatient beds at Temple Street and Beaumont hospitals, Dublin","asker":"1021","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2860,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRDD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":2861,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRDD02050"},{"type":"question","counter":2862,"qnumday":616,"qnumall":"[42914\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRDD02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding home help care in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2863,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRDD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":2864,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRDD02213"},{"type":"question","counter":2865,"qnumday":617,"qnumall":"[42932\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRDD02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will examine a document (details supplied) in respect of reforming and saving costs in the Health Service Executive and social services; his views on this document; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2866,"content":"<p>The Department has received the correspondence referred to by the Deputy.

The outcome of the negotiations with the consultant representative bodies is that detailed proposals have been agreed between the parties.  Amongst the key provisions of this agreement are: Consultants' co-operation with measures to improve patient flow through the hospital system with the potential to deliver a saving of 220,000 bed days per annum; Consultants' availability for rostering for any five days out of seven as opposed to weekdays as at present; Rostering of consultants where required on a 16\/7 (8 a.m. to midnight) or 24\/7 basis in services where this is required; Clinical Directors will have a much strengthened management role in respect of consultants; Consultants commit to expeditious processing and signing of claims for submission to private health insurers; More cost-effective arrangements for funding of continuing medical education.<\/p><p>  These flexibilities are centred on enhancing productivity and efficiency on an ongoing basis and on maximising the availability of consultants, as key clinical decision makers.  A range of other measures is being pursued to address the HSE's budgetary issues.  Separate from the negotiations with the consultant representative organisations, I have announced that new consultants will be appointed at a significantly reduced rate, involving a 30% reduction in salary for future appointees.

The programme will be delivered in a phased manner and a series of Technical Guidance documents will issue to all hospitals covering amongst others (a) Governance and Accountability structures (b) the Management of Referrals (c) the Management of Waiting Lists, Booking and Scheduling (d) the Management and Delivery of Outpatient Clinics (e) the Management of DNAs (f) Clinical Outcome Management and (g) Discharging Patients from Outpatient Services. The first Technical Guidance Document issued on August 20th, 2012, with the key focus on putting governance and accountability structures in place, minimising risk and beginning the process of making robust the manner in which patient referrals are handled and triaged.

The DNA rate is calculated by taking the number of missed appointments (DNAs) as a percentage of the total number of attendances and missed appointments combined.

Approval has recently issued for the 2012 Plan and details will be posted on the HSE's website as soon as is practicable.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is understood that the Deputy, in asserting that a PCC was to be delivered in Rowlagh by way of the HSE's capital programme may be referring to lists reported in the media.  It is important to state that these lists related to work that was ongoing; that they were work in progress.  The prioritisation exercise was a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation.<\/p><p><br \/>  An assessment\/evaluation of each proposed primary care centre location was undertaken with the infrastructural requirement evaluated under three headings: 1) accommodation assessment; 2) service priority; and 3) deprivation index.  The selection of a delivery mechanism was not, however, solely dependent on the resultant priority or ranking.  The delivery mechanism selected for each location was based on suitability and the availability of funding (insofar as it is known at any point in time). The following considerations were taken into account:<\/p><p>- agreements for lease in place - where there were good prospects of the leased centre being delivered - these locations remained as lease strategy;<\/p><p>- The size of the centre - the larger centres are more attractive to PPP bidders;<\/p><p>- Extensions to existing facilities or refurbishment of existing buildings are not suitable projects for PPP.<\/p><p><br \/>  The delivery method for a potential PCC in Rowlagh\/North Clondalkin changed in the lists reported in the media and published by the Department as part of the Government's Infrastructure Stimulus Package.  This change was on the advice of the Head of Estates in the HSE as PPP was considered to be the method by which progress in this development could potentially commence quickest.  However, as mentioned above, the method and timescale for delivery of PCCs is dependent on a number of factors and the list will continue to be reviewed and revised as necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRFF01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2967,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 654 to 657, inclusive, answered with Question No. 611.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2968,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 658 to 661, inclusive, answered with Question No. 653.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":2969,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRFF01288"},{"type":"question","counter":2970,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[43154\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRFF01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the information campaign that has been carried out by the Health Service Executive in relation to newborn screening cards; the number of cards that have been destroyed and the number retained by consent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1105","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2971,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRFF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Services","counter":2972,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRFF01450"},{"type":"question","counter":2973,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[43171\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRFF01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when new residential care \/ nursing home for elderly people at the Old Richmond Barracks site in Inchicore, Dublin 8 will be fully operational to meet local needs","asker":"1031","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2974,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRFF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Redundancies","counter":2975,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRFF01650"},{"type":"question","counter":2976,"qnumday":664,"qnumall":"[41675\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRFF01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to concerns being raised by home helps with regards to their lack of contracts and conditions of employment; his plans to take action regarding same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":2977,"qnumday":665,"qnumall":"[41674\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRFF01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to ensure that there are standard contracts with detailed terms and conditions for workers in the home help sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2978,"content":"<p>Contracts for home helps employed by external (non-HSE) providers are a matter for the individual provider.

Prozac (fluoxetine) is indicated in children and adolescents aged 8 years and above for moderate to severe major depressive episode, if depression is unresponsive to psychological therapy after 4&ndash;6 sessions.  Fluoxetine should be offered to a child or young person with moderate to severe depression only in combination with a concurrent psychological therapy.  In children and adolescents aged 8 years and above treatment should be initiated and monitored under specialist supervision.

The prescribing information sets out specific criteria for diagnosis.  Treatment must be initiated under the supervision of a specialist in childhood and\/or adolescent behavioural disorders.  Methylphenidate treatment is not indicated in all children with ADHD and the decision to use the drug must be based on a very thorough assessment of the severity and chronicity of the child&rsquo;s symptoms in relation to the child&rsquo;s age.  The clinical indications also address the issue of long term (more than 12 months) use in children and adolescents, pre-treatment screening and on-going monitoring.  In addition, methylphenidate is tightly controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation in recognition of its potential for abuse.  These controls include that prescriptions must be handwritten, must be retained by the pharmacist who dispenses it and no instalment may be supplied later than two months after the date of the prescription.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRGG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Applications","counter":3038,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRGG03150"},{"type":"question","counter":3039,"qnumday":688,"qnumall":"[43356\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRGG03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on the most recent changes to the stock of occupational therapy home care aids and appliances in the Health Service Executive Dublin North East area; if he will detail the procurement process which was followed in advance of the most recent changes of suppliers; if he is satisfied that this process compiled with all the necessary protocols; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3040,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRGG03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Delays","counter":3041,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRGG03350"},{"type":"question","counter":3042,"qnumday":689,"qnumall":"[43444\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRGG03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of discretionary medical cards that were in place in each of the years 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3043,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRGG03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Issues","counter":3044,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRGG03550"},{"type":"question","counter":3045,"qnumday":690,"qnumall":"[43446\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRGG03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive will facilitate the transfer of parental leave to nurses who work in hospitals from their spouses who may work in other parts of the public service specifically An Garda Sioch&aacute;na to enable the HSE employee to take the parental leave and are there any rules preventing this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3046,"qnumday":693,"qnumall":"[43470\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900074#WRGG03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive will facilitate the transfer of parental leave to nurses who work in hospitals from their spouses who may work in other parts of the public service specifically An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that the HSE employee can take the parental leave; if there are rules preventing this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3047,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 690 and 693 together.<\/p><p>  Parental leave entitlements and their implementation are set out in  the Parental Leave Acts 1998 and 2006.

Approximately 2,200 new cases are diagnosed each year, and it is cause of death in around 950 people each year. Colorectal screening works on two fronts: it provides early detection and therefore earlier and more effective treatment, and it helps to prevent cancer in the first place by detecting pre-cancerous growths such as polyps. It is therefore imperative that the programme commences and continues on a sustainable basis. <\/p><p>  Plans for the implementation of a national colorectal screening programme are at an advanced stage within the HSE-National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) and the programme will be introduced on a phased basis in quarter four 2012, as stated in the HSE Service Plan 2012.  When fully implemented the programme will offer free screening to men and women aged 55-74 every two years.  As 50% of cancers within this age group are found in people aged 60-69 the programme will begin with this age cohort (a population of approximately 500,000). <\/p><p>  The screening programme is the first call\/ recall screening programme in Ireland to be offered to men as well as women.  Organised population-based call, re-call screening for colorectal cancer is complex and to ensure quality and safety it is imperative that it is introduced in a carefully managed and monitored way to ensure that risks to patients are minimised and best clinical outcomes are maximised.  Over time the phasing of the programme will allow development of colonoscopy capacity to cater for the full 55-74 year old population.<\/p><p>  The HSE-NCSS and the Special Delivery Unit in my Department have been working together to develop the appropriate capacity in colonoscopy services nationwide to support the introduction, sustainability and growth of the screening programme, while maintaining and enhancing the capability of the symptomatic endoscopy service.

Ultimately, this Government is committed to introducing an Irish model of universal health insurance that best fits the Irish system. <\/p><p>  It is also important that we look to other countries that have developed health insurance-based funding models and that we build on best international experience.  This is reflected in the membership of the UHI Implementation Group.  The UHI Implementation Group comprises a mix of those with executive responsibilities within our health services and external expertise, including international experts working with the World Health Organisation and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies.

This objective, as reflected in the HSE Service Plan 2012, is realised through various community based services such as Mainstream Home Help, enhanced Home Care Packages, Meals-on-Wheels and Day or Respite Care. These services not only meet the preferred wishes of many vulnerable older people, but also are intended to reduce pressures elsewhere on the wider care system. The demand for these services will continue to increase as the demographics, and complex needs, of older people change.<\/p><p>  It has long been the case that the HSE has worked in partnership with the Not-for-Profit and Private sectors to augment its valuable services to older people at  local level where, for whatever reason, the Executive is not in a position to do so itself. This may include, for example, where there are  resource limitations locally or in order to ensure care in the evenings or weekends.  The HSE has been developing various operational initiatives to improve nationally its approach to all relevant aspects of its Home Supports services. These include various new guidelines for Home Care, and a new Procurement Framework for approved agencies providing services on its behalf. While on-going developments have been designed to standardise and maximise the use of limited resources in the face of increasing demand, they are also intended to enhance quality, safety and other relevant aspects of service for both providers and care recipients alike.   This has obviously been a challenging year for the health services overall, including maintaining services in line with evolving resource pressures.The overall provision of home support services is therefore regularly reviewed at national and local levels, in the context of client need and resource availability.    <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the recently announced reduction in HSE Home Support provision for the remainder of 2012, investment in these services remains significant with expenditure of around &euro;330 million expected for Home Help and Home Care Packages this year.  All measures are being taken by Local Health Offices to ensure that as many people as possible receive a prioritised service, in line with assessed individual needs. The HSE partnership approach, working with both non-profit and private companies, has not changed, and there is no concerted effort to privatise this service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRDD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Issues","counter":3361,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRDD01650"},{"type":"question","counter":3362,"qnumday":614,"qnumall":"[42910\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRDD01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of medical assessors assessing medical card applications in the primary care reimbursement service in Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3363,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRDD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Bed Numbers","counter":3364,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRDD01838"},{"type":"question","counter":3365,"qnumday":615,"qnumall":"[42913\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRDD01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of cystic fibrosis isolation inpatient beds at Temple Street and Beaumont hospitals, Dublin","asker":"1021","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3366,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRDD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":3367,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRDD02050"},{"type":"question","counter":3368,"qnumday":616,"qnumall":"[42914\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRDD02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding home help care in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3369,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRDD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":3370,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRDD02213"},{"type":"question","counter":3371,"qnumday":617,"qnumall":"[42932\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRDD02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will examine a document (details supplied) in respect of reforming and saving costs in the Health Service Executive and social services; his views on this document; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3372,"content":"<p>The Department has received the correspondence referred to by the Deputy.

The outcome of the negotiations with the consultant representative bodies is that detailed proposals have been agreed between the parties.  Amongst the key provisions of this agreement are: Consultants' co-operation with measures to improve patient flow through the hospital system with the potential to deliver a saving of 220,000 bed days per annum; Consultants' availability for rostering for any five days out of seven as opposed to weekdays as at present; Rostering of consultants where required on a 16\/7 (8 a.m. to midnight) or 24\/7 basis in services where this is required; Clinical Directors will have a much strengthened management role in respect of consultants; Consultants commit to expeditious processing and signing of claims for submission to private health insurers; More cost-effective arrangements for funding of continuing medical education.<\/p><p>  These flexibilities are centred on enhancing productivity and efficiency on an ongoing basis and on maximising the availability of consultants, as key clinical decision makers.  A range of other measures is being pursued to address the HSE's budgetary issues.  Separate from the negotiations with the consultant representative organisations, I have announced that new consultants will be appointed at a significantly reduced rate, involving a 30% reduction in salary for future appointees.

The programme will be delivered in a phased manner and a series of Technical Guidance documents will issue to all hospitals covering amongst others (a) Governance and Accountability structures (b) the Management of Referrals (c) the Management of Waiting Lists, Booking and Scheduling (d) the Management and Delivery of Outpatient Clinics (e) the Management of DNAs (f) Clinical Outcome Management and (g) Discharging Patients from Outpatient Services. The first Technical Guidance Document issued on August 20th, 2012, with the key focus on putting governance and accountability structures in place, minimising risk and beginning the process of making robust the manner in which patient referrals are handled and triaged.

The DNA rate is calculated by taking the number of missed appointments (DNAs) as a percentage of the total number of attendances and missed appointments combined.

Approval has recently issued for the 2012 Plan and details will be posted on the HSE's website as soon as is practicable.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is understood that the Deputy, in asserting that a PCC was to be delivered in Rowlagh by way of the HSE's capital programme may be referring to lists reported in the media.  It is important to state that these lists related to work that was ongoing; that they were work in progress.  The prioritisation exercise was a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation.<\/p><p><br \/>  An assessment\/evaluation of each proposed primary care centre location was undertaken with the infrastructural requirement evaluated under three headings: 1) accommodation assessment; 2) service priority; and 3) deprivation index.  The selection of a delivery mechanism was not, however, solely dependent on the resultant priority or ranking.  The delivery mechanism selected for each location was based on suitability and the availability of funding (insofar as it is known at any point in time). The following considerations were taken into account:<\/p><p>- agreements for lease in place - where there were good prospects of the leased centre being delivered - these locations remained as lease strategy;<\/p><p>- The size of the centre - the larger centres are more attractive to PPP bidders;<\/p><p>- Extensions to existing facilities or refurbishment of existing buildings are not suitable projects for PPP.<\/p><p><br \/>  The delivery method for a potential PCC in Rowlagh\/North Clondalkin changed in the lists reported in the media and published by the Department as part of the Government's Infrastructure Stimulus Package.  This change was on the advice of the Head of Estates in the HSE as PPP was considered to be the method by which progress in this development could potentially commence quickest.  However, as mentioned above, the method and timescale for delivery of PCCs is dependent on a number of factors and the list will continue to be reviewed and revised as necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRFF01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3473,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 654 to 657, inclusive, answered with Question No. 611.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3474,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 658 to 661, inclusive, answered with Question No. 653.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":3475,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRFF01288"},{"type":"question","counter":3476,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[43154\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRFF01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the information campaign that has been carried out by the Health Service Executive in relation to newborn screening cards; the number of cards that have been destroyed and the number retained by consent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1105","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3477,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRFF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Services","counter":3478,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRFF01450"},{"type":"question","counter":3479,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[43171\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRFF01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when new residential care \/ nursing home for elderly people at the Old Richmond Barracks site in Inchicore, Dublin 8 will be fully operational to meet local needs","asker":"1031","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3480,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRFF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Redundancies","counter":3481,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRFF01650"},{"type":"question","counter":3482,"qnumday":664,"qnumall":"[41675\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRFF01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to concerns being raised by home helps with regards to their lack of contracts and conditions of employment; his plans to take action regarding same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3483,"qnumday":665,"qnumall":"[41674\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRFF01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to ensure that there are standard contracts with detailed terms and conditions for workers in the home help sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3484,"content":"<p>Contracts for home helps employed by external (non-HSE) providers are a matter for the individual provider.

Prozac (fluoxetine) is indicated in children and adolescents aged 8 years and above for moderate to severe major depressive episode, if depression is unresponsive to psychological therapy after 4&ndash;6 sessions.  Fluoxetine should be offered to a child or young person with moderate to severe depression only in combination with a concurrent psychological therapy.  In children and adolescents aged 8 years and above treatment should be initiated and monitored under specialist supervision.

The prescribing information sets out specific criteria for diagnosis.  Treatment must be initiated under the supervision of a specialist in childhood and\/or adolescent behavioural disorders.  Methylphenidate treatment is not indicated in all children with ADHD and the decision to use the drug must be based on a very thorough assessment of the severity and chronicity of the child&rsquo;s symptoms in relation to the child&rsquo;s age.  The clinical indications also address the issue of long term (more than 12 months) use in children and adolescents, pre-treatment screening and on-going monitoring.  In addition, methylphenidate is tightly controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation in recognition of its potential for abuse.  These controls include that prescriptions must be handwritten, must be retained by the pharmacist who dispenses it and no instalment may be supplied later than two months after the date of the prescription.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRGG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Applications","counter":3544,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRGG03150"},{"type":"question","counter":3545,"qnumday":688,"qnumall":"[43356\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRGG03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on the most recent changes to the stock of occupational therapy home care aids and appliances in the Health Service Executive Dublin North East area; if he will detail the procurement process which was followed in advance of the most recent changes of suppliers; if he is satisfied that this process compiled with all the necessary protocols; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3546,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRGG03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Delays","counter":3547,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRGG03350"},{"type":"question","counter":3548,"qnumday":689,"qnumall":"[43444\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRGG03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of discretionary medical cards that were in place in each of the years 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3549,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRGG03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Issues","counter":3550,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRGG03550"},{"type":"question","counter":3551,"qnumday":690,"qnumall":"[43446\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRGG03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive will facilitate the transfer of parental leave to nurses who work in hospitals from their spouses who may work in other parts of the public service specifically An Garda Sioch&aacute;na to enable the HSE employee to take the parental leave and are there any rules preventing this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3552,"qnumday":693,"qnumall":"[43470\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900076#WRGG03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive will facilitate the transfer of parental leave to nurses who work in hospitals from their spouses who may work in other parts of the public service specifically An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that the HSE employee can take the parental leave; if there are rules preventing this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3553,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 690 and 693 together.<\/p><p>  Parental leave entitlements and their implementation are set out in  the Parental Leave Acts 1998 and 2006.

Approximately 2,200 new cases are diagnosed each year, and it is cause of death in around 950 people each year. Colorectal screening works on two fronts: it provides early detection and therefore earlier and more effective treatment, and it helps to prevent cancer in the first place by detecting pre-cancerous growths such as polyps. It is therefore imperative that the programme commences and continues on a sustainable basis. <\/p><p>  Plans for the implementation of a national colorectal screening programme are at an advanced stage within the HSE-National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) and the programme will be introduced on a phased basis in quarter four 2012, as stated in the HSE Service Plan 2012.  When fully implemented the programme will offer free screening to men and women aged 55-74 every two years.  As 50% of cancers within this age group are found in people aged 60-69 the programme will begin with this age cohort (a population of approximately 500,000). <\/p><p>  The screening programme is the first call\/ recall screening programme in Ireland to be offered to men as well as women.  Organised population-based call, re-call screening for colorectal cancer is complex and to ensure quality and safety it is imperative that it is introduced in a carefully managed and monitored way to ensure that risks to patients are minimised and best clinical outcomes are maximised.  Over time the phasing of the programme will allow development of colonoscopy capacity to cater for the full 55-74 year old population.<\/p><p>  The HSE-NCSS and the Special Delivery Unit in my Department have been working together to develop the appropriate capacity in colonoscopy services nationwide to support the introduction, sustainability and growth of the screening programme, while maintaining and enhancing the capability of the symptomatic endoscopy service.

Ultimately, this Government is committed to introducing an Irish model of universal health insurance that best fits the Irish system. <\/p><p>  It is also important that we look to other countries that have developed health insurance-based funding models and that we build on best international experience.  This is reflected in the membership of the UHI Implementation Group.  The UHI Implementation Group comprises a mix of those with executive responsibilities within our health services and external expertise, including international experts working with the World Health Organisation and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies.

This objective, as reflected in the HSE Service Plan 2012, is realised through various community based services such as Mainstream Home Help, enhanced Home Care Packages, Meals-on-Wheels and Day or Respite Care. These services not only meet the preferred wishes of many vulnerable older people, but also are intended to reduce pressures elsewhere on the wider care system. The demand for these services will continue to increase as the demographics, and complex needs, of older people change.<\/p><p>  It has long been the case that the HSE has worked in partnership with the Not-for-Profit and Private sectors to augment its valuable services to older people at  local level where, for whatever reason, the Executive is not in a position to do so itself. This may include, for example, where there are  resource limitations locally or in order to ensure care in the evenings or weekends.  The HSE has been developing various operational initiatives to improve nationally its approach to all relevant aspects of its Home Supports services. These include various new guidelines for Home Care, and a new Procurement Framework for approved agencies providing services on its behalf. While on-going developments have been designed to standardise and maximise the use of limited resources in the face of increasing demand, they are also intended to enhance quality, safety and other relevant aspects of service for both providers and care recipients alike.   This has obviously been a challenging year for the health services overall, including maintaining services in line with evolving resource pressures.The overall provision of home support services is therefore regularly reviewed at national and local levels, in the context of client need and resource availability.    <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the recently announced reduction in HSE Home Support provision for the remainder of 2012, investment in these services remains significant with expenditure of around &euro;330 million expected for Home Help and Home Care Packages this year.  All measures are being taken by Local Health Offices to ensure that as many people as possible receive a prioritised service, in line with assessed individual needs. The HSE partnership approach, working with both non-profit and private companies, has not changed, and there is no concerted effort to privatise this service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900080#WRDD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Issues","counter":3755,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900080#WRDD01650"},{"type":"question","counter":3756,"qnumday":614,"qnumall":"[42910\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900080#WRDD01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of medical assessors assessing medical card applications in the primary care reimbursement service in Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3757,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900080#WRDD01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Bed Numbers","counter":3758,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900080#WRDD01838"},{"type":"question","counter":3759,"qnumday":615,"qnumall":"[42913\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900080#WRDD01900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of cystic fibrosis isolation inpatient beds at Temple Street and Beaumont hospitals, Dublin","asker":"1021","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3760,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900080#WRDD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":3761,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900080#WRDD02050"},{"type":"question","counter":3762,"qnumday":616,"qnumall":"[42914\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900080#WRDD02100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding home help care in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"965","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3763,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900080#WRDD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":3764,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900080#WRDD02213"},{"type":"question","counter":3765,"qnumday":617,"qnumall":"[42932\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900080#WRDD02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will examine a document (details supplied) in respect of reforming and saving costs in the Health Service Executive and social services; his views on this document; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1050","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3766,"content":"<p>The Department has received the correspondence referred to by the Deputy.

The outcome of the negotiations with the consultant representative bodies is that detailed proposals have been agreed between the parties.  Amongst the key provisions of this agreement are: Consultants' co-operation with measures to improve patient flow through the hospital system with the potential to deliver a saving of 220,000 bed days per annum; Consultants' availability for rostering for any five days out of seven as opposed to weekdays as at present; Rostering of consultants where required on a 16\/7 (8 a.m. to midnight) or 24\/7 basis in services where this is required; Clinical Directors will have a much strengthened management role in respect of consultants; Consultants commit to expeditious processing and signing of claims for submission to private health insurers; More cost-effective arrangements for funding of continuing medical education.<\/p><p>  These flexibilities are centred on enhancing productivity and efficiency on an ongoing basis and on maximising the availability of consultants, as key clinical decision makers.  A range of other measures is being pursued to address the HSE's budgetary issues.  Separate from the negotiations with the consultant representative organisations, I have announced that new consultants will be appointed at a significantly reduced rate, involving a 30% reduction in salary for future appointees.

The programme will be delivered in a phased manner and a series of Technical Guidance documents will issue to all hospitals covering amongst others (a) Governance and Accountability structures (b) the Management of Referrals (c) the Management of Waiting Lists, Booking and Scheduling (d) the Management and Delivery of Outpatient Clinics (e) the Management of DNAs (f) Clinical Outcome Management and (g) Discharging Patients from Outpatient Services. The first Technical Guidance Document issued on August 20th, 2012, with the key focus on putting governance and accountability structures in place, minimising risk and beginning the process of making robust the manner in which patient referrals are handled and triaged.

The DNA rate is calculated by taking the number of missed appointments (DNAs) as a percentage of the total number of attendances and missed appointments combined.

Approval has recently issued for the 2012 Plan and details will be posted on the HSE's website as soon as is practicable.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is understood that the Deputy, in asserting that a PCC was to be delivered in Rowlagh by way of the HSE's capital programme may be referring to lists reported in the media.  It is important to state that these lists related to work that was ongoing; that they were work in progress.  The prioritisation exercise was a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation.<\/p><p><br \/>  An assessment\/evaluation of each proposed primary care centre location was undertaken with the infrastructural requirement evaluated under three headings: 1) accommodation assessment; 2) service priority; and 3) deprivation index.  The selection of a delivery mechanism was not, however, solely dependent on the resultant priority or ranking.  The delivery mechanism selected for each location was based on suitability and the availability of funding (insofar as it is known at any point in time). The following considerations were taken into account:<\/p><p>- agreements for lease in place - where there were good prospects of the leased centre being delivered - these locations remained as lease strategy;<\/p><p>- The size of the centre - the larger centres are more attractive to PPP bidders;<\/p><p>- Extensions to existing facilities or refurbishment of existing buildings are not suitable projects for PPP.<\/p><p><br \/>  The delivery method for a potential PCC in Rowlagh\/North Clondalkin changed in the lists reported in the media and published by the Department as part of the Government's Infrastructure Stimulus Package.  This change was on the advice of the Head of Estates in the HSE as PPP was considered to be the method by which progress in this development could potentially commence quickest.  However, as mentioned above, the method and timescale for delivery of PCCs is dependent on a number of factors and the list will continue to be reviewed and revised as necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900082#WRFF01200","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3867,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 654 to 657, inclusive, answered with Question No. 611.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":3868,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 658 to 661, inclusive, answered with Question No. 653.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":3869,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900082#WRFF01288"},{"type":"question","counter":3870,"qnumday":662,"qnumall":"[43154\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900082#WRFF01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the information campaign that has been carried out by the Health Service Executive in relation to newborn screening cards; the number of cards that have been destroyed and the number retained by consent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1105","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3871,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900082#WRFF01400","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Services","counter":3872,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900082#WRFF01450"},{"type":"question","counter":3873,"qnumday":663,"qnumall":"[43171\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900082#WRFF01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when new residential care \/ nursing home for elderly people at the Old Richmond Barracks site in Inchicore, Dublin 8 will be fully operational to meet local needs","asker":"1031","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3874,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900082#WRFF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Redundancies","counter":3875,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900082#WRFF01650"},{"type":"question","counter":3876,"qnumday":664,"qnumall":"[41675\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900082#WRFF01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to concerns being raised by home helps with regards to their lack of contracts and conditions of employment; his plans to take action regarding same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3877,"qnumday":665,"qnumall":"[41674\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900082#WRFF01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to ensure that there are standard contracts with detailed terms and conditions for workers in the home help sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1003","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3878,"content":"<p>Contracts for home helps employed by external (non-HSE) providers are a matter for the individual provider.

Prozac (fluoxetine) is indicated in children and adolescents aged 8 years and above for moderate to severe major depressive episode, if depression is unresponsive to psychological therapy after 4&ndash;6 sessions.  Fluoxetine should be offered to a child or young person with moderate to severe depression only in combination with a concurrent psychological therapy.  In children and adolescents aged 8 years and above treatment should be initiated and monitored under specialist supervision.

The prescribing information sets out specific criteria for diagnosis.  Treatment must be initiated under the supervision of a specialist in childhood and\/or adolescent behavioural disorders.  Methylphenidate treatment is not indicated in all children with ADHD and the decision to use the drug must be based on a very thorough assessment of the severity and chronicity of the child&rsquo;s symptoms in relation to the child&rsquo;s age.  The clinical indications also address the issue of long term (more than 12 months) use in children and adolescents, pre-treatment screening and on-going monitoring.  In addition, methylphenidate is tightly controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation in recognition of its potential for abuse.  These controls include that prescriptions must be handwritten, must be retained by the pharmacist who dispenses it and no instalment may be supplied later than two months after the date of the prescription.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900083#WRGG03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Applications","counter":3938,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900083#WRGG03150"},{"type":"question","counter":3939,"qnumday":688,"qnumall":"[43356\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900083#WRGG03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on the most recent changes to the stock of occupational therapy home care aids and appliances in the Health Service Executive Dublin North East area; if he will detail the procurement process which was followed in advance of the most recent changes of suppliers; if he is satisfied that this process compiled with all the necessary protocols; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3940,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900083#WRGG03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Delays","counter":3941,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900083#WRGG03350"},{"type":"question","counter":3942,"qnumday":689,"qnumall":"[43444\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900083#WRGG03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of discretionary medical cards that were in place in each of the years 2010, 2011 and to date in 2012; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3943,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900083#WRGG03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Issues","counter":3944,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900083#WRGG03550"},{"type":"question","counter":3945,"qnumday":690,"qnumall":"[43446\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900083#WRGG03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive will facilitate the transfer of parental leave to nurses who work in hospitals from their spouses who may work in other parts of the public service specifically An Garda Sioch&aacute;na to enable the HSE employee to take the parental leave and are there any rules preventing this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":3946,"qnumday":693,"qnumall":"[43470\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012100900083#WRGG03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the Health Service Executive will facilitate the transfer of parental leave to nurses who work in hospitals from their spouses who may work in other parts of the public service specifically An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that the HSE employee can take the parental leave; if there are rules preventing this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1100","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3947,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 690 and 693 together.<\/p><p>  Parental leave entitlements and their implementation are set out in  the Parental Leave Acts 1998 and 2006.
