We are delighted to be here and I have brought a very senior team, including three assistant secretaries from the Department.  Committee members have copies of the six-month report on developments in the EU from July to December 2013 and it gives details of dossiers progressed under the Lithuanian Presidency.  I will provide a brief overview of the work carried out by the Department during that period.<\/p><p>  The period in question focused predominantly on Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, deliberations around finalisation of the CAP reform package agreed under the Irish Presidency.  Agreement was reached on the final legal texts of the four pillar dossiers under CAP on direct payments, the common organisation of the markets, rural development measures and the horizontal measures.  Discussions also commenced on a series of delegated acts on CAP reform.  These are the detailed rules for implementation of the reform package and the texts were finalised earlier this year.<\/p><p>  The Minister launched a consultation process in July 2013 on how the direct payments regulation would be implemented from 2015.  There was a considerable amount of feedback from the various stakeholders, including this committee's submission.  At this point, most of the decisions have been taken and have been well flagged so I do not propose to go into detail here.  However, I would be happy to answer any questions members may have.  Further stakeholder consultation took place on the outline of our rural development programme, RDP, and the Minister announced the details of our funding commitments under the RDP for the period 2015 to 2020.  Our draft RDP was submitted to the EU Commission last week and we hope to receive, and will press strongly for, early approval for the suite of measures we have developed.<\/p><p>  By way of background, the new rural development regulation moves away from the old axes structure and is instead based on six priority areas for rural development.  These areas are fostering knowledge transfer and innovation, enhancing competitiveness, promoting food chain organisation and risk management in agriculture, restoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems, promoting resource efficiency and supporting the shift towards a low carbon and climate resilient economy and promoting social inclusion, poverty reduction and economic development in rural areas.  The new RDP will be a vital support in terms of enhancing the competitiveness of the agrifood sector, managing natural resources in a sustainable manner, and ensuring the balanced development of our rural areas.<\/p><p>  Under the Lithuanian Presidency, the Commission organised a conference in September to discuss the future of the dairy sector following the expiry of quotas, which will end in March or April of 2015.  Although there were few developments on this issue in the period we are reviewing, I think it may be worthwhile to bring the committee up to date on developments that have taken place this year on the matter.  A growing number of member states, including Ireland, has been arguing for an adjustment in the final year of quotas.  We are arguing that the soft landing envisaged for the expiry of quotas is not happening in all member states.  However, there have been attempts by some member states to link the soft landing issue with the post-quota policy.  The situation in the dairy sector was discussed at every agriculture Council of Ministers meeting under the Greek Presidency and the Italian Presidency also indicated it will be on the agenda at the next Council on Monday.  The position is that the Council is divided on the steps that should be taken in the run-up to the abolition of quotas and afterwards.<\/p><p>  The Minister has lobbied for measures to be taken to address this, notably through an adjustment of the butterfat correction coefficient.  Our allies on this include Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Poland, Luxembourg, Estonia, Belgium and Latvia.  However, another large and influential group of member states, including France, Spain, the UK, Sweden and Italy, is opposed to taking action.  Some are linking this issue to the policy direction to be taken after quotas expire.  There are subtle hints that some would like to see the reintroduction of some form of supply control in the event of a crisis in the sector.  As I said, the matter will be discussed on Monday and at this stage it is difficult to say what the outcome will be.  The reality is the Council is divided on the issue and it would be unwise to anticipate changes to the current quota arrangements, especially for farmers during a year of strong grass growth.<\/p><p>  On the Common Fisheries Policy, the regulation on the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund was concluded during the Lithuanian Presidency.  The three pillars of the fund are to help fishermen in the transition to sustainable fishing, to support coastal communities in diversifying their economies and to finance projects that create new jobs and improve quality of life along European coasts.  The Minister recently secured EU funding to the tune of &euro;148 million from this fund.  This is a huge increase on our allocation, more than double the &euro;72 million allocation for 2007 to 2013.  Ireland must now prepare a programme setting out the arrangements for spending the fund and submit this to the Commission by 20 October 2014.  The Department has been working on the new operational programme since 2013 and has engaged with stakeholders on a number of occasions to date.  Further public consultation and a strategic environmental assessment will take place over the summer of 2014 and the process mirrors that applied to the rural development programme.  The Commission also published its annual proposal for total allowable catch, TAC.  Following stakeholder consultation in November, Ireland successfully negotiated a TAC of around 270,000 tonnes that, importantly, included increased quotas for Celtic Sea herring, mackerel, boarfish and blue whiting. <\/p><p>  Regarding international trade agreements, negotiations and technical discussions are ongoing between the EU Commission and a number of countries in pursuit of free trade agreements.  In the period under review, political agreement was reached on a deal with Canada while negotiations continued with a number of other countries including US, Japan, India, Thailand and the Mercosur countries.  The Department continues to work closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to ensure our position is represented in the trade policy committee meetings where the ground work is completed.<\/p><p>  As I mentioned, political agreement on the Canadian agreement was reached last October.  However, technical discussions are ongoing between Canada and the Commission regarding some issues, including arrangements for the administration of the tariff rate quotas for cheese and beef.  These are of significant importance for Ireland and the Department continues to engage with the Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development and the Directorate General for Trade.  At this point, we understand that the licensing system that will be put in place will regulate the trade evenly over the year.<\/p><p>  On the much-discussed trade agreement, TTIP, between the EU and the US, three rounds of negotiations took place during the period under review.  The main objectives of the agreement are eliminating tariffs, solving regulatory barriers and working to avoid future regulatory barriers.  Discussions between the Directorate General for Trade and the Office of the United States Trade Representative, USTR, are ongoing.  There are significant opportunities for Ireland under this agreement to increase our exports of dairy products and consumer foods, including oatmeal, sports nutrition drinks and so on, to the US.<\/p> <p> There are also opportunities for the meat sector, including in the context of pork, beef and lamb.  For beef and lamb in particular, we envisage the development of a niche market - possibly along the east coast - focused on the Irish diaspora.  However, we must also be mindful of any quota that may be offered to the US in beef.  We continue to urge caution regarding the size and, significantly, composition of any beef quota offered to the US under these negotiations.  As members are probably aware, the US Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Tom Vilsack, recently visited Ireland and had wide-ranging discussions with the Minister about the EU-US negotiations and with regard to access for Irish beef and lamb to the US market.  A United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, inspection of Irish beef-producing plants took place last week.  Assuming they meet the US standards, exports of Irish beef to the US could commence later this year.  We are happy with the way the inspections went so we are hopeful that the process will move on.  Last month the Minister led a trade visit to the US highlighting, among other things, the importance of the US market to Irish producers.<\/p><p> Negotiations with the Mercado Com&uacute;n del Sur, MERCOSUR, stalled in the second half of 2013.  A commitment for the exchange of market access offers between the EU and MERCOSUR by the end of the year was not met.  We are monitoring ongoing developments in respect of this matter very carefully.  Ireland has repeatedly expressed concerns about the threat to both the EU and the Irish beef industry from a badly handled MERCOSUR deal.  We have worked with other member states, in particular France, but also with Austria, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Poland on different aspects of the issue in order to highlight our concerns.  This matter has been raised at official level at the trade policy committee by the Minister at the Agriculture Council and we have had several meetings with the EU Commission at both ministerial and senior official level.  We have made clear our view that the beef offer should not be increased and that it should be structured to avoid a focus on high value cuts, fully respect equivalence and include in-quota tariff rates.  We know that our concerns are fully shared in the Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development, DG Agri, up to and including the Commissioner.<\/p><p> In the context of other free trade agreements, FTAS, negotiations are ongoing between the Commission with Japan, India and Thailand.  The Department continues to monitor developments and provide input into these negotiations.<\/p><p> I wish to deal now with plant health, veterinary and food safety issues.  The legislation in this regard covers animal health, plant health, seeds and propagating materials and includes Regulation (EC) 882\/2004 on official controls.  The intention behind it is to simplify the administrative controls in the areas to which I refer.  During Ireland's Presidency the relevant technical discussions commenced and were continued under the Lithuanian and Greek presidencies.  These are substantial dossiers and are not expected to be finalised until 2015 at the earliest.  The final part of the so called five-part package, which covered plant reproductive material, was rejected by the Parliament and is now with the Commission for redrafting.<\/p><p> On the food sector, the European Commission launched a proposed reform of the established information and promotion regime for European agricultural and food products in November 2013.  The new policy is based on an evaluation of the current policy framework and was developed in parallel with the CAP post-2013 reform process.  The aim is to increase the added value of the agrifood sector and its contribution to the European economy by moving towards a European and global promotion policy that will be more focused on the commercial aspects of the sector.  Following intensive negotiations earlier this year the package was signed off under the Greek Presidency.  It is the fastest ever agreement reached under co-decision with the European Parliament in the agricultural sector.<\/p><p> The six-monthly report on forestry refers to the ongoing discussions on a legally binding agreement on forests in Europe.  These discussions have continued into 2014.  There are a number of inter-institutional differences regarding the preferred strategy to be adopted and these will be discussed further at a ministerial conference on forests, the timing of which has not yet been confirmed.  In addition, discussions on proposals for a forest law enforcement, governance and trade licensing scheme for timber imports into the EU have now concluded, with agreement with the European Parliament on amendments to the existing regime.<\/p><p> That concludes my opening statement.  I would be happy to answer reply to any questions or discuss any issues which members may wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070800003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404825000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moran.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070800004#E00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1404825000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moran for his presentation.  He stated that a great deal of time was spent on the detailed regulation.  It is often said that the devil is in the detail.  Our discussions with representatives from the Department last week indicated that a major challenge is arising for farmers who have so-called commonage land in the context of what constitutes an active farmer.  It appears that if one puts any stock on semi-cultivated land, one will not receive any form of single farm payment whatsoever.  In situations where there is a mixture of lowland and commonage, only some people actively use the hilly land.  This suits those individuals because it means they can have more stock.  As Mr. Moran is aware, there has been an ongoing battle against the overstocking of hills in any event.  The remainder of farmers involved in the type of scenarios to which I refer just use the enclosed parts of their farms.  I understand it is stated somewhere in the small print that if farmers do not put stock on the semi-cultivated land, they will not receive single farm payments.  This would have a huge effect on a large number of farmers on the west coast.<\/p><p>  The GLAS scheme also seems to be giving rise to major problems for commonage farmers.  Did the requirement that 50% of an active shareholders in a commonage join the scheme on the same day emanate from the Department or does it arise on foot of an EU regulation?  Is this requirement immutable?   We cannot use freedom of information to discover who are the commonage farmers and which of them have submitted area aid forms because the information is private and is not, therefore, disclosable.  There might be 200 people in a commonage but only 100 of them might have submitted area forms.  I understand from Mr. Moran's officials that it is not possible to discover the identity of those 100 individuals in order to discover whether they all want to join GLAS together or whether only 50% of them to.  Is this down to the regulation, was it the result of a slip up in the negotiations or does it emanate from the Department?  If the latter is the case, then it could be changed.<\/p><p>  Will Mr. Moran provide details of the discussions which took place in the second half of 2013, when Irish and British beef prices really began to diverge?  For example, what discussions have taken place at EU level in respect of barriers to free trade.  The entire idea behind the Union is that there should be free trade and that borders should not be used to erect artificial barriers in respect of such trade.  As Mr. Moran is aware, there appear to be a significant and increasing number of barriers to free trade between Ireland and both Britain and Northern Ireland.  What discussions took place at EU level in respect of country of origin labelling being misused and employed as a barrier to free trade?  Was the possibility of moving from country of origin to origin EU labelling - in order that free trade in the beef sector will not be hindered - discussed?<\/p><p>  I understand that a change has been made in the context of the regulations.  Previously under the CAP, the N+2 mechanism ensured that payments to farmers were spread out over a number of years.  As a result, payments for the 2007 to 2013 period will not actually cease being paid until 2015.  I understand that on this occasion payments will be made up to 2023, which means that it will be a ten-year rather than a nine-year period.  This indicates that the money on offer will be somewhat lower than previously because payments are going to be spread out over ten years.  It is something similar to what the Government has stated is the position with regard to the country's loans, namely, the longer the payment schedule, the less one is obliged to pay each year.  How much of the money available under the CAP will be on a seven-year timeframe?  I understand that such a timeframe applies in respect of single payments and that a ten-year model applies with regard to rural development.<\/p> <p>Of the billions we will be allocated, how much will be paid in the seven year timeframe and in the new ten year timeframe?  We need to know this to get handle on the annual payments we will receive.  <\/p><p> Under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, &euro;148 million has been secured, which shows the difference between the funds for agriculture and for fishing.  The allocation works out at &euro;20 million a year if the timeframe is seven years.  Will Mr. Moran confirm if it will be allocated over seven years or ten?  Will it be paid in the period from 2014 to 2020 or from 2014 to 2023 or even to 2022?  If the timeframe is seven years, the allocation will be &euro;20 million a year and if it is ten, the allocation will be &euro;14 million a year.  There is a major difference between the two.  Will Mr. Moran confirm if compensation for shellfish farmers hit by incidents of red tide, toxins and such like which will result in their being out of business for one or two years is included in the EMFF package?<\/p><p> With all of the trade agreements being negotiated, the key issue is equivalence.  In other words, if somebody were to sell into this market, would he or she have to adhere to the same standards in regard to genetically modified organisms, animal health and welfare and all of the other standards required to be met in European farming?  Is Mr. Moran confident that when trade interests which are much more dominant in the European Union than agricultural interests get to work, we will be able to insist on equivalence being maintained in all free trade negotiations?  If it is not, lower standard producers with bigger farms will have a massive advantage over us and could dump a lot of their produce in our markets and thus undermine the livelihoods of European farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070800004#E00300","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404825600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Moran for his presentation.  I have a few questions on milk policy.  It appears from his presentation that in some areas there is a resistance to the cessation of quotas.  He referred to a post-quota policy.  What does he envisage is meant by this?  Will some countries try to hold on to their quotas or advocate holding on to some quota at the end of the negotiations?<\/p><p>  Regarding the Common Fisheries Policy, Ireland successfully negotiated a total allowable catch of 270,000 tonnes which includes quotas for sea herring, mackerel, boarfish and blue whiting.  Was success secured for onshore fishermen who I am told make up 80% of those involved in the industry?  Much of the quota for herring, mackerel and boarfish was ring-fenced for a small number of boats that make an awful lot of money, but the vast majority of those involved in the sector are only surviving from day to day, mainly due to the lack of quota.  <\/p><p>  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has pointed out that the figure of &euro;148 million secured works out at an allocation of &euro;20 million a year if paid over seven years and less if paid over ten.  How does Mr. Moran envisage the allocation operating?  Will those coming into the sector be grant-aided to upgrade their fishing vessels or the exploratory gear they use, particularly in dealing with discards?<\/p><p>  The transatlantic trade and investment partnership negotiations are taking place between the European Union and the United States.  On the regulation of the beef industry in the European Union in terms of traceability from conception to placement on the market and ensuring there is no use of hormones to enhance product, how will the Americans overcome this issue?  I am told American beef producers use growth hormones in producing beef.  How will the system work if their product is placed in the European market?  Will there be traceability?  Mr. Moran has mentioned that exports of Irish beef to the United States could commence later this year.  I am aware that the price of beef this year is higher in the USA than it has been for a considerable time.  Normally, Irish producers would not be able to compete in the United States because of the price factor.  Unless we target a niche market for organic beef, how will Irish producers be able to compete in the US market?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070800005#F00300","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speech","time":1404825600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I have a few brief questions following on from the points raised by previous speakers.  I also welcome the delegation.  <\/p><p>  On the timescale for the rural development programme, as I understand it, a proposal was made to the Commission in the past week.  Is that correct?  When does Mr. Moran expect to receive a response?  When does he expect the Department to be in a position to take in applications from the first applicants under the 2015 green low carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS?  At what stage in 2015 will the process be up and running?<\/p><p>  On milk quotas, to which Deputy Martin Ferris referred, I am concerned about a phrase Mr. Moran used in his submission, namely, \"some form of supply control in the case of a crisis in the sector\" in the future.  I am concerned because some countries are very strong on this issue.  Many farmers in Ireland invested a substantial amount of money to increase their herds and expand their facilities on the understanding that they would have freedom to produce as much as possible and that there would be a market for them.  They need to know in the short term if there will be obstacles as they move forward.  There are serious targets to be achieved under Food Harvest 2020, particularly in the dairy sector.  Given that large investments have been made, this is a source of serious concern for those in the middle of an investment process.  There is a need for certainty.  It is important that we have some allies, but there is also a strong group building on the other side and it is a battle we will find hard to win.  The timescale involved needs to be known in the very near future because people are beginning to plan for what will happen in March 2015 which is only seven or eight months away.  <\/p><p>  Deputy Martin Ferris referred to the beef industry.  Mr. Moran mentioned that the US Secretary of State had been here in recent weeks.<\/p> <p>What will be the value of our exports to the American market when it opens later in the year?  There are disadvantages and advantages in that from our point of view and from a European point of view.  Is there the potential that we will flood the market with American beef when we are trying to get our beef to America?  Are we playing one against the other, and will we get lost in the middle of that situation?  As Mr. Moran knows, beef farmers have been through a difficult time.  How will all this fit into Food Harvest 2020 from our point of view?  Some people would argue that the targets will never be achieved.  That is a matter for debate but if the markets we are trying to open are not worthwhile, for example, America, is it worthwhile going there in the first place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070800005#F00500","speaker":"968","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404826200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Deputy Penrose, Senator O'Keeffe, Deputy Heydon and Senator O'Neill are offering but Mr. Moran might like to take the questions from the first three members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070800006#G00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404826200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I will follow whatever the Chairman wants to do.

I will begin with the one that has been raised by a number of Deputies and Senators.  I want to be clear on the milk issue.  The decision has been taken that quotas will end as and from next year, and it was reconfirmed under the health check.  As part of the exit from milk quotas it was decided that there would be a year by year increase in the EU quota to ensure there would be an easing out and a soft landing, which is particularly applicable to countries like Ireland.  No increase was provided for in the very last year.  What was provided for was a report from the Commission to the Council on the state of the market.  Some years ago, Ireland and a small number of member states were conscious of the fact that this soft landing would not necessarily apply equitably across all countries and were of the view that some would have a hard landing.  With a number of other countries, therefore - Denmark, Luxembourg and Netherlands - Ireland started to press for some form of an adjustment in the last year.  That is all we are talking about.  The obvious possibility of adjustment would have been to have a further increase in quotas.  Another one would be adjustment in the levy.  They are now not possible because of Council regulations, which cannot be changed.<\/p><p>  There is one final mechanism that could be used, namely, an adjustment to the fat coefficient.  It is a technical term that essentially means a lift in the quantity of solids in milk that can be produced in the last year.  As I said, the supporters of that adjustment idea have grown considerably in number.  Equally, the opponents have been adamant that the quota regime should not be touched in the last year in that the decision has been taken to end it next year, that it should be left as it stands until then, and that there will not be a quota from that time.<\/p><p>  A number of issues emerged in the debate about adjusting the last year.  It is no secret that not every member state likes the end of quotas but that decision has been taken, and we are not going back on that.  However, in the debate about the last year, other countries have begun to suggest some other mechanism to deal with crises.  The Commission's response, and it is something with which we would agree, is that there are market management measures provided for under CAP reform and in the event of a dip in prices, a supply issue or a volatility related issue, even though the broad prognosis is for an increase in the market, continued increase in demand and a strong optimistic output for milk, market management measures would be applied quickly.<\/p><p>  The Commission has also set up the idea of a price observatory to gather information quickly and accurately across the milk market and to be able anticipate in that regard.  We would have no difficulty with that.<\/p><p>  Allied with those other countries we want to see if we can get an adjustment to the fat coeffiient in the last year, which makes perfect sense in Ireland's view.  However, Ireland, and all those member states, would not countenance any hint, subtle or otherwise, towards supply control from the end of quotas onwards for the reason mentioned, namely, farmers and the industry invested.  That train has left the station.  Quotas are gone, and Ireland is gearing up towards at least a 50% increase.  As far as we are concerned, that is finished.  I would not be concerned in the slightest on that question.  We will still try next week to get an adjustment to the fat coefficient in the last year.<\/p><p>  On the question of commonages and so on, commonages spill over Pillars 1 and 2.  I know Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and others have a strong interest in and attachment to them.  They are a difficult concept to handle within the Common Agricultural Policy, probably because the concept is not generally shared across other member states, but some key factors apply, one of which is the principle of active farming.  Active farming has been spelt out clearly in the new Common Agricultural Policy.  If payments are to go to active farmers, by definition, active farmers must be defined and if they are defined, it must be done by some means.  The way we do it is by the actual farming.  In commonage terms it means the holding stock.  In other words, if someone farming on a commonage wants to claim a Pillar 1 single payment, they must stock in line with commonage framework plans coming down the track.  If, however, they apply under GLAS, the new environmental scheme, by definition they must do more than is required under Pillar 1.  If someone has land in commonage, they must add some further environmental condition to get the newly announced payment of &euro;120 per hectare.<\/p><p>  Another condition that relates to the GLAS one, and it was mentioned previously, is the idea of a collective.  There is shared ownership but there is also shared responsibility, and there was a consultation process on the level of that.  There was a figure of 80% at the beginning but at the latter stages of consultation, having listened to the arguments, including from here and elsewhere, it was decided that the more appropriate figure would be 50%.  However, there must be a collective sharing of responsibility for managing the commonage in line with environmental practice.  That means there must be a common plan that covers 50% of the active farmers on the commonage or 50% of the land.  There was a change to that last week or the week before, which was welcomed by the organisations because of the serious engagement we had on it.<\/p><p>  Regarding beef-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070800006#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Moran"},{"type":"speech","time":1404826200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Can I ask a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070800006#G00800","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1404826200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Let Mr. Moran finish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070800006#G00900","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1404826200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I asked a specific question on that.

Beef farmers have suffered this year in particular, as there has been a serious decrease since September 2013.  Prices in the first half of 2013 were at the highest level ever.  The current reduction in beef prices is not just an Irish issue, as it applies throughout the European Union and is particularly dramatic within the United Kingdom.  A combination of reasons have contributed to this including, in part, falling demand.  There is increased competition from other proteins and meats and one need only compare the price of poultry and pigmeat with the price of beef.  In difficult times, consumers throughout Europe will make choices in this regard and this is particularly evident in the United Kingdom, which is our primary market.  There also is a Russian ban on pigmeat, which means there is a bit more pigmeat knocking around in Europe than there ordinarily would be.  What has happened in beef, therefore, is a function of the market.<\/p><p>  At the same time, however, the Deputy has raised the issue with regard to Northern Ireland and the question of country of origin.  It definitely is clear that the specifications applied by supermarkets through processors and so on probably were less strongly adhered to in a time of shortage and high prices.  However, when prices dipped, the specification then entered more into the fray and as a result, there was an unfortunate build-up of out-of-specification bull beef in particular on farms.  This gave rise to the action the Department took when the Minister announced the beef roundtable forum.  One key point to emerge therefrom was the need for greater communication from processors to farmers, because one cannot simply switch on and off the supply of or the specification for cattle.<\/p><p>  As for the issue raised with regard to Northern Ireland, it is down to a choice by retailers in the United Kingdom retail market.  Only three retailers in the United Kingdom take Irish beef and their choice is to maintain a product that is called UK beef, as well as non-UK beef.  If beef is reared in Ireland and slaughtered in Northern Ireland, under European Union law that must be stated on the label.  The British retailers' preference is for the two different types.  One is born, reared and slaughtered in England and has the Union Jack and is called British and then otherwise, it is non-British.  It is a choice of retailers and is not really a question of something over which we have any great control.<\/p><p>  I understand the joint committee is meeting Mr. Michael Dowling later today and he can go into this issue in great detail.  While he was doing it for us any way, as part of the roundtable we have asked him to consider the activation measures set out for beef under the Food Harvest 2020 strategy and to ascertain which measures were being addressed and which were not.  In addition, as part of the same exercise, we asked him to examine the recent beef issues and to establish what needed to be done.  Mr. Dowling came up with some serious recommendations that were presented to the roundtable the last time it met and there is much work to be done by everybody involved, including the processors and suppliers, to get together and to work on some of his recommendations, which involve clarity and transparency in respect of price and specification.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to the N+2 rule, which involves programme expenditures spilling over into the two years after the end of the programme period.  As the rural development programme is based on a series of programmes, some of which are investment programmes that involve long lead-ins, major planning and so on, one cannot necessarily force all the expenditure into the six or seven years covered by the programme.  Consequently, member states are allowed to spend some of that money in the following period.  For example, in the case of on-farm investment and so on, it runs on, as it is not always easy to plan it.  At present, we are in the \"+2\" period of the old rural development programme.  Equally, at the end of the new programme for which we now seek approval, there probably will be spillover but by then, hopefully, there will be new funds and a new programme will be under way.  It represents a slight overlap at the end of each programme that runs on and is nothing more than that.  It simply involves planned expenditure over a series of programmes.<\/p><p>  A question came up on the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, and beef in the United States.  The Minister has stated and the Department is confident that we would be able to put beef into the United States in the autumn, particularly because we are fairly happy with the outcome of some of the audits this week and it just has to go through a process.  The key question is how much.  The value of the market into which we will be heading in the United States is &euro;700 million.  While we will not be anything in that range, we will be heading into specialist markets.  Deputy Ferris should note it will not necessarily be organic beef but will be grass-fed beef into niche markets in particular, possibly albeit not necessarily the diaspora areas.  Irish beef in the United States could meet a certain target because, if for no other reason, of its size.  It is down to consumer preference for grass-fed beef but if one takes a strip loin of a British-Irish breed, two little strip loins fit nicely into a pack, whereas if one is looking at the bigger breeds or whatever, it is a different shape.  There is a possible niche market in this regard and when one builds on that, the Origin Green programme and the sustainability argument, I believe we have a good chance, which also is the view of Bord Bia.  It is positive and we are working towards it.<\/p><p>  The question of equivalence was also brought up, as was the issue of hormones and so on.  I agree that TTIP will not be easy.  The prize is very big across all ranges, that is, more liberal trade between the European Union and United States is a useful prize at the end of the day.  Agriculture was always going to be one of the key difficult sticking areas and within that, the sticking areas will be equivalence and the terms of trade.  Deputy Ferris put his finger on it as the issue of hormones will be one of those areas.  The European Union consumer does not want hormones.  It is not simply a science-based argument.  Just because, for example, one could get scientists to prove that beef with hormones does one no harm or whatever, ultimately that only goes so far.  If the consumer does not want them, it then is a big issue.<\/p><p>  Thereafter, if one allowed beef with hormones from the United States into the European Union, producers here could argue the case that if producers from the United States can come in and sell such beef, they also should be allowed to so do.  That aspect of it will not be easy.  It is not all just about science.  While science is an input, it is not the deciding factor.  Consequently, the negotiations will take some time.  Agriculture and equivalence, including the matters mentioned here, will be key elements in this regard and it is not just about hormones.<\/p><p>  It is not just defensive, as we have an offensive interest in the United States in respect of milk and dairy products.  We will have a lot of product and there is a lot of opportunity there.  The Irish Dairy Board opened a plant last week in Wisconsin, where it will be using 35,000 tonnes of cheese from the United States to be placed into the food service business.<\/p> <p>There is every opportunity for that kind of a facility to take Irish cheese over time.  There are significant opportunities in the United States for branded butter such as Kerrygold.  There are big prizes to be had in this as well as our defensive interests on beef.<\/p><p> On the European maritime and fisheries fund, EMFF, it is a considerable increase, from &euro;70 million to &euro;148 million.  It will follow a programme, as I stated, much like the rural development programme, with schemes.  It deals with helping fishermen to adopt sustainable fishing practices.  It talks about local communities diversifying their economies and it will fund projects in the fish area, providing jobs in coastal areas.  There are also areas to contribute the application of the new fish control regime.  That programme is being put together, the issues of co-funding are being worked on, and in the fullness of time, that will be submitted to the Commission.  At a particular stage, there would be no difficulty in bringing in some officials and taking the committee through that programme, just as we did on the rural development programme, if that was useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070800007#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404827400,"counter":38,"content":"<p>What is the estimated amount of co-funding?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070800008#J00200","speaker":"1047"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404827400,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I am not clear on the level of co-funding.

I accept that there are defensive and offensive interests, but it is difficult to understand how there can be equivalence when the vast majority of United States beef is produced under a different method, much of it hormone-driven, while we have rigorous standards, hormone-free production, rigorous trade accessibility procedures and focused quality initiatives.  If beef is to be imported on an equivalent basis, will we be allowed to accentuate the country of origin so that consumers will be in a position to discriminate, as the French do?  We are a little squeamish when it comes to ensuring that our interests are protected.  I have grave concerns about that.  Mr. Moran correctly indicated that it is a niche market.  While we obviously want to sell a lot of our beef, we will need to be careful about what is imported.<\/p><p>  The US Secretary of Agriculture, who was leaning across a gate when being interviewed by RTE, was asked about genetically modified foods, and, of course, he wants a significant relaxation of standards in that regard.  The European Commission has a different view - or, certainly, member states have.  How can that be reconciled?  If he goes down that line, is that another area that will represent a trade barrier from our perspective?  We should not sacrifice all merely to rush in.  I would have grave doubts about such a course of action.<\/p><p>  With regard to the current situation in beef, when the Department, in conjunction with Bord Bia and others, secures a market it is a job well done, but one can buy gold too dear.  I would be worried about what might happen in beef.  I come from a significant beef-producing area and I know how farmers are suffering at the moment.<\/p><p>  I must agree with Mr. Moran that while we all can trot out glib solutions, a lot of this is market-determined.  We must face up to that.  Mr. Moran is correct.  The relaying of information and the nod-and-wink practice has to stop.  Clear, unequivocal information must be given to beef producers well ahead of time.  What happens in the beef sector does not happen in other sectors, particularly the milk sector.  I hope this round-table conference achieves a crystallisation of views and ideas that will address a situation that is occurring for many beef farmers across the country.  How will the matter be reconciled?  How will they square that circle?  We have a particular view on genetically modified crops, under which Ministers have operated over the years.  How will that feed into the matter?  Was the US Secretary of Agriculture using that as a bargaining tool?  What interpretation did Mr. Moran put on the US Secretary of Agriculture's view on genetically modified crops?  Was he using it as a hard bargaining tool?<\/p><p>  I have one other question.

If there was meant to have been a big European statement on that, I wonder where that is.<\/p><p>  Finally, on Mr. Moran's observations about the food sector, he spoke about the negotiation that took place under the Greek Presidency on the food sector and the global promotion policy.  I wonder what on earth the global promotion policy is, particularly as it is more focused on the commercial aspects of the sector.

At the meeting referred to I asked about the testing of beef to ensure it was free of hormones.  Will the onus be on the importer to ensure it is hormone free?  If it is not, will the Department impose more sanctions ?  Instead of testing one in every 100 tonnes, for example, will it test according to a different regime?<\/p><p>  The beef industry is in crisis.  The Department had no input when the beef grid was drawn up.  It was an agreement between the factories and farm organisations.  Will the Department try to take some initiative to design a new grid?  This would benefit both farmers and processors and would also benefit the retailers who sell on beef.  If prices are transparent, everybody is happy.  If world markets are depressed owing to the price being paid, we cannot do anything about it.  There are so many sanctions in place, including in respect of over-age and under-age animals, and overweight and underweight animals, and various factors associated with the grid.  Therefore, we need transparency.

It is completely separate.  European beef, including Irish beef, was banned in the United States because of BSE.  It is a BSE-related ban that we are trying to have lifted.  We have had lifted it in all other countries.  There are only two countries being considered for the admittance of beef to the US market through the lifting of the ban, one of which is Ireland, while the Netherlands is the other.  The Netherlands wishes to export veal, not beef.  Therefore, we have blazed a trail in this regard.<\/p><p>  Consider the circumstances that obtained when half of our beef exports were going to third countries, including Egypt, Iran, Iraq and Russia.  One needs options in the beef market.  It does not matter whether one uses them, but one needs them.  It is very difficult if supermarkets, or any buyer in any commercial arrangement, have a hold over the outlet.  Over 90% of our beef goes elsewhere in Europe; some 50% is exported to the United Kingdom.  These statistics will not change dramatically, but, when trying to sell one's beef, one needs options.  A certain number of tonnes of striploin, or higher value cuts, might go to the United States, for example.  Options strengthen one's bargaining position, which is very important.  The extent to which one uses these options will depend on the commercial return from the markets.<\/p><p>  On the question of information for producers, I agree with Deputy Willie Penrose.  The position is not like that concerning milk.  Milk is bought and sold every month and one receives one's monthly cheque.  Beef production involves a long project, not unlike building a house.  One cannot become involved, therefore, without knowing the outcome, as one might be feeding animals over the winter only to be stuck waiting.  Therefore, what one needs is transparency.  Ideally, contracts are required.  Particularly with a specialised product such as bull beef, contracts are required in order that one will know where one is going if one invests heavily in feed and stocks animals over the winter, for example.  This point emerged very strongly in Mr. Michael Dowling's report.  He will emphasise it later.  We are very strongly in favour of this.  Not only is transparency required; contracts are also required.<\/p><p>  With regard to the grid, Senator Pat O'Neill is absolutely correct.  Members know what the grid is, for which the payment basis was worked out between farmers and the factories.  The Department does not and could not have an involvement in it.  The Government and the Department cannot enter the space involving the negotiation of price between buyers and sellers of a product.  One simply cannot be in that space for a host of reasons, many of which have legal implications.  However, what came out of the forum and what the Minister made clear only last week was the importance of the grid and using it such that farmers would know precisely the basis on which they were being paid.  Therefore, if there is a bonus, they will know the basis on which it is added.  Alternatively, they will know the basis on which a payment deduction can be made.  Again, it is a matter of clarity and transparency.  We could not get involved in negotiating a new price structure between farmers and factories and it would not be correct to do so.  However, we agree with the Senator that transparency and predictability are very important.<\/p><p>  The question of sacrificing everything just to rush into the US market will not arise.  The discussions will be difficult.  The US Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Tom Vilsack, came to three countries, namely, France, Ireland and Luxembourg, where he met Council representatives.  We are pleased that he came here.  He came here in order that we would understand American agriculture and that the Americans would understand our system.  The two systems are different.  The United States has a very serious difficulty in trying to understand the concept of geographical indicators that link a product with a tract of land.  Mr. Vilsack emphasised in his public comments the role of science in coming up with proof and in deciding whether something was good, not good or causing no harm.  There are many other considerations involved in this regard.  It was not that we were negotiating on the TTIP because we could not do so; it is a competency of the European Commission.  What we were doing was explaining where we stood and we were trying to understand where the United States stood.  We were engaging in bilateral negotiations on beef production and the US Secretary was extremely helpful in that regard.<\/p> <p>However, I do not think anything is being sacrificed as a result of engaging with him.<\/p><p> The EU, including Ireland, has its own position on GMOs.  No doubt, these things will feature in the way in which the negotiations progress, but they will be difficult.  It was well recognised that some of the more difficult aspects of the TTIP negotiations will involve the technical aspects around agriculture and food.  There will be others as well.<\/p><p> The key point about the US audit of plants in Ireland is that it is a systems audit.  They pick two plants and give a rigorous assessment.  Traditionally, going back 20 or 30 years ago, the USDA approval of something was always gold standard.  They do examine things very rigorously and they will work it out from that assessment.  It then falls to member states to approve other plants based on the US standard as worked out through those two plants.  That is the way it will work.  There is a set period of time after which those discussions will take place.  They have 60 days within which to come back and we also have 60 days.  Our aim will be to try to tighten up those periods. <\/p><p> There are advantages in the Canadian agreement.  Senator O'Keeffe talked about my somewhat enigmatic comments about the type and nature of quotas.  I might not have been clear enough.  The issue is that a tonnage of beef is not an absolute in itself because it depends what type of beef it is.  For example, 20,000 tonnes of high-value fillets is not the same as 20,000 tonnes of forequarter beef, minced beef or lower value cuts.  When a quota is being negotiated in international trade, our aim is to ensure that that reflects either the fall of the animal or some relation between the value of the cut and the overall quantity.  That has been our strong position in MERCOSUR, WTO and the Canadian discussions.  It will also be our position in the US talks.  <\/p><p> There are advantages to the Canadian deal.  We have access for 18,500 tonnes of cheese, including 16,800 tonnes of high quality cheese.  I can give the committee a note on that, so I will not read out a load of figures on it.  We have duty-free access for milk protein concentrates into Canada, which is increasingly important for the Irish dairy sector.  There are gains in Canada therefore on the dairy side for Ireland and we can send on a list of those for the committee's information.  <\/p><p> Nomad cattle is a strange phrase but this is a commercial choice.  Governments do not make this choice, it is made by slaughterers in the North under the influence of their purchasing arrangements with UK retailers.  Concerning beef, legally, one must include details of where the animal was born, reared and slaughtered.  If this happens in different countries, it gets complicated.  An animal may be born in the Republic of Ireland, reared in the North and slaughtered in Britain.  It can be complicated both for labelling and processing, because a processor must do those on separate lines at separate times.  It is done for ease of their operations.  The Minister has raised this matter with his counterpart in the North to see if something could be done about it. <\/p><p> Deputy Heydon referred to young farmers, which was a key feature of the CAP.  The Minister was very successful in giving them top priority and ensuring that the top-up arrangement was compulsory across all member states.  A specific issue is often referred to as the old-young farmers - ones that have already been there.  We are seeking to solve that through some kind of priority in the national reserve.  We have raised that with the Commission and have difficulties with it, but we are trying to resolve it.<\/p><p> I think I have covered everything. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070800009#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Moran","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404828600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>There is just the Russian issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070800010#L00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1404828600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>The horsemeat question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2014070800010#L00300","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404828600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>As regards the horsemeat issue, the very fact that it was found in Ireland, originated here and then became European from here, gave rise to a huge amount of work across Europe on new regulations.

The Commission's proposal in 2008 for a European private company statute, SPE, which was intended to facilitate cross-border activity by SMEs, fell because it failed to garner the unanimous support necessary for adoption.  The present proposal is effectively a substitute for the SPE and has been brought forward by the Commission following deliberative and consultative processes including an impact assessment.<\/p><p>  The so-called twelfth company law directive, (89\/667\/EEC), as given effect in Ireland by SI No. 275\/1994, the European Communities (Single-Member Private Limited Companies) Regulations, provided for the incorporation of single-member private limited companies.<\/p> <p>Changes made to the 1989 directive were codified in Directive 2009\/102\/EC.  The intention is that the current directive, which captures the content of the codified directive of 2009, will repeal the latter.  As of now, on a national basis, we have the scope for single members to incorporate.<br \/>I will now turn to the legal basis of the proposed measure-Commission justification.  Article 50 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union provides the legal basis for the draft directive.  The Commission justifies its proposal on the grounds of subsidiarity by making the point that without action at the level of the EU, only non-harmonised approaches would be forthcoming and SMEs would still encounter obstacles to operating in another member state.  It also justifies the proposal on the grounds of proportionality by stating that the harmonisation in question is confined to those aspects which are most important in a cross-border context and do not go beyond what is necessary and proportionate for the achievement of the regulatory objective.<br \/>The directive provides for the establishment of private single-member limited liability companies in accordance with the rules and procedures set out in the proposal. These companies are to be referred to as SUPs, an abbreviation of the Latin term &quot;Societas Unius Personae&quot;.  The directive provides for limited harmonisation of the relevant national laws by requiring that companies may have a single shareholder and regulating the powers of that single member in respect of the company.  The proposed directive on single-member private limited liability companies is intended to make it easier for any potential company founder, and in particular for SMEs, to set-up companies abroad.  This is designed to encourage and foster more entrepreneurship and lead to more economic growth, innovation and jobs in the EU.<br \/>I will now set out key features of the proposal.  Member states would be obliged to allow for direct online registration of SUPs, eliminating the need for a founder to travel to the country of registration or to appoint an agent there for this purpose.  The proposal would provide for a template of articles of association, which would be identical across the EU, available in all EU languages and contain the necessary elements to run a single-member private limited liability company.  A minimum capital requirement of &euro;1 for SUPs would be introduced.  Protection for creditors is to be provided through a balance sheet test and a solvency statement.<br \/>The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation issued a consultation document on the proposal which elicited responses from four organisations, in addition to which the Companies Registration Office supplied some comments.  Some of the points made do not appear to take due account of the existing scope to operate as a single-member private liability company.  That scope already exists.  Among the contributions received was a welcome for the proposal and its benefits in terms of administrative burden reduction and its perceived benefits for SMEs in accessing export markets.  Another observation was the perceived benefit of the solvency statement provided for at Article 18 in the context of proposed distributions, which was considered prudential.  Due to the role posited for registration and ancillary functions in the draft directive, the Companies Registration Office had a number of comments to offer in terms of new requirements proposed and implications <i>vis-a-vis<\/i>the Companies Bill 2012, which is likely to be enacted later this year.  This is the rather large consolidated Bill about which I suspect people present know quite a bit.<br \/>The first meeting of the Council working group to consider the draft directive took place on 22 May 2014 and was introductory in nature setting out the scope of the directive and seeking preliminary views from member states.  Two further meetings have taken place since then, the latest on 2 July.  While there is no evidence of fundamental opposition on the part of member states to the principle of what is proposed here, the situation in general is that all member states continue to maintain scrutiny reservations.  Much of the discussion is of a technical nature and delegations continue to seek clarification on the meaning and intent of aspects of the text.  In many cases, the Commission has undertaken to revert at future meetings with the clarifications sought.  To date, there has only been a partial reading of the measure.  They have probably got about two thirds of the way through.  One point being made by some member states is that the share capital requirement should be increased significantly from &euro;1.  The Commission responded by pointing out that the wording in the article in question, which is Article 16, &quot;shall be at least &euro;1&quot; allows member states the flexibility to require a higher figure.  The Italian Presidency at the most recent meeting invited member states to make written submissions with any proposals, questions or issues they wish to bring to attention.  It is our intention to avail of the Presidency's offer.<br \/>It is understood that the Italian Presidency is seeking to achieve a general approach by the end of its term.  A general approach is the term used for agreement at Council level.  The European Parliament is obviously ploughing its own furrow in this regard.  At the most recent Council working group meeting, the Council legal services gave a long oral presentation making the case for the appropriateness of Article 50 of the of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union as a legal basis for the draft measure.  This is an indication of the relatively preliminary nature of consideration of the dossier.  In the event, member states sought the Council legal services' views in writing, which suggests that they may have some issues around their consideration as to whether it is an appropriate basis.<br \/>The Department will be formulating its policy position on the directive over the coming time, which will take account of the consultation undertaken, with clarification on points raised there which could benefit from being amplified, and further discussions with the Companies Registration Office.  Proposals or suggestions made in the present forum will also be taken account of in the discharge of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014070800003#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Houlihan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404822900,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Before we move on to the next COM, are there any questions?

I am not sure if he has received the submission from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, but I met it regarding the issue.  It has expressed some concerns in respect of this directive, some of which I share.  The substance of ICTU's submission is that it could encourage bogus self-employment, informal insolvencies and tax avoidance.  There is a distinction between being a sole trader and being a limited company.  There are advantages to both but a sole trader is not a company.  A sole trader does not pay corporate taxes.  The person pays personal income taxes.  If one sets up what is now a single-person limited liability company, one will have all the advantages of a corporation, which would include lower corporation taxes.  There are also potential issues relating to insolvencies.  We have seen workers left high and dry where a company essentially ceases trading but a liquidator or receiver is not appointed and the workers are unable to get any of their unpaid wages under the insolvency fund.  This is a major issue and workers have been left high and dry.  The case of the Paris Bakery is the most recent one but there have been many such cases.<\/p><p>  If a person sets up a company at the moment, they must have two directors.  Will this remain in place or will it be changed to one director?  What will that mean?  In respect of some of the key messages that I have been asked by ICTU to articulate to the Department, it is important that if ICTU makes submissions, we air them and get responses from the Department.  ICTU is very much of the view that the directive should ensure the single-member limited liability company is not a vehicle for avoiding tax, for example, allowing companies to set up a number of subsidiaries and then register in a different country from the one in which they actually operate.  This does happen, as we know, so there must be clear rules relating to the transfer of a registered office which must include the protection of worker involvement rights, require the registered office and headquarters to be in the same country and allow for a transfer only for genuine business reasons.  I think that makes sense.  It should also ensure the single-member limited liability company is not a vehicle for promoting self-employment over employment, which could create its own problems.  ICTU is saying that single-member single-worker firms should be excluded and that regardless of what happens here, we must ensure workers' rights are protected.  We have seen examples where companies are set up, their headquarters may be somewhere else and they are not bound by the same employment rights rules in this State.  These are all legitimate concerns that have also been raised by the European Trade Union Confederation.<\/p> <p>Perhaps the Mr. Houlihan might acknowledge whether he received a copy of the ICTU submission and, if so, whether he agrees with the any of the concerns it raised.

This proposal would provide another member state dimension to the current process.  I have listened carefully to the Senator's comments about the potential that the proposal could, in theory, give rise to scope for unfair play, but that is something we would monitor carefully.  The committee in Brussels is going through the proposal with the proverbial fine toothcomb and people are offering their views on it, whether for better or worse.

Such agreement seems to be quite far away and even the Presidency's desire to progress the dossier within the confines of its own term of office, which expires at the end of the year, has been questioned by some member states.  I do not perceive any indication of undue haste and, in regard to the kind of concerns that have been articulated and the issues that need to be examined, every effort is being taken to ensure the measure contains nothing untoward or unintended.

As the committee will be aware, the proposal was adopted by the Commission last April and it went straight away to the European Council and the European Parliament at the same time.<\/p><p>  On the Council side, there have been three meetings of the working party, which is the technical level, and matters are still at an early stage, with member states looking for clarification.  The plan from the Presidency's point of view is to get member states to agree their general approach by the Competitiveness Council, which takes place on 4 December.  At the same time, the European Parliament has selected its Committee on Legal Affairs to take the lead on the file but, as far as I could tell from the Internet yesterday, the rapporteur has not yet been appointed, probably for obvious reasons.  Three other committees will be asked to give their opinions as part of the preparation of the final report, namely, the Committees on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.<\/p> <p>Meanwhile, back at home, our company law section in the Department held a public consultation during May and June.  We received only nine submissions, which we intend to publish as they came in on the Department's website in the coming week or so.  There was a slight delay, partly because I have been out of the office but also because, although I made it very clear that my intention was to publish them, I asked people to let me know if there was anything confidential in them and there is a certain amount of checking whether certain items can be published.  As far as I am concerned, there is nothing confidential.  The Department is assessing all those submissions with a view to refining our negotiating position to be settled with the Minister.<br \/>I will recall the main features of the proposed directive.  The main aim is to encourage shareholders to engage more with the companies they own in order that they and those companies take a longer-term view of success and build sustainable businesses.  The proposal does this in two ways in particular.  First, it gives the shareholders new rights of oversight of company business.  Second, it obliges others in the investment chain to provide new types of information to the shareholders.  Once adopted, the directive will affect several groups of people, namely, asset managers; institutional investors, which are not, in this case, banks but life assurance companies and pension funds; investment intermediaries; companies that are listed on the main market, in our case Dublin; proxy advisers; and shareholders.<br \/>The proposal will introduce three new categories of provisions, namely, new rights for shareholders to oversee remuneration and related party transactions; provisions on disclosure that will oblige institutional investors, asset managers and proxy advisers to provide more information to companies, each other, shareholders and, in some cases, the public; and procedures to improve the identification of shareholders by the companies they own and to facilitate the exercise by those shareholders of their rights in the companies.<br \/>The new rights for shareholders relate to oversight of the remuneration policy and of related party transactions.  On pay, the text provides that shareholders will have the right to vote on the company's remuneration policy for directors at least every three years.  The directive lists the main elements that should be included in the policy, which include maximum levels of pay for directors and the main contractual terms.  While the policy is binding on the company, there is provision for the company to exceed those maximums, for example if there is either prior or post approval from the shareholders.  The company will also have to prepare an annual remuneration report for the shareholders, which will have to include information on the total remuneration paid over the past year to the directors, how those packages were made up and how they fit in with the overall three-year policy.  The report is submitted to the AGM and shareholders vote on it.  If they reject it, the company must explain in the remuneration report of the following year whether - and, if so, how - the rejecting vote was taken into account.<br \/>Alongside the so-called say on pay provisions, the directive will oblige companies to report to their shareholders on related party transactions that represent more than 1% of the company's assets.  For larger transactions, where they represent more than 5% of the company's assets, the company must submit the transaction to the shareholders for a vote.  In both cases, the company must also arrange for an independent third party to assess whether the transaction is on market terms and confirm that it is fair and reasonable from the perspective of the shareholders, including minority shareholders.<br \/>The draft directive will provide that institutional investors and asset managers must develop and publish shareholder engagement policies.  They will then have to report annually on the implementation of the policies.  It is open to institutional investors and asset managers to fulfil this provision on a so-called comply or explain basis.  Institutional investors will have other new disclosure obligations.  They will be required to make public how their equity investment strategy contributes to the medium to long-term performance of their assets and they will have to publish certain elements of their mandates to their asset managers.  Asset managers will have to disclose certain information to the institutional investor.  At the same time, proxy advisers will be required to take measures to ensure their voting recommendations are accurate and reliable; to disclose information on the preparation of those recommendations; and to identify and disclose to their clients and the company concerned any actual or potential conflict of interest.<br \/>Shareholder engagement is a two-way street between the shareholders and the companies.  The Commission has proposed measures to help companies identify and better engage with their shareholders.  There will be obligations on investment intermediaries to provide names and contact details of shareholders to a company following a request from the company.  The investment intermediaries will also have a role in exchanging other information between the company and its shareholders and in facilitating shareholders in exercising their rights.<br \/>Negotiations within the Council in Brussels have begun and we have had public consultation here, and I will summarise some of the issues that have arisen.  In Brussels, there is general overall support for the objective of this proposal, but there is disagreement on the means to achieve it.  While most member states have supported the draft directive's provisions for binding measures, some would prefer to introduce so-called soft law, such as a non-binding recommendation.  There have been calls for more flexibility in the proposal to allow companies and others more freedom to devise policies as they see fit.<br \/>Another argument has been the concern that some of the new provisions could introduce unnecessary administrative burdens.  If so, it could put EU companies at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>their non-EU competitors.  It could also motivate companies to de-list from stock exchanges, which would mean we would have even less information on them.  Another concern has been about how the provisions on shareholder identification and exchanges of information will work in practice.  There is a possibility of having several intermediaries in a single investment chain, some of which may be based outside the EU and, therefore, not covered by the directive.  What will happen in the event of such a gap in the chain is a concern.<br \/>The submissions to the Department reflected general support for the objectives of the proposed directive and most of the comments received related to the practical implementation of those objectives.  Regarding the identification of shareholders and facilitation of their rights, it is probable that the directive here could reduce the current powers of companies under Irish law to identify their shareholders as, for example, it introduces intermediaries into the process and places time limits on the period for which the information may be retained by companies.  This is a little different from current Irish law and we must examine it as we do not want a diminution of our protections.  Another issue is that the requirement on companies to confirm to shareholders that they have received votes could impose significant costs on the issuers of the shares as it does not take into account the reality of the voting process.  For example, one submission pointed out that given that shareholders are free to change their vote at any time up to the date of the relevant meeting, one might need to confirm to a shareholder several times that one had received his or her vote, which could be costly.<br \/>Regarding engagement policies for institutional investors and asset managers, there was a concern that, by encouraging and emphasising long-term investment, the legislation runs the risk of forgetting the importance of short-term strategy.  Companies will have legitimate needs for funding in the short term.  The requirements for disclosure on asset managers may be onerous and costly for smaller management firms.  Asking asset managers to disclose how their strategy contributes to the medium to long-term performance of an investor's assets may not be achievable as that investor may have more than one asset manager, each of whom has only part of the picture.<br \/>On the transparency of proxy advisers, one submission suggested that it would be difficult for a proxy adviser to &quot;guarantee&quot; that its voting recommendation is accurate and reliable, which is a high standard to require.  The shareholder oversight of remuneration provision was welcomed generally.  There was a view that the text could be clearer on the fact that it is ultimately a role for the board and remuneration committee rather than shareholders to set and agree directors' remuneration.  There was a call for more clarity on how a company can go beyond the remuneration policy and the consequences if the shareholders do not subsequently approve that particular pay package.<\/p> <p>It was said that the directive was silent on that situation.<\/p><p> Third, some expressed a concern for the provision to explain a ratio.  The directive speaks on remuneration policy of giving a ratio between the average employee salary and the pay packages of the directors.  Some people consider that would be a meaningless figure.  If a company has bases in many different EU member states, it will have different levels of pay and that does not give a proper feel for what is the average pay.  There was also a concern that making this publicly available could engender a reputational risk.  Finally, there was a concern on the remuneration that the status of existing contracts would not be recognised and there was a need to grandfather those arrangements.<\/p><p> The final group of submissions related to shareholder oversight of related party transactions.  There was a worry that it would be impossible for an independent third party to make the type of assessment that the text requires here.  As an alternative, therefore, it was suggested that the requirement should be just to disclose details of the transactions rather than to give any opinion on its reasonableness.  Second, it was suggested that there may be a conflict with existing Irish law, which sets a lower threshold for transactions that need shareholder approval.  Again, that is something that needs further assessment.<\/p><p> The Department is assessing all these submissions and we will more than likely have to go back to some of the organisations for further information or clarity.  Some of the submissions threw out issues and did not give us a steer as to what might be a suitable solution or whether they were serious problems.  All the views will be considered in the refining of the Irish position over the coming weeks.  We will post them on our website and we can let the committee know immediately when that happens.<\/p><p> The Italian Presidency is looking towards getting a general approach at the Competitiveness Council in December.

I am joined by Ms Fionnuala Healy, who is chief technology officer with start-up Gotcha Ninjas and was a senior software engineer with Ericsson; successful tech entrepreneur Mr. Sean Blanchfield, who is scaling up his latest venture, PageFair, having recently raised a round of investment and is very familiar with the scaling challenges which face start-ups; Mr. Gene Murphy, one of the most committed start-up community activists I have ever met, who spends a huge amount of time mentoring and invigorating the start-up community in Dublin; and Mr. Karl Aherne, who is a long time supporter of the start-up community and leads Dublin's largest corporate accelerator, Wayra, and has many Irish successes to his credit.<\/p><p>  We wish to speak to the committee about the challenges Dublin faces in its goal of being a global tech start-up hub, and about the momentum and success which Startup Ireland has achieved to date.  We are a group of volunteers and it is very much a grassroots movement.  We are very much committed to making a success of this.  We also want to speak about the vision we have for Dublin as a global tech start-up hub by the year 2020.<\/p><p>  Committee members will remember that Mr. Sean O'Sullivan chaired the Entrepreneurship Forum, and I was in the public gallery for his presentation on its report.  We see ourselves as carrying on the good work of the forum.  The report contained 69 recommendations, and for today's purposes we will focus on the aspect of vibrant hotspots of activities, whereby a density of networks - in cities - creates successful start-up communities.<\/p><p>  Our goal is to make Dublin a global tech start-up hub by 2020, and one might ask why this is our goal.  A minimum of 2,800 jobs could be achieved by then and the contribution to the Dublin economy could be in excess of &euro;200 million per annum.  These figures are based on the Activating Dublin report.  The goal is that Dublin will be an international centre for innovation.  The real importance of start-ups as creators of jobs is underpinned by the Action Plan for Jobs, which found that two thirds of all new jobs are created by start-up businesses.  This is a common factor throughout the world in all advanced economies.  The role of start-ups in creating innovation is important and recognised by the big multinationals, which invest increasing amounts in start-ups through their corporate venturing arms, so much so that many of the big corporates will not only invest directly in start-ups but will run accelerator programmes for them.  An accelerator programme typically offers an amount of seed capital between &euro;20,000 and &euro;40,000 or $20,000 and $40,000.  There is a competitive process to get on the, typically, three-month programmes and hundreds will apply for ten to 20 places.  A corporate accelerator programme often facilitates introductions to divisions within the business, which makes getting the first big corporate sale much easier.  Similar processes are involved in other accelerator programmes.<\/p><p>  At present, Dublin does not appear in any of the key tech start-up ecosystem rankings.  An element of perception is possibly involved in the challenge Dublin faces, as we are doing quite well on many metrics but we do not figure in many of the research reports.  The 2012 Startup Genome rankings did not feature Dublin.  Neither did the start-up ecosystem report, which examined 35 cities throughout the world, and Dublin was not on the most active cities list compiled by TechCrunch.  For anyone out there who thinks the biggest challenge facing Dublin at present is the Kilkenny hurling team, I would like to put it differently.<\/p><p>  Dublin faces many challenges with regard to our goal of being a tech start-up hub.  If anyone thinks Dublin has it easy, I ask him or her to bear this in mind the next time someone states Dublin gets all the good stuff.  At present the research and development venturing activities of the corporates are not located in Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014070800009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Costello"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1404825600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>Deputy Damien English took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404825600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>In Tel Aviv in Israel, 40% of highly qualified staff work in the research and development centres of big multinationals, such as Google and Microsoft.  The fact that the large multinationals do not have their corporate venturing and research and development activities here means they do not have sufficient meaningful engagement with the start-up community.  Dublin lacks a cohesive single story.  Silicon Valley is known internationally as the epicentre for tech ventures, where one can get in one place the entire pathway for successfully scaling a high-tech opportunity.  London is the hub for incubating financial technology ventures.  Tel Aviv is internationally renowned as a hub for mobile, water and life sciences innovation.  Dublin also has a skills shortage with regard to being a global tech hub.  A total of 75% of ICT companies, with an estimated 4,000 vacancies, are looking for workers.  Dublin has a lack of female entrepreneurs engaged in our tech start-ups.  Global Entrepreneurship Monitor has found a 2:1 ratio between males and females engaged in entrepreneurship.<\/p><p>  This combination of difficulties means it is difficult to find successful investment.  After a company has gone through seed rounds and is beginning to scale up internationally, closing the round between &euro;2 million and &euro;5 million is very difficult in Dublin.  Taking all these factors together, the result is we have low international visibility as a start-up hub.  The problem with this is that it comes at a time when international competition is moving from being country-based to city-based, because cities are the real engines of our economic development.<\/p><p>  Let us look very briefly at what we can learn from other successful start-up ecosystems throughout the world.  These include many US cities, which have a massive captive population, and cities such as London or Paris which have very large domestic populations.  Approximately two weeks ago I interviewed an incubation centre manager in Israel.  He told me that in Tel Aviv everybody has a start-up idea and everybody is working on making it the next big thing.  In Israel when an entrepreneur has a business idea he or she will begin to work on it by the end of the week.  The Entrepreneurship Forum found that we must encourage entrepreneurship because we have a cultural problem with it.  In Tel Aviv, because of the culture and can-do attitude, the pipeline is very large and a very large number of people have highly technical skills.  Start Tel Aviv is an international competition open to 20 countries which feeds into the pipeline.  With regard to infrastructure, Tel Aviv has in excess of 600 spaces available at any particular time for start-ups.  This creates an output of 1,900 tech start-ups per annum.  Our best guesstimate is that at present Dublin may produce up to 200 tech start-ups per annum, which means the output in Tel Aviv is ten times larger than that in Dublin.<\/p><p>  The pipeline goes from ideation to incubation, and includes building a team, getting a product market-fit, accelerating it and raising money.  Tel Aviv has 36 accelerators, including important multinational accelerators such as Google Campus and Microsoft Ventures.  Israel has the largest number of NASDAQ-quoted companies in the world.  Its output of 63 NASDAQ-quoted companies is greater than that of Korea, China, Singapore, India and all of Europe combined.  This is what is possible with a joined-up ecosystem.<\/p><p>  It is important that Israel has a large number of accelerators and corporate accelerators.<\/p> <p>The reason it matters if that over time the survival and success rates of start-ups that have gone through an incubation programme are significantly higher.  Everybody knows the failure rate of start-ups is high.  However, through the use of an accelerator programme, this does not have to be the case.  The slide now showing focuses on the Y Combinator and tech start-ups.  These are US data which show that through the use of an accelerator programme, the failure rate over time is significantly lower.  That is the situation in relation to a city ranked number two in the world in start-up ecosystems.<\/p><p> We will now look at one ranked number 20 in the world and what it is doing about this area.  Startup Chile - Chile is a fairly remote part of the Earth - has set about this with real gusto.  It runs an international competition which attracts more than 3,000 applications from 35 countries.  Its pitch to start-ups is: \"We want to transform our country.  We would want you to talk to local students and entrepreneurs and imbue them real entrepreneurial spirit.\"  It has been very successful.  That is the situation at the other end of the scale.<\/p><p> I will now focus on the middle sector and those start-up ecosystems that want to ramp up their activities and what we can learn from them.  Currently, the world's largest start-up incubator is being constructed in Paris.  It will cater for 1,000 start-ups.  This means ten times our current output will be going through incubation facilities in Paris, France.  Mexico, which is trying to break into this space and although not currently in the top 20, is doing a great deal about that, has built a 35,000 sq. ft integrated facility.  This is really important in the context of having the entrepreneurs, lawyers, financial service providers and so on all in the one space creating a dense network of connections.  They are the challenges Dublin faces and what we can learn from other successful start-up ecosystems.<\/p><p> I would like to outline briefly the Startup Ireland track record to date and the genesis of the idea.  The next slide is a founding photograph of Novara Technology which was a hosting and domains business set up in the front bedroom of my house, which was scaled up very quickly and over eight years achieved a customer base of more than 8,000 and 20 staff.  It was the second largest company of its kind in Ireland.  I sold that company to Digiweb for a seven figure sum.  This all happened in 2009-2010 when things were very bleak.  In order to give something back, I then went travelling the world and visited incubation centres and social entrepreneurship enterprises and brought that knowledge back to Ireland.  When I got back, I did a masters degree at the University of Ulster and looked at how the start-up ecosystem in Ireland could be strengthened.  I presented the findings of my research to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and then took on the job at DIT hothouse incubation centre, where I am currently programme manager of the new frontiers programme.  What I am trying to do in this context is implement the findings of my dissertation, namely, to bring about collaborative activities, to bring students into work with start-ups on an internship basis and to encourage students to do digital marketing, brand creation or strategic management projects for the benefit of a start-up, such that both sides win.  I also hold student tours of the incubation centre.  It is working.  Culture change is about hand-to-hand combat.  It is granular and it does work.  I recently spoke to a parent of a student who is doing an internship.  He told me that since taking the internship, his son has been buzzing about setting up his own start-up.  Prior to doing the internship, he had no interest in start-ups.<\/p><p> About a year ago I reached the point where I knew this was working and that it  needed to be scaled up and taken national.  Following this, we as a group got together and discussed setting up Startup Ireland.  I will now focus on what Startup Ireland is doing and how it is making a real difference.  Put simply, Startup Ireland is working at a policy level, grassroots level and a cultural and educational level.  We are reconciled to the fact that this is going to be a long-term commitment.  As stated by Brad Feld, creating culture change is a commitment that will take approximately ten years.<\/p><p> At a policy level, I spoke at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis in February where I made the point that we must take start-ups seriously and put them at the centre of our economic policy.  I will speak at any Ard-Fheis on the topic of start-ups.  I am happy to put the case for start-ups anywhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014070800009#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404826200,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I presume there is no charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014070800010#J00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404826200,"counter":134,"content":"<p>There is no charge.  We also attended the launched of the Action Plan for Jobs, which, courtesy of Mr. Karl Aherne, took place at Wayra, and discussed with the Ministers of State who attended on the day our action plan for change.  Last week, we received the good news that we have been accepted as a full member of Startup Nations.  This means Startup Ireland is now in the same league as Startup Chile, Startup Malaysia, Startup Australia, Startup Canada and so on.  We are also preparing a pre-budget submission to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on behalf of the start-up community.<br \/>I will now speak about what we are doing on the grassroots side.  Without the grassroots side, this is not a sincere movement.  We have been extremely careful to pay full attention to the grassroots side.  We have linked in a group which now has 4,000 members actively exchanging information and networking about start-ups activity and programmes.  We have 7,500 Twitter followers on our account.  In terms of our social media footprint, we are leveraging it to the benefit of the community.  For example, highlighted in red on the slide now showing is an awareness-raising campaign which we ran for the NDRC female founders programme.  We helped spread the word about it across that big social media network.  We also took on board a lesson from the entrepreneurship forum report, that the network in Ireland needs to become much more dense and integrated.  As noted from the slide, we have set up a site for each of our key cities.  What we try to do is put ourselves in the mind of somebody who has just arrived in a city and wants to establish a start-up or get something off the ground.  We have infographics and network on each city site and a guide to tech events.  In terms of Dublin, this is provided thanks to Russell Banks.<br \/>In terms of our activity, at a cultural and educational level, I recently spoke at Google's first ever conference in Dublin.  My goal in that discussion was to bring on side the really important corporate venturing side.  There are many multinationals located in Dublin but we do not have their corporate venturing business.  My focus during my speech on that occasion was how we can become a global hub with the corporate accelerators playing a major part in that.  Also on the cultural side, we are organising the first ever entrepreneur careers day in November of this year in conjunction with Global Entrepreneurship Week.  My attitude is if lawyers and accountants can have a careers day, so too can entrepreneurs.<br \/>On our vision, a number of us attended a workshop convened as part of the activating Dublin initiative at which Mr. Moran posed the question of where the vision is for the tech start-up community.  There is a lot of great activity and so on but there is no uniting vision.  We then decided to examine a number of vision-led projects from the past, including the IFSC.  I am sure members will recall that in the 1980s the IFSC was a derelict site and an idea.  Today, it contributes more than &euro;2 billion annually to the Exchequer.  In the late 1990s the IDA had a visionary strategy of attracting the main data centres to Ireland.  In terms of my own former business, Novara Technology Limited, I was delighted because this meant we had top quality data centre facilities which were better than those in most other countries in Europe.  As a result of that strategy in the early 1990s, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and so on have invested hundreds of millions of euro in their data centres located here.  They have also located their cloud centres for Europe here.  We are now in a situation whereby data centre capacity <i>per capita<\/i>is one of the highest in Europe.  This came about through that strategy.<br \/>We then went back to the drawing board and looked at the possible scale for this in terms of the activating Dublin initiative.  In other words, what does wanting to make Dublin a leading global start-up centre look like?  Our vision for Dublin starts at culture level, where we want to scale-up the collaborative activity of connecting students and people in middle management who want to do a project with a start-up or internship in a start-up.  We want to get the basics at this level right.  Also, if Startup Tel Aviv and Boston MassChallenge can have international competition, we should leverage The Gathering, which is an amazing international network, and establish the Startup Gathering, thus leveraging the 60 million Irish diaspora worldwide to make a real input into Ireland a global tech hub.<br \/>In terms of infrastructure, we are chronically short of hotdesking and incubation space for start-ups in Dublin.  This must be a major part of the vision.  In terms of accelerators, there is a strong tangible impact from vertical accelerators, which can accelerate and scale-up start-ups.<\/p> <p>Why not be the accelerator capital of Europe and set that as a goal by 2020?  It is highly achievable.  That will feed into a much bigger pipeline of high potential start-ups for Enterprise Ireland, which is in all our interests.  There was an evaluation carried out by Forf&aacute;s of supports for entrepreneurship in Ireland and it indicated that due to the success of the high potential start-up unit, there is an opportunity to scale up considerably the number of start-ups.<br \/>Members may be interested in hearing about Dublin and we see it as the cockpit of Ireland but we already have activities and operations elsewhere.  I was in Cork a number of weeks ago meeting some of the start-up community members, and there are start-up champions in Limerick, Galway and Belfast, where I did my masters degree.  This is an all-Ireland initiative, and any of the gains made for Dublin will be shared with the other start-up ecosystems.  Clusters must represent regional advantages and resources so there is no reason we could not have really strong and world-beating discrete clusters for food, medical services, ICT, energy and bio-farming working in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland's existing strategies and frameworks.<br \/>We have been very upbeat so far, although we have spoken of the challenges for Dublin, even aside from those in hurling.  Nevertheless, some people in our community feel the battle has already been lost, as things are being fixed when they have gone wrong.  Some people make the case we are a satellite of London and have become part of London's so-called tech city pipeline.  This argument has some merit when we consider the statistics.  An analysis by the Startup Europe Partnership considered the start-ups which secured an investment of &euro;1 million or more in the past three years, and of the total in Europe, London has 26% of those scaled up, with Berlin having 16% and Dublin having 6%.  The downside is that when there are successfully scaling start-ups, it attracts venture capitalists.  We have discussed how one of the challenges is the round of &euro;2 million to &euro;5 million.  Those venture capitalists are attracted to the likes of London and Berlin.  They include Balderton Capital, DFJ Esprit and the big players attracted to the big centres.  As identified by the Startup Europe Partnership, a significant number of successful start-ups end up transferring their headquarters - not intellectual property activities - to either London or north America.<br \/>Considering the density of corporate-backed accelerators in London, there will be a challenge that we should tackle head on.  London is similar to Tel Aviv as it has big players like Google Campus, Microsoft Ventures, Startup Bootcamp, Seedcamp etc.  One can look at the output of just one of these centres in London, such as Google Campus, which in 2013 alone saw 70,000 people attend events, with &euro;34 million raised by start-ups involved in the campus.  Campus members from 61 countries around the world visited that location, so it is a magnet for attracting people around the planet.  Females make up 20% of campus members in London, compared with an industry average of 11%.  The man in Israel argues that Google Campus in Israel is an amazing engine of growth for start-ups.<br \/>With regard to my goal, my son Cillian is seven months old and this is a battle I want to win.  I am very personally motivated to make Dublin a global tech start-up hub.  By the time Cillian sits down with his career guidance teacher, I want a career in entrepreneurship to be the number one choice rather than legal or accountancy jobs.  They are great professions but if we are to bring the next generation of growth through, we need to encourage start-up activity.  There must be a well-integrated system of support so Cillian should not have to move to Silicon Valley or London unless he absolutely wants to.<br \/>We are probably aware that all our cities are very much silo-oriented, with much good stuff going on but never the twain shall meet.  The issues are quite fragmented.  To address this, Startup Ireland, beginning with Dublin, is going to convene a meeting of the key pillars in each sector of the start-up ecosystem and get decision makers together on one day in one room.  We should come up with co-ordinated strategic visions for each city, starting with Dublin.  We invite the committee members to Google on 10 October, where the session will be facilitated by Mr. Sean O'Sullivan who addressed the committee in February.  He is the chairman of the Entrepreneurship Forum report.  It will also involve Mr. John Moran, the chairman of Activating Dublin, and we are absolutely delighted to have Mr. Brad Feld, the guru of how to build a successful start-up community.  Our goal is to create a single shared strategy for Dublin.<br \/>The message we want to air is that we should forget about the excessive focus on our corporate tax rate or on us recovering from recession.  Let us change the international discourse about the country and send a message to the world that this is a land of opportunity for start-ups who want to take on the world.  This is a realistic message.  <i>Forbes<\/i>has found Ireland the best country in the world to start a business and <i>The Wall Street Journal<\/i>has found that we top the European average for venture capital funds raised.  According to the World Bank, we are 15th in the world from 185 countries for ease of doing business.  We have nine of the top global software companies located in our country and we have three of the top accelerators located here.  It is a realistic ask.  Our goal is to make Ireland, as an initial point, a global tech start-up hub and we ask the committee to join us on 10 October.  We also ask the committee's support in our vision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014070800010#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Costello","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404826800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I cannot add much to that very worthwhile presentation.

Previously, most corporate innovation took place within a business but it has been realised that this does not solve the innovation gap.  Corporate venturing units have been created to almost buy innovation and invest in start-ups.  That has mostly taken place in the US, which is currently the home of most of those large corporations.  We can tap into the great resource which the IDA has developed for us through foreign direct investment and a large number of these US corporations are now setting up in Ireland.  It is the destination of choice to enter Europe and we can now build an ecosystem where those corporations can bring corporate venturing arms into Ireland.  It is a second wave that will take place but we need to create the environment to make it happen.<\/p><p>  This environment must incorporate three different areas, with one around incentivising corporations to bring the corporate venturing arms into Ireland.<\/p> <p>There can be passive and active incentives.  One such incentive could be the benefit they garner from our corporation tax rate.  Perhaps we should consider encouraging them to use a very small percentage of that benefit to reinvest in corporate venturing in Ireland.  It could take the form of setting up their own accelerator, investing in an existing accelerator or directly investing in start-ups in which they were interested.  It would help them in filling their innovation gap and also be a very good CSR activity for them in their relationship with Ireland.  It could also deflect from what could be perceived as a low corporation tax rate.<\/p><p> There are two other areas on which we must focus to drive it.  One is regarding the founders of start-ups.  It is critical that we do not punish failure, as we do at present.  We do it through income tax rates and the lack of tax credits.  As we have assisted farming, artists and stud farms, perhaps we might consider assisting entrepreneurs.<\/p><p> The third piece relates to investors.  As Mr. Costello correctly said, there is a large swell of professional investment firms that are creating significant funds for investment in early stage companies, but what we are missing in Ireland are the incentives for angel investors.  We are not creating the right environment for angel investment.  In the United Kingdom, for example, there are the enterprise investment scheme, EIS, and the seed enterprise investment scheme, SEIS, whereby one has downside protection from an investment.  If one's investment loses money, one can write off the loss against one's income tax to a maximum figure of &pound;150,000.  This is driving a huge amount of investment for seed and early stage companies.  The investment available drives more founders into creating their businesses.  One then ends up with corporate venturing tagging onto it to create the great synergy between the three.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014070800011#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Karl Aherne","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404827400,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Blanchfield to respond to Deputy Dara Calleary's question on the obstacles encountered in terms of tax and the disincentives to embarking on entrepreneurship.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014070800012#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Costello"},{"type":"speech","time":1404827400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Mr. Aherne touched on something.

There are obstacles in the tax code facing entrepreneurs that are probably accidental.  There is a different image of an entrepreneur in mind, not a struggling 20-something year old putting in all of his or her savings and possibly the next ten years of his or her family life on the line.  For example, entrepreneurs do not benefit from a PAYE tax credit, which is explicitly taken away.  That is something one might do to explicitly discourage entrepreneurship, but that is the current position.  Entrepreneurs do not benefit from any protection in being able to benefit from social welfare if their venture fails.  That is explicitly taken away.  With regard to capital gains tax, CGT, in several budgets in a row, with the exception of the last one, capital gains tax was increased.  For an entrepreneur or an angel investor, that is the end game.  That is specifically how one pays oneself, apart from the baseline salary one takes from one's business.  These successive increases, although I am sure they were not aimed at entrepreneurs, directly disincentivised entrepreneurs.<\/p><p>  In many of these cases there is low hanging fruit that could easily be addressed.  The problem is that, as entrepreneurs, we are terrible at making our voices heard in terms of policy.  It is because we are working in very small teams with no time or money.  We do not have time to engage.  From my point of view, that is what Startup Ireland is about - creating the channel in order that even the low hanging fruit policies that could be put in place to dramatically support start-ups could be communicated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014070800012#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Blanchfield"},{"type":"speech","time":1404827400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates.  This is a very interesting discussion.  Coincidentally, I have just returned from Tel Aviv.  I was there with a European mission for growth.  As I had wanted to visit Tel Aviv for some time, when the opportunity was presented to the committee, I had my hand up first.  The delegates are very familiar with the work we are doing in Cork with the Cork Foundation and in trying to obtain funding and so forth.  There is some interesting information on Tel Aviv.  The average age is 29 years and all males spend three years in the army, while the females spend two years in it.  They then spend half a year travelling and one year working before they start college.  There is, therefore, a very positive attitude towards taking a chance.  There are also incubation centres, some of them in the basements of libraries.  They are not high end, simply places where people are collaborating together.  From what I saw, they are all ages, not just young people.  There were people there in their fifties and sixties.  It was not the image we had of young college students.<\/p><p>  I met many interesting people, but one guy had an elevator programme which I thought was good.  I understand Telefonica has something similar here, whereby it has a five month intensive incubation programme.  The guy told me that the hardest thing was to obtain accreditation and seek distribution for young start-ups to get to the next stage.  He is obviously a mediator between the source of venture capital and the start-up.  He more or less incubates them and everybody receives a share; therefore, everybody wins and it is very clean.<\/p><p>  The other area includes the universities.  As every university has a company, if one wishes to have research conducted, the university takes a share, but it is very clean and up-front.  The figure might be 2% or 5% and if the research or product turns into a Google, everybody benefits.  In Ireland, on the other hand, different universities have different policies and it seems to take forever to move forward.  It can take 18 months to almost three years to get a product through the system.  We must definitely change this.<\/p><p>  I do not know if the delegates have encountered Mr. Andrew Lynch.  He is working in a type of incubation centre that is working with multinationals and small companies in which they conduct research together.  Another blockage is funding.  Ireland is the only country in the OECD in which one cannot draw down European funding unless one is part of an education system.  One must go through a university to have money drawn down.  I understand we are changing this, but it is taking a long time.  It is a big issue for us, given that one of our great strengths is the multinational environment and small business.  All of the multinationals are outsourcing their research because it is far more effective than conducting it internally.  I do not know if the delegates have been to the Digital Hub in St. James's, but there are approximately 800 people working there in different companies.  We need more such places.  There have to be basements and libraries available-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014070800012#L00700","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404827400,"counter":147,"content":"<p>The National Asset Management Agency has plenty of space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014070800012#L00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Costello"},{"type":"speech","time":1404827400,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I had noted that.

My background is in accounting and I have done a lot of work with small businesses.  As an entrepreneur and as a small business, more allowances can be used.  Whether this is fair or unfair, it has been in place forever.  PRSI has changed and people can only get six months, even as a PAYE worker, and after that it is means tested.  People are entitled to social welfare payments after losing their businesses but the issue is that it is means-tested.  It is not means-tested, people are only entitled to six months.

It is muscle memory, which is what we lack in Ireland.  We take too much of an academic approach to a lot of the things we try to take on and not enough of the sport approach.

When I was building Novara technology in the front bedroom of my house or when we were building the family jewellery business, there were no similar programmes available.  Ireland, in terms of programmes and the availability of supports, is one of the best countries in the world in which to start a business.  However, there are obstacles and issues.  At the same time, there are amazing supports available.  The New Frontiers programme is a national brand and co-ordinated.  There is an increasingly dense network of connections evolving from it and it is a really good programme.<\/p><p>  The JobBridge programme that has emerged from An Action Plan for Jobs has been extremely good.  The great thing about it is that it comes back to learning by doing.  Instead of talking or learning academically about something, what it does is that it helps in giving people skills.  I know that there are cases in the media.  However, in my experience, working with the start-ups using our incubator and working with a number of JobBridge programme interns, it has been a fantastic way to give them the skills they need and to help us in delivering on more ambitious goals.

They see the opportunities in being here.<\/p><p>  Enterprise Ireland is helping.  It has a number of funding solutions for start-ups, from the competitive feasibility fund for female founders to the competitive start-up fund for early seed start-ups.  It has the follow-on high potential start-up fund which provides match funding of up to &euro;250,000.  It is certainly playing a role also.  <\/p><p>  On hotdesking, last year in Wayra we created a new area where we could house 20 to 25 new individuals who were creating businesses.  We do not charge for this.  We meet them and see if we are interested in their businesses.  They come and work for free; we do not charge them one penny.  Literally, within one month of opening, we were full.  The capacity was taken almost instantly.  The demand for hotdesking and access to a community and a network is crucial.  <\/p><p>  In Spain Telefonica has created a new business, Open Future.

They suddenly find that the rest of class are able to say to them that they can do it, and once they get confidence they can do a great deal.

With regard to incubation facilities, the model internationally in many locations is that they are privately funded, or if we really want to kick-start that space, we could look at it as a public-private funded vehicle.  It could be very much cost-neutral to the Exchequer.  In terms of incentivising accelerators, as Mr. Aherne identified, there are ideas such as attaching tax credits to work that a company does on a vertical accelerator, or having start-ups in the same building as the parent company so that there are casual conversations and chats, which gets over all the gatekeepers which typically stop a company from getting that corporate sale.  Dublin City Council could make the space rate-free for a number of years for the accelerator.  On the cost side, there would be the cost of the incentives; however, the benefits would include jobs, PAYE and other taxes.  Just look at the scale of what the IFSC has achieved.  Much of what we are talking about would be neutral at worst, but at best, we would see that it would have a substantial benefit to the Exchequer over time.

The draft regulations are before the committee by virtue of the procedural requirements of section 28 of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996 which provides that a draft of every regulation proposed to be made under the Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the proposed regulation shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.  The draft regulations in question are being made as part of a package of ten statutory instruments to give effect to the International Labour Organization&rsquo;s Maritime Labour Convention 2006, ratification of which was recently approved by the Government.  The other statutory instruments are being made by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport who has policy responsibility for the maritime sector.<br \/>The Maritime Labour Convention 2006 - hereafter referred to as the MLC - seeks to ensure the employment and social rights of seafarers on Irish ships are fully implemented.  Ireland was represented at the 2006 International Labour Conference, at which the MLC was negotiated, by a tripartite delegation consisting of Government officials, nominees of the employers &ndash; IBEC &ndash; and the workers &ndash; the ICTU.  I can confirm that both IBEC and the ICTU fully support Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the MLC.  Currently, the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) (Exclusion of Workers in the Fishing or Shipping Sectors) Regulations 1997, SI 1 of 1997, permit young persons, namely, those who have reached 16 years of age but who have not reached 18 years, to work at night in both the shipping and fishing sectors.  This is subject to the proviso that they are allowed equivalent compensatory rest time on the following day.  The Maritime Labour Convention which applies only to the shipping sector provides that young persons, those aged 16 and 17 years, working in the shipping sector cannot work at night, except for training purposes.  This provision of the MLC is being given effect in regulations being made by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport as part of the package of legislative measures to bring Irish law into compliance with the Maritime Labour Convention.  It is, therefore, necessary for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to make new regulations under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996 removing the existing permission regarding night work for young persons in the shipping sector but continuing the permission for young persons in the fishing sector to work at night.  In this respect, the draft regulations before the committee are purely technical as the rules governing when and how young persons in the shipping sector can work at night are set out in the aforementioned regulations being made by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.<\/p> <p>I confirm that the Minister has consulted the social partners and published notice of his intention to make these regulations in accordance with section 8 of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996.  I commend the draft regulations to the committee, as they will facilitate the introduction of the new rules governing night workers for young persons in the shipping sector which are required for Ireland to comply with the maritime labour convention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2014070800016#P01500","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404830400,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the presentation.

We sent in our written submission which, I understand, we are not to repeat.  I will, therefore, make some additional comments.<br \/>In October 1999 the Irish Seaweed Forum was established by the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.  In the seven months to May 2000 the forum, consisting of 17 individuals drawn from industry, academia and Government institutions, met on six occasions to consider its brief, which was to evaluate the current state of the seaweed industry, consult widely, investigate the potential of the industry and examine the barriers to development.  The final report which was published with 12 recommendations clearly identified research and development as the chief priority.<br \/>The forum specifically addressed the issue of harvesting and concluded:<blockquote>For a long time it has been considered that the legal status of harvesting ... was a serious problem for the development of the industry.  Through consultation with the Office of the Attorney General it has been found that legislation regarding this issue is much clearer than was previously perceived and is no longer thought to be a serious barrier to development.<\/blockquote>In the more recent past a number of companies, including Brandon Products Limited, have made serious efforts to invest in research and development and seen their businesses grow as a result.  The State, through Enterprise Ireland, with the European Union, through various initiatives, including the FP7 framework, has assisted this research and development effort.<br \/>The science behind the products being produced by companies in the sector has been the primary driver of growth.  In the case of Brandon Products Limited, we have trebled our sales in the past six years by focusing on improving our scientific understanding of how seaweed works and how to translate this into higher performance products.  As we continue to invest in research into the potential of seaweed, we increase the valued added.  When taken in conjunction with other demand-related factors, the interest in the seaweed resource faces levels of demand not previously seen.  The harvesting process which, to date, has been primarily undertaken by individuals will come under increasing pressure and there is a risk of damage to the resource by short-sighted harvesting malpractice.  To ensure this risk does not manifest, the need to regulate the sector for harvesting is important.  Harvesting has been self-regulated for generations and in the past 70 years, in particular, there has been an adequate resource to meet the various demands.  Unfortunately, for many of these years the resource has simply been harvested and dried, with the main added value being generated by processors and users outside the State.  Since 2000 when the forum reported, the proportion of the resource being processed with additional economic benefit to the economy has grown steadily, mainly due to the research and development effort mentioned.<br \/>It is clear that the growth of the sector is research and development dependent.  Whereas I agree with the potential &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta sees in the sector, as reported in the January 2014 Joint Sub-Committee on Fisheries report, I disagree with its assertion that regulation of harvesting is the key.  To me, it is clearly research and development.  Harvesting needs regulation to ensure the increased demand is not met by reckless harvesting, but harvesting is not the obstacle to development.  In fact, restricting access to the resource and allowing any commercial entity to exert significant control over the resource could become the single biggest obstacle to the development of the sector.<br \/>Looking at how the sector is managed and developed in other jurisdictions is always a good starting point.  It is not to slavishly follow one model but to truly understand the good and bad points of each and pick the best to make Ireland the role model for others to follow.  Let us learn from the mistakes of others, not simply repeat them.  To develop a strong sector, we need several strong companies.  Imagine what would have happened in the dairy sector if we had started out with only one dominant company that controlled the grasslands and thereby stifled competition.  Consolidation may well happen in time when the better companies emerge, but the starting point must be having several strong companies, ideally with different strategies.  To realise the potential of the sector, we must continue to encourage research and development and value-added processing within Ireland.  To protect the sector and the resource, we need to regulate and lay down guidance on best practice on its management and use.<br \/>In the committee's consideration of these issue it should bear in mind the big picture of what we want to achieve and ensure we give equal status to all of the factors that can impact on the establishment, growth and sustainability of this emerging sector.  My company's submission contains a number of specific recommendations that it believes would balance the competing needs and develop a world-class sector that would work for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Mullins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404824400,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to address it.  It is a great opportunity for the seaweed sector to use this forum to address the current issues in the licensing and harvesting of seaweed.<\/p><p>  It is important for me to highlight the methods we at Carraig Fhada Seaweed use to harvest seaweed.  We harvest the majority of it for food, but we also harvest it for the cosmetic market.  To ensure our seaweed is only of the finest quality, we hand-harvest everything.  Correct harvesting techniques eliminate further work during the drying and packaging processes and ensure the seaweed is harvested in a sustainable and ecological manner.  Our experience during the years has helped us to identify prime harvesting areas and we have found correct management of these areas yields a better quality harvest, year on year.  We do not harvest in a linear manner but in a patchwork style which eliminates the possibility of the rocks being stripped bare and ensures adequate seaweed cover for the aquatic life on the foreshore.<\/p><p>  Our business is all about sustainability and managing our resource became of paramount importance to the success of the business.  We obtained our first seaweed harvesting licence in 1995 which allowed us to hand-harvest seaweed along the coast of west Sligo and we maintained a licence up to last year.  We have never had issues in renewing the licence.  An application to renew it was submitted to the foreshore unit in Wexford over 12 months ago and to this day we are still awaiting a decision on it.  We were asked for further information which was provided.<\/p> <p>Experts and engineers were examining it, which is reasonable enough, yet 13 months down the line there are still no answers.  Repeated attempts to determine the progress of the application proved fruitless.<\/p><p> It must be noted that it is not a new application; it is simply a renewal of a previous licence.  There was nothing new in the application.  I am not aware of the issues that might delay the application but I question the complete lack of transparency employed by the foreshore unit up to this point.  Again, one must ask the question why the licence was continuously granted up to last year and now there is a delay in processing and issuing the licence.  The licence is the backbone of the business.  Effectively, we are breaking the law if we harvest seaweed but that is our livelihood so we must do it.<\/p><p> Due to the apparent lack of regulation within the industry our business is constantly under threat from individuals who harvest seaweed during the summer and sell it for a quick buck at fairs and markets.  There is no restriction on their harvesting seaweed and there is no accountability.  I pay VAT, tax and rates.  I conform with the regulations set out by the HSE for my business but I cannot compete with a cash economy.  Turnover takes a dramatic fall during the summer months.  Last summer was a prime example.  August was the quietest month of the year, down almost 40% on July, and July was by no means a busy month compared to previous months.<\/p><p> There needs to be reform in the way the licensing of seaweed harvesting is carried out.  No one individual or company should have the exclusive rights to the foreshore or any section of the foreshore.  It belongs to everybody and should be managed accordingly.  We need to take a number of steps.  First, we need transparency from the Department as to why there is a delay in the issue of licences.  Second, we need immediate reform in the licensing process to prevent over-harvesting and illegal harvesting of this natural resource.<\/p><p> Finally, what we have is a natural, renewable resource.  We are on the edge of Europe.  Most of the coast is unspoiled in any way.  What we have is probably the envy of most of Europe.  We have pristine, prime waters.  If we as an industry can develop the resource to its full potential without destroying it, we can leave a legacy for many generations to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800003#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Melvin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404825000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I am Miche&aacute;l Quinn from MB Quinn and Sons.  We are located in Ballyhaunis, County Mayo.  We are new entrants into the seaweed business.  We are in operation approximately 12 months.  Before that we manufactured wood shavings and sawdust and due to the downturn in the economy we found margins getting tighter.  At that stage we had 14 full-time employees and we had to reduce staff numbers to five.  We had machinery repayment commitments and we had to make a decision on what to do with our drying equipment.  We set about looking at various options.  We made a cautious decision to invest in more machinery to dry seaweed.  We set about the change and in the past six months we have taken orders from companies in Asia and Europe.  At the moment we employ ten full-time employees.  We have ambitions and plans to grow our staff up to somewhere between 20 and 22 people in the next 18 months.  We have orders of the magnitude of 3,500 tonnes of dried Ascophyllum at the moment.  I have no gripe with Acadian Seaplants Limited buying Arramara Teoranta, and I wish it the best of luck, but my main concern is that we have people harvesting seaweed for us from north Donegal down as far as south Clare and if the option was swept from under our feet our company would be out of business and we would lose 20 employees.  In the past 18 months we have invested &euro;1.2 million in our plant without aid from anyone.  The proposed change would be a total disaster for us.  I have no problem with a licence being granted but it should remain with the people on the shore.  Some of the documents outline that the licence is needed for the preservation of the seaweed but the people of Ireland have been harvesting seaweed for generations.  If one looks back to 1947 when Arramara Teoranta was set up, if the people on the shore were not able to look after seaweed in a proper way there would not be any seaweed there today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800004#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Miche&aacute;l Quinn"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404825000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting Ocean Harvest Technology to discuss the licensing and harvesting of seaweed.  Although as a company we are not completely reliant on locally harvested seaweed, Ocean Harvest Technology currently provides seaweed-based feed ingredients for a number of applications.  Some of the seaweeds used are obtained from local harvesters who are in turn monitored by our sustainable management plan.  The plan takes into account harvesting estimates, pollution, specific techniques and our sustainable annual yield.<\/p><p>  Ocean Harvest Technology applied for a foreshore licence in 2011 to harvest small quantities of various seaweed species in a sustainable manner, excluding the commonly harvested brown seaweed, Ascophyllum nodosum.  Unfortunately, at this stage and after three years we have still not obtained the licence.<\/p><p>  Moving forward, we feel that Irish seaweed is a great resource and should be used for the benefit of Irish people.  Therefore, any licensing protocols must provide a maximum benefit for the Irish economy.  However, they must also facilitate the wishes of local harvesters who have been harvesting seaweed for more than two decades.  This will most likely require collaboration between industry and universities but also adequate regulation and enforcement.

We made a detailed submission and we ask all members to take time out to read it.  We have five minutes to make a case today but the majority of the detail is in the submission.<\/p><p>  BioAtlantis commenced business in 2004.  It commissioned its production facility in 2007 and got into the market at that point.  Since then, we have grown at an average annual rate of 45%, which by any standards is decent.  We plan to grow at 25% per annum going forward.  Our spend in the Irish economy in 2013 was &euro;2.9 million and our spend in 204 will be much greater.  That is normal business practice.<\/p><p>  Our primary resource and raw material is Ascophyllum nodosum seaweed.  Having control of that raw material is critical to us and to the future of our industry.  What we want is that companies should not be allowed to monopolise the resource.  A maximum of 25% of the total resource should be allowed to any one processor.  Licences should only be granted to responsible processors.  They should be granted on an exclusive basis for specific areas.<\/p> <p>Preference should be given to companies that add value to the seaweed resource.  The committee should investigate the role of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in the sale of Arramara.  It was a State asset and I feel there are questions to be answered.<\/p><p> A monopoly over the ascophyllum resource in Ireland should not be allowed happen.  That will have effects on harvesters.  An application for a licence has been submitted covering the area from Clare to north Mayo for 40,000 tonnes.  There is approximately 59,000 tonnes in that area.  So Acadian and Arramara will be allowed to pick and choose which harvesters they want to work with, which should not be allowed.  Acadian is our major competitor worldwide.  Following the decision by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s, Acadian controls our raw material supply, which should not be allowed.<\/p><p> BioAtlantis plans to grow at 25% per annum.  While that sounds ambitious, we have already done that over the past seven years.  In this year we have grown by 25% in the first six months.  The Kerry Group had a target to double in size every five years.  I spent most of the 1990s working in the Kerry Group so I know what has to be done.  I know where we have to go and we have put the foundations in place.<\/p><p> Licenses must be granted to responsible processors only.  This will ensure the environment is protected; overharvesting will not occur; SAC and SPAs, where the majority of the seaweed grows, will be fully protected; full traceability will be available; and ease of monitoring by the Department.<\/p><p> There are problems with unregulated harvesting.  There are specific examples in Clew Bay where all the holdfast was taken out.  That means it may not grow anymore.  It is vital to be responsible.<\/p><p> Licences are granted on an exclusive basis for specific areas.  If licences are not granted for specific areas it will result in confusion, a lack of clarity and a lack of responsibility leading to blame game, with people saying, \"He did it; it's not our fault\".  There also needs to be knowledge of specific requirements for each SAC and SPA.<\/p><p> We have applied for a harvesting licence for 12,500 tonnes in Clew Bay.  We have to take account of all the islands in the bay.  We have quantified the resource on all those islands.  Some of them are already overharvested meaning that we must not harvest them for the next two to three years.  We have had to take account of the seals.  The mudflats were omitted from the plan; we will not be harvesting in the area around the mudflats.  We will also omit areas where the seals are moulting or breeding or do so only at specific times of the year.  This has to be done properly.  The birds have to be protected.  Account has to be taken of a resting site for birds and those areas are omitted at certain times of year.<\/p><p> Preference should be given to companies that add value.  We have invested in research and IP.  We have three patents.  We have invested in equipment and in complex processes and formulations.  We have put in place the basis for a high-growth company.  The resource is a serious asset to us.  It is not coming in and out.  It is our livelihood and we will cherish it because it is our lifeblood.<\/p><p> Arramara, which wants rights from Clare to north Mayo, including Belmullet, is only drying seaweed.  It is adding a small amount of value, but it does not add high value.  Why should it be allowed to control that area?<\/p><p> BioAtlantis plans to protect stakeholders in Clew Bay, including the processors and harvesters.  We are looking at 20 full-time jobs or 40 part-time jobs.  Some people might prefer to work at certain times of the year and work on the farm or wherever for other times of the year.  We can go either way.  We have the resource.  We have to have a strong development plan and we have put that in place.  We have to take care of the environment as it represents our future.  We have to take care of the SACs and SPAs.  This is regulated by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, but it does not have a free handle here.  Europe is looking down on us.  If it is not done properly Europe will intervene and prevent it from happening.  Tere are already fines from Europe because of breaches.<\/p><p> In Clew Bay hand-harvesting can continue in a traditional way with 20 full-time or 40 part-time jobs.  We plan to take out some of the hardship related to hand-harvesting.  No one would say this is an easy job.  The majority of people are interested now because the economy went belly up in 2007.  The traditional harvesters may not exist and some of the hardship must be removed from them.<\/p><p> We compared the traditional methods used in Ireland with processes in other countries for use in Clew Bay.  We asked if it made sense to use the rake system used Canada where harvesters work on barges.  It looks lovely and is interesting.  However, the majority of Clew Bay SAC is made up of small pebbles.  Seaweed would grow on a person's fist.  When harvesting small pebbles with a rake, once picked up the whole thing is gone.  Acadian has allowed for 6% mortality in Canada.  In Clew a maximum mortality of 1% will be allowed.  We need to focus on the fucus.<\/p><p> I will outline the benefits of licensing BioAtlantis in Clew Bay.  A monopoly of the resource is avoided.  A license is granted to a responsible processor.  BioAtlantis will take care of the resource.  The harvesting methodology will remove much of the hardship from the harvesters because we are using a collection vessel, which allows more time for cutting and ensures there is full traceability.  There will be a full plan over the quality because one can see whether stones or fucus is brought in.  It provides a huge opportunity to control.  We have 20 full-time jobs or 40 part-time jobs.  It will allow us to continue on our strong growth trajectory.<\/p><p> The final slide contains our recommendations which I initially asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800004#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404825600,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I will give everyone six minutes.

This is a very interesting debate and one that is very topical in the west of Ireland.  It clearly also affects the north, south and south west also.  It is a complicated issue.  The role of the harvester was only mentioned once or twice.  Looking from the outside it might be asked if it would make more sense to set up some kind of independent organisation representing the harvesters, which could then negotiate with the rest of the companies in the field for whatever price is necessary to sell the raw material to any of the companies represented here so that they would have more of a say over how the raw material is utilised.<\/p><p>  There are a number of issues here, including the exclusive rights in an area.  In my area of Connemara there is a traditional right called the striping of the seaweed and the shoreline although there is a question over the legality of that.  There is a kind of common law understanding that people would have a certain stripe on the foreshore that they cut and they do not go into other people's stripes for love or money.  Where are the traditional rights of the seaweed cutters being held in that regard?<\/p> <p>Questions have been raised about the sale of Arramara Teoranta by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The BioAtlantis deputation stated there were questions to be answered.  I am keen to find out which ones should be answered.  What are the issues Bioatlantis, as an industry player, believes should be raised?<br \/>If an exclusive licence is granted, surely it keeps potential new players out of the market.  What would happen if, for example, a co-operative in Carraroe decided to set up a venture and do something with seaweed?  If some of the other companies involved, whether it be BioAtlantis, Acadian or any other player in it, have cornered the market and have licences covering the entire foreshore, where is the space for new companies to come in?  Surely provision would have to be made for this in any new legislation.<br \/>There is an argument to be made about the technology being used to cut seaweed.  My ancestors cut seaweed using the hand harvesting style.  The BioAtlantis deputation suggested that if a licence was granted to Acadian from County Clare to Belmullet, damage could be done if the company used the technology it was using in Canada.  We have been told that Irish shoreline is similar to that in Canada.  What damage could potentially be done?  BioAtlantis stated there was an argument to be made <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>&Uacute;dar&aacute;s maintaining there was a need for regulation to manage the foreshore.  BioAtlantis disagrees and has suggested that potentially no management system is required.  Who should manage the issue of sustainability?  Is there a role for the likes of Foras na Mara?  Surely there should be some independent oversight, rather than leaving it in the hands of any number of companies with licences.  If there is to be regulation, it should take the form of independent regulation, rather than leaving it to the stakeholders who own the licences.  We have got into trouble in other areas in Ireland during the years and I question whether we should go that way.<br \/>I gather the harvesters maintain that it might be better to go down the route of their setting up a co-operative or other organisation to represent their rights, almost like a fair trade scenario.  We have seen this happen in the case of coffee bean growers and other companies throughout the world.  They believe the cake is being carved up by the companies and that their rights are being excluded.  What is the view of the deputations on such a scenario?<br \/>There was a meeting recently between Oireachtas representatives from County Galway and the Minister which several people in attendance at the committee today attended.  My understanding is that no complaint has been made as of yet by the European Commission's directorate for the environment and that the licensing regime is being brought forward as a precautionary measure to pre-empt potential problems in this area.  Do the deputations have views on this?  Are there examples of complaints made against individuals harvesting along the coastline?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800005#E00500","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404826200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>Are those questions directed towards BioAtlantis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800006#F00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1404826200,"counter":244,"content":"<p>They are directed towards all of the industry players, although they may not wish to answer all of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800006#F00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1404826200,"counter":245,"content":"<p>I want to avoid duplication.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800006#F00400","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404826200,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I will try to get through the answers as quickly as possible.  <\/p><p>  Having co-operatives is a good idea.  The only issue is if there would be a co-operative with control of seaweed, but there are other companies involved also.  We are trying to add value.  We have a five or a ten year plan.  Let us suppose a co-operative sells the product at a given price for the next five years and someone else then comes in and decides to double the price.  That is a question to be asked because the new player might have an alternative use and suddenly decide that the co-operative was out of the business.  There are pros and cons.  Are the co-operatives willing to put money into this industry, to invest money in resources and people who know how the environment should be protected, etc?<\/p><p>  Another question was related to Clew Bay and the technology used.  I am not saying the use of rake methods is wrong.  All I am saying is that they may not be suitable in the area.  We examined the issue in the case of Clew Bay and determined they were not suitable.  The rest of Connemara and Clare may be perfect for the use of rake methods.<\/p><p>  There was a question about having an independent body.  I agree totally with the idea of having an independent body, rather than the industry running things on its own.  We have seen what has happened in the beef industry, etc.  It should not do it.  As the chief executive of a processor, I take the view that there is no issue with having an independent body.  However, if there were three or four processors, one would very easily figure out which were cowboys and which were genuine operators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800006#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404826200,"counter":247,"content":"<p>As a processing company, it is our view that if the licence was to be granted to one commercial identity, it would completely eliminate our business.

One of the risks in a co-operative type system is that it would simply sell to the highest bidder, which could be a Chinese company seeking raw material to be processed in China.  That would not be in our interests as a country or an economy.  We should stand back a little.  All of the details relating to whether a harvesting co-operative or a company would be preferable should be considered as part of the bigger picture in terms of what we want to achieve.  We want to achieve the maximisation of the resource for the economy.  We want to achieve long-term sustainability and ensure the resource is not damaged by over-harvesting or incorrect harvesting.

When I read the law I presumed the sale of State assets would be advertised publicly.  As it is not specifically laid out that it should be so advertised, legally, the company is right but, morally, it is totally and utterly wrong.  The two companies &Uacute;dar&aacute;s picked out were Setalg in France and Acadian in Canada.  Setalg is part of the Roullier group which was fined &euro;60 million in 2011 for running a cartel.  It was the first choice of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s.  Acadian has engaged in highly unethical advertising campaigns against Irish companies.  I have mentioned this previously.  The evidence is available and the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  <\/p><p>  There is a third aspect with which I have an issue.<\/p> <p>We were not allowed into the sales process initially; we had to battle to get into it.  One of the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s personnel demanded &euro;2 million in funding before we would be allowed in.  We got past that hurdle and then we had 12 days to prepare a submission.  Setalg and Acadian had over a year, if not two or three years, to prepare their submission; we got 12 days.<\/p><p> We were told when we met &Uacute;dar&aacute;s that the up-front price was not relevant - that it was secondary.  The most important aspect was the plan.  We took their guidance.  If we had been buying it and it did not matter what we were doing with it afterwards, we would have put in an up-front price, but we concentrated on the post-development plan, which was to double the size of Arramara.  That included driers, an indirect heating system, and research on the animal feed business to bring it up the value chain.  We bid &euro;1.5 million for the up-front price, with &euro;4.2 million in the post-investment phase,  bringing it up to a total of &euro;5.7 million.  As far as I am aware, Acadian bid &euro;1.8 million - I have no idea of the post-investment process - and Setalg bid &euro;2 million.  <\/p><p> As far as I am aware, when the final bids were in the rating was changed.  A rating of 3 was given to the up-front bids and a rating of 1 given to the rest.  We have never seen the three bids.  I have spoken to Ministers.  I have written to both the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy McGinley and Deputy Deenihan, yet I have not got any information on the bids for each of the places.  The lack of transparency, and the lack of patriotism, were frightening.  It made me disillusioned with the Irish language, with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, and with our political system.  This is our first opportunity to speak in public.  We could have gone to the newspapers but we decided it was more ethical to work through the system.  We were wasting our time.

These companies manufacture, employ, support local enterprise and contribute financially to this country through taxation, and the sale of companies that have been heavily subsidised by the Irish taxpayer to foreign businesses is a worrying trend.  More worrying is the access these companies demand to an Irish resource without expense or a contribution to the Irish tax system.  Future growth relies upon continued secure access to this renewable resource.  Local companies I know have harvested in the same areas for the past 15 years and have been able to demonstrate an ability to avoid doing damage and maintain the integrity of the biomass over the years.  My concern is that foreign companies might not have the same vested interest in protecting the future viability of Irish resources.  Mr. Melvin might comment on those concerns.<\/p><p>  There is deep uncertainty about the granting of harvesting licences, and the term of the licences means that some of these local companies are unable to seek investment.  If someone is waiting six, eight or 12 months for a licence it can cause difficulties in terms of seeking funding or additional investment from lending institutions.  Some of these companies may be unable to seek investment as investors are concerned that they have no long-term guaranteed access to seaweed resources.<\/p><p>  It is vitally important that this committee listens to what the witnesses have said and proceeds with the recommendations.  Would Mr. Melvin agree that the granting of long-term licences with conditions would allow these local companies to secure future commercial investment and allow them expand their businesses?  He mentioned that there are 40 people employed in his company.  I know that during the summer it employs quite a number of people on both a part-time and a full-time basis.  Voya employs approximately 40 people.  These companies are very concerned.  Without security of access to the raw material, does Mr. Melvin agree that it represents too much of a risk for potential investors?  A local company harvesting less than 25% of the available biomass in the granted area needs access to a greater number of areas to ensure that delicate balances are achieved.<\/p><p>  This committee should recommend that companies involved in the seaweed harvesting business that have a proven track record in corporate governance and a high level of regard for the environment should be considered as a consultative body with regard to future legislative moves in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800007#G00600","speaker":"1082"},{"type":"speech","time":1404826800,"counter":258,"content":"<p>I have been called to another meeting which I have to attend.

Perhaps the Mr. O'Sullivan would elaborate on the company's understanding of that arrangement, whether any work has been done in terms of finalising that arrangement and whether that condition has been included in the terms of the sale.<\/p><p>  I would welcome a comment from each witness on the reason processors, as opposed to individuals who have been traditionally harvesting, should be granted licences to harvest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800008#H00200","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404827400,"counter":268,"content":"<p>On the first issue regarding the harvesting rights, my only issue in that regard is that most areas from County Clare to County Mayo are special areas of conservation.  In 2013, I received notification that the sale of Arramara Teoranta had gone through, with which I had an issue.  We now have no control over whether we will be supplied.  We spent almost eight months preparing our submission to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Dr. Kieran Guinan worked full time on that project with Ecofact Environmental Consultants Limited.  This is about more than just seaweed.  Birds and seals must be taken into account.  Much of what happens is no longer in the control of the Irish people.  Unfortunately, these decisions are made by Europe.  In regard to whether an individual harvester should be allowed to harvest, while I have no objection to that, I find it difficult to believe that it will be possible for everybody to do so.  It will also be virtually impossible to validate and monitor.  I have no issue with the concept.<\/p><p>  Arramara Teoranta was a state company.  BioAtlantis Limited went into production in 2007, at which time we obtained our dry raw material from Arramara Teoranta.  As we were dealing with a body of the State, there was never any need for us to engage in harvesting.  It is perhaps something we might have envisaged doing further down the road.  Currently, Arramara Teoranta is owned by our major competitor worldwide.  I have worked in the food industry since 1989.  I worked for Golden Vale and Kerry Group.  I have never come across a company that has used the tactics being used by Acadian Seaplants.  That is my opinion.  The food industry is tough.  There is a line one does not cross.  We have to have control of our resource.  Otherwise, we will have to consider moving our operation to Scotland.<\/p><p>  I received a letter from the Minister of State, Deputy McGinley.  I have not heard for months from the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, but amazingly I also received a letter from him yesterday.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, states in his letter that he is informed that our supply is guaranteed into the future, with no definition of what is meant by \"into the future\".  Does \"into the future\" mean a political term of five years?  We are trying to build a long-term company.  The Kerry Group started in a greenfield site in 1973.  I had the joy and privilege of working in that company.  The objective is to build long-term companies, not companies that are going to disappear the first time something goes wrong.  Companies are either in it for the long haul or they are not.  <\/p><p>  As stated by an earlier speaker, all the Chinese operators want is raw material.  They do not give a fiddlers about the quality of it.  They want it for the fracking industry.  They just buy up what they want and move on.  While the concept of what is suggested is good, it will not work.  The solution is to grant a licence to a number of different companies and to provide that where an operator does not play ball, abuses harvesters by not providing them with proper terms and conditions or fails to take care of the SACs, the licence may be withdrawn.  Licences not used properly should be withdrawn.  The solution is to use the best of industry in conjunction with the best of local harvesters.  The cost of investing in the boats picking up the weed from the areas is &euro;200,000.  Trying to pike weed with a four-pronged pike is no good.  We have been there and done that.  It is not something that one would recommend to anybody in the 21st century.  We should be trying to make this as easy as possible using the traditional method.  Licences should be granted to the people interested in harvesting.  In my view, there are not that many genuine harvesters.  The person willing to harvest 800 tonnes per year will earn &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000 per annum doing so.  That is a decent income, which could be increased through a combined activity.<\/p><p>  In regard to the statutory regulation mentioned, I am not sure to what that relates.  It appears to relate to a grant.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta turned down our offer, despite the fact that we are an Irish company.  It then received an offer from Acadian Seaplants and grant-aided it in respect of future investments.  As far as I can see, that is what happened.  I cannot verify that.  Perhaps someone should ask &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta if it has grant-aided that company or put in writing that any future investment in Arramara will be grant-aided.  Has it put in writing that any investment will be related to the granting of the licences for harvesting from County Clare to County Mayo?  <\/p><p>  We submitted our licence application in January.  Arramara submitted its application in March or April.  We applied for 12,500 tonnes.  We do not want to be stepping on anybody's toes.  OGT in Donegal has applied for a licence for 9,000 tonnes.  The traditional area for Arramara weed is Galway.<\/p> <p>We respected that area, but next we have a licence application coming which covers an area from County Clare to County Mayo.

On the one hand, he referred to accommodation for traditional harvesters, while, on the other, he wants the licence because of the way things have turned out in Arramara Teoranta.  He has cited some of the difficulties that may confront small harvesters, including European regulations.  If he were to receive the licence, what terms and conditions would he operate in respect of these harvesters?<\/p><p>  I am not clear from the delegates' evidence whether they have all been dealing with Arramara Teoranta.  I see shakes of the head indicating that is not the case.  Deputy Thomas Pringle pointed out that one of the conditions of the sale would seem to offer assurance.  I understand, however, that Mr. O'Sullivan has concerns about what it might mean.  Given that Arramara Teoranta is now under new management, what discussions has he had with the company?  What are the terms and duration of his existing contract with it?  Has that arrangement fallen by the wayside or is he still getting his seaweed from Arramara Teoranta?<\/p><p>  It seems from what the delegates are saying there are issues with the current regime, even though the value of having traditional harvesters is also recognised.  Mr. Melvin has observed that the unregulated cash economy is something with which he has to contend.  Mr. O'Sullivan and others referred to the issue of sustainability and how it is monitored.  The suggestion is that there should be some independent oversight, rather than leaving it up to individuals.  The gist of what the delegates are saying, as I understand it, is that we should be seeking to maximise the benefit of this natural resource, which sounds sensible.  The issue is in focus because of the situation where Arramara Teoranta has been bought out.<\/p><p>  The other issue cited as important, by Mr. O'Sullivan in particular, is that of research and development, environmental concerns and so on.  If all of this is above board in respect of Acadian Seaplants Limited, am I correct in saying his real concerns are about there being a monopoly and about security of supply into the future?  In other words, he envisages his company expanding but is fearful that he will not be able to get additional resources?  At this time he is competing for part of the area for which a licence is being sought by Arramara Teoranta.  Clew Bay comes within its scope and Mr. O'Sullivan is seeking part of it for himself and putting out the figure of 25% as a proposal.

As I said in my opening statement, anybody who wants a licence should be entitled to one.  If a person wants to harvest seaweed for his or her own personal use, there should be no issue with it.  It has been a tradition that people are allowed to do this, but it should be regulated.  Any company that wants to harvest commercially is entitled to do so, but it should be a requirement that it be tax compliant and has obtained approval from the HSE before a licence will be granted.  This would ensure any company selling on the open market was complying with HSE regulations and paying its taxes, which is what I have to do.<\/p><p>  It is important to allow people to utilise the sea and the resources it produces naturally every year.  It is unfair to eliminate any person or body from engaging in that activity.  Seaweed is natural, renewable and one of the few resources we have left.  It is important that it be managed correctly.  That cannot be done from Wexford; it must be done at a more local level, perhaps through local authorities or the Environmental Protection Agency.  People should be allowed to harvest seaweed, but there must be oversight to ensure it is all above board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800009#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Damien Melvin"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404828000,"counter":274,"content":"<p>Deputy Michelle Mulherin asked about the terms and conditions we would offer harvesters.  Harvesting seaweed is hard work; there is nothing pretty about it.  The number of people who genuinely want to take part in a life of harvesting seaweed is minimal, although there are some who have been doing it for the past ten or 15 years.  I agree completely with my colleague's suggestion regarding tax and regulation.  Whether one is an employee or a subcontractor, a person's aim is to build a business for himself or herself and his or her family.  Some of those involved will invariably be reliant on additional sources of income.  We are trying to give them a taxable income.  As it stands, some of them may not be paying tax because, if they are categorised as self-employed, they are allowed to write off a lot of expenses.<\/p><p>  Any harvester we engage will have a PRSI number and be offered a sustainable price for his or her seaweed.  Harvesters are getting &euro;35 a tonne from Arramara Teoranta; we will probably pay &euro;40 or even &euro;50.  All harvesters will be on a contract; there will be nothing iffy about it and we will train up.  Many harvesters do not know about fucus, for example, or the issues with seals.  They might be perfect harvesters, but they may not be aware of these issues.  As far as I am concerned, they will be treated in the same way as any employee of BioAtlantis, which is to say they will be treated properly.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked what discussions we had had with Acadian Seaplants Limited.  The sale of Arramara Teoranta was approved early last year and an engagement began last October involving one of the company's representatives, Mr. Daniel Parker, Brandon Products and, possibly, other companies.<\/p> <p>We were not making much progress; we seemed to be going around in circles.  I took the document and said it made no sense, that the people in question had no interest in trying to do a deal.  I rewrote it and said we should make a commercial contract, that this made sense and that we could do a deal.  However, this was twisted and turned and with the elections the people and harvesters got to know that Aramara Teoranta was being sold.  The submission on the harvesting licence was sent in and suddenly the harvesters realised the implications of what was happening.  The sale of Aramara Teoranta was giving control of a seaweed resource from County Clare to County Mayo, about which everyone was excited and there was a big push to do a deal.  We had a good meeting in Tralee on 24 April at which substantial progress was made.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will be involved in the deal for five years, but what will happen after it leaves?  Do we put a plan in place for year six?  We have nothing in that respect; we cannot be in this business for a five year game.  &Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta, the Department of Arts, Heritage an the Gaeltacht and the Ministers involved signed off on the deal on 9 May and we have had either one or two e-mails since, but we have no agreement with Aramara Teoranta.  We have, however, continued to obtain our supply .  I have the letter from the Minister of State, Deputy Dinny McGinley, stating &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, amazingly, had negotiated a deal that was better for us.  We have not received any reduction in price, nor have we obtained a better quality product; what, therefore, is this amazing deal?  There is no timeframe for it and nothing has been put on paper.  If it was very open, why have we not had sight of the documents?  It is fairly simple to set out that it is an agreement, that is what concerns us.   As far as I am concerned, we are on a complete tangent and have to get the harvesting licence for Clew Bay, as otherwise we will have a serious strategic problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800009#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404828600,"counter":276,"content":"<p>To clarify, Mr. O'Sullivan said he had a good meeting-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800010#K00200","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404828600,"counter":277,"content":"<p>We made progress.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800010#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1404828600,"counter":278,"content":"<p>Yes, but to what end?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800010#K00400","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404828600,"counter":279,"content":"<p>The outcome of the meeting was that Acadian would take all of the issues into account and come back with revised proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800010#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Sullivan"},{"type":"speech","time":1404828600,"counter":280,"content":"<p>To clarify, is Mr. O'Sullivan saying that in the previous year he issued it with a commercial contract?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800010#K00600","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404828600,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I went back and said it would make much more sense to have a commercial contract, getting rid of some of the silly things, and that we should try to get a deal done.

I equally want to see the traditional companies represented here to grow, thrive and flourish.

When account is taken of the issues relating to EU regulations and Natura 2000 impact statements and while I know there is talk of co-operatives, do the representatives agree that it is beyond the financial ability of harvesters to apply for licences and publish appropriate assessments and that the common-sense approach would be for companies, whether it be those represented or others, to submit applications for licences?  Mr. Melvin mentioned the role county councils could play and that the process could be undertaken on a county basis.  If companies do not apply, who will apply?  <\/p><p>  On the specific issue of Aramara Teoranta's application, I presume all of the companies represented will make a submission when the application is published and that they will highlight the areas in which they have had an ongoing interest for many years, particularly Clew Bay and Sligo.  I assume - perhaps this reflects innocence on my part - the foreshore section of the Department will take these issues on board in considering any application from another company, that it will state that in the case of Clew Bay there is a company with a licence and managing a business and that the same will apply to other areas.  I cannot speak for those in the foreshore section, but that would make sense to me.  I know from the discussions we had with the Minister a few weeks ago that it would have stated any application should include full mapping details.<\/p><p> Mr. O'Sullivan talked about the cutting method used and the need to ensure eight inches of growth.  Surely it is not in any company's interest to do anything that is not sustainable.  Every company that is harvesting and that wants to grow it business and the harvesters who want to create a future for themselves and those who will come after them wants to harvest in a sustainable way.

It is hard to know.  Ideally, everybody should be allowed to apply for a licence if he or she so wishes, regardless of whether it is for personal use or if he or she wants to make some money out of it.  People have a vested interest in it.  Alternatively, the businesses which process the seaweed could be given a larger licence and subcontract out the work to harvesters.  Perhaps that is an idea worth considering.  Perhaps licences might be given on the basis of scale.  We harvest less than 50 tonnes a year, but applications have been submitted for the harvesting of ten of thousands of tonnes.  I do not understand how our licence needs to be treated in the same as that of a business harvesting 40,000 tonnes.<\/p> <p>That is why I suggested this should be done at a local level, though perhaps not by the county councils.  I only raised them because they exist in each area.  This requires intimate knowledge of an area of coastline, be it Clew Bay, Killala Bay or Sligo Bay.

If it is done locally there is a possibility that it can be managed and the resource can be harvested sustainably so it can be reaped year after year.

Harvesters will either be employees of BioAtlantis with a contract to supply a specified number of tonnes that year or will act as subcontractors.  If harvesters are employees, BioAtlantis will cover all of the costs, onerous regulations and matters relating to the standing scientific committee, SSC, and they will get the revenue.  If they act as subcontractors they will also be given a contract to supply a specified number of tonnes that year, but the harvester is responsible for issues such as traceability.  As employees, the only issue facing them is cutting the seaweed properly and doing what is asked of them.  We want to build relationships and create jobs in Clew Bay.  It is not the case that 12,500 tonnes of seaweed are currently being taken from Clew Bay.  We want to create genuine employment because people coming in and out of the area are of no use to us and are, in fact, disastrous.  We work with families and people who genuinely want an income.

If the processing company does not act correctly it should lose its licence.  This applies to BioAtlantis too.<\/p><p>  There are 110 kilometres of coastline in the small area at Clew Bay.

This is an issue that arises occasionally in the Houses.<br \/>To go back to the beginning, do the witnesses agree that the two issues the Department must consider when deciding on the distribution of licences are sustainability and the public good?  Everything is predicated on these factors.  The Minister must ask whether a licence application is sustainable, as reinforced by the EU habitats directive, and in the public interest.  This industry has been very underdeveloped in Ireland and we did not realise our wealth, so I take it the witnesses agree that we must aim for a diverse and growing industry.  We must seek new products, added value and different types of seaweed to add to the wealth because, traditionally, Arramara was a low-added-value, bulk processor of seaweed.  Do the witnesses agree that sustainability is a criterion?<br \/>Over the past three months I have become convinced that the <i>status quo<\/i>of an unregulated sector is not sustainable.  Does anyone believe the <i>status quo<\/i>can continue?  Harvesters were poorly informed because they harvested without a licence, which has been illegal since 1933.  Despite this, factories, including Arramara, were happy to buy the harvested seaweed and accept it was the harvesters' to sell.  The factories were in a better position to check the law than the harvesters.  There is a suggestion that only the harvesters were mistaken in their behaviour and factories should thus have the right to harvest now.  I accept harvesters had no right to the seaweed in the first place but, equally, factories had no right to buy it from them.  Do the witnesses accept that they bought goods from people who were not in a position to sell those goods because they did not own them?  The harvesters sold seaweed to factories either on the pier or direct to the factory door and the factories paid a price.  If harvesters acted illegally then so too did the factories.<br \/>I was surprised to hear talk of PRSI, taxes and so on.  The simple fact is seaweed harvesters were liable for PRSI and tax like any farmer or self-employed person and means testing, was also a factor.  We introduced a special exemption on means testing to allow the harvesting of a certain amount of seaweed without loss of full social welfare allowances, but it was taken into account.  It is questionable to say the State did not know because tax auditors could easily have checked whom the factories purchased seaweed from.  I assume all of the witnesses kept proper records of those from whom they bought seaweed.  It is a travesty of justice that seaweed harvesters are being singled out as having acted illegally, and I have seen how they have had to account for themselves.  I would hate to think any State company did not keep proper records.<br \/>Is it viable to take seaweed from offshore islands such as the Aran Islands, Inishturk or Inishbofin for processing on the mainland?  If not, are people there seeking licences to exclusively harvest seaweed?  Should a limit be placed on the maximum that can be granted to any one industry?  Should we say no single group or person can get the sole licence for a period?<\/p> <p>What period of time does Mr. O'Sullivan think would be the proper length for the licence? <\/p><p> I have the impression that BioAtlantis is proposing that the processors hold the licence.  It seems to be putting the argument that if the processor does not hold the licence it cannot go to the bank.  There are big processors in the farming industry but they do not own the cows.  The malt processors do not own the barley.  Why is seaweed harvesting so different?  I was involved in the timber industry.  The processors do not own the timber but they get money from banks.  Why is this industry unique, as a renewable resource-based industry, such that the processor must own the base for production?<\/p><p> I have heard a great deal about harvesters this afternoon.  Have any of the witnesses examined whether they or the harvesters own the seaweed?  Many farmers have appurtenant rights to seaweed.  How many of the witnesses have checked that the State owns the seaweed where they want to harvest or how much is in private ownership?  One still needs a licence but one could get the licence and not be able to harvest because a farmer has appurtenant rights to the folio.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800011#L00400","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404829800,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I will try to answer all of the questions.  The current situation cannot continue in respect of sustainability.  I am not sure whether, if we were to be examined by the European Commission to see that we are in line with the proper systems, it would be allowed.  I am not sure whether it is sustainable.<br \/>How does one define the public good?  Does it mean extra employment for the country?  Is it measured in exports?  I think it is defined by several criteria.  One is that what our generation leaves behind should be the same as what we got.  Our job is to pass it on in the same condition as we got it in and not damage it.  The second is to create jobs, sales and exports.  BioAtlantis employs seven people with doctoral degrees.  There are not many companies around the country that employ seven people with PhDs.  There are three engineers and two accountants in the company.  Not many companies provide such high-value jobs.  We are small but we are growing rapidly.  That is to the public good.  We are involved in research on gut health.  We have a patent on a bioactive ingredient from seaweed that could improve gut health and microbiological immunity.  That is also in the public good.  We could potentially produce something that would reduce the incidence of irritable bowel disease.  It will probably take us five more years to get to where we want to be.  That is all work in the public good.<br \/>In respect of the diversity and growth of the industry, we export to 30 countries.  We export to China and sell there at prices as good as those we get in Europe.  The Chinese came to us to buy seaweed meal for the fracking industry.  The question is whether we should operate as farmers did in the old days, when they exported cattle on the hoof, or process here and create jobs.  In the beef industry the processors step out of line every so often.  I agree completely that there must be independent control.<br \/>I do not think the <i>status quo<\/i>can continue.  It is not sustainable.  Factories bought seaweed from harvesters.  We have a licence application for Clew Bay.  Being nice boys is a disadvantage to us because we could go up to Clew Bay and pay &euro;50 to get the weed, but we do not do that.  Since 2007 we have bought the weed from Arramara.  When the Acadian Seaplant sale process started it would have been logical to create a presence in Clew Bay and buy it from the harvesters.  That would have been breaking the law, which would have been very advantageous to us in this instance.  We did not do that.  BioAtlantis did not break the law.  We have never in the past seven years bought a tonne of seaweed from any harvester on the west coast.  I have no idea whether all the harvesters in Arramara are tax-compliant.  That is not my problem.  We want to build a relationship with the people we want to employ in Clew Bay.  We are building an industry.  They will be tax-compliant, whether as self-employed people or as employees.  That is not my problem. <br \/>There are many offshore islands in Clew Bay.  We do propose to harvest seaweed from them.  At the moment, guys go out in a small punt to try to tow it back in a net.  They are probably not complying with the health and safety legislation.  Clew Bay is open water.  If we put a vessel into Clew Bay to take tonnage there we have to be licensed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  That is quite a strict process.  We will work with the offshore licences.

Traditionally, harvesters have worked part time and have harvested small amounts to supplement income from other streams such as fishing and farming.<\/p> <p>The onus is coming from regulations and from Europe to harvest the seaweed sustainably and to be able to show records that we are following best practice.

While the topic of this meeting is the licensing and harvesting of seaweed in Ireland, my comments apply to just two species of seaweed - ascophyllum and fucus.  Other seaweed species will require their own different licensing and managing processes.<\/p><p>  I am here today to speak in support of the licensing of the seaweed resource of the ascophyllum and fucus species.  I will list the important factors that should be taken into consideration when decisions on licensing are being made.  I will speak about the reasons Arramara has applied for a licence.  I will also provide examples of what can happen in both a regulated and an unregulated commercial seaweed harvesting environment.  We believe seaweed licensing is important to ensure the resource is managed in a responsible and scientific way.  We believe it is needed to ensure harvesting practices are sustainable and the habitat is protected from an environmental perspective.  Seaweed licensing is important if we are to maximise the economic benefit of the seaweed resource to Ireland and ensure it is used to make value-added products, create economic benefits for harvesters and generate economic benefits in harvesting communities.<\/p><p>  I would like to run through the factors that we believe should be taken into account when licensing is being considered.  Licences should be granted to cover a specific geographic area on an exclusive basis.  Exclusive licences are needed to avoid competitive commercial harvesting in the same geographic area.  Having said that, individuals should be permitted to harvest seaweed for their own personal use as long as it is not for resale.  Unregulated competitive commercial harvesting leads to the over-harvesting of the resource, which consequently leads to the loss of harvester jobs and the closure of manufacturing facilities and habitat degradation.  The licenceholder must be held accountable for the economic benefit to Ireland, including to the harvesters, and for the sustainability of the resource.<\/p><p>  Arramara Teoranta has applied for a licence to ensure it has an ongoing source of seaweed for its business.  I want to emphasise that we are aiming to ensure all the harvesters will have an opportunity to continue to harvest seaweed on an ongoing basis.  We want to ensure continued employment and make a contribution to the coastal communities of the west.  Arramara has applied for a licence in the areas where Arramara has traditionally obtained seaweed.  It has been processing seaweed for more than 67 years, since 1947.  Over 300 harvesters have supplied Arramara with seaweed in recent times.  We want to ensure each of those harvesters can continue to have the opportunity to supply seaweed to Arramara now and into the future.<\/p><p>  I will provide examples of what can happen in a both regulated and an unregulated environment.  The submission we have furnished to the joint committee contains a chronology from Acadian Seaplants showing that each time a licence was secured, investment followed.<\/p> <p>We have established an industry that started in Canada that is growing and is sustainable.  We have five world-class processing facilities in rural communities, 25 researchers, including nine who hold PhDs, 45 sales and marketing people located in seven countries, namely, Canada, the US, Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Colombia and Japan, and we have more than 250 employees in Canada.  In June, we opened a new, 115,000 sq. ft. value-added, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility.  This happened because licensing provided assured access to seaweed, allowing investment and proper management of the resource to take place.<\/p><p> Global demand for seaweed is growing dramatically, and we have heard some examples of it here today.  As a consequence, the potential for over exploitation will increase over time, without proper management.  For example, in September 2013, Chile shut down the harvesting of brown seaweed due to over harvesting in an unregulated environment.  This resulted in the loss of harvester jobs and manufacturing plant closures.  In a regulated, licensed environment, Acadian Seaplants has been able to build a sustainable seaweed industry in Canada, ensure the scientific management and sustainability of the resource and habitat and create value-added products in a rural environment for use domestically and exported to more than 80 countries around the world.  An unlicensed commercial competitive environment will result in over harvesting, loss of harvester jobs and industry shut-down.  Together, the partnership between Arramara and Acadian Seaplants in a licensed environment will result in an Irish success story featuring an Irish company, resource and people.  A licence for Arramara will provide assured access to the resource for the 300 plus harvesters who supply Arramara Teoranta.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800014#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Paul Deveau","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404831600,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Is mise John Bhaba Jeaic &Oacute; Conghaile &oacute; Chearta Chladaigh Chonamara.

I was born on an island off Lettermullen-Furnish with 15 houses.  I am over 60 years old and since the age of ten I have been cutting seaweed on the shore for potatoes, fruit, vegetables and everything.  We cut seaweeds such as carageenan for winter as jelly.  The sea around us was our income.  The first year I started cutting seaweed there were seven seaweed factories in Kilrush and six in Connemara.  We used to dry the seaweed and bring it to the factories and it provided a good income.  We would have approximately seven acres of land and harvest approximately four lorry loads every four years, and then let the seaweed grow.<\/p><p>  We have looked after our seaweed all this time, and cut it the right way, with a knife.  We have looked after the environment and ensured the seaweed regrows.  We have looked after everything at the shore, as it has looked after us.  Now, one company is coming in and wants all the rights from County Mayo to Galway, which is wrong.  We have looked after the seaweed for generations and we should be left as were have been all these years to ensure it grows in the right way.  We had three meetings in Connemara, each of which was attended by approximately 150 people.  The one thing people wanted was to keep the seaweed rights they have had for all these years.  They do not want one big business to take over the seaweed from us.<\/p><p>  We are talking about coastal communities which have no factories.  The nearest factories are a long way from us and there is no employment in our area.  We have nothing against Acadia, Arramara or any other factories, only against the idea that one company would have the right to all the seaweed from County Clare up to Mayo.  While a company might say we can do whatever we want and cut the seaweed as we do, I do not think we will be able to do so in years to come.  In our area, people cut seaweed to help pay their car insurance, water rates and telephone bills.  It is hard work, and if one company gets the licence, it can reduce the price from &euro;30 per tonne to &euro;10 or &euro;20, which would be wrong.

We would like the Minister to search in the congested district board maps and the dealing numbers for any seaweed papers that have been lost, so they can be known.  The seaweed was cut right and was always there.  It is renewable and good, and the people had it.  The people cutting now, who may not have the folios or the rights, have done a good job and have looked after it, and it is still there after approximately 100 years.  If the State claims seaweed cutting must be licensed, the licences should be given to the cutters who have looked after it and ensured the seaweed grew again.<\/p><p>  In the 1960s, approximately 65,000 tonnes of seaweed were taken from Connemara and sold, and the seaweed is still there.  It was never abused.  People cut it with a knife below and it grows again even better.  Studies have proven it is the right way to do it.  Although it is not an easy life, people would like to have the right to do it and wish to be able to sell it to Acadia or any other company that wishes to buy it.  Over the years, Arramara Teoranta has been a great buyer of seaweed and has employed many people in hauling and cutting seaweed.  People had the right and could sell it.  We hope they will retain the right so the current generation and the next generation will have something, and if someone new wants to start out with a smaller company they will have the right.<\/p><p>  When people look after something for 100 years and it has grown, they will not abuse it but will look after it.  We would like it to remain as it is.  If regulations must come, they should apply to people who are cutting and have been there for generations so no cowboys can come in.  So far, no cowboys have been cutting seaweed because cowboys want easy money.  It is not easy work, but people earn money on it and we would like it to continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800015#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Murch&uacute;"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404831600,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me.  I was CEO of Arramara Teoranta until 2007, when I left to form Irish Seaweed Processors limited for the extraction of bioactive compounds from Irish seaweed.<\/p> <p>Since the 1960s Arramara Teoranta purchased and processed only one seaweed, ascophyllum nodosum, from harvesters who did not hold a licence but claimed traditional harvesting rights.  In May 2014 Arramara Teoranta was formally transferred to ownership of Acadian Seaplants Limited.  In March 2014 Arramara Teoranta applied to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for a foreshore licence to harvest ascophyllum nodosum from north Mayo to north Clare, driving suspicions that Arramara Teoranta is being used as a proxy to gain control of Irish seaweed resources.<br \/>In January 2014 the Joint Sub-Committee on Fisheries published its report on promoting sustainable rural, coastal and island communities.  The main focus of the report is on the social and economic situation of rural, coastal and island communities and the promotion of sustainable industries.  The main industries discussed by the sub-committee with stakeholders were inshore fisheries, sea angling, seaweed, aquaculture and tourism, particularly marine tourism.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta advised the sub-committee on matters relating to the seaweed industry.  According to the report, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta identified to the sub-committee that the principal issue in developing the seaweed processing industry is the regulation of supply, and that investors would be unlikely to provide or secure capital funding when uncertainty surrounds the supply of the raw material to be processed.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta cited to the sub-committee the case of the state of Nova Scotia in eastern Canada, where the state leases out an area and the company awarded the lease is responsible for sustainable harvesting of the seaweed.  It explained that in Canada at the practice is to cut 1 ft. per annum, which is done from boats, but at present nobody in Ireland is responsible for the sustainable harvesting of seaweed and people take seaweed off the rock and the plant is gone.  Based on this advice the sub-committee recommended that the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Environment, Community and Local Government resolve the regulatory licensing issues which pose an impediment to the development of the seaweed industry.<br \/>In <i>A Guide to Commercially Important Seaweeds on the Irish Coast<\/i>written by Jim Morrissey, Dr. Stefan Kraan and Professor Michael-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800015#P00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Barrett","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404832200,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I respectfully ask the witness to speak into the microphone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800016#Q00200","speaker":"1142"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404832200,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I beg the Senator's pardon.<br \/>The book is written by Jim Morrissey, Dr. Stefan Kraan and Professor Michael D.

It states that for a resource which has been exploited for many centuries, and particularly intensively in the past century, Ireland's seaweed resources could accurately be described as well maintained with considerable potential for further sustainable development.<br \/>The book also states ascophyllum nodosum grows apically, in other words, the tips actively grow with the plant progressively becoming older towards its base.  As I mentioned, the growth cycle takes between three to five years, depending on the area.  The book states the adoption of sustainable harvesting practices for exploitation of this resource since the start of large-scale exploitation of ascophyllum nodosum by Arramara Teoranta in the 1960s has successfully maintained and even enhanced the natural resources of ascophyllum nodosum.  It states sustainable harvesting means allowing regeneration of the resource between harvests and to this end a number of guidelines have been adopted over the years by hand harvesters applying to Arramara Teoranta.  These are listed and include that when cutting seaweed at least 15 cm to 25 cm above the base of the plant should be left attached, which serves to speed up the regeneration process greatly, as if the entire plant is ripped out the resultant space would be quickly colonised by other seaweeds, such as fucus spiralis, and considerable time would elapse before ascophyllum could recolonise the site.<br \/>Another guideline listed is that an area should not be completely harvested until bare and rather, a proportion of the biomass, preferably 50%, should be left to maintain a canopy to minimise the impact to the other plants and animals living there.  This measure helps minimise the displacement of many fish and other animals living among ascophyllum beds.  The fronds generally take between three to five years to regenerate fully following harvesting but the exact period depends on the area and the time of harvesting.  Sustainable harvesting requires that such a period of time is allowed to pass before the next harvest occurs.  Fallowing of harvested areas between cuts should therefore be carefully observed.  It has been found that regular harvesting of ascophyllum nodosum allows greater production.<br \/>I will refer to the national seaweed forum report published in 2001.  The forum was established by the Minister with responsibility for the marine to develop the seaweed industry in Ireland.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta had a member on the forum.  The report states:<blockquote>The coast of Ireland has a myriad of different algal species.  This forms a potentially very valuable resource.  Tapping into this resource is completely sustainable due to a combination of the renewable resource and the good husbandry practices that are employed in its harvesting.  The main seaweed crop used in Ireland today (Ascophyllum nodosum) requires a recovery time of only 3-4 years and so the fallow period of 4-5 years employed in Ireland is quite sufficient for sustainability.  The fact that the cutters used by the largest company in Ireland (Arramara Teoranta) have been cutting seaweed in the same areas over and over again for more than fifty years provides the practical evidence to support this.<\/blockquote>The report also states, &quot;The establishment of processing in Ireland will not only reduce foreign dependence but will increase dramatically the overall contribution of the industry to GNP by capitalising on the value-added end of the market&quot;.<br \/>The report makes special reference to the Canadian seaweed industry at the time:<blockquote>Due to the nature of the data available from Canada it is quite difficult to narrow down the differences seen to a particular crop but an overall decline of the Industry is evident.  At present the largest seaweed company in the Maritime Provinces (Acadian Seaplants Ltd.) employs 220 people full-time and 870 people seasonally (May to October).  Traditionally Ascophyllum was cut using hand-held knives or sickles at low tide or from boats with a toothed rake with a long wooden pole.  In the late 1980s the Norwegian suction cutter machine was introduced to Canada.  These machines have very high efficiency and quickly put Canada second in the world (after Norway) for Ascophyllum production.  Lack of effective management and competition between companies led to over-harvesting of the stocks, putting the sustainability of the resource in jeopardy.<\/blockquote>Acadian Seaplants Limited wants to take the traditional rights of the seaweed harvesters in Ireland and claim them for itself, thereby giving it sole control of this vital native Irish resource.  What is the real reason for the sensitivity of Arramara Teoranta to the need for harvesters to hold a licence under the 1933 Act now, when in its 67 year history it was quite satisfied to deal with the harvesters who had no licence but held traditional harvesting rights?  I contend this newfound self-righteousness is an attempt by a foreign company to gain exclusive control of the seaweed harvesting rights on the Irish coast so it can dictate to all its own terms and can kill off any perceived commercial competition from indigenous companies succeeding in taking some of its market share internationally.<br \/>The Foreshore Act 1933 states the State owns all beach material between the high and low water mark and anyone harvesting beach material should have permission in the form of a licence issued by the State.  Given that seaweed harvesting has been carried out along Ireland's Atlantic coast for centuries, landlords included seaweed rights in deeds for tenants.  These seaweed rights still exist today, which is why licensing has not been in vogue before for those who have traditionally had the right to harvest seaweed.  The seaweed rights should be the automatic criterion for the granting of a harvesting licence to the present individual seaweed harvesters.  Such a licence should not be granted to any single commercial entity, whatever its origin.  If the State's law dictates a licence is required then I am not opposed to the law, but I am strongly opposed to any commercial entity obtaining the exclusive licence for harvesting seaweed along sections of our coast.  A licence to harvest seaweed should be preserved only for those who actually harvest the seaweed and not a commercial entity with a vested interest.<br \/>I wish Acadian Seaplants Limited every success in its acquisition of Arramara Teoranta.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800016#Q00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Barrett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404832200,"counter":321,"content":"<p>We heard much about competition from Mr. O'Sullivan in the previous session.

The Irish seaweed industry is following international trends and is expanding.  The seaweed sector has been one of the key drivers of the coastal economy in the Gaeltacht over many years.  It is important not only for those employed in the processing companies, but also for harvesters and those who provide facilities and logistical supports, including transport services, to the sector.  While the development opportunities for the seaweed sector are substantial, growth and development can only be achieved by identifying the resources available, addressing the management of that resource and adding value by expanding the product range.<\/p><p>  The level of interest in seaweed-based enterprise is increasing, with entrepreneurs keen to develop businesses using this resource.  The development of the seaweed sector requires a regulated environment to attract the investment necessary and maintain and protect this rich natural resource.  The greatest threat to the seaweed sector comes from unregulated over-harvesting.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is of the view that commercial, competitive harvesting can only be managed through a regulated environment where full exploitation on an ecological, environmental and economically sustainable basis can be optimised.  It is our view that there is a need for a comprehensive appraisal of the seaweed resource to determine its potential contribution to the coastal economy.  It is on the basis of such research that the State can prepare detailed plans and take a proactive approach to developing this sector.<\/p><p>  Tuigeann an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s go gcaithfear bheith airdeallach ar an traidisi&uacute;n agus muid anois ar an tairseach chun an tionscal a fhorbairt ar mhaithe le luach saothar n&iacute;os fearr le ghn&oacute;th&uacute; as an bhfeamainn agus breis fosta&iacute;ochta a chruth&uacute; sa Ghaeltacht d&aacute; bharr.

Overall, this is a fascinating story.  Seaweed seems to be a very good story for Ireland.  Possibly, it can get better.  Like all success stories, it is creating its own problems.  I have a number of questions.  Obviously, the existing traditional harvesters are worried about the future.  What kind of future will they have if this licence is granted and Acadian Seaplants gets involved in the manner that has been outlined by the people who have concerns?  What will be the future for small and medium-sized enterprises like Brandon Products, which is based in County Kerry, if Acadian Seaplants becomes a huge player in the market?  Brandon Products and its counterparts might not be providing huge employment, but they are creating valuable jobs and have room for expansion.  If I understand correctly, Acadian Seaplants is a competitor of Brandon Products.  Will they work together?  Is there a legitimate fear that the whole thing will be taken over by a big monster?<\/p><p>  Why did &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta feel it was appropriate to sell Arramara at this particular time?  Was that a policy decision?  Was it a strategic decision?  When Acadian Seaplants bought Arramara, was there an understanding that it would be granted this licence?  Did talks take place in advance at Government level to copperfasten this deal?  If that happened as part of this process, it should be made quite clear.<\/p><p>  I am worried about the Sligo experience.  Mr. Melvin, who has been harvesting for many years, told the committee earlier about the difficulty he is having in getting his licence renewed.  Is that something we need to worry about in the context of the 70% licence that Acadian Seaplants will have?<\/p><p>  There is some resonance with the situation regarding traditional bog and turf cutting.

This company indicated in 2006 that it was going to withdraw from Arramara Teoranta and the market and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs at the time asked &uacute;dar&aacute;s to purchase the ISP shares and take over the shares the Minister held.

In 2010, we appointed consultants to advise us on that and this process culminated in March 2013 when the board of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta decided to sell its shares to Acadian Seaplants Limited.

We knew that in purchasing Arramara, we were purchasing a company that did not have rights to any seaweed.  Two of the points raised by Senator O'Sullivan concerned the supply of material to the customers, in particular Brandon Products and Bio Atlantis.  One of the challenges for us is that because we do not have any rights to the seaweed, this makes it difficult for us to guarantee absolutely that we can provide both of the customers mentioned with an ongoing supply.

While we do not always agree on everything, we can agree on the following.  We believe it is very important that Arramara and organisations such as these, which are creating value added products in Ireland, have licences, so that they will have assured access to raw material in the future and to assure they, and the others here who are making these kinds of investments in capital and in research and development, will have the raw materials necessary to create a viable industry here in Ireland.

I believe past performance is a good indication of what to expect in the future.  For the past 25 years, we have had quite a number of licences in Canada, where we managed the resource and worked very closely with the harvesters.  We were able to map out every bed of seaweed in our licensed territories, quantify them and come up with annual harvest plans.  Every harvester knows he can harvest a specific quantity on an annual basis, because of the close co-operation we have with the harvesting community.  We indicate to the harvester which area to go to and how much to harvest from it and what area to move to next.  These things are worked out and negotiated with the harvesting community.  Based on that type of long, historic ability, the harvesters can depend on that employment year after year and we, as a company, can depend on the raw material to build the business.

Therefore, the sustainability of the resource is real.  The challenge arises when one looks at the sustainability of the industry and the totality of the resource in Ireland.<\/p><p>  I will use a fictitious number for illustrative purposes.  If, for example, we had a total resource of 100,000 tonnes, sustainable on an annual basis, that is the maximum amount that could be harvested.  This brings us back to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question on the difference between seaweed and farming cows.  We could have an infinite quantity of cows, but the seaweed is finite.  Only a certain amount of it can be harvested before cutting into the principle of the resource.  Therefore, if an industry developed and was harvesting 120,000 tonnes per year, there would be nothing left after a couple of years.  While the individual patches would regrow, we would have now caused a situation where individual harvesters would not have anything to harvest and the industry could no longer depend upon the raw material and would have to scale back its operations and, perhaps, suffer plant closures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800019#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Paul Deveau"},{"type":"speech","time":1404834000,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Mr. Deveau obviously appreciates the concern in the community exemplified by the harvesters and Cearta Chladaigh Chonamara.  He would be aware of the concerns also from various other sources.  I said at the initial hearings that I would like to see his company grow, be sustainable and create employment in the Connemara area, but I would also like to see the traditional Irish companies equally able to grow and flourish and to see the harvesters continue their work.

Can Arramara, the harvesters and the companies have a future in the area?<\/p><p>  There has been some concern that after a number of years, Arramara could, if it acquired a licence, close down a plant and leave.

Will he comment on that also?  A number of companies that presented on this earlier related to distinct geographical areas from which they harvested.

The advice we received was that this was a complex issue and that the &uacute;dar&aacute;s wanted to make it clear that it was up to us, if we were interested in concluding the transaction, to accept the responsibility of figuring out how to operate in that environment.  We have had preliminary discussions with the various Departments to try to understand the situation.  The advice we got was to continue with the application Arramara had put together in order to clarify and get the rights to the seaweed and to be able to develop that area.<\/p><p>  Deputy Kyne raised the question of the use it or lose it clause.  This particular clause exists in the licences we have in Canada.  Effectively, this clause prohibits an organisation from getting a licence and not using it for the benefit of Ireland.<\/p> <p>If one is considering a licensing a regime, sustainability, habitat protection and maximum economic benefit are important factors.  There needs to be a mechanism to address a situation in which an entity receives a licence but does not use it, as harvesters would not be able to harvest and others who might use seaweed for their economic benefit could not access it.<\/p><p> A question was asked about the recommended length of harvesting licences.  Based on our experience, I might be so bold as to suggest a relatively short initial licence of three years.  One year is too short because of the way in which the plant grows.  A period of three years allows for people to show that they are working on ensuring sustainability, habitat protection and a level of capital investment that will benefit Ireland economically.  Once people have shown they can do this, longer licences might make sense.<\/p><p> Another of the Deputy's questions was on the compatibility of companies like Arramara Teo, the harvesters and other players in the industry.  Given the quantity of available resources, all of the entities that want to and are currently making substantial investments can co-exist, have access to those resources and work with the seaweed harvesters to ensure that all of the harvesters can continue doing so in a way that will work for everyone.  In this way, we could develop a substantial and world-leading industry.  This assurance is necessary if the industry or anyone with a licence is to make the substantial investments required.<\/p><p> I do not know whether I have hit all of the Deputy's questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800019#T00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Paul Deveau","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404834600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>What of the geographical issue?

D'iarradh orainn soil&eacute;iri&uacute; a thabhairt faoi cad is br&iacute; le &quot;folio rights&quot;.  Appendix No. 4 of the seaweed forum defines it well.  It states: &quot;As the great majority of the foreshore is State owned, permission to exploit the benefits of a natural foreshore resource such as seaweed, is for the State to give or withhold in accordance with the provisions of the Foreshore Acts 1933 - 1998.&quot;  Those are now the 1933-2002 Acts.  It continues:<blockquote><br \/>In certain areas the transfer of title to tenants which occurred on the break-up of large private estates, may have included seaweed harvesting rights.  In practical terms the validity of such rights would depend directly on the express provisions of the title documents.  It is not considered, however, that the enjoyment of such rights would be extensive and\/or would not constitute a major impediment to the harvesting of seaweed in coastal areas.<\/blockquote>Sin is br&iacute; le &quot;folio rights&quot;.<br \/>T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go dtuigfimid at all times, the licensing regime refers to State-owned foreshore and nothing else.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government's statement is worth contemplating.  According to it, to comply with the Foreshore Act 1933 it is required to harvest seaweed from State-owned foreshore.  The Minister, who determines all applications, is advised by the marine licence vetting committee following a detailed assessment of such applications.  Mandatory public consultation is undertaken on all applications and any person may submit comments to the Department.  The processing of foreshore applications is not time-bound.  Applications, when accepted by the Department as being complete, are published on its website, etc.<br \/>Ba mhaith liom pointe t&aacute;bhachtach a dh&eacute;anamh faoi na crit&eacute;ir gur ch&oacute;ir a &uacute;s&aacute;id i gc&aacute;s cead&uacute;nas.  This is the &quot;use it or lose it&quot; clause.  One must remember that the State owns the foreshore and the resources thereon.  For the economic benefit of the coastal areas, it is important that these resources be exploited in a sustainable manner.  If there is no regulation of licences, people can choose not to harvest, thereby blocking the harvesting of seaweed, which is in no one's interest bar a few individuals.  There are two sides to this.  Harvesters claim they should be given the right to harvest but large quantities of seaweed are not being harvested because people perceive the resource as theirs and do not want it harvested.  If it is a State asset, the State has a duty to ensure it is sustainably used.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to the public good.  This State asset should be used for the public good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800020#U00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Mac Eochaidh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404834600,"counter":349,"content":"<p>We are discussing seaweed, but there would be more than seaweed involved if a company got the licence.

I have said publicly that in my view the rights to harvest should be held by the harvesters and that there should be some mechanism whereby the private companies and all the players in the field should be able to negotiate with the harvesters, almost like a fair trade scenario.  I have made that view clear from day one.<\/p><p>  From what I have heard today there seems to be a sense that the witnesses are like the big bad wolf, that they belong to a very big multinational company coming in to squeeze the other players out of the market and that we should not expect anything else.  We are told initially that the company will play ball with everybody but, bit by bit, the players will  be squeezed and pushed out of the market, one way or another.  The witnesses deserve an opportunity to counter that argument but that is the argument being put forward.<\/p><p>  In a scenario where a co-operative or another entity were to be set up to represent the harvesters and it were to apply for a licence and be successful, would the company be willing to interact with it and to negotiate with it in collective bargaining?  That is what they are considering.<\/p><p>  We have heard that Garth Brooks has pulled out of five concerts in Croke Park because he did not get the licence he was looking for.  Will Acadian Seaplants pull out of Cill Chiar&aacute;in if it does not get the licence it is looking for?  This is a very serious question, believe it or not.  Is it conditional on the licence being granted or will the company pull out if the licence is not made available?<\/p><p>  Why has the company bothered buying Arramara because it is my understanding that it did not buy the actual facility, rather it just bought the shares in the company.  Would it not have made more sense for the company to set up a different plant without any of the hassle with the history of Arramara and start afresh to tackle the competition in that way?  What is the logic behind buying Arramara?  I have asked &uacute;dar&aacute;s and I ask the witnesses what deal was done.  What is the net profit for &uacute;dar&aacute;s from the deal?<\/p><p>  Over the past year or two have there been negotiations on the licensing issue between the company or any of its agents with any Ministers? Has the company had negotiations with Ministers or talked to them about the regime in Canada and suggested it would be a good idea to have that type of regime here in Ireland?  Mr. Deveau mentioned that a lack of regulation, if it is allowed to continue, would lead to the industry shutting down.  I find that hard to take because the industry has not shut down in the past 73 years nor has it been regulated.  I do not buy that argument, quite frankly.  I would like to see a situation where Acadian can do well, can bring development to the whole industry, all along the west coast, but I also want to see the other players in the industry being given fair play.  I have said from day one that my primary interest is that the right of the seaweed cutters and the individuals in the industry to cut seaweed in the traditional way must be the number one priority for us as legislators, and I will fight to ensure that happens.  If it needs a process of negotiation whereby all the players sit down together and that needs to be done, I am happy to play any part I can in that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800021#V00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404835200,"counter":352,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom aird a thabhairt ar na cupla ceist deiridh a d'ardaigh an Seanad&oacute;ir ansin, agus labhr&oacute;idh mo chomhghleacai ar na mionsonra&iacute;.  &Oacute; thaobh go nd&eacute;anfadh an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s iarratas ar chead&uacute;nas bainte feamainne muid f&eacute;in, n&iacute; rud &eacute; sin at&aacute;imid in ann a dh&eacute;anamh leis na hacmhainn&iacute; agus leis an saineolas at&aacute; againn.

In Canada, we have two operations that are very similar to that of Arramara.  We saw it as a fantastic opportunity to be able to transfer the technologies we have developed in Canada with respect to processing, resource management and the application of products to Ireland, and to use Ireland as a base from which to start.  By way of example, over recent weeks we sent Irish harvesters, hauliers and management to Canada and brought Canadian resource scientists, managers and engineers here in the first stages of this transfer of technology.  Last week, as I mentioned, we announced our initial investment of &euro;2 million in Arramara.  This is really our first step.  The investments here will be in research and development, marketing, quality improvements and capital expansion.<\/p><p>  This relates to the next item.  I apologise to the Deputy for not having responded to the question on the closing of Arramara.  The Deputy asked whether we would walk away if we did not get a licence.  There is no question that we regard these investments as very long-term.  We have a track record in Canada in this regard.  We believe tremendously in the potential of Ireland.  Irrespective of whether we receive a licence, we believe we will be treated fairly here and in a proper manner if we show we can make the right investments, work with the other players in the industries here and do what is required to build an industry.  We certainly believe the initial investments can be justified without a licence but, with a licence, we believe we can do a lot more in the future.<\/p><p>  I would like to address the issue of co-operatives.  Certainly, there have been many areas in which co-operatives have been quite successful.  Let me outline the challenge I envisage in a co-operative-type environment.  Mr. O'Sullivan spoke about the challenges associated with the Chinese fracking industry.  At times there can be blips in demand for raw materials.  It would not be unusual for the Chinese to be able, all of a sudden, to offer a higher price to the harvesters at co-operative level and take it all.  Obviously there are those here who feel that is an appropriate way of operating.  I refer to harvesters getting the harvest price.  The challenge here is that if all of a sudden the Chinese took all the harvest, it would be very detrimental to the Irish industry, which is creating value-added products.  In other words, the other companies and ourselves would not have the security of supply for the longer term.<\/p><p>  In determining the common good, it is best to have a strong and vibrant industry that has access to supply.  We should not be looking at ways of allowing for a short-term opportunistic form of behaviour, be it at harvester level, industry level or any other.  We want good, long-term investments.  The challenge is arriving at a trade-off such that everybody wins, thereby allowing the harvesters and industry to do well and Ireland to be at the level it should be at in leading the world with this tremendous resource.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800023#X00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Paul Deveau"},{"type":"speech","time":1404836400,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Obviously, the licensing regime has been in place in Canada for quite a while.

I wish to add to what Mr. John Bhaba Jeaic &Oacute; Conghaile said on the risk of setting precedents in regard to a blanket licence for a single commercial entity.  The precedent could be such that other resources, such as other seaweed species, would be sought in the future.<\/p><p>  I noticed that both ascophyllum and fucus were mentioned in the opening statement of Arramara.  From my experience as CEO of Arramara, we never processed fucus.  We were quite adamant in stating to seaweed harvesters that we did not want fucus; we wanted ascophyllum only.  It is a little odd, therefore, that fucus is now mentioned in the processing portfolio.<\/p><p>  I wish to refer to the report of the Joint Sub-Committee on Fisheries published in January 2014, Promoting Sustainable Rural Coastal and Island Communities.  The timeline for some of the actions is quite interesting.  On 1 March, the press release from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta states that at its board meeting on that day, it was agreed to sell the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta shares in Arramara to Acadian Seaplants Limited.  This agreement will be subject to the Minister's approval and legal conditions.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta members were advising the members of the joint sub-committee on 30 April 2013, just two months after the press release on the selling of the company to Acadian.  The recommendation from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta was that the principal objective was to obtain licensed regulation of supply of the seaweed industry. The report was published in January 2014 and, two months later, Arramara made the application for the blanket licence for the region from north Mayo to north Clare.  I find the timeline very interesting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800023#X00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Barrett"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404836400,"counter":369,"content":"<p>Is d&oacute;cha go bhfuil s&eacute; de bhunt&aacute;iste agam f&eacute;in go bhfuil m&eacute; bainte leis seo &oacute; bh&iacute; 2006 ann, nuair a fuair an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s &uacute;in&eacute;ireacht ar Arramara i dtosach, mar bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag obair in Arramara ag an am.

Ceapaim go bhfuil s&eacute; seo mar cheann de na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta&iacute; is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; sa seomra seo riamh.  I want to speak about the aquaculture industry.  We have 220 million acres of sea land, or sea water.  We have 20 million acres of land.  We spend an awful lot of time speaking about land and not enough time speaking about water and the aquaculture industry.  I think today is very important.<\/p><p>  Given that I live in Dublin, those present might be asking what I know about the sea.  I am from Connemara.  My father, Packie Sweeney, was one of the purchasers of seaweed going back years.  He bought ribbon weed, blackweed, laminaria and carrageen from Mayo to Galway to Clare.  There used to be a seaweed factory in Ballyconneely, where I come from, but it is now closed.  When we were children, many people were employed packing carrageen.  Some of them were employed by my father.  Now things have changed and we have to move on.  We need to have sustainable development.  Every fisherman and every purchaser knows it will not last forever.<\/p><p>  Fishermen and harvesters are intelligent people.  The sea and the seabeds would not be in the condition they are in today if they had not harvested properly over the years.  I will explain what I mean by harvested properly.  Fishermen and harvesters know by instinct and by education how to move on from one place to another.  For example, they know how many inches to cut before moving on.  Self-preservation was good regulation, but we cannot have that now.  We need regulations to ensure we have sustainable development.  We have groups like Arramara and Acadian Seaplants at the moment.  Other groups that know nothing about the sea might come in and take over.<\/p><p>  As my party's environment spokesperson in the Seanad, I am very aligned to the preservation of the land and the preservation of the sea.  My culture is also very dear to me.  We have to ensure people who have been harvesting all their lives are looked after.  There are turbary rights and they are with the Queen's estate and the court's estate in the North.  I think we are in the EU.  The turbary rights come.  I have to research it further.  I am not my party's spokesperson on this area.<\/p><p>  The question of folio rights that we have been speaking about today needs to be followed up.  It is known and it is a statutory fact in the North of Ireland that there are inheritance rights with estates.  It is written down in law.  We are always talking about how thing are done differently in the North, but this is an example of something that needs to be examined further here in order that we can see what we have to do.<\/p><p>  I do not think regulation should be led by vested interests.  The communities, the industry and the scientists should work together to ensure best practices for the licences and regulations that are laid down.  One cannot do one without the other, however.  One cannot leave out the communities, the scientists or the industry.  They all play together.  We have to ensure it is included in our gross national product.<\/p><p>  I get worried when I hear about blanket licences that will almost extend from the north to the south.  They might extend from Mayo to Kerry.  We all know what monopolies do to society, for example, in the grocery industry.  We could have the same thing in this case.  I am not saying that is the aim or objective of any company.  It is something we have to flag and prevent.  If one company has a licence from Mayo to Kerry, where will the monopoly stop or start?  We are talking about monopolies in oil, groceries and everything else.  We have to talk about monopolies when it comes to harvesting and sea rights.<\/p><p>  We have to develop regulations for best practice.  We saw what happened when this country had developer-led building.  We allowed vested interests to dictate what was happening.  We might not have had best practice there.  We could not have had it.  We could go down the same road if we allow this to be led by vested interests, developers or monopolies.  I think everyone around the table will agree that we have to focus on how best to protect and manage our sea, which is a valuable resource.  The people who have been harvesting all their lives do not want this industry to go, no more than anyone else wants it to go.  If it goes, they will not have a living.  Self-preservation is the best way to proceed.<\/p><p>  How are we going to operate in this sector?  That is the question.  There are two schools of thought.  I have not heard the answers yet.  I suppose that is what this committee is about.  We need to flesh it out.  We have listened to all sides here today.  I am sorry I could not have been here for the entire meeting, but I was upstairs in the Seanad earlier.  I heard a great deal of what was said.  As the Minister said, we are all looking for the same result.  We need to focus on how we can get that result.  It is important to ensure it is all-inclusive.  Nobody should be left outside the door looking in.  We can see when that happens.<\/p><p>  I would like to speak about the question of access rights, which has not been mentioned here today.  Access rights to the sea go with estates.  Reference has been made to the possibility that the Chinese will come in.  I have heard nothing about that.  A company from Canada is coming in.  Theoretically, various companies will need access.  Mechanical harvesting cannot be permitted because it would devastate the whole thing straight away.  We have manual harvesting, which is facilitated by access from certain points.  One can get in by many means.  If a farmer has rights down to the sea shore, will he have to apply for an access permit if he needs to cross over from A to B past a person who has an inherited right?  I have not heard anyone asking this question.  I would like it to be answered.<\/p> <p> How does one get over it?  I refer to applying for a licence.  The planning process is open.  Information is available on the web.  One can apply or one can object.  Anybody can put in an observation and an appeal can be made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Will there be anything like that to ensure everybody has open access to apply for a licence?  There are many questions which I would like answered.  I know the witnesses will not be able to answer them all today.  However, I think our culture is important also.  We cannot railroad over it just because we want to ensure one body has a licence from Mayo to Kerry.  We all want to ensure Arramara Teoranta which has been taken over continues with the good work because employment is badly needed in the west of Ireland.  We want to ensure we get people in who will employ people.  I started off by saying my father employed people in what one would call the big bad wolf of the old days and, as I said, there was a factory there.  Carrageen was packed and sent off in lorries.  I think there was another buyer in Galway at the time.<\/p><p> This is important but so too is culture.  I know of the medicinal properties of seaweed.  Anybody can go down to the sea and pick a bit.  I presume that right will always be there and a licence will not be needed.  This is one of the most important debates in this country and it applies mostly to the west of Ireland because it goes from the west coast to Rockall.  The east coast is not as long.  It is not just a west coast asset but it is an Irish asset.  It is a huge asset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800024#Y00600","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404837600,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I am not sure we have anyone to answer the questions.

People should consider that if this resource is not being utilised and there is industry that wants to invest, that industry should have the opportunity to do so because one wants to maximise the benefits of these investments to Ireland.  The limit of 25% on any particular licence could be an impediment to the growth of economic benefits in Ireland.

Chile was also mentioned.  If one has co-operatives of harvesters who can negotiate contracts with suppliers and processors, that solves that problem.  It will not necessarily occur.  It is very important that these things are done in a way that is sustainable but that protects the local communities.  The local communities will protect the asset.<\/p><p>  The Senator said it is a valuable asset.  It is not a valuable asset; it is an invaluable asset.  In terms of losing this one like we lost our fish, when I was a young fellow, I could get mackerel, pollack, etc., on the shore for my dinner but one cannot do that anymore because the Spaniards have come in.  The EU has come in and taken everything from us and we let it happen.  We must not let that happen to our seaweed.  The only way to protect it is to keep it in the hands of the local people who will protect it and control it because it is in their vested interest and that of their families that it continues to be there.<\/p><p>  There is another problem, which Mr. Deveau mentioned, namely, a hypothetical 100,000 tonnes.  What happens when one reaches that 100,000 tonnes because there is huge demand and huge growth?  The 25% was mentioned.  If, at the end of the day, it gets to a stage where it is at the ceiling and it cannot get enough, will it still supply its competitors in the same way it did before when there was plenty?  Will it cut its own throat?  If the control is with the suppliers, the harvesters, they will sell to the people who will pay them.  It is then up to the free market.  If one pays the money, one gets the stuff but if one does not, one does not and somebody else gets it.  However, it is there and it is available.  Mr. Deveau is quite correct.  He said he was against monopolies.  Then we should not give the monopoly of a licence. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800025#Z00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean &Oacute; Moch&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1404837600,"counter":382,"content":"<p>Would anyone else like to speak?

Several important comments were made.  The reason we asked for a large portion of the resource is that we believe the seaweed is not only the raw material for the industry.  In Canada, we take a precautionary approach.  Seaweed is also a habitat and it is very important.  It is not only a raw material to be used in the in the industry.  Dozens of different species benefit from that habitat and some of the species are commercially important.  They feed on the resource or they hide in the resource for protection.  Therefore, we need an area that is relatively large so, in Canada we apply a very low exploitation rate to maintain the habitat.<\/p><p>  In Canada, it is very difficult to detect where the habitat is.  Therefore, we go to the same area year after year - three, five or seven years.  We harvest in the same location because we apply a very low exploitation rate to preserve not only the resource but the habitat which is so important for other fisheries.  This is the kind of management that will eventually apply.  <\/p><p>  I do not think there is anything wrong because the resource has been preserved for generations but my experience of 30 years in seaweed management tells me that every time competition arrives in a country, over-exploitation occurs.  That happened in Chile, Peru and even in Canada.  There is no mechanical harvesting in Canada anymore.  Everything is done by hand.  We maximise employment and we guarantee the resource is maintained for the resource itself and for other species.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800025#Z00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Raul Ugarte"},{"type":"speech","time":1404838200,"counter":385,"content":"<p>T&aacute; d&iacute;om&aacute; orm leis an &uacute;dar&aacute;s gur l&aacute;imhse&aacute;ladh an cheist seo mar a l&aacute;imhse&aacute;leadh &iacute;  Ba mhaith liom a fh&aacute;il amach &oacute;n &uacute;dar&aacute;s cad &eacute; an ch&eacute;ad uair ar thuig s&eacute; go raibh cead&uacute;nas ag teast&aacute;il le feamainn a bhaint.

C&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach raibh comh-iarratas d&eacute;anta ar an gcead&uacute;nas idir an monarcha agus iad?  M&aacute; chreid Arramara go mba ceart don mhonarcha an cead&uacute;nas a bheith aige, c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach comh-iarratas a bh&iacute; ann le lucht bainte na feamainne luaite agus ainmnithe air?<\/p><p>  I believe we should not be where we are.  I believe this issue should have been resolved before Acadian Seaplants Limited came in.  I am not aware of when the &uacute;dar&aacute;s and Arramara became aware that there was a legal requirement to have a licence to harvest seaweed.  When I submitted parliamentary questions on this issue, I found people had been looking for licences for some time back.  It seems strange to me that people did not realise licences were required.  Licences were issued as far back as 1966 and it is amazing that all those people who applied since then knew licences were required, but the main processor did not.  That is the question.  I am disappointed also that there was not open consultation by the factory and that a joint application was not made.  Another issue concerns the number of issues affecting Acadian Seaplants Limited, possibly unwittingly on its part.<\/p><p>  The fear is simple and real.  People from the Gaeltacht have been harvesting seaweed for years.  This is one of the industries that has been dominated by Irish speakers from the Gaeltacht.  If, in two or three years time, it is decided they are looking for too much money to cut the seaweed, what is to stop Acadian Seaplants Limited from, as has happened all around these islands, importing cheaper labour and displacing the people we can protect now, by not giving out the licence of the State, in their right to continue to harvest that seaweed?  It is quite simple.  Verbal promises do not count.  Possession is nine tenths of the law.  Unfortunately for the harvesters, they did not realise they needed a licence.  What I want is what we wanted when we transferred the factory to the &uacute;dar&aacute;s, which was a democratically elected authority of the people elected to protect their interests, that this industry be grown for the Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht.  That is what the mandate is.<\/p><p>  There has been a lot of beating about the bush here.  There is an interesting dilemma in regard to the people with a legal ownership right.  The State should find out quickly who owns what.  Having decided on that and on what is owned by the State, I will be unhappy if a licence is issued that does not legally protect the local interest in terms of harvesting.  I would be a lot happier if there were some legal protection.  That could easily have been done by making a joint application and listing all the people with an interest in the contract for the three years.<\/p> <p>This would have protected the seaweed and ensured there was genuine partnership.<\/p><p> There is another technical issue.  When Arramara applied for the licence - I have not seen the application because the public consultation date has not been published yet - it said it was for specific areas and only covers approximately 20% of the foreshore.  I accept that, because significant parts of the foreshore would not have any exploitable seaweed.  Is Arramara looking for an exclusive right to harvest whatever seaweed is on the sections for which it sought a licence?  I understood it was yellow seaweed or feamainn bhu&iacute; it was interested in, but much of what has been said here today suggests we cannot have two or three people harvesting the same areas, even if they are harvesting different species.<\/p><p> Is Arramara saying that even though it may only exploit one type of seaweed in a given area, it is opposed to any other licences being issued for other types of seaweed growing in that area, because this would give rise to management issues, as mentioned earlier?  I am very interested in hearing the technical explanation for this.  If Arramara gets a licence for a particular species, does it expect no other licences will be issued for those patches?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800026#AA00100","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404838800,"counter":387,"content":"<p>Does Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in wish to respond on behalf of the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800027#BB00200","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404838800,"counter":388,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dh&eacute;anamh don mh&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v agus do rud a d&uacute;irt John Bhaba Jeaic &Oacute; Conghaile n&iacute;os luaithe.<\/p><p>  Nuair a rinne m&eacute; an ch&eacute;ad r&aacute;iteas, d&uacute;irt m&eacute; go gcreideann muid n&aacute;r ch&oacute;ir go gcuirfeadh c&oacute;ras rialach&aacute;in bac ar mhion-bainteoir&iacute; - sin iad na bainteoir&iacute; a bh&iacute; ag baint go d&uacute;chasach d&oacute;ibh f&eacute;in.

I understand this to mean that if a person applies for a licence for ascophyllum nodosum, he may get that licence, but this will not impact on the ability of someone else to get a licence to harvest carrageen or chondrus crispus or whatever.  The Department is strict on that.<\/p><p>  In all our dealings with the Department - as a development agency we have been dealing with it for a number of years - our job is to attract investment into the sector and help the sector grow.  The Department is very much aware of its responsibilities in this regard and has a marine licence setting committee.  I know, because two of our clients, one a company in Donegal and the other a start-up company in Connemara, and now also Arramara, have made licence applications, that this is an onerous process.  It is not just a simple matter of downloading a form from the Internet and filling in some details.  The process is onerous and rigorous, particularly in respect of conforming with the National Parks and Wildlife Service requirements.  This committee will probably make recommendations to the Minister and I would like to confirm for it that the existing system is onerous and is designed to protect a State asset.<\/p><p>  To return to the question of the folios, the Department is clear on the fact that this discussion relates to State-owned foreshore.  People must understand that if it is not State-owned foreshore, the Department does not have any rights to grant or withhold licences.<\/p><p>  &Oacute; thaobh chomh-iarratais or joint applications agus mar sin de, f&aacute;gfaidh m&eacute; faoin gcomhlacht f&eacute;in n&iacute;os m&oacute; a r&aacute; faoi sin.  On the surface, joint applications seem a nice aspiration, but my understanding of the harvesting community is that some are more active than others.  Some 200 or 300 people have harvested for Arramara traditionally and the practicality of including all of these in one licence application would be cumbersome.<\/p><p>  There has been significant emphasis on the rights that go with a licence, but there are also huge responsibilities.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is trying to ensure somebody takes responsibility for the sustainable harvesting of this national asset.  If we do not ensure it is harvested sustainably, we will be made do it by Brussels.  The Department needs to be able to identify people who will be responsible for sustainable harvesting.  While not impossible, that is much more difficult to do if the responsibility is spread over 200 or 300 harvesters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800027#BB00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Mac Eochaidh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404838800,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Le cead &oacute;n &uacute;dar&aacute;s, ba mhaith liom labhairt &oacute; hata iar-fhosta&iacute; de chuid an &uacute;dar&aacute;is agus mar bhainisteoir Arramara faoi l&aacute;thair.

He asked about the seaweed species in the application submitted by Arramara.  The application relates specifically to the <i>ascophyllum nodosum<\/i>and fucus species, which grow in the intertidal zone and are often interspersed.  If <i>ascophyllum<\/i>was the only species covered by the application, it would be next to impossible to ensure nothing other than ascophyllum would be harvested.  There is always a by-catch associated with such harvesting.  The Arramara application does not cover any other species of seaweed, such as <i>laminaria<\/i>, <i>palmaria<\/i>or <i>chondrus crispus<\/i>.  They would have to be dealt with by means of other applications or through some other future approach.<br \/>The Deputy also asked about foreign workers.  As I mentioned in my opening comments, we operate five processing facilities in very rural parts of Canada that are not dissimilar to the Connemara area.  We have worked very closely with the local communities in those environments to ensure the seaweed is harvested by people from those specific communities.  That system has worked extremely well.  I will give an example of what I mean when I talk about &quot;local communities&quot;.  In Leitir M&oacute;ir, we work with people from Leitir M&oacute;ir.  In other localised areas, we work with people from those areas.  By working closely with local people as we have done in the Canadian examples I have mentioned, we have developed some very successful partnerships.  People have been able to depend on this work for their livelihoods.<br \/>Some people prefer not to have to go to Dublin for work - not that there is anything wrong with Dublin - but they are not sure whether they can depend on work being available.  People in rural communities need opportunities so they can depend on having an ongoing ability to get employment.  We believe that if a proper licensed environment is in place in this sector, people will want to stay in their local areas and take up this kind of work on an ongoing basis.  That is something very powerful, in our opinion.  It puts the harvesting and processing communities in a position to be able to create value added products in a rural environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800028#CC00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jean-Paul Deveau"},{"type":"speech","time":1404839400,"counter":393,"content":"<p>An bhfuil an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v s&aacute;sta?

It is good to see that this approach is working in the global village.  We are competing internationally.  Obviously, Acadian Seaplants is coming here because of seaweed.  Not every place in the world has seaweed.  We have that in our favour.  It is the job of the State, the Government and the different Departments to get this right.  The delegates have explained very well how they deal fairly with people.  The State agencies and the Government are responsible for putting in place the proper regulatory framework.  If one of these companies was taken over in the morning and we were dealing with different personalities, the Government would have to ensure on the licensing and the competition sides that the people are protected.<br \/>Licensing is a complex area.  I would be reluctant to go down the line advocated by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v by saying that we should proceed exclusively on the basis of people's folios and that only such people have rights.  People have long-standing rights that need to be protected and respected.  These rights equate to people's livelihoods.  I would urge some caution in this regard.  When we started to formalise and regulate the operation of quarries in Ireland a few years ago, our efforts did not protect the legitimate quarry people <i>per se<\/i>.  Anybody who had dug a hole in the ground - the extent of the digging they did could have been done by me - was entitled to claim it was a quarry.  The challenge we face is to get this right.  I know that is why we are having this debate.<br \/>It is exciting to hear what the representatives of companies that rely on seaweed have to say.  There is no doubt that they have a real passion for the industry.  They want a bite of the apple as well.  The way to go is to accommodate people and provide for the right system.  We should not create a monopoly, even if that is done inadvertently through State agencies, etc.  I appreciate that Acadian Seaplants is intent on ensuring a monopoly does not develop.  The public good, which is referred to in the licensing document and encompasses environmental and cultural factors and the will of the people, is tempered by other things like competition law and the need to get the licence right.<br \/>I wish to make a final point.  An tUasal Mac Eochaidh said that Acadian Seaplants was chosen because it is in a position to invest and grow.  We have been told it is investing approximately &euro;2 million.  What are the plans?  Can the witnesses paint a picture for us?  How can this country hope to benefit from all of their expertise and experience?  This country's many harvesters want to work with the company and get a proper return.  How can that be facilitated?  Will the efforts that are being made to avoid the development of a monopoly assist people like Mr. O'Sullivan, who is concerned about whether he will get more seaweed if he wants it?  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta has said it will give priority to certain people, but how far will it go in that respect?  Where is the cut-off point?  Will it impede people's ability to grow their businesses?  If that is a reality, we need it on the table.  How will the company deal with people like Mr. Quinn, who have not had dealings with Arramara and are afraid that their harvesters will be taken and they will be unable to get seaweed?  I will conclude because we have to vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800028#CC00800","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1404840000,"counter":399,"content":"<p>I will allow Deputy Pringle to make a brief comment as he has been waiting for a long time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800029#DD00100","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1404840000,"counter":400,"content":"<p>Is the meeting being suspended or adjourned?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800029#DD00200","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1404840000,"counter":401,"content":"<p>Deputy Pringle may ask a question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800029#DD00300","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1404840000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I will be brief as this has been a lengthy meeting.  It appears that Acadian Seaplants would like to transplant to Ireland a model that works for the company in Canada without recognising that the system in place here is working.  The seaweed forum has described it as a working and sustainable system.  As such, it is not necessary to impose on the harvesters who have been employed in this area for many years the model that Acadian Seaplants would like to operate here.<\/p><p>  Arramara Teoranta has been operating for 67 years.  Perhaps the representatives of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta or former managers of Arramara Teoranta will indicate the number of times in the company's 67 years of operation that supply has run out, seaweed has been harvested in an unsustainable manner or production has been shut down.  This would give members an indication of the magnitude of the problem that the new licensing regime is intended to remedy.  <\/p><p>  On the licences, we learned that Acadian Seaplants is applying for a licence to harvest 75% of available seaweed resources.  This would give rise to what would, to all intents and purposes, be a monopoly.  Clearly, the monopoly in place in Canada works well for the company given that it is seeking to secure control of the seaweed resource here. <\/p><p>  We heard that it is necessary to guarantee supply to a commercial entity.  How would harvesters be guaranteed an income under the proposed licensing regime?  If they are unhappy with the regime implemented by Acadian Seaplants, where can they sell their products given that the licence will cover the entire west coast?  <\/p><p>  We heard that past performance is a good indicator of future performance.  The joint committee received a submission from another company that included a product service information brochure from Acadian Seaplants, which described Irish seaweed products as inferior to its products.  Is this an ethical approach to advertising?  Is it appropriate to attack products from another country?  Does this indicate how business will be done when the company operates here?  If past performance is an indicator of future behaviour, what can the harvesters expect from their dealings with the company?<\/p><p>  I apologise to the representatives of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as my Gaeilge is not good enough to ask questions as Gaeilge.  I will, therefore, stick to B&eacute;arla.  When &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta gave evidence to the sub-committee an agreement had already been reached to sell Arramara Teoranta to Acadian Seaplants.  Should &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta not have informed the sub-committee at the time that it had sold its interest in Arramara Teoranta?  Does &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta see its role as being a development agency for Gaeltacht areas?  Having exited seaweed production, does it have a role in seaweed harvesting?<\/p><p>  We heard from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta that it was looking for a strategic partner to come on board.  Rather than entering a strategic partnership, it chose to sell Arramara Teoranta.  How did the relationship with Acadian Seaplants evolve?  Is there a partnership in place between &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and the company?  We also heard that if Acadian Seaplants does not live up to the agreement in respect of existing suppliers, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will have a right to take back up to 40% of the shares?  Is it not the case that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta will have a right to acquire 40% of the shares and does acquisition not entail purchasing rather than taking back the shares?  Perhaps the representatives of Acadian Seaplants will indicate whether there is an agreement in place whereby &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is entitled to take back 40% of the company if certain conditions are not met?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800029#DD00400","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1404840000,"counter":403,"content":"<p>The Department with responsibility for the marine used to take a nod and wink approach and would not say a word about licences because the issue was too sensitive and could create uproar.  This approach was considered acceptable for years, as we have just been told.  We were informed that Arramara Teoranta would apply for a licence for the cutters to safeguard them from any new legislation that might be introduced and they would not have any problem continuing to harvest as usual.  This is not the way the licence has worked out, however.  If it was the case that the licence was applied for to save the cutters and those working on the shore line, we would not be afraid.  It seems, however, that the licence was issued in a certain manner and when various people were informed, some of them were not very happy.  The process is similar to the scenario set out by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v in that we were to have a joint application between the cutters, owners and so forth as this would protect us from an extensive licence that would come from Dublin, Brussels or elsewhere.  If this had been done and we had been consulted, we might not be in the current position.  The current approach is creating more fog on the line, which is the reason we want to protect what we do.  The solution is simple.  We want investment by Acadian Seaplants and development but we also want to protect those who are most vulnerable because it is the most vulnerable who will be kicked out if anything goes wrong.  The money that was referred to does not compute with me, but maybe I am too simple to understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800029#DD00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Murch&uacute;"},{"type":"speech","time":1404840000,"counter":404,"content":"<p>I do not believe Mr. &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is simple.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014070800029#DD00600","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1404840000,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Mr. &Oacute; Murch&uacute; has got to the nub of the issue.  I was shocked by a comment made by Mr. Mac Giolla Bhr&iacute;de.  He was told by civil servants not to comply with the law, which has been in place since 1973.  It appears offered him this advice because they did not want him to disabuse people of the simple belief that they owned the seaweed.  The people who knew the position did not tell the harvesters, which allowed everyone to live in cloud cuckoo land, believing that the harvester owned the material he was selling to the factory.  After years of being led to believe this was the case, we have learned that Arramara Teoranta and the Department were conniving to keep people in the dark about the real position.  People suddenly woke up to find that not only do they not own the seaweed but that a company is to be awarded the harvesting licence and will be able to bring in anybody it wishes to harvest the material the harvesters believed they had owned for years.  While that may not be the legal position, it is the human position.  I am being told in a committee of Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann that this approach was perpetrated by senior civil servants who told Mr. Mac Giolla Bhr&iacute;de not to apply the law.

We have a wealth of experience in this specific seaweed, which is the exact same seaweed species.

I do not see the regulation of supply being an impediment to the actual supply of raw material or the availability of it.<br \/>I want to clarify a further issue.

I think everybody in the room agrees that regulation of supply is something that is very much required, and that was seen in advance back in 2006.

There has been almost a <i>de facto<\/i>situation in which there is only one commercial entity operating in a geographical area.  The challenge we see - and we have seen this before - is competitive activity, where two commercial entities are trying to get a certain quantity of seaweed from the same geographical area.

When one organisation is expecting some seaweed to be there it is not, and <i>vice versa<\/i>.

First, he raised the issue of product comparisons by companies in the marketplace.  Companies in the marketplace are always looking for points of differentiation of their products versus the competitors.  That is a fact of life.

The real gains to be made lie in getting people, particularly those involved in agriculture, to use these classes of products which, in turn, will create a larger market for everyone.  That industry-cluster type of relationship is a great way to build a larger industry and market, not just in Ireland but also across the world, which would be to our benefit and that of BioAtlantis, Brandon Products Limited and other producers.<\/p><p> If harvesters are unhappy, what can be done to remedy it?  We know that not every harvester will be happy.  What is important is that the community of harvesters is happy and that they have an industry on which they can depend.  If that is happening, it is successful.<\/p><p> I commented on a three year harvesting licence.  If, after three years, someone had not followed the necessary regulations, the Government could impose conditions in renewing the licence or not renew it at all.

Deputies, Senators, Excellencies, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and honour to make a presentation to the Joint Committee on European Affairs on the programme of the Italian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  A copy of the programme - a document of 76 pages divided into ten sections dealing with topics including foreign affairs, the economy, justice, home affairs, employment, health, agriculture, the environment, competitiveness, education, youth, culture and sport - has been distributed.<\/p><p>  I launched the Italian Presidency at the Department of the Taoiseach in the presence of Deputy Dominic Hannigan, the Chairman of this committee.<\/p> <p>On that occasion I outlined the priorities of this programme, which focuses on the need for growth in order to give new impetus to European and global economic recovery and bridge the gap between EU institutions and the people of Europe.  As the Italian Prime Minister pointed out in his speech to the European Parliament on 2 July, Italy intends to do its utmost to ensure the EU has its own identity, ideals and common values.<\/p><p> As a founder member of the Union and a net contributor to its budget, Italy believes in the European institutions.  In the words of the Prime Minister of Italy, it does so with the courage and pride of those who give rather than those who ask.  Italy does not attribute to the EU the faults of its current crisis and the crises of other European countries.  The results of the last European election are proof of this.  However, Italy is committed to achieving the objectives of a smart Europe that is centred on simplification of the institutions and unification of diverse positions.<\/p><p> When I spoke to him the other week, the Chairman of this committee, Deputy Hannigan, pointed to two major concerns for Ireland.  First, he referred to the dialogue between national parliaments and the European Parliament.  This is a typical political task.  It is not in the hands of diplomats; it is in the hands of the elected representatives of national parliaments.  Second, he spoke about the role of the UK and the possibility of its exit from the Union.  The Italian Prime Minister, Mr. Renzi, was very clear on that concern when he said the EU without the UK would not only be a less rich Europe but also simply a lesser Europe.<\/p><p> In view of the new impetus behind the European project, and in a world that runs at a much faster pace than our world, it is essential to focus on growth.  For this reason, the Italian Presidency will place a special focus on certain issues, such as the Europe-Asia meeting that will take place in Milan in the second half of October.  It will also preview another major event that will take place in the same city next year - the Milan Expo 2015, in which Ireland has shown a very keen interest.  For the same reason, the Italian Presidency will support the prosecution of the negotiation of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership in order to achieve a balanced and comprehensive agreement based on reciprocity.  We think the focus on those objectives will help our general economic situation.<\/p><p> I would like to comment on the macroeconomic framework.  The Stability and Growth Pact stands on two pillars.  The first pillar is not sufficient to secure the future of Europe without the second pillar.  For this reason, I read with pleasure today that the Irish Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is backing the Italian push for more flexibility in budget rules.  I believe this is a major concern in light of the Italian situation.  Despite years of budget cuts and increased taxes, public debt in Italy is still growing.  The only way to address this, apart from the taking the necessary reform measures, is to increase gross domestic product.  Italy maintains that a review of the EU six-pack and two-pack rules may offer an opportunity to press for greater flexibility in the application of the Union's budget rules.<\/p><p> With regard to the real economy, the Union must concentrate on information technology, on the fight against climate change, on the move towards an even more sustainable economy and, above all, on the enhancement of human capital.  In his speech last week, Mr. Renzi underlined several times the importance of the European civil service in this context.  For Italy, Europe must also become a place of the future, not only as an ideal border but also as a physical and geographical Europe.  On the one hand, Europe must work to stop the tragedies of victims in the Mediterranean Sea caused by the difficulties in countries of northern Africa, particularly Libya, through the Frontex operation.  On the other hand, Europe must overturn its approach and demonstrate that it is an active protagonist in the economic framework and, above all, in the human context.<\/p><p> On another plane, Europe must be worthy of its great responsibility and must listen to the voices in Ukraine and elsewhere in the east of our continent that are asking for freedom and for more European involvement.  For this reason, we have to bear in mind that we cannot build Europe against our largest neighbour.  For the same reason, we think we have to guarantee young Palestinians the right to grow in a nation.  At the same time, we must make a commitment to the right and the duty of Israel to exist.  All the other major international crises which affect us directly and indirectly, such as the conflicts in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, will be followed with great attention by the Italian Presidency.<\/p><p> I will conclude by using the same words used by the Prime Minister when he addressed those who were not yet 18 years of age at the time of the signature of the Maastricht treaty.  He said they needed to rediscover themselves as Telemachus, the son of Ulysses, who is well known in Ireland thanks to James Joyce.  He said those of this generation should not stand and wait but should instead meditate on what they have inherited from their fathers, and that the fate of young Europeans is to carry on their shoulders our great common traditions in order to ensure their own futures.  He said this needed to be done as a duty not only to future generations but also to those who died throughout the ages, so that Europe would be not only a geographical expression but also \"an expression of the soul\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014070800003#B00300","nonspeaker":"H.E.

I thank him for his presentation and for providing the committee in advance with a detailed copy of Italy's agenda for its Presidency over the next six months.  If we as politicians have learned anything from the recent European elections, it is that the citizens of Europe are not content with the way we have been operating the Union for their benefit.  That is obvious from the increases in the level of euroscepticism and in the number of eurosceptic MEPs.  I suppose this is a challenge for all of us.  Unfortunately or fortunately, the challenge will be led by the Italian Presidency.  I would like to get a better understanding of how Italy intends to address the issues that arose from the recent election, such as the growth in euroscepticism and the recognition that something is not right from the point of view of citizens.  The elected Members who are often referred to as the political elite are frequently accused of not being in touch with the public.  If we are to reach out to citizens across Europe, what needs to be done to regain their trust and confidence in the European project?  That is my first question.  It is not just a challenge for the sake of a challenge.  The success or failure of the efforts of Italy and all member states that are pro-European will hinge on how we protect against the gradual break-up of the Union.  We do not know whether our nearest neighbour will be successful in its efforts to exit the Union.<\/p> <p>It appears the British Prime Minister will facilitate the British people having an opportunity to vote on the question.  A UK exit would signal a difficult period ahead as it could start a gradual break-up for the European Union.  How does Italy propose to address this significant problem?  While other issues such as financial matters and the need to create jobs and growth are very much part of the problem, the bigger issue, one that we have failed to address, is the perception of what the Union is and should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014070800004#C00300","speaker":"976","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404825300,"counter":462,"content":"<p>I welcome the ambassador and thank him for his attendance.  He has answered one of the questions I intended to ask.  I congratulate Italy on raising the issue of member states' budgetary obligations.  As the ambassador noted, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, is positively disposed to agreeing to the concept proposed by Italy.<\/p><p>  The ambassador is from a country that attracts significant media coverage owing to the difficulties it is experiencing as a result of an influx of immigrants.  We see horrible pictures of Africans climbing over barbed wire fences in Ceuta and overcrowded ships leaving ports in north Africa.  We hear of the sums of money that human traffickers are making from this type of exploitation.  We also see images of many of these poor unfortunate people dead on arrival or at the point of being rescued.  It is worthwhile recording our appreciation of the humanitarian work being done by the Italian Government, especially as Ireland is so far removed from the large influx of human beings Italy is experiencing and the ensuing human tragedy.<\/p><p>  The immediate problem may be one for Italy but, as a member of the European Union, how does Italy believe Europe should be equipped to address the issue?  Does the ambassador agree that people will always seek to flee areas of crisis and that they have the right to do so?  One must be rather cynical about what is taking place in north Africa in the sense that vast sums of money can be collected and boats can be loaded in certain ports and the national authorities appear to be happy to facilitate the movement of human cargo, with its great potential for loss of life.<\/p><p>  Given its importance, size and the strength of its military and navy, what role does the ambassador envisage for Italy in the European Union's maritime security strategy?  We hear about various European bodies which are ostensibly trying to protect the Union's borders.  Greece is known to be an entry point for illegal immigrants and an EU body, known as FRONTEX, has been given the role of controlling migration and tackling human trafficking.  What relationship does Italy have with the countries from which the large cargoes of human misery originate?  What should be the European Union's position on fortress Europe, a concept with which I do not argue?  Ireland is a small island which has experienced significant immigration, much of it illegal, and claims rights for 60,000 emigrants who live illegally in the United States.  The Irish Immigrant Council, among other organisations, argues that we are hypocrites because the issue of immigration to this country needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>  Immigration is a significant issue that is also tied into the issue of international security.  We see the vicious struggles in Iraq and Syria and we are constantly reminded that many of the young, impressionable Muslims from Europe who are travelling to the region to fight in these wars may return as subversives.  The current turmoil in the world, including Europe, is being exacerbated by the terrible practice of human trafficking.  Will the European Union, under the Italian Presidency, address the issue in a manner that will reverse the trend?<\/p><p>  Baroness Ashton may not like the words \"battle group\" but it appears in the communiqu&eacute;, which refers to rapid reaction capability issues and the usability of battle groups.  As an Italian diplomat and representative of his country, does the ambassador applaud the unilateral decision of France to deploy troops to Mali to prevent the overthrow of its Government by Muslim fundamentalists?  Is it acceptable that Europe must react to crises by having France and other powers act unilaterally, rather than the European Union taking action through battle groups?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014070800005#D00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1404825300,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I am not sure the ambassador is in a position to answer the Deputy's final question, which may be a matter for France.

We expect Italy to understand the economic circumstances throughout Europe better than most other European Union member states.  We have been trying to explain the position to other member states in recent years, with some degree of success.<\/p><p>  I note the points the ambassador makes on Europe having an identity and agree that Europe must have an identity.  This must be a result of dialogue between European institutions and national institutions where there appears to have been a breakdown in communications in recent times.  This has caused the growth in euroscepticism, a trend to which my colleagues alluded.  Unfortunately, if one studies the history of Europe, one will readily recognise that, over the centuries, the Continent has reached a similar juncture on more than one occasion.  When Europe becomes dissatisfied with itself and what it has, it always looks elsewhere for greener pastures.  This striving for a better place has not always succeeded and I have no doubt that if the current trajectory is maintained, Europe may well find itself in a more difficult place, particularly in the political sense.<\/p><p>  I echo the words of my colleagues, Deputies Timmy Dooley and Eric Byrne, in the sense that if Europe decides to depart from the centre and individual member states seek to follow their own path, politically, socially and economically, they should first be asked to consider the history of Europe because history has shown that this is not the correct way to go.  We do not seem to want to talk or walk in the same direction or at the same time.  That, unfortunately, has been the tragedy of Europe.  The people of Europe paid a high price when the European ideal was disregarded in the past.  Various meetings of COSAC and other bodies have called for the ideals of the founding fathers to be borne in mind to a much greater extent than they are at present.<\/p> <p>I believe that the economic issues that confront us are only temporary.  They will disappear in time provided we act upon them but they will not disappear overnight.  There never was a situation in Europe, the US or worldwide where such economic issues would disappear overnight, so it will not happen that way.<\/p><p> How Europe evolves from here on will be the legacy that the present generation will give to future generations if it is a worthwhile legacy.  If Europe decides to co-operate, to converge to a certain extent with the agreement of the various member states but not necessarily held by any one in particular, while at the same time having due regard for each other's position, it can evolve in a concise and cohesive manner which would be of benefit to the future generations of European people.  For example, as there is much agitation about immigration in certain European countries, we need to address that important issue.  Is it a code for something else?  Is it something that we understand or do not understand?  If there is a need to address an issue in that context, it should be addressed at European level with the full support of all EU countries, not just the Italians who have to address the issue of refugees at the front line.  Each EU country has an input and it is not sufficient for some countries to resile from responsibilities or an issue.  In that regard it will have huge consequences at some stage in the future.<\/p><p> Youth employment is hugely important in terms of stabilising the economy and the social fabric of European society.  The degree to which the Italian Presidency is successful in dealing with this issue will have a huge impact in the short term as well as in the medium and long term.  If in the course of its term the Italian Presidency can achieve reasonable progress in that area, that will stabilise the European Union Presidency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014070800005#D00400","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1404825900,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I apologise for my late arrival which is due to a number of votes in the Seanad.  I welcome the ambassador and wish the Italian Presidency every success in the next six months.<\/p><p>  The issue I wish to raise is mentioned in the ambassador's submission, that is, health care and health research.  He referred to the Dublin declaration of ten years ago on the issue of a joint approach in dealing with HIV and AIDS.  I wish to touch on medical research.  As a group, the 28 member states of the European Union have not worked as well as we could in the whole area of medical research.  It is an important area on which we need to focus given that 70% of people outside the EU who are interested in research end up working in the US and do not come into Europe.  As this is an area in which we all have a part to play, perhaps we could do more work together with member states, particularly since this has been highlighted as part of the programme of the Presidency.<\/p><p>  There should be much more co-operation between member states in the area of health.  We have a problem in Ireland where we are trying to get people in from developing countries to work in our health service.  For example, we have 4,900 junior doctors in Irish hospitals, 54% of whom are not Irish graduates.  A medical friend of mine who attended a conference in Sweden met some Italian doctors, following which I am advised that there are a huge number of junior doctors in Italy who are suitably qualified and cannot get employment.  From our point of view this would be an ideal opportunity to try to build links with Italian universities who are producing medical graduates and medical training programmes by bringing in people from Italy to work here rather than seeking them outside the EU.  Is that an area in which there could be much more co-operation?  I am talking not only about co-operation between Italy and Ireland but co-operation between all member states in the area of health care professionals.<\/p><p>  A Harvard study published last week indicated that health care professionals are the most difficult to recruit due to a world demand and a world shortage.  That group has been identified as the group where one is least likely to be successful in recruiting.  Given that junior doctors in Italy find it difficult to get employment, as conveyed back to me from the conference in Sweden six or eight weeks ago, can some work be done, as part of the programme, on more co-operation on health care and health research across the 28 member states?<\/p><p>  The EU directive on cross-border health care passed in February 2011, which is being implemented in each member state, provides that people may travel from one member state to another member state if they cannot get it in their own member state.  Perhaps the ambassador would refer to this in his reply as health care is an extremely important issue for every member state.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014070800006#E00300","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1404825900,"counter":467,"content":"<p>Deputy Dominic Hannigan took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1404825900,"counter":468,"content":"<p>I welcome the ambassador.

It is not easy to answer all those questions which have many common links.  The first issue related to the challenges to achieve more growth and especially youth employment and the gap between politics and public opinion.  The Italian Presidency is facing many challenges.  Prime Minister Renzi's programme is very ambitious but he is a very ambitious man.  He has proved that being ambitious can sometimes be very effective.  The results of the Italian European election are proof of that.  His political campaign was focused on European and international issues and he got an incredible result as the party he leads got 41% of the votes.  He is in a strong political position.<\/p> <p>This will enable him to have a better Presidency and will help him achieve the major reforms required in Italy.  We have a serious unemployment problem in Italy, more serious than that in Ireland, with approximately 18% of the population and 40% of our youth unemployed.  In the southern part of Italy in particular, the unemployment level touches dramatic figures.  Therefore, there is much to be done.<\/p><p> In Italy, we must achieve reforms which have already been achieved in other countries, such as in Germany and Spain.  This reform will not be easy, but it must be achieved to deregulate the system and help those without jobs to get jobs.  An important meeting was scheduled to discuss growth and youth unemployment.  This meeting was scheduled to take place in Turin in the next few days, but it has been postponed for security reasons and will probably take place in November.<\/p><p> I read a very funny article written by a French economist on how the 3% was decided 30 years ago and how we must stick to it now.  While it is an important figure, I believe the solution to the issues is to consider what we can exclude from this 3%, such as infrastructure investments which would help the creation of jobs and so on.  I see that as one of the major battles of our Presidency with our European partners.  I hope we can achieve something, because otherwise the gap I mentioned previously, between public opinion and the European institutions, will not be bridged.  The view of the Italian Foreign Ministry is that there is no future apart from Europe.<\/p><p> This year, we are celebrating two important anniversaries, of the First and Second World Wars, and many books have been written recently on both.  Every country, including Ireland, paid highly with the blood of their citizens during these two wars.  We must avoid a recurrence of these events because of the problems facing our young people.  I have met some of these young people, including one from my own town in Italy.  It is true we face major problems in Europe.  These problems seem more difficult to resolve because we face a period of low growth and other important international issues, such as immigration.  It is hard for me to believe that in Europe, where the young generation travels from one country to another with just an identity document, where we have a common currency for most countries and where young people can spend a year of their university course in another country, we will return to a situation like that we had 30 years ago, when the European project already existed, but not in the current state.  It is a long process.<\/p><p> We are, perhaps, paying for success which saw a fast enlargement of the European Union.  We moved slowly from six to nine countries and then 15 and then moved quickly to 28 and could get even bigger.  We must now go through a \"digestive\" process to bring together our common values.  At the same time, we must maintain a Europe where each country retains its differences and specialties, but where we all become more European.  The borders of Europe go back centuries, but despite borders there has been a large contribution by Ireland.  Irish monks built monasteries all around Europe and these seem of more influence than the Roman influence which created the idea of Europe.<\/p><p> We need to make a major achievement on growth and I expect to see negotiation on this between the political actors.  Italy, through its Presidency, is working on that direction and we were pleased to see the Irish Minister for Finance supports our way of thinking.  I believe change is on the way.  The other day, I read an interesting article which suggested the European Central Bank will use the European Investment Bank to accelerate investment.  I was not aware of it, but apparently the European Investment Bank can take money from the European Central Bank.  Of course, being part of the European institutions, it is easier to get money and to spend it or give it to companies and not only other banks.  Therefore, we have a way to achieve better things, but through the hands of specialists.<\/p><p> We may not solve other major issues, such as immigration, an issue to which I will return.  As the Senator pointed out, many Italians are leaving Italy to go to other European countries.  This is not easy to do.  If someone was trained to be a nurse in Italy and decides to go to Scandinavia or Germany, he or she must learn another language, although we are European and it is easier now to make a move like this.  More and more people are leaving their own country to go to another European country.  This movement is good.  Many young Italian people who came to Ireland were able to find jobs.  If we look back, the origin of the Italian presence in Ireland goes back to the 1920s.  It is surprising that some Italians came here just before Ireland became independent and they were able to create something that did not exist here, fish and chip shops, and also create new jobs for Irish people.  This helped them to integrate well into Irish society.  We must learn from them and be optimistic.<\/p><p> I believe the mix of experiences will help Europe to grow.  I was pleased to see in Trinity College, where there is important emphasis on physics, the department of nanotechnology is directed by an Italian physicist and has 400 people working in it.  It is achieving incredible results and receiving aid not only from the Irish Government but also from private companies, American ones in particular.  This means American money is being invested here in Europe.  I welcome everything to do with the Erasmus programme and would encourage further investment in it.<\/p> <p>The exchange of experiences will help Europe to recover and to create new job opportunities.  That goes back to immigration problems.  It is a tragedy and we will not stop it with boats.  There was a major concern when last summer the number of casualties started to rise in such a dramatic way that Italy decided to set up an operation called Mare Nostrum in order to prevent people who are trying to come to Europe dying between the southern and northern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. <\/p><p> There are several major concerns.  That wave of emigrants comes from all around the world, not just from Africa or northern Africa, but from Asia, including from China, Afghanistan and Pakistan.  There are up to 50 different nationalities on those boats.  That creates two kinds of problem.  The first is that our public opinion is not prepared to receive such numbers and the variety of cultures is very difficult to handle.  <\/p><p> Italy was one of the biggest exporters of people for decades.  There are the same number of people of Italian origin abroad as there are in Italy.  The majority of Italians who went to America, north and south, Australia and around the world achieved incredible success.  It is true that it is not easy to handle but we do not have to take only a negative view of those people, partly because there are jobs Italians do not want to do any more.  There is, on the other hand, a decrease in population which will be a major problem in the next 15 or 20 years in Italy as the population gets older with no young people to look after it.<\/p><p> The situation in Ireland is rather different but we have things in common because young people are leaving the country.  Ireland is recovering well compared with other European countries but there are still young people who are not happy.  It is easier for them because they speak English which is the most international language.  What can we do to help those people?  First, there must be more unity among European countries.  We are carrying a heavy burden because these people come first to Italy.  People forget that we have a small island, Lampedusa, which is much closer to the shore of north Africa than to Malta.  Many people pay a high price to come to Europe and there are an increasing number of criminals exploiting that.  Last week, our navy stopped a boat on which there were more than 50 dead people.  They had paid just to die.<\/p><p> A proposal was made to ask the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, UNHCR, to open offices in Libya to set up human rights controls.  A few days ago there was a big conference in Morocco.  The northern African countries face the same problems because not everyone will cross the Mediterranean Sea.  They will stay there and the governments must deal with those problems every day.  I was in Morocco for three years at the beginning of this century.  It was dramatic because people will try to go from Morocco to Spain in extreme conditions and at that time Spain could not be left alone.  One can see Spain across the sea from Tangiers.  It is only 15 km away.  That is not the easiest route.  They will go through the Canary Islands to go to Spain because apparently that is much easier.  There were casualties every day in the Strait of Gibraltar.<\/p><p> We have to help the countries that receive this large number of refugees.  It is not easy.  The numbers are in the millions.  Information moves faster and faster in modern society.  Television channels can be picked up in the middle of the African desert.  One has only to connect a television set with a battery.  When I was in Central America, everyone had a mobile phone and knew what was going on. <\/p><p> We have to be realistic.  We have to be united which would be the beginning of a solution.  Many of these people are well educated.  There are engineers, doctors and so on coming from Syria.  They are leaving their country because they know their lives are at risk.  They do not want to stay in Italy because they know people in Germany or in France or have relatives there.  We cannot stop them going to those other countries.  It is a very complex situation we face because we are on the front line.  We are asking our European partners for help and slowly the message is getting through.  We hope during this semester there will be more focus on this very important issue.<\/p><p> The economic situation is severe.  I am glad to see that certain countries are recovering faster than others.  I read some optimistic figures for Ireland.  Today, there is a very important summit in Venice about the digital economy.  I read that in Ireland alone the digital economy could in the next ten years create approximately 100,000 new jobs.  That is a very specialised area and I do not know what the outcome will be but it is being discussed in Venice.  I do not want to live in a dream world but we do not have to be negative about the future of Europe.  Let us see the good things and what we can achieve together.<\/p><p> Our future can only be a closer Europe.  If we were to lose a part of the EU, such as the United Kingdom, which is not a small part, that would be very dramatic, particularly for Ireland.<\/p> <p>The United Kingdom will not be able to get European aid to assist with Northern Ireland and the problems will arise again.  The Irish people know our British friends better than anyone else so perhaps they can do something on this issue.  I am preoccupied by the numbers as I read that over 40% of the British people are unaware of Britain's membership of the European Union.  This indicates the British Government has failed in its responsibility to keep British citizens informed and will face major problems with the Scottish referendum.<\/p><p> Our future is in Europe and there is a newly formed European Parliament that will sit for five years.  Italian Members of the European Parliament are in touch with the Italian Parliament so there is a constant dialogue.  National parliaments must point things out in Strasbourg and there are things we can do to make things less onerous in Europe.  For example, during the elections the Prime Minister, Mr. Matteo Renzi, pointed out that there have been discussions in Brussels on the size of fishing hooks used for tuna in the Mediterranean.  This may be an important issue but it is relatively small compared to other issues related to the Mediterranean.  In Rome, we feel we must return to a more political Europe or there is no future.<\/p><p> The Italian Presidency will last only six months, the new European Parliament will sit for five years and a new European Commission will begin its work shortly.  The other week the Commission was in Rome and held major meetings with the Italian Prime Minister and President, who is a keen European.  The goals of the Italian Presidency were made clear and we should be ambitious, as Mr. Renzi said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2014070800006#E00800","nonspeaker":"H.E.

This is a difficult job to handle as five Senators and ten Members of Italian Parliament are elected abroad.  There are major voting districts involved in this - four Italian Members of Parliament and one or two Senators are elected from south America.  Representatives are elected for those regions where the majority of Italians reside and many live in south and north America.  The problem is, the Italo-Argentine elected as an MP for Rome will also represent Italians resident in Honduras.  The Italian in Honduras will not know who his MP is and it will be very difficult to ask him questions.<\/p><p>  It is a difficult process to handle because around 4.5 million people with Italian passports live outside the country.  Ballot papers are sent to where we think these people live but often they do not receive them because they changed address or country and did not inform us.  Often we only find out a person has changed country when he or she goes to renew his or her passport at a different consulate.  Perhaps a person was in Buenos Aires but moved to Sydney - the consulate in Sydney will have to contact its counterpart in Buenos Aires to ensure everything is acceptable.<\/p><p>  It costs a fortune to allow these people to vote.  We calculated that each vote cast from abroad in the European election prior to the most recent one cost approximately &euro;150.  In the sense that I must deal with such problems, I am a technician.  Our French colleagues came up with a solution to this whereby, when a European or national election is to take place, those who wish to participate can submit their names to the relevant consulate or embassy.  This makes things easier because many people living abroad are not even interested in voting and sending them all the information by post is very expensive.  Timing is also a factor because we cannot send the relevant papers too far in advance of an election and often we only have three or four weeks to do the entire job.  At such times embassies and consulates must stop the many tasks and projects in which they are involved to focus solely on this work.  We have pointed out to Italian politicians that a different approach would be better.<\/p><p>  Italians living abroad were granted the right to vote in these elections only 15 years ago.
