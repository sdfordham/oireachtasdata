The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes. The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC. It does not, therefore, involve the award of credits.<\/p>  <p>  To be eligible for the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, a person must: <\/p>  <p>  - Permanently live in the State (exception may be made where EU regulations apply),<\/p>  <p>  - Be aged under 66, <\/p>  <p>  - Have started insurable employment or self-employment before the age of 56, <\/p>  <p>  - Not work full-time, although for the purposes of this scheme, a person can work and earn less than &euro;38 gross per week, <\/p>  <p>  - Care for a child (under 12) or an incapacitated person on a full-time basis. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a SPC. The standard qualifying conditions for the SPC must also be satisfied.  These require a person to enter insurable employment at least ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate (credited contributions do not satisfy this condition) and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited on their record. <\/p>  <p>  Where someone age 66 or over does not satisfy the conditions to qualify for a SPC, or qualifies for less than the maximum rate, they may instead qualify for one the following: <\/p>  <p>  - The means-tested State pension (non-contributory). The maximum personal rate of this pension is &euro;219, which may be payable if their means are no more than &euro;30 per week. A reduced rate may be payable if their means are no more than &euro;245 per week. A living alone allowance may also be paid, where applicable. <\/p>  <p>  - If a spouse receives the SPC, the other spouse may receive a payment, known as an increase for qualified adult (IQA), which may be up to &euro;206.30 per week. <\/p>  <p>  - If widowed, they may qualify for a widow's contributory pension, which they may claim either based on their spouse&rsquo;s or their own social insurance record. The qualifying conditions for this require fewer contributions paid (260) than the SPC, and the maximum personal rate for those aged 66 or over is &euro;230.30. <\/p>  <p>  Where a person qualifies for more than one of the above payments, they are paid under the pension that is most advantageous to them. <\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced from 1994, and as with most schemes, this was without retrospective effect. Costs in relation to this scheme, under the current rules, are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994. The cost of backdating was considered in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions in 2007.  At that time, very tentative estimates suggested that the cost of backdating to 1953 would be approximately &euro;160 million annually.  These additional costs would be very significant and consequently, the Government has no plans to backdate this scheme prior to 1994. Any decision to change the scheme would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100068#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Allowance Data","counter":82,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100068#WRB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":83,"qnumday":36,"qnumall":"[6236\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100068#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of applicants in receipt of a winter fuel allowance at the start of the 2014-2015 season who had their eligibility revoked due to a social welfare payment change, that is, applicants on jobseeker's allowance changing to illness benefit, in County Donegal; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

In order to qualify for the tax relief currently, a minimum donation of &euro;250 per annum must be made to the body concerned.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, changes were made to the scheme of tax relief for donations to approved bodies in Finance Act 2013 as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Donations from all individual donors under the scheme are treated in the same manner, with the tax relief in all cases being repaid to the charity. <\/p>  <p>  - A blended rate of relief of 31% applies to all taxpayers regardless of their marginal tax rate. All donations are grossed up as was previously done for donations from individuals within the PAYE collection system. <\/p>  <p>  - The charitable donations scheme has been removed from the scope of the high earners' restriction in recognition of the fact that donors will no longer benefit from the tax relief associated with their donations. <\/p>  <p>  - An annual donation limit of &euro;1 million per individual, for which a refund of income tax can be claimed by approved bodies, has been applied. <\/p>  <p>  These changes were made following a process of engagement between officials at the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners with representatives of the charities sector from the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group (ICTR). <\/p>  <p>  The objectives of that process were threefold: (i) to simplify the operation of the regime, (ii) to reduce the administrative overheads on charities and on the Revenue Commissioners incurred in the operation of the scheme, and (iii) to ensure that any change would be Revenue neutral from the Exchequer perspective. The proposals for the changes were also recommended in the Report of the Forum on Philanthropy and Fundraising.<\/p>  <p>  The &euro;250 threshold has not changed since it was introduced in 2002. Normal inflation levels effectively have reduced the value of the threshold over time. In addition, the donations scheme was introduced to encourage the donation of large sums of money to charities and certain other bodies. It was never envisaged that the scheme should subsidise smaller donations, which in all likelihood, would be made in any event.<\/p>  <p>  The tax relief available for donations is already very generous and\u00a0donations can be cumulative, such that a donation of just &euro;5 per week over the course of a year would qualify. However,\u00a0tax relief is no longer provided to individual\u00a0donors and is refunded directly to the approved bodies. It is therefore questionable as to whether\u00a0reducing the &euro;250 limit would result in additional\u00a0donations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100068#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Property Leases","counter":102,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100068#WRB02550"},{"type":"question","counter":103,"qnumday":44,"qnumall":"[6206\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100068#WRB02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will address concerns raised in correspondence (details supplied) regarding a proposal by a person to establish a small business in a property controlled by the National Asset Management Agency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

I am glad to inform the Deputy that 2014 was a record year for both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in terms of investment wins and job creation, with 7,131 net new jobs being created in IDA Ireland client companies and 8,476 net new jobs being created in Enterprise Ireland client companies.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 was launched on 29th  January last.  This is the fourth annual plan in a multi-year process, which began in 2012.  When the First Action Plan for Jobs was launched, unemployment stood at 15.1%.   Today it stands at 10.6% and we are on track to exceed our target of 100,000 additional jobs by 2016. We are now setting a goal to bring employment to 2.1 million by 2018 &ndash; 2 years ahead of our original target.<\/p>  <p>  We are determined to ensure that every region will benefit from the recovery.  Yesterday, along with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, I announced the details of a comprehensive new strategy to support enterprise growth and job creation at regional level.   The Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative seeks to build on the success of the annual Action Plan for Jobs process by developing locally driven plans that can build on the strengths and opportunities identified in each region.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy will provide up to &euro;250 million over five years in additional funding to support regional enterprise development.  This includes the roll out of a five year, &euro;150 million property investment programme by the IDA to attract foreign direct investment into the regions.   This programme will build on the recent investment by the IDA in a number of advance manufacturing facilities in regional locations.  A further sum of up to &euro;100 million will be available to Enterprise Ireland to support enterprises in the regions to start-up, grow and export, thereby creating more jobs in regional locations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100069#WRC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Enterprise Centres","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100069#WRC02750"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[6303\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100069#WRC02800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his plans to open the business development management grant scheme, administered through Enterprise Ireland; when applications will open; the budget that might be attributed to such a scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Action Plan for Jobs &ndash; Regional - is based on the principle that the best way to support job-creation in towns and villages across the country is to support agencies and organisations within 8 regions, to build on the particular strengths and assets of their area and drive new job-creation strategies and projects.  <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The Strategy is based on the successful Action Plan for Jobs model of setting out lists of actions with timelines and responsibility allocated, and then monitoring implementation. <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I will lead the initiative. Each of the 8 regions will develop its own Action Plan. It is my intention that all Regional Plans will be published or in development by July 2015. <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Under the Strategy, Enterprise Ireland will launch a series of new competitive funding initiatives in the areas of entrepreneurship, innovation, enterprise infrastructure and job creation. The objective is to bring forward fresh collaborative initiatives to boost enterprise and job creation in the region. An initial fund of &euro;50 million is to be made available for three competitive calls. <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The first of these competitive calls, with a budget of &euro;5 million, will focus on community-driven enterprise initiatives and how all the local players, public and private, can work together to maximise job creation.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The Community Enterprise Initiatives Fund call will be open to existing Community Enterprise Centres (CECs) and also to any other organisation or groups of organisations with innovative ideas to create jobs, promote entrepreneurship, boost innovation or enhance exports. It should be open to any credible and novel approach rather than simply replicating what has been done before.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The criteria in any such competition will be announced by Enterprise Ireland, but the typical criteria will include:<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">-Promoting a culture of entrepreneurship locally and regionally;<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">-Developing capacity to start up and scale companies; filling gaps in enterprise facilities;<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">-Building on existing strengths or opportunities, e.g. developing a sectoral opportunity where there is a competitive advantage<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">-Devising a credible plan to deliver added value in jobs and start-ups and increased level of exporting \/ potential exporters<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">-Commitment of matching finance<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">-Bringing originality in approach, objectives, leverage of other stakeholders<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">-Leveraging off other enterprise support (Mentoring, funding, networks)<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">-Promoting public and private partnership, e.g. alignment\/collaboration with others players (e.g. LEO, ETB, HEIs, Chambers etc.)<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I believe this is a significant challenge and a significant opportunity for the Community Enterprise Centres, in collaboration with others, to deliver new businesses and jobs in their locality.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100069#WRC02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":171,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100069#WRC03000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Value for Money Reviews","counter":170,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100069#WRC02950"},{"type":"question","counter":171,"qnumday":70,"qnumall":"[6247\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100069#WRC03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the independent value for money assessments his Department has scrutinised, in order to sanction the co-funding for the operational programme for fisheries and aquaculture, in view of the limited employment created by aquaculture, in comparison to the tourism and angling industries.","asker":"1192","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":172,"content":"<p>My Department is presently finalising a new Seafood Development Programme 2014-2020 under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) Regulation (508\/2014).

The aim of the legislation is to seek to effectively eliminate, in so far as is possible, the need for judges to commit anyone to prison for the non-payment of a fine. As well as introducing an option for persons to pay fines by instalment, there are also changes in the way those who fail to pay fines are dealt with, with a range of options available to judges including recovery orders, attachment of earnings, community service and ultimately imprisonment.<br\/><br\/>Work is ongoing in preparing for the implementation of the Act. The area most directly affected by the changes is the Courts and the Courts Service is working on a number of developments which will ensure that the implementation of the legislation, and the new procedures which will operate under it, are as efficient as possible.<br\/><br\/>In relation to the introduction of payment of fines by instalment, a decision was taken to outsource all aspects of the recovery of fines to an external provider. The Courts Service is introducing new arrangements for the payment of fines which will allow payments to be made in a range of outlets across the country, and not just through Courts Service offices. There are significant changes in information technology required to ensure that the instalment payment system operates effectively and that the necessary accounting procedures are in place for the recording of payments. Changes are also required in the way that information is transferred between the Courts Service and An Garda Siochana to ensure that both organisations have fully up to date information on the cases and their current status.<br\/><br\/>It is expected that all the preparations for the new system will be completed by the third quarter of 2015. While it is desirable that the Act be commenced as soon as possible, it is important that these preparations are done correctly to ensure that the significant changes being implemented in the fines system as a result of this legislation are implemented smoothly and effectively from the start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100070#WRD04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":257,"qnumday":95,"qnumall":"[6227\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100070#WRD04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of female prisoners jailed in the State for each year since 2010; the percentage of all prisoners this represents; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1069","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":258,"content":"<p>The number of female committals for each year since 2010 is set out in the table below.

The Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. It provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children.<\/p>  <p>  The School Completion Programme was subject to a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure in 2011, requiring an annual reduction in budget of 6.5% in the period 2012-2014, from &euro;30.258m in 2011 to the 2014 allocation of &euro;24.756m. Since 1st January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects. The Agency has approved local projects' school retention plans for the 2014\/2015 academic year. The first instalment of 2014\/15 funding issued to local projects last September. Further payments totalling approximately &euro;9.5m have issued over the past month, with a third instalment planned for payment in May 2015.   <\/p>  <p>  The estimate for the Child and Family Agency for 2015 is &euro;631 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation.

This includes my priorities for consideration in the development of the Agency's 2015 Business Plan.

It is being carried out by the ESRI following a procurement process managed by the Agency.

I am aware that the Health Service Executive does, where possible, assist children with special needs who may require additional support to enable them to avail of pre-school services in mainstream settings.  <br\/><br\/>To ensure that the ECCE programme is more accessible to children with special needs, a number of additional provisions have been added.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  <br\/><br\/>The free pre-school programme is designed to be delivered for three hours per day, five days per week, over 38 weeks (183 days per year), and capitation fees are paid to participating services on the basis of this provision.  The provision is based on the primary school model, under which primary schools are required to open on 193 days per year (equivalent to 38.6 weeks).  There are no plans to increase the current provision within the pre-school year or to extend the age range for eligibility.  <br\/><br\/>A total of some &euro;175 million is spent on the ECCE scheme annually in which some 67,000 children receive free pre-school care and education. The Government succeeded in maintaining the pre-school year on a universal and free basis despite the difficult budgetary situation that prevailed in recent years.While considerable progress has been made in correcting the overall budgetary situation, the funding available to my Department following the completion of budgetary process this year does not allow for an increase in the capitation paid to childcare providers. As the economy improves and the public finances recover, I would hope that the capitation rates for all childcare programmes could be improved.<br\/><br\/>To ensure that all the benefits of childcare investments are fully realised, future public investment in childcare must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated.  I am establishing a cross-Departmental group to look at the provision right across the 0 to 6 age group as well as to consider the after-school needs of older school-going children. It is crucial that we develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare services.<b><\/b>This new group will include representatives of the Departments of Education and Skills, Social Protection, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Public Expenditure and Reform, Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach and will be led and supported by my Department.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100071#WRE02000","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Protection","counter":293,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100071#WRE02050"},{"type":"question","counter":294,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[6324\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100071#WRE02100","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the action he will take on the 8,000 cases of child abuse, neglect and welfare concern, and to end these serious crimes, inflicted on innocent children, as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":295,"content":"<p>I am replying on the basis that the Deputy's question relates to the number of child welfare and  protection cases which are with the Child and Family Agency and which do not have an allocated social worker. <br\/><br\/>As of November 2014, the Child and Family Agency has advised that a total of 19,988 children were in receipt of a dedicated social work service.

Under these provisions, persons who are insured with (covered by) the healthcare system of one EU member state are entitled to receive healthcare in the public system of another member state in certain circumstances, at the cost of the member state in which they are insured.  Such persons may include:<br\/><br\/>-people who are employed in one member state and resident in another and their dependants,<br\/><br\/>-pensioners of one member state who reside in another and their dependants,<br\/><br\/>-visitors to one member state from another, and<br\/><br\/>-persons referred for treatment to another member state.<br\/><br\/>The EU Regulations provide for the costs to be reimbursed between member states. The Regulations also allow for two or more states to agree alternative arrangements for reimbursement other than those laid down in the Regulations, or to mutually waive reimbursement altogether.  <br\/><br\/>Ireland's primary interaction has been and continues to be with the United Kingdom with whom it operates a bilateral healthcare reimbursement agreement, covering such persons as temporary visitors between the two countries, pensioners of one country and their dependants residing in the other country, and the dependant families of persons employed in the other country. Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis.  The amount payable is the net difference between the costs to the Irish health services of providing care to those with only UK entitlements and the cost to the UK health services of providing services to those with only Irish entitlements.  The amount payable is agreed following compilation of the necessary data and discussions between the two administrations.  Payments are made in advance and are subject to final settlement once all necessary statistical and financial information is complete. Total payments in any one year can as a consequence relate to both final settlements in respect of previous years' liabilities and advance payments in respect of the current and\/or previous years. The net payment received by Ireland from the United Kingdom was &euro;100m in 2008; &euro;286m in 2009, &euro;320m in 2010; &euro;270m in 2011; &euro;220m in 2012; &euro;220m in 2013 and &euro;172m in 2014.  These amounts represent the actual payments made in cash in these years and do not correspond to the full liability for that particular year.<br\/><br\/>As explained below, only a small portion of the above payments relates to UK visitors to Ireland and Irish visitors to the UK.  By far the largest part of the payment received from the UK authorities on an annual basis relates to the provision of healthcare to UK pensioners and their dependants residing in Ireland. Entirely separate arrangements apply to patient referrals for scheduled treatment in the other jurisdiction whereby the costs arising are reimbursed on an actual costs basis. These arrangements are administered by the Health Service Executive.<br\/><br\/>The amount payable in any one year attributable to temporary visitors between Ireland and the UK (i.e. EHIC type costs) is determined by the estimated number of visitor days and an estimate of the average cost of providing healthcare treatment.  The finalisation of accounts is normally some years in arrears to facilitate collation of relevant statistics and for the approval of the average cost prepared by each country for the year concerned at EU level.

In October 2013, during the universal periodic review of Israel&rsquo;s human rights record, Ireland expressed this concern and urged Israel to fully implement the recommendations of the February 2013 UNICEF report, entitled &quot;Children in Israeli Military Detention&quot;.  <br \/><br \/>We recommended that Israel end urgently night arrests of Palestinian children, the admissibility in evidence in military courts of written confessions in Hebrew signed by Palestinian children, the use of solitary confinement and the denial of access to family members or to legal representation.<br \/><br \/>Bilaterally, our concerns regarding the detention of Palestinian minors have been raised as part of our ongoing dialogue with the Israeli authorities on the overall situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel&rsquo;s treatment of the Palestinian population, both with the Israeli Embassy here and through our own Embassy in Tel Aviv.<br \/><br \/>We cannot attempt to follow each specific case in which these issues arise.  The case cited by the Deputy has not previously come to the attention of my Department, although it is a clear example of the reasons why these practices are of such concern.<br \/><br \/>In my view, Palestinian children should be afforded the same rights and protections under the law which Israel rightly considers to be appropriate for Israeli children living alongside them.<br \/><br \/>The overall human rights situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including the treatment of children in detention, remains a matter of concern and will continue to be raised in the relevant multilateral fora, and to feature in the EU's broader concerns about human rights in the area. <br \/><br \/>Similar concerns would exist in relation to the detention of children in many other states in the region.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100072#WRF01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100072#WRF01200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Language Schools","counter":355,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100072#WRF01150"},{"type":"question","counter":356,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[6158\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100072#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her plans to deal with the lack of regulation in relation to agencies and persons that recruit students from outside the European Union for college courses here, particularly in relation to those dropping out of, or failing to turn up for, the courses, and the lack of any monitoring or check-up on their attendance, in conjunction with colleges and language schools in the State.","asker":"1192","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":357,"content":"<p>Ireland has an excellent international reputation for the quality of education services delivered to both our own citizens and those who come here from abroad.  The vast majority of providers of education and training to international students in the State operate to a high standard and are motivated by the desire to enable learners to reach their potential.  However, it is evident that a minority of providers do not operate to the same standards, with serious implications for students and the reputation of the wider sector. <br\/><br\/>  For this reason, I announced robust regulatory reforms to the international education sector together with the Minister for Justice and Equality on 2nd September 2014.  These reforms are designed to provide certainty and clarity for international students coming to Ireland, to prioritise education over work, to give effect to an enhanced inspection and compliance regime and to safeguard the strong international reputation of high-quality Irish education providers. <br\/><br\/>  A key pillar of these reforms is a strengthened and more integrated inspection regime, including an enhanced inspection function for the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) and the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), which will be linked to Revenue, the Department of Social Protection and the National Employment Rights Authority.  Officials from my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality are co-operating closely on the arrangements for the implementation of the reforms and when finalised, these will be brought to Government for approval.<br\/><br\/>  Another key pillar of the regulatory reforms for international education is the International Education Mark and related Code of Practice.  The Code of Practice, which is currently being finalised by QQI, includes requirements relating to the protection of enrolled learners, treatment of fees and tax compliance, and will also address other 'non-academic' issues such as recruitment, marketing and accommodation.  Providers will have to demonstrate compliance with the Code before being authorised to use the Mark.<br\/><br\/>  The Mark will be used both as a driver of quality within institutions and as a marketing tool to underpin the promotional activities of Enterprise Ireland in seeking to attract international learners to Ireland.

It is more than prudent from an audit and financial accountability point of view that we validate the data underlying these payments and ensure that payment is made only once in relation to each pupil.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100073#WRG03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Data","counter":408,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100073#WRG03350"},{"type":"question","counter":409,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[6278\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100073#WRG03400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views that the creation of the primary online database without the protection of the provisions of the Statistics Act 1996 is an appropriate method of gathering and processing the personal data of primary school children.","asker":"1052","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":410,"content":"<p>The statistics Act 1993  Under this Act \"Information collected may be used only for statistical purposes, and no details that might be related to an identifiable person or business undertaking may be divulged to any other government department or body.\"   The primary purpose of POD will be to monitor the education progress of primary pupils (in DES aided schools), throughout the primary system and onwards to post primary level and to help them develop their full educational potential.

The tender process, which is being led by Pobal, is almost complete. Following on from this, a panel of regional suppliers will be contracted to provide the equipment within specific regional areas. As the market for the equipment is well established, it was neither necessary nor appropriate to engage in consultations with the market on the matter prior to the tender process.<\/p>  <p>  This new approach will reduce the administrative burden for the many hundreds of community and voluntary groups registered under the Scheme, who provide an excellent service for the elderly. It will enable the groups to concentrate on the main purpose of the Scheme, namely to support and interact with the elderly in the local community. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100074#WRH01500","answer":true,"speaker":"964"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Staff","counter":453,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100074#WRH01550"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[6203\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021100074#WRH01600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if local authorities can include a clause in employee contracts forbidding them contacting local elected representatives regarding grievances connected to their employment or work.","asker":"1102","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":455,"content":"<p>Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.
