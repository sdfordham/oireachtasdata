I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to attend.  As the Chairman stated, I propose to refer to some key points in my opening statement to speed things along and allow as much opportunity as possible for the committee to ask questions.<\/p><p>  I am joined today by Mr. Eamonn O'Dea, assistant secretary in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, who will be answering questions with me.  We will be talking today in general terms as we are precluded from discussing the affairs of any individual taxpayer.  As the committee will appreciate, policy matters are a matter for the Minister for Finance and as we are only four weeks from the budget there may be some tax policy issues that I am unable to elaborate on at this time.<\/p><p>  The tax arrangements of some multinational corporations have received a good deal of attention in recent times.  It is now a mainstream issue of interest.  Tax planning by multinationals has evolved to take advantage of the differences between jurisdictions' tax codes which provide opportunities for some multinational corporations to reduce their tax liabilities.  Some of the international rules are also perceived as being outdated.  It is recognised as a complex global problem.  The opportunity for this type of arrangement has come about because of the change from traditional business models to the new models involving integrated global supply chains and the digital economy, where national borders become less relevant and the location of profit generation becomes more difficult to specify or identify.<\/p><p>  The task facing tax policy makers and legislators throughout the world is to put the appropriate rules in place to ensure as much consistency as possible which, in turn, will provide tax authorities as well as international companies with a greater degree of certainty with regard to where and how income should be taxed.<\/p><p>  The OECD is regarded as the pre-eminent authority on tax policy for international business.  Policymakers face an increasingly difficult balancing act in the current environment.  They must design tax rules which stimulate economic growth on the one hand while also managing to increase tax revenues.  Tax policy is also at the core of national sovereignty and each country is free to devise its tax system in a way it considers most appropriate.  OECD studies have indicated that international competitiveness concerns and pressures are felt in all countries.  In addition, OECD research has shown that corporate taxation is the most harmful to economic growth prospects.<\/p><p>  The base erosion and profit shifting project was born at OECD level backed by political stimulus.  The G20 leaders meeting in Mexico in June 2012 explicitly referred to the need to prevent base erosion and profit shifting.  The project has continued to be politically endorsed at the highest level internationally.  In July the OECD's Pascal Saint-Amans told this sub-committee about the OECD plans for this project over the next two years, so I will not dwell on it here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52013091800003#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Tobin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379509500,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Tobin.

In the past, many of those queries have focused on jurisdictions other than Ireland.  In this instance, however, we are among a number of other countries that have been asked to provide information.  I understand from what the European Commission has said that other countries may also be asked to provide information.

For many years the initial focus at OECD level was on trying to ensure there was no double taxation, but now things have almost flipped around completely.  There is a concern about ensuring there is no double non-taxation.  The primary focus on this issue is at OECD level through the BEPS project.  It could be argued that if the project was not in place, we would almost have to create it at this point because there is such mainstream interest in the taxation of multinationals and such political desire for action to be taken.  I am aware that Mr. Saint-Amans was here to talk about the BEPS project.  Those involved in it are planning to examine 15 areas in the next 24 months.  Like all other OECD members, Ireland will be involved in the discussion groups and, obviously, we will try to do our level best to ensure the outcome is satisfactory from an Irish perspective.<\/p><p>  In addition to the OECD initiative, ongoing discussions on taxation are taking place at European level.  We have seen some developments in recent days with regard to the financial transactions tax.  I understand this committee has asked some of my colleagues to appear before it in the next couple of weeks to discuss some issues in that area.  There are ongoing talks on the common consolidated corporate tax base issue.  During the course of the Irish Presidency we tried to help that discussion to move forward in what we felt was a realistic way.  The international tax architecture is very complex.  A number of things are happening in different places.  We have prepared a slide - unfortunately, I do not have copies with me - that tries to map the international tax landscape.

This was the initial approach to a competitive corporation tax regime - and to which Professor Barry referred yesterday - which was introduced in the 1950s.  However, that changed in 1980 when we moved to a 10% rate for manufacturing relief.  There was a period from 1980 to 1990 when companies that had already been investing and had substantial operations in Ireland focused on exporting and availing of this export sales relief.  Their profits continued to enjoy the benefits of this export sales relief for a further ten years from 1980 to 1990.  Every walk of life has its own jargon or technicalities but certainly in tax there is often reference to grandfathering where an arrangement is carried over for a specified time.  In this case the carryover arrangement was set out in law and it was part of our statute that while we were bringing in an effective 10% rate, by virtue of manufacturing relief, at the request of the European Union, for a transitional period, for a ten-year period, export sales relief would continue to be available for companies already entitled to it.

Such planning involves tax practitioners arbitraging between different countries' tax systems, trying to identify where the differences exist and evaluating whether they can be exploited.  This is just one example of that.  At present, the OECD is examining this area internationally through the base erosion and profiting shifting, BEPS, process.  It has set a very aggressive timeframe in respect of the next 12 to 24 months.  Once that happens, the question that will arise will relate to the likely response.  For example, will the said response come at national or international level?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52013091800009#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Tobin"},{"type":"speech","time":1379512500,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Let us deal with BEPS.

Undoubtedly, the current demand for action flows from the financial crisis and the fact that taxpayers feel they are having to live with austerity.  Historically, it seems that whenever there is a global recession, international tax rules tend to be looked at.  In the 1960s when the US was in similar trouble it introduced its subpart F rules, which introduced certain restrictions.  That is the context.  You are right, Vice Chairman.  There are many large multinational companies that have been in this country for more than 30 years.  They were here long before some of the international rules and US rules were in place.  It is not my job to try to defend multinational companies.  They can do that themselves but to be fair, in certain situations what one has seen are companies responding to changes in rules that happen in the US and elsewhere and they build structures around those rules.  Some companies were in Ireland and elsewhere long before some of the rules were put in place.  For example, the check-the-box rules to which reference was made, were only introduced in the US in the late 1990s.  One could certainly argue that those companies did not come to this country to exploit those rules because they were here before the rules existed.<\/p><p>  Deputy Doherty quoted from the testimony that was presented to the Senate hearing.

I will deal with the second question first.  The Deputy is correct that a number of European countries are in the process of introducing ring-fenced regimes for certain types of income.  In the case of the UK, it is planning to introduce a 10% regime by 2018 but there are a number of other jurisdictions that have those regimes in place.  The Netherlands has what it calls an innovation box and there is also one in Cyprus and Spain.  It is a matter of public record that a number of countries have raised concerns around some of those regimes.  Even the German Finance Minister, Mr. Sch&auml;uble went on public record essentially criticising those types of regime.  He said that he would not particularly be in favour of them.  It is also a matter of public record that some of those regimes are being examined at a European level in terms of their appropriateness.  We are certainly aware of those regimes but given the question mark that is over the patent box regimes internationally at the moment it is questionable whether this country should be thinking about introducing such a regime when it is so controversial.  I would expect that when those discussions happen at a European level it may become clearer whether such regimes are regarded as fair tax competition.  We will wait and see.  We are certainly aware of what is going on and are following developments.  It is one tax controversy that at the moment we are not involved in and we do not have any desire to get involved in it.<\/p><p>  In regard to other jurisdictions that have two-tier structures, again, I emphasise that the whole issue is around mismatches between different tax codes.  I would prefer not to name countries but there are other two-tier structures which do not involve this country.  They are used and we must be mindful that if we make a change to our tax regime we will not solve the problem of two-tier structures.  It is an international issue.  Part of it is around adopting the appropriate transfer price for extremely valuable intellectual property.  Those kinds of decisions must be taken at an international level and essentially by the OECD.  That is why it is open to question as to whether unilateral action or multilateral action is the appropriate way to go.

The cost of doing business in this country was significantly greater than in Poland and Dell left.

The OECD has done a lot of work on the issues of tax and growth.  It carried out some major research on this subject back in 2008 and then engaged in further research in 2010.  Without going into masses of detail, essentially, what it found was that, broadly, a 1% increase in the corporation tax rate internationally tended to reduce foreign direct investment in the country concerned by approximately 3.7%.  For example, if there was an increase of 2.5% in the corporation tax rate, it would reduce foreign direct investment in the country concerned by approximately 10%.  This is an OECD study which is not Ireland-specific and some would argue that were one to apply such methodology to Ireland, the figure would actually be higher.  In other words, were there to be a 2.5% increase in the Irish corporation tax rate, the fall-off in foreign direct investment would actually be higher than 10%.  There appears to be a strong and statistically significant link between the corporation tax rate and the attractiveness for foreign direct investment in the country in question.  Again, I have to hand a chart that I photocopied and which I can distribute to members, if they wish.  It shows effective corporation tax rates across the European Union, as measured by the European Commission's methodology.  It tends to show that countries in the core European Union tend to have higher corporation tax rates than those on the periphery.  When one observes this on a colour graph, it is very obvious and from an economic perspective, that the reasoning behind this is quite clear, that multinational companies tend to locate in countries that have big markets because they wish to be near these markets.  Therefore, to get them to locate in more peripheral locations, other factors must come into play.  Even if one considers Scandinavian countries which we traditionally perceive to be high tax entities, their effective corporation tax rates actually are not very high.  Consequently, there is a strong, recognised and acknowledged link between foreign direct investment and corporation tax rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52013091800011#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Tobin"},{"type":"speech","time":1379513700,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tobin for his reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52013091800011#K00300","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1379513700,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Pearse Doherty wish to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52013091800011#K00400","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1379513700,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Yes, I wish to come in on a few points, although I may not get the time to do so.

They will set out for us what their operations in the country comprise and how they relate to other parts of the company if it is a branch located here.  Consequently, it is on that basis, looking at the specifics, that it could be cost plus, cost plus and a percentage of receipts, or a profit split.  There are various methods, but it depends on the facts and circumstances involved.  We do not have a formula that we will apply on a rule of thumb basis to these companies in general.

I will not go into the effective tax rate because I do not think we have time but I would like to go into that.  It is a quick question.<\/p><p>  On the investigation that has been launched by the European Commission, we can play around with words stating that it is requiring information, etc.  It is requiring information about specific companies.  I note that the Commission asks for information on taxes and state aid regularly enough, but I would say it is rare that it has pinpointed specific companies, the Revenue's rulings on specific companies and the assurances the Revenue has given in relation to specific companies.  I would hope that the Commission does not ask for this regularly in terms of rulings.<\/p><p>  The question I am asking is simple.  Would this have a major impact, if the Commission found that the Revenue was in breach of state aid?  As I understand it, there would be a requirement on the State to carry out certain actions to recoup that money.

What we have attempted to emphasise and be very emphatic about is that there is no such approach here, that we deal with the facts and circumstances of particular cases by reference to international principles in attributing the profits to those companies.  There are no special arrangements.  There is no discriminatory approach.  We do not address international structures.<\/p><p>  The point I tried to make early on, in response to the valid question, was that it is important to make clear the distinction between the rates that transnational companies or transnational groups of companies might be able to achieve and what a sovereign nation offers.  We need global rules for global entities but we have our national rules for the national profits arising.  It is understandable how people would be concerned if high-profile and, apparently, very highly-profitable companies end up paying low average rates across jurisdictions.  That may well be understandably a source of concern.  However, in terms of Ireland's role and the role of the Revenue Commissioners, we ensure that the branches and companies operating here are taxed according to the same rule that goes across all companies and there is no discriminatory aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI52013091800012#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamonn O'Dea"},{"type":"speech","time":1379514300,"counter":131,"content":"<p>That is not the question I asked.

The conflict in Syria is a tragedy and a humanitarian disaster, but it is also a complex challenge, touching on international law and issues surrounding the spread of chemical and other weapons.  The scale of each of these challenges is huge and their resolution will not be simple in such a difficult and unstable environment.<\/p><p>  We have all been witness to Syria's agony for far too long.  I know some committee members travelled to the Middle East this summer to witness the dire situation of Syrian refugees in Jordan.  I visited refugee camps in Turkey earlier this year.  Members will have seen the terrible effects of the conflict and know full well the appalling suffering which those who have escaped the war are still enduring.  The circumstances of those who have not fled and are still in Syria in the middle of appalling violence are unbearable.<\/p><p>  Over 4 million Syrians out of a population of 20 million have been driven from their homes and are now internally displaced within Syria.  A further 2 million refugees have fled to Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon.  More than 100,000 Syrians have been killed since the conflict began and almost 7 million Syrians are in dire humanitarian need.  These figures are so large that they are difficult for us to fully comprehend, masking to some extent the horrific scale of the crisis.  Almost 40% of registered schoolchildren have dropped out of school in a country which had close to full enrolment in education before the conflict began.  The United Nations reported that half of the children aged between six and 12 years from displaced families in Aleppo were forced to work because their fathers were dead, disabled or missing.  These are the equally shocking and under-reported consequences of war - the destruction of future generations.  We have received reports of a health system in crisis, with the United Nations reporting that one third of health workers in some areas had left the country.  The Syrian-Arab Red Crescent has lost 22 volunteers since the conflict began - medical volunteers killed while performing humanitarian tasks.  The United Nations has lost 11 of its own staff.  This is a merciless conflict and the misery it is inflicting is unacceptable.<\/p><p>  This is a conflict in which there has proved to be precious little respect for the duties and responsibilities of all parties to protect civilians, support the work of humanitarian agencies and groups and protect those providing medical or other essential needs for the civilian population.  Irrespective of whether they fight for the Syrian state or opposition groups, all parties to the conflict are bound under international law, to say nothing of basic humanity, to uphold these duties.  These failures and the growing reports of groups of foreign radicals affiliated to Al-Qaeda or other extremists becoming involved in Syria are profoundly worrying for the future of Syria. Syrian society needs not just an end to combat but also the promise of a stable and free society in the future.  Respect for international law means a society which protects its people and upholds human values.  Syria's future stability and prosperity are dependent on the survival of these values.<\/p><p>  The attack on Ghouta and other areas around Damascus on the morning of 21 August represented a new low in this endless litany of horrors.  We all saw the images of children lined up on the floor of hospitals wrapped for burial.  This cowardly and cynical attack was aimed at opposition controlled suburbs of Damascus.  This is not a battlefield but a residential area.  The video and photographic evidence of toddlers gassed to death in the middle of the night is proof enough for us to know that this was aimed at a defenceless civilian population sleeping in their beds.  We do not know exactly how many people died, but some estimates speak of over 1,400 killed and several thousand injured.  The UN inspectors' report issued earlier this week shows clearly that they died from exposure to the sarin nerve agent delivered by surface to surface missiles.  The information available points very clearly towards Syrian state forces as the responsible party for this horrific crime.  As I have stated previously, this is a very serious war crime.  It is true that many more people have died already in the course of the conflict.  It is also true that for those victims, it is of no consolation to have been killed or wounded by conventional weapons rather than chemical weapons, but the world has long agreed that the use of chemical weapons is a crime.  It has been illegal since 1925 when the nations of the world decided following the terrible human cost of the First World War that these weapons were too terrible to use in any circumstance.  There is no use of chemical weapons which is legal.  Syria is a signatory to the 1925 agreement and in breach of the commitments it owes to the international community.  I have stated this new violation of international law, just the latest in a long list of abuses perpetrated on the Syrian people, must be addressed by the international community.  There cannot be any impunity for leaders or anyone under them who carries out these crimes.  The use of these weapons has been viewed with horror by the international community and we cannot allow those who would seek to introduce their use anywhere to succeed.<\/p><p>  Many other foreign Ministers and I have previously called for the UN Security Council to refer the Syrian conflict to the International Criminal Court.  The long list of violations of international law in the course of the war is all too clear and the legal means for Syria's people to seek accountability and justice are non-existent.  There can be no long-term peace in Syria without justice for the victims of the war.  It would be far better for Syrians to have recourse to an accountable and fair justice system in Syria and perhaps this can be achieved in the future.  However, until such time as Syria can provide legal redress for the suffering of the victims, the International Criminal Court remains the only path to justice for the Syrian people.<\/p><p>  Last Saturday I welcomed the news of the agreement by the United States and Russia of a framework for the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons.  The implementation of this agreement will improve the security of the Middle East region as a whole, for which the existence of Syria's chemical weapons was a threat and, above all, of the Syrian people who have suffered at the hands of their own Government's use of chemical weapons.  The implementation of the agreement is what matters most at this point and the key factor for its success is the compliance of the Syrian regime.  I am not labouring under any illusion as to the nature of that regime.  It has repressed and murdered its own people and lied to the international community, denying until recently that it even possessed these weapons.  The process must be quick, credible and comprehensive.  Syria has used these weapons with deadly effect and they must be eliminated before their repeated use can ever again be contemplated.  I am not under any illusion either as to the scale and magnitude of the task this will present.  Achieving the complete elimination of Syria's chemical weapons programme by mid-2014 is an unprecedented challenge for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, OPCW, the body charged with implementation of the chemical weapons convention.  As it happens, Ireland is currently a member of the executive council of the OPCW and our ambassador to the organisation will express our full support at a meeting of the executive council later this week for the adoption of the agreement.<\/p><p>  The elimination of Syria's chemical weapons will present a major challenge for the OPCW and entail significant additional resources on its part.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013091800003#B00200","speaker":"951","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379518800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>The UN report published last week did not determine where the guilt lies.

We have been working through a number of NGOs and United Nations agencies.  I admire the work they are doing in trying to get aid through.  Inside Syria there are excessive controls on aid agencies working in the country.  The fragmentation of the armed opposition and the intensity of the military confrontations have made the operating environment extremely volatile and insecure, particularly in opposition-controlled areas.  Restrictions imposed by the Assad regime, combined with logistical constraints and increasing insecurity, make it very difficult to access populations which are in need of humanitarian assistance.  As an example of the difficulties faced in getting aid through, the journey between Damascus and Aleppo would normally take three hours, but now takes three days through approximately 50 different checkpoints.<\/p><p>  This is the biggest humanitarian crisis of our times.  The scale of this is enormous.  The UN call was for &euro;5.2 billion in aid.  It is the biggest aid effort of all times.  Approximately 43% of that has been delivered, which is huge, but there is a big demand for it.  We have called for a pause in hostilities to enable humanitarian aid to get through.  In welcoming what has been agreed between the US and Russia on the chemical weapons issue, we can build on a number of points.  First, there was a pause in hostilities to allow the UN inspectors to do their work.  That can and should be replicated for the delivery of humanitarian aid.  That is an immediate priority and we are seeking it.  Second, we hope the engagement by both the United States and Russia which produced the agreement on chemicals weapons - which must be implemented - can be built on and give momentum for the convening of Geneva 2 discussions and conference.  There must be a political settlement and dialogue that gives rise to a new Syria, a state of peace and an end to the hostilities.<\/p><p>  We were one of the first countries to call for what was happening in Syria to be referred to the International Criminal Court.  A very strong body of international opinion from many countries has similarly called for it.  That remains our position and we will continue to do that.

There is a general consensus throughout the country and across the political spectrum that the way forward is to come up with a peaceful resolution of the conflict.  Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that the difficulty will be getting people into a room, given that the Syrian opposition comprises 1,000 groups with various views?

The supply of arms to Syria is often portrayed as arming the opposition or elements of the opposition, but we need to recall that the Assad regime is being supplied with arms and when we say there should not be a supply of arms, we also mean that those supplying arms to the Syrian state and providing the means by which the conflict can continue need to stop also.<\/p><p>  It will not be easy to get people around the table.

There is then the issue of participation by those of who are opposed to the regime and their willingness to take part in discussions which will involve a regime they want to have removed and replaced.

A conflict has been going on for over two years and more than 100,000 people have been killed.  There has been an involvement by some external actors - if I can use that term.  It has become a kind of cockpit for conflict.  We need to recalibrate where the priorities now lie.  The first priority is to bring that conflict to an end, end the suffering and get a ceasefire at least for humanitarian purposes.  We need to work on getting a political resolution that ends the conflict and puts Syria on a peaceful path in which all its citizens irrespective of their religious or other background can have a future.<\/p><p>  The conflict has complicated the whole environment.  Making an assessment of the relative strengths of different forces is difficult, not least because of what has happened to normal communications in the course of the conflict.  The picture is moving.  One hears reports of the relative successes or setbacks encountered by different parties to the conflict.  There is, of course, intelligence information that has been picked up.  I have heard figures mentioned of the relative strengths of the different forces in the conflict.  What credibility one can give to those figures is another question.<\/p><p>  The conflict is taking place and there have been waves of international responses to it.  There was the formation of the Friends of Syria, in which we participated to try to influence and help the situation.  There is the mobilisation of the humanitarian effort through the UN, its agencies and NGOs.  There is the call of the international community expressed through whatever means for a peaceful resolution.  It has been disappointing and enormously frustrating that the UN Security Council was not able to agree a resolution owing, as everybody knows, to the use of the vetoes.  Permanent members of the UN Security Council have a very important responsibility.<\/p><p>  It is encouraging that the US and Russia were able to agree.

I spoke by telephone with the new Foreign Minister of Iran recently and exchanged with him Ireland's views on the situation and the role Iran might play.  As for the issue of chemical weapons, as I mentioned in my opening contribution the use of chemical weapons has been banned since 1925.  This applies consistently and Ireland's view is that it is a war crime and one must work towards their complete elimination.  It is not simply a case of their use but it also concerns their manufacture, stockpiling and maintenance.  We need a world that is free of such weapons.<\/p><p>  On the issue of Irish troops, as the Deputy is aware, the Government has decided to deploy 114 members of the Irish Defence Forces to the UNDOF mission on the Golan Heights and four officers already are deployed there at present.  The initial detachment will go out this Friday and the balance will follow approximately one week later.  Clearly, the circumstances in which they operate, their safety and the safety of their operating environment are matters of the greatest importance to the Government.  It was an issue on which the Government had extensive discussions with United Nations when the request came from the latter to participate in the UNDOF mission.  I spoke directly with Secretary-General Ban about both the request and in particular the measures that needed to be taken to ensure the safety of the troops.  This is an issue about which we will have continuing discussions.  I expect to meet Secretary-General Ban again during the United Nations General Assembly week and to have further discussion with him about it.  I am aware there have been some media reports regarding the evacuation of civilian staff and family members of the UNIFIL personnel in Lebanon.  The current information we have from the United Nations is that no decision has been made on the evacuation of UNIFIL personnel or their family members.  As it happens, no family members are accompanying Irish personnel in Lebanon in any event.  The UNIFIL mission continues to implement all mandated tasks and in line with the requirements of all UN missions, it reviews constantly and updates its contingency plans.<\/p><p>  The Jasmine Tent is a civil society initiative to provide psychosocial support for victims of violence and involves people from the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.

His analysis both today and previously has been impressive.  In addition, the part played by Russia in this regard in recent weeks has been highly constructive.  While one may disagree about what the Russians have been doing at the United Nations Security Council, the manner in which they took up the issue of the United Nations becoming involved in putting beyond use chemical weapons was very good.  The T&aacute;naiste might comment on how this came about on foot of what some people saw as a <i>faux pas<\/i>.  I watched the press conference at which US Secretary of State, John Kerry, was asked the question by the American journalist to which he gave what I considered to be a realistic and reasonable answer.  However, it appears to have got his Administration on the wrong foot.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to comment on that.<\/p><p>  With regard to the plight of Christians generally across the Middle East but particularly now in Syria, I attended a conference a week and a half ago at which one of the keynote speakers was a Syrian Christian.  When talking to some Christian groups, I have discerned a conflict in respect of supporting regimes which are known to be far from benevolent but which are very oppressive.  Nevertheless, because of their secularist approach Christians at least have been able to survive under such administrations.  However, under some Middle Eastern Islamist-led governments, they have become subjected to murder and persecution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013091800009#H00500","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379522400,"counter":191,"content":"<p>First, I thank Senator Walsh for his kind remarks.<\/p><p>  Let me start with the contribution of the Russian foreign Minister, Mr. Lavrov, and US Secretary of State, Mr. Kerry.  I have had the privilege of discussing the issue of Syria with both, more recently with Mr. Kerry at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Vilnius, and I am not in any doubt about their personal commitment to seeking a peaceful political solution to the conflict in Syria.<\/p><p>  The issue facing the international community over the past couple of weeks was that a war crime had been committed, in that chemical weapons, banned since 1925, were used.  The United Nations, for reasons that we all know, is not in a position to respond.  Does that mean that there cannot be a response, that there should not be a response, that chemical weapons can be used with impunity and that regimes can commit atrocities without consequence?  We are in the fortunate position today - I commend both Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lavrov on the work they have done together in bringing about a solution - that a way of dealing with this has now been agreed, because the first priority was, I suppose, to ensure that chemical weapons were not going to be used again.  There was a very real worry, in the aftermath of what happened on 21 August, that this might be the start of repeated use of chemical weapons, with all of the consequences that would flow from it.  We have at least seen progress on that.  The hopeful aspect is that their work lays a foundation for further work to be done.<\/p><p>  I am glad Senator Walsh raised the issue of Christians because I want to make an observation on it.  The Middle East is home to some of the world's most ancient Christian denominations, although of course there has been a very significant reduction in their numbers in the region over recent years.  The political turmoil that has overwhelmed many countries in the Middle East in recent years has led to increased international concerns about the safety of Christians, first in Iraq and Egypt and now, most pressingly, in Syria.  The descent of Syria into violence and disarray has left small Christian communities very exposed and sometimes subject to direct attack.  Ireland raises the issue of the safety of Christians through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question and stressing the responsibility of the Government to protect minorities.  I have raised the issue of the protection of Christians in the Middle East at discussions at the Foreign Affairs Council and supported stronger EU statements on the issue - for instance, the Council conclusions on Egypt which were issued on 21 August last.  Officials from my Department have met frequently local Christian leaders from the Middle East region and discussed the issues that are affecting their communities.  It should be noted that many of these groups requested that any efforts made on their behalf be carried out discreetly, as any special attention from Western countries might only increase their difficulties.  I assure Senator Walsh and the committee that we have been very active on the issue of the protection of Christians.  I welcome the statement that was made by Pope Francis and the call that he has made.  He has been forthright and consistent in his calls for peace.<\/p><p>  I have spoken already about the impact on the neighbouring countries of Jordan and Lebanon and the potential for destabilisation because of the number of refugees involved.

I put it to the Minister, who may choose to answer or not, that there is increasing evidence of the inability of the United Nations to intervene where the Security Council is not in a position to reach agreement on a resolution or whatever, that this is similar to other situations in the past, including in Kosovo, and that this, in turn, gives wide latitude and scope to despotic leaders in various locations who are safe in the knowledge that the international community cannot intervene.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013091800010#J00400","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379523000,"counter":194,"content":"<p>Let me refer to the impact on society of the refugee camps.

It is a worrying dimension, reflecting the pressure on the countries with large refugee populations.  Inevitably, there are tensions and pressures.  This will have to be managed and worked on very carefully.<\/p><p>  On the wider issues raised by Deputy Bernard J. Durkan, I share the disappointment and frustration at the fact that the UN Security Council has not been able to deal quickly and effectively with what has been a growing crisis in the past two years.  The response has been very strong on the humanitarian side, with agencies working very well, and we work very well with them.  However, that is not an argument for ignoring or bypassing the UN Security Council. <\/p><p>  We must consider this issue on a number of levels.  First to be considered is the issue of accountability for the atrocities that have been committed.  There has to be accountability and I have been saying for some time that it should be secured through the International Criminal Court.  That is why we have been arguing that the UN Security Council should refer the issue to that court.  People who have been responsible for atrocities committed in Syria, at whatever level, must understand the day of reckoning and account will come some day through the International Criminal Court.<\/p><p>  The next issue concerns determining the approach in circumstances in which the UN Security Council cannot agree and the veto is being used, as it has been sequentially.  If one goes back over all of the various attempts made to get the UN Security Council to respond, one will conclude that everybody must understand the world is different than in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War when the United Nations was established.  The interconnectedness and interdependence of states are different.  The communications are different.  It is increasingly becoming unsustainable for any country, irrespective of its levers of power, to adopt a position at the United Nations that it can say \"No\" repeatedly.  There are economic, communications-related and other influences that can be brought to bear on a country other than military strength and sheer might.  It is a different world.  To some extent, it is the understanding that we live in a different world that has brought about circumstances in which the immediate issue of chemical weapons and their use has been subject to an agreement.  I very much welcome the agreement, but we must see it implemented.<\/p><p>  The immediate priority is to halt the violence and the war immediately for humanitarian purposes and to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid.  It is a question of getting the Geneva II process going and securing a political solution to the problem.  The world must continue determinedly and doggedly to try to bring this about.  That is the overwhelming will of people in this country and pretty much every country where the national will has been measured in some way or another.  People want to see the conflict brought to an end soon and a political settlement.  They want work to continue on dealing with the humanitarian consequences.  Ultimately, they want those in refugee camps or who are displaced from their homes to be able to return home to rebuild their lives and country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2013091800011#K00300","speaker":"951"},{"type":"speech","time":1379523000,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste and his officials.

The first petition for consideration is P00027\/12 entitled Employment Appeals Tribunal from Mr. John O'Sullivan.  The petition concerns what the petitioner sees as an abuse of the Employment Appeals Tribunal process as follows: the cost of bringing complaints to the tribunal has to be paid by the complainants; the employer is under no obligation to pay the award and the claimant then must pursue the employer through the courts for payments; the need for the engagement of a legal team; and the tribunal's lack of power to enforce its judgment.  The petitioner suggests that an employer should be required to lodge a bond as security.  The petitioner also raised concerns regarding the appointment of liquidators and their qualifications.<\/p><p>   Members will recall that the petitioner, along with a number of other organisations such as Mandate, ICTU, IBEC and departmental officials, attended the committee before.  The recommendation proposed is as follows: the committee forward a copy of its letter of 26 July 2013, together with the response received from the office of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to the petitioner for information; the petitioner be informed that the petition is now closed and the committee has concluded its deliberations on the matter; and to refer a copy of the transcript of the meeting of 18 July 2013, together with a copy of the committee's letter of 26 July 2013 and the response received from the office of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation for consideration and appropriate action in the context of that committee's scrutiny of the workplace relations Bill and the Companies Bill.  That is the agreed recommendation regarding the petition.<\/p><p>  The second petition is P00045\/12 entitled Issue relating to the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces and the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 from Mr. Niall Donohoe.  The petitioner was a commandant in the Defence Forces and in 2006-07 he was involved in highlighting cases of bullying in the Air Corps.  As a result of his involvement he claims to have been treated badly by the organisation.  He submitted 195 official complaints to the military authorities and claims that none of his complaints was investigated properly.  As a result, he raised 141 of these complaints with the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  He is aware that the individual complaints raised with the ombudsman can form no part of this petition.<\/p><p>  The petitioner has lodged a petition on the basis of his previous interaction with the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  The petitioner lists the following failures, as he perceives them: the failure of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces to provide access to its service; the lack of any legislative element within the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 to make provision for the appeal of any decision of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces to refuse access or otherwise, a legislative lacuna brought about by the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004; and other matters relating to the manner in which the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces goes about its day-to-day operations.<\/p><p>  The committee has deliberated on the issue.  We agreed that we would forward the Department of Defence's response to the petitioner for his information.  We also agreed to forward a copy of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces' letter for his information.

When it reports back to us we will revert back to the petitioner.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. <\/p><p>  The next petition for consideration is P00047\/12 entitled Policy Issues within the Defence (Amendment) Act 2007 from Mr. Niall Donohoe.

Good morning, everyone.  My name is Eithne Scott-Lennon.  I live in Blackrock, County Dublin, along with my husband James and four sons.  I am the owner and managing director of Fitzpatrick Castle Hotel in Killiney.  It is a four star hotel that employs 120 staff.<\/p><p>  The hotel and tourism industry has been a constant in my career and, indeed, throughout my life.  I have travelled extensively, promoting Ireland as a destination.  I have gained great insights over the years into tourism and hospitality worldwide, seen the best in class and understand that we must always strive for new and innovative ways to develop our industry.<\/p><p>  I attended primary school in the Loreto convent in Wexford, where my father then worked for the Stafford family in the Talbot Hotel.  My family moved back to Dublin in the late 1960s when my father took up the position of group general manager for P.V. Doyle and his growing Doyle Hotel Group.  After that move I attended the Holy Child school in Killiney.  In 1970 my father purchased Killiney Castle and it has been the flagship of our hotel business for the past 43 years. <\/p><p>  On leaving school, I trained in the hotel industry in Switzerland and the United States.  After returning to Ireland, I set up a sales and marketing division of the family business, Fitzpatrick Hotels, which by then had acquired its second hotel in Shannon<font color=\"#000080\">.  <\/font>The group eventually developed into a substantial family run business with hotels in Dublin, Cork, Shannon, New York and Chicago.<\/p><p>  I passionately believe in the power of dedicated and motivated staff because they are the ones who make a difference.  Our ethos is a personalised professional organisation with its staff and customers always to the fore.  The focus of our hotel business is excelling in customer care and service.<\/p><p>  I took over Killiney Castle when my late father, Paddy, passed away in 2002.  I have since invested heavily in the business.  Unfortunately, I have had to make some harsh decisions over the past trying four to five years, but we have survived, albeit with turnover reductions and a rationalisation of overheads.<\/p><p>  I was appointed to the board of the national tourism development authority in May 2003 and served two terms.  I have chaired numerous committees, including the audit committee and the exciting Ryder Cup Committee during 2007.  <\/p><p>  I was first appointed to the interim board of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company in 1994.  I was subsequently reappointed by various Administrations for a number of terms on that board.  I am honoured to have been invited to take up the role of chairperson of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company.<\/p><p>  For members who are unfamiliar with D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour, I will highlight a few facts and figures before outlining my vision for the future.  The harbour has a unique and beautiful location as a leisure harbour close to Dublin city.  The D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company is the statutory commercial body charged with maintaining and developing the harbour as a marine tourism gateway to Ireland.  The harbour was built as a port of refuge between 1817 and 1842, and is widely recognised as one of the finest man-made harbours in the world.  It was formed by the two breakwaters that we commonly know as the east and west piers, each of which measure approximately one mile.  The company controls an area of 297 acres, of which 47 is land.<\/p><p>  In recent years the company has undergone a major transition involving, in particular, the implementation of a restructuring plan. The company employs 19 people, down from 42 in 2009.  It has a three person management team, which has halved in recent years.<\/p><p>  The company operates modern passenger ferry facilities and the largest marina in the country for recreational vessels.  It offers a great infrastructure for those with an interest in sailing, with four yacht clubs, sailing clubs and other marine-related activities.  It has become successful in attracting and hosting exciting major events to our shore, such as the last year's world junior sailing championships.  The company&rsquo;s main source of revenue was traditionally from ferry operations.  However, due to a number of factors, particularly the high cost of the fuel on which these vessels operate, this source of revenue has significantly contracted.  <\/p><p>  Our challenge is to ensure that the impact from the economic downturn and the changed profile of the traditional ferry business will be offset through generating sufficient revenue from a broader range of commercial operations in the harbour.  That is why the company produced a comprehensive masterplan in 2011.  It sets out plans for the long-term development of the company, and aims to develop the harbour as a marine, leisure and tourism destination of world-class calibre.<\/p><p>  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour wishes to enhance its attractiveness as a major destination for tourists to Ireland.  The masterplan seeks to extend the recreational and amenity value of the harbour, to promote investment, and to generate sufficient revenue from commercial operations to ensure the sustainability of the maintenance programme and the marine facility that the harbour provides.  In short, the objective is to transform the harbour into a living, vibrant area offering facilities for people to live, work and relax in.  The masterplan, which envisages development over 15 to 20 years, will be reviewed every five years. <\/p><p>  I will bring members up to date on the progress that has been made on some of the plan&rsquo;s key elements.  A key objective is to develop the harbour as a cruise ship facility, and this summer has seen a breakthrough for the D&uacute;n Laoghaire cruise stakeholder group.  We had 14 visits in total, including the high-profile <i>Queen Mary 2 <\/i> and the <i>Queen Elizabeth<\/i>.  More than 30,000 passengers and crew visited our shores through D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  The stakeholder group, which we established to promote the cruise business, has engaged with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006, with a view to building a new facility for the next generation large cruise ships.  There are no facilities for such ships in Dublin, and this lost opportunity needs to be addressed urgently.<\/p><p>  With our unique setting and recent categorisation as a leisure port in the Government&rsquo;s port policy, I strongly believe that D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour offers the most suitable home for a cruise facility.  This would complement Dublin Port's core industrial focus and concentrate on roll-on, roll-off and load-on, load-off ferries.  I envisage a relationship similar to how Cobh takes all the visiting cruise ships to Cork city and allows it to focus on industrial traffic.  <\/p><p>  The number of cruise passengers visiting Ireland could quadruple over the next ten years, but only if we invest in the right facility in the right location.  The D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company would welcome the opportunity to engage further with members of the committee on this matter over the coming months.<\/p><p>  Another key element key of the masterplan is the development of an urban beach facility that will be located next to Berth 1 on the east pier of the harbour.  It will comprise a floating swimming pool containing fresh seawater and be permanently heated to 26&deg; Celsius using renewable energy sources.  The floating structure will be a recycled barge or similar, which will house both the swimming pool and an urban beach approximately 240 m&sup2;.<\/p><p>  As members may have seen in the media, public pre-planning consultation on the project has commenced and we have undertaken a number of meetings with key stakeholders.  We hope to go to planning later in the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013091800004#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Eithne Scott-Lennon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1379499300,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Scott-Lennon for her comprehensive presentation on her background, the harbour's strengths and challenges and her plans.

In terms of the international diaspora centre, how is it proposed to fund that?  We have suffered a great deal from a withdrawal of access by ordinary people to the sea front in general.  For example, the Colamore Hotel, where ordinary people rather than members of exclusive yacht clubs could go for a pint, has closed.

I would encourage her to visit our website where she can have a good look at the master plan.  I was a member of the steering committee which developed the plan and as such I am conscious of access to water.  One of the problems for local communities has always been a lack of access to water.  Some people believe it is only for sailing clubs and so on.  The master plan provides for so much more direct access to the water for every man, woman and child.  It is really exciting from that perspective.  I suggest that the Senator study the master plan.  Every part of it provides for water access around the whole perimeter of the development, which is exciting.  It even makes provision for sail training.  I do not propose to go into the plan in detail now.<\/p><p>  In terms of the components of the plan, I agree that the ferry business was vitally important to D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I have already mentioned that one issue was that of the cost of fuel for vessels.  The <i>HSS<\/i> could be compared to the Concorde.  What Stena does is its own business.  However, it has a contract with the harbour which does not expire until April 2015 and will honour that contract.  What it proposes to do beyond that, we do not know.  We are hopeful it will continue to hold a presence in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It is possible it will put a traditional ferry in place.  We will have the facilities to cater for ferries, vessels and, in time, the new age cruise ships.  We have no intention of closing out ferry business, we will welcome it with open arms and will strive to retain it if we can.<\/p><p>  In terms of the town, increasing the cruise passenger numbers will increase the flow up-town, thus helping in the revival of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.

It is planned to develop the land that is available.  We will be careful and sensitive in how the land is developed.<\/p><p>  As I stated, the vision for D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour is for it to be a living and vibrant place.  Currently, it closes down at 6 p.m.  If any of the members were to walk around the harbour after daylight hours, they would find the area is dead.  Our vision is to bring the area to life and for this reason our plans include an element of living.  We will focus on that and job creation will come from some of the retail plans we have.  There will be a good mix and balance of retail and residential development.  That is where we envisage job creation taking place.  The development will be phased and planned and will be ratified with each section of the plan as we proceed. <\/p><p>  On employee numbers, I agree that we have faced significant challenges.  Management has had a very challenging time purely because of the decline in ferry business, which has suffered because of low cost air fares.  I am great believer that all things are cyclical.

It is something for the future and it is probably within the remit of a national tourism agency to see how that might work and how all of us, as a country, might make that viable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013091800009#L00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Eithne Scott-Lennon"},{"type":"speech","time":1379501700,"counter":250,"content":"<p>It could be a new version of hop-on, hop-off.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013091800009#L00200","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1379501700,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Exactly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2013091800009#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eithne Scott-Lennon"},{"type":"speech","time":1379501700,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I am intrigued by the urban beach and the floating swimming pool.

Naturally it will not be open all year round - I do not believe our weather is sufficiently clement to allow that.  The Berlin facility has the capability of being covered in the winter.
