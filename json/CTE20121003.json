Members will have received copies of my opening statement.  I am an assistant secretary with responsibility for illness and disability policy in the Department of Social Protection.  My colleagues, Liam Walsh, principal officer, Eoin O'Shea, assistant principal officer, Alan Chapman, assistant principal officer disability policy, Mary Kennedy, principal officer, and Aideen Mooney, assistant principal officer PRSI policy, are here to assist me in answering any questions members may wish to raise.<br \/><b><\/b>I wish to stress the Department's continued commitment to providing a wide-ranging system of supports, both in the area of basic income supports and, of particular relevance here today, in the area of work-related supports for people with disabilities.<b><\/b>The context in which we seek to carry out our work in this area has been shaped by the wider transformation of the Department arising from the merger between the old Department of Social Protection and significant elements of F&Aacute;S which took place earlier this year.  Prior to the merger the role of the Department related to the structure of the various welfare payments available to people with disabilities, notably the disability allowance scheme, invalidity pension and illness benefit together with schemes such as the back-to-education allowance, which the Department operates directly.  Earlier this year, the range of income support measures was extended following the introduction of the partial capacity benefit scheme, on which I will say a few words in a moment.  <\/p><p>  Our remit has been significantly widened however with the transfer of elements of F&Aacute;S services into the Department.  These include the range of disability support and awareness measures, the wage subsidy scheme and the employability programme.  I should mention that responsibility for training, <i>per se<\/i>, remains with the Department of Education and Skills.  Each of the measures for which the Department has responsibility has an important role to play in supporting increased participation in the labour force by people with disabilities.  Clearly, the challenge to improve the level of that participation is all the greater when set in the context of the wider economic difficulties we face at present, but the merger of the two organisations presents us with the opportunity to develop a more cohesive and coherent approach to meeting that challenge.<\/p><p>  Put simply, the challenge we face is to further enhance the shift in focus from disability to ability.  The introduction of the partial capacity scheme in February of this year marked a significant milestone in that process.  This scheme recognises that the welfare system, which categorised people as fit to work or unfit to work, did not reflect the reality for most existing welfare customers.  It provides an opportunity for people with disabilities, and assessed to have an employment capacity which is restricted when compared to the norm, to avail of employment opportunities while continuing to receive a long-term income support payment.  The scheme is still in its infancy and it will take time for it to develop, but we believe that it is already starting to serve its purpose in enabling hundreds of people to enjoy the benefits, from both an income and an inclusion perspective, of being engaged in the world of work.  Since the scheme was introduced in February last, just under 700 claims have been awarded.<\/p><p>  I should mention also another important measure, the disability activation project, which we are undertaking with the support of the European Social Fund.  In a process which is being managed for the Department by Pobal, we have invited bids for projects which will test models of activation which can improve access to employment for people with disabilities, young people with disabilities and people with acquired disabilities, as well as projects which demonstrate better engagement with employers.  The intention is that these projects will be announced by the Minister for Social Protection later this month.  The projects will continue until early 2015 across the Border, midland and west region.  We are hopeful and optimistic that they will provide a valuable input into the development of more effective pathways to employment for people with disabilities in the years ahead.<\/p><p>  A number of additional programmes, which were formerly operated by F&Aacute;S, are now operated by the Department of Social Protection. These include: the employAbility service, formerly the supported employment programme; the wage subsidy scheme; the disability support-awareness grants and schemes; and community employment.  The main aims of the employAbility service are to facilitate the integration of people with disabilities into paid employment in the open labour market; to provide supports to assist with this integration; and to meet the requirements of employers.  The scheme is open to people with a disability who are job ready and need the support of a coach to obtain employment in the open labour market.  The service is open to people between the ages of 18 and 65 and in 2011 just under 3,000 people with disabilities were supported through this scheme.<\/p><p>  We also operate the wage subsidy scheme, a demand-led programme to increase the numbers of people with disabilities participating in the open labour market.  A disabled employee on a work subsidy scheme is subject to the same conditions of employment as other employees.  The employer must pay the disabled employee the going rate for the job, at least the minimum wage.  The wage subsidy scheme was placed on a permanent footing from October 2008, subject to the annual budgetary process, following the operation of a three-year pilot phase.  The uptake of the wage subsidy scheme has been incrementally slow since its inception.  It has taken a number of years to build it to this level of participation.  Included in this budget is its predecessor programme, the employment support scheme, which was frozen to new applicants in 2005.  In 2011, wage subsidy was paid in respect of 916 people.<\/p><p>  A number of different employment supports for people with disabilities are provided for under the heading - disability support and awareness.  These include the work equipment adaptation grant; the job interview-personal reader grant; the employee retention grant; the disability awareness support scheme and the discretionary fund for innovative projects.  The purpose of these grants is to support unemployed people with disabilities to gain access to the open labour market by providing grants for reasonable accommodation in the private sector; to support private employers and encourage them in the employment of people with disabilities; and the funding of innovative disability projects within Department of Social Protection procurement guidelines.  That is all I will say on the disability side for now and I will hand over Ms Mary Kennedy to deal with the social insurance entitlements of the self-employed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012100300003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Leonard"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349254800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Social insurance PRSI contributions broadly fall into two categories - employers and employees, over 16 years of age, pay PRSI towards establishing entitlement of employees to a broad range of both short-term and long-term social insurance benefits.  A lower rate of PRSI is paid by the self-employed into the social insurance fund, which provides them with access to long-term social insurance benefits.<\/p><p>  Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension, contributory and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension, contributory.  Maternity benefit is also available to self-employed contributors.  Ordinary employees who have access to short-term and long-term social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI class A.  For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 4.25%. <\/p> <p> Self-employed workers may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker's allowance. They can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed unemployed claimant of jobseeker's allowance, the means of husband-wife, civil partner or cohabitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.<\/p><p> I made a presentation to the committee on 20 September on the findings of the actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010.  This is the third actuarial review of the fund and was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012.  It was presented to the Government on 24 July 2012 and published on 17 September 2012.  The review covers a 55-year period between 2011 and 2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 actuarial reviews.  The scope of the 2010 review was to update the results of the 2005 review, taking account of the policy, economic and demographic changes with particular reference to income and expenditure projections as well as break-even contribution rates.  The review also considered the effects of various policy options, existing Government commitments and planned reforms.  The review examined a range of value for money measures to examine the extent to which individuals currently receive value for money from the fund.<\/p><p> With regard to the self-employed, the report states that \"the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed - when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person\".  On possible future entitlements for the self-employed, the review examined the break-even contributions rates required, and the potential long-term cost implications to the fund, of providing invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker's benefit for self-employed workers.<\/p><p> The 2010 review also looked at the break-even contribution rates required to provide invalidity pensions and jobseeker's benefit for self-employed workers.  The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory) is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker's benefit in addition to the core contributory State pension is provided.  The average contribution rate required for the core pension in addition to the invalidity pension and jobseeker's benefit is estimated to be 17.3%.<\/p><p> KPMG modelled the costs associated with the introduction of these benefits by increasing the incidence by 12% in their models reflecting the increase in potential beneficiaries.  This uplift is based on the distribution of PRSI contributors at 31 December 2010.  The implicit assumption in this calculation is that the proportion of self-employed accessing these benefits is the same as the existing population with entitlement to access these benefits.  For illustrative purposes, KPMG costed the extension of these benefits by assuming the extended scheme reaches full \"maturity\" in terms of the numbers of additional beneficiaries with immediate effect.  One would not know; there are contribution requirements in these schemes but that was how the consultants did the calculations.  In the absence of statistics pertaining specifically to the self-employed, KPMG assumed the incidence rates to be the same as for the overall labour force.  This may or may not be appropriate depending on whether the self-employed may be expected to behave atypically.  KPMG, therefore, indicated sensitivities to the incidence rates chosen setting out the range of costs involved where the self-employed numbers accessing jobseeker's benefit and invalidity pension are 20% higher or 20% lower than the base-case scenario.<\/p><p> Assuming the incidence rates are the same as for the overall population, KPMG found that the cost of extending jobseeker's benefit to the self-employed in 2013 would be &euro;87 million.  If the incidence rate is 20% lower than the norm, the estimated cost would be &euro;73 million in 2013 and if the incidence rate is 20% higher than the norm, the cost in 2013 would be &euro;105 million.  In the case of invalidity pension KPMG's analysis predicted a 2013 cost of &euro;78 million where the incidence rate is the same as for the overall population.  Where the incidence rate is 20% lower, the cost is estimated at &euro;65 million and where the incidence rate is 20% higher than the norm, the cost would be &euro;94 million.  While, as stated by the consultants, the long-term projections, by their very nature, are unlikely to be borne out in practice, the report emphasises the trends which emerge over the period.<\/p><p> Last year the Minister for Social Protection established an advisory group on tax and social welfare.  Under its terms of reference, the group examines and makes recommendations on a number of key issues, including child and family income supports, working age income supports, the appropriate unit of assessment and interactions in both the tax and social welfare codes, issues concerning social insurance for self-employed people and budget 2012 proposals concerning disability allowance and domiciliary care.  The advisory group's overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the terms of reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed.

There is a widespread perception that once somebody is self-employed, he or she can forget about looking for the allowance.  I am not familiar with other parts of the country but, in the Limerick area, that perception is being encouraged and being promoted by the interaction people have with the local social welfare office.  I am sorry to have to say that but I have to say it clearly and bluntly.<\/p> <p>People have come to my constituency clinics and said, \"We have been in touch with the labour exchange in Limerick and because we are self-employed we have been told our chances are virtually nil.\"  There is a perception that a person who has been self-employed is automatically disbarred from jobseeker's allowance, regardless of his or her circumstances.  <\/p><p> One of the delegates has cited the rule applying to someone who has been self-employed and whose business is gone when he or she applies for jobseeker's allowance.  The rule states that, in general, the means calculated against him or her \"will take account of the level of earnings in the last 12 months\".  A self-employed person whose business goes down the tubes has no income.  Such a person has no income but is debarred from jobseeker's allowance because he or she had income in the 12 months up to the time the business failed.  That seems to be perverse, to say the least.  In fairness, the delegate went on to say, \"in the current climate account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.\"  That might be done on paper, but the reality is different. <\/p><p> Reference was made to the advisory group on tax and social welfare.  Over the weekend we heard some of its proposals which had mysteriously made their way out of the Department and into the press.  I note that the group was also advising on social insurance for the self-employed.  Now that part of the report is in the public domain.  Perhaps the officials might share with us what the group had to say about providing insurance for the self-employed.  I note that it has also been advising on disability and domiciliary care allowances.  Perhaps we might receive some information on its deliberations on these weighty matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012100300004#D00600","speaker":"1059","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349256000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>In her opening statement Ms Leonard said 3,000 people were supported by the EmployAbility service and that the wage subsidy was paid to 916 people.  We know that last year more than 100,000 were in receipt of disability allowance.  That shows the scale of the challenge faced by the Department in capturing the people concerned.  I note what was said about the partial capacity scheme and some of the changes suggested.  Is the Department considering other ways to promote and expand these two schemes?  From my limited knowledge of them, they seems to be working well.  Some employers do not seem to be aware of the partial capacity scheme, or do not seem to be taking up the opportunities it presents.  Is that because they are not aware of the scheme or are they discouraged by the bureaucracy associated with it?  What is the waiting time under the scheme?  In many schemes there is a delay between the application and the sign-off, but an employer wants an employee in place as quickly as possible.  How is the scheme working and how quick is the turnover?<\/p><p>  Various other grants are available to individuals and employers.  Work equipment adaptations can be made, for example, to ensure someone can be made to feel a full member of staff.  Sometimes the cost of getting to work can be onerous for a person with a severe disability.  Are employers aware of grants to adapt workplaces and equipment?  What is the delay between the application for such a grant and its delivery?<\/p><p>  Last year the Minister's proposals regarding disability allowance were shelved and the disability allowance scheme was reviewed.  Has this impacted on the work of the Department?  Has there been an increase in the numbers applying to participate in schemes to help them to move from disability allowance into the workforce?  It is not always for monetary gain that people move from dependency on disability payment into the workforce.  Often it has to do with inclusion.  Community employment schemes have helped in many ways in this regard.  Public representatives have been hearing that the changes the Minister made to the community employment scheme and what was termed the double payment have discouraged people with disabilities from taking up opportunities which would have left them job-ready at the conclusion of the scheme.  For an employer or a person with a disability to avail of the two schemes, the delegate mentioned that the employee must be job-ready.  The severity of a disability can exclude a person from the workforce and in need of time in a scheme targeted at addressing that exclusion.  <\/p><p>  We have had some discussion on the exclusion of self-employed persons from the PRSI system.  I do not doubt this is a complex area, but I have heard of strange cases from people who came to my clinic.  Some taxi drivers who are managing to survive on very low earnings have been able to avail of payments, while others have been told they must give up their PSV licence in order to qualify for jobseeker's allowance.  Some are being obliged to exit the taxi industry completely.  Some PSV licence holders, while not working as taxi drivers, have been told they must surrender their licence, although this is their only access to the workforce.  This is a complex area and needs to be looked at in detail.  <\/p><p>  The KPMG report on pensions suggests an employer's contribution rate of 17.3%.  The Class A contribution which covers the majority of employees consists of a combined employee and employer contribution rate of 14.75%.  Will the officials explain the reason for the difference?<\/p><p>  Self-employed persons often have irregular incomes.  There may be periods during which they have a reduced income or no income at all.  The current system is based on days worked.  The committee recently had a discussion on casual work during which we spoke about changing the social welfare code from days worked to hours worked.<\/p> <p>How difficult would that be in terms of extending the social welfare system to the self-employed, who often work longer hours than PAYE workers?  There is also the issue of extending FIS to the self-employed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012100300005#E00200","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349256600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I must ask the Deputy to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012100300006#F00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1349256600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>This is my last point.

I welcome the work being done by the working group at present and look forward to its results being issued.  It is long overdue because the group was due to get back to us last year but, hopefully, that will happen in November.  There has to be a way forward with regard to the self-employed because there is no incentive to be self-employed in this country at present.  A safety net must be put in place for self-employed people.<\/p><p>  Speaking from experience, I agree with what Deputy O'Dea said about the frustration among the public regarding the entitlements of self-employed people.  They go to the social welfare office and are told they are entitled to nothing.  They then come to our constituency offices and we work with them.  One is at the mercy of the community welfare officer in certain cases.  In fairness to them, however, they work with and help many self-employed people.  If one is self-employed, one pays an S stamp or, if one is paying PRSI, an A stamp.  When I was self-employed I had an accountant to pay my returns to the Revenue Commissioners.  They told me what stamp I should pay and when I paid it, I received a receipt.  However, the receipt did not tell one what entitlements one had.  That is one of the issues the Department of Social Protection should deal with.  People need information, particularly the self-employed.  Self-employed people will read the fine details even though they are basically very busy people working seven days a week.  They need this information.<\/p><p>  Many self-employed people are calling to my constituency office at present.  Their business and turnover are down by 60% or 70% and they are living on their savings.  They are also keeping their businesses going with their savings, but the savings are drying up.  Self-employed people are in a terrible mess.  They were never really represented, and I am not blaming any Government for that.  They are a small minority of people who kept this country going, but they were never represented when it came to their entitlements.  More information should be given to self-employed people about their entitlements.<\/p><p>  The witnesses say that if a self-employed person can produce their facts and figures to the community welfare officer, he or she is entitled to some type of social welfare payment.  The problem is that a self-employed person's business could have been going badly for a year or two years and if they wish to get all their figures, he or she must get them from their accountant.  In certain cases, they do not have the money to pay their accountant to give them the figures so one is left in no-man's land.

The social welfare officer cannot give one anything because he or she must have the facts and figures.  We must see what the working group has to offer for self-employed people.

Up to a fortnight ago, 21 September, 1,019 applications had been received.  Of those, 764 had gone through the process of having a medical assessment and a medical opinion provided, 645 were in payment and the vast majority of those medical opinions had indicated, as we would have expected, that the people concerned were in the moderate category.  Typically, they are people one would expect to be closest to the labour market in any event.  Very few were found to be ineligible for payment.  It was inevitable that some people might come through who would have been due for review in the ordinary course of events and might have been found to be ineligible.  A total of 18 so far have fallen into that category, so it is very few.<\/p><p>  The Deputy asked about costs.  Essentially, the \"savings\" the Department is making in terms of giving slightly reduced payments to people who are availing of the scheme are negligible at present in the context of the sums the Department pays out for invalidity pension or illness benefit.  We have not started to calculate what they are, but they would be thousands rather than the millions we pay out.<\/p><p>  Deputy Ryan asked for our thoughts on the scheme.  He is correct that to some extent people are testing the waters and trying to see where they would fit in it.  On the operational side in the Department for the people dealing with this, a large part of the work is trying to tease through these matters with applicants.  This is a voluntary scheme.  There is no compulsion to take it up.  Even if people take it up and it does not work, there is no penalty.  People go back to their original entitlement without question.  They do not have to go through a hoop again but return to their primary payment.<\/p><p>  What we are trying to move from is a system where there was an exemption, which was, again, a way of testing the water.  The idea was that it would be a time limited thing.  One would get an exemption from the rules of invalidity benefit or invalidity pension and take up work.  If it worked for the person, he or she might move on.  However, that was not recognising that people needed an income support payment given their position in terms of their capacity to engage in the labour market.  Partial capacity provides that long-term support.<\/p> <p>It can last until the person is 66 if he or she is able to continue in work.  It is a shift away from a short-term testing of the waters to a longer-term income support, permanently provided by the State.  As Ms Leonard said, we are at the infancy stage of the scheme and we will keep an eye it on all the time to see if we can tweak and improve it.  As the scheme involves a medical assessment, there is inevitably a time lag.  Those on the operational side of the Department are trying to ensure that a red flag is raised when a job is hanging on the medical assessment and it is fast-tracked through the medical assessment system.  As members will know, the pressures on that system are significant.  On average it takes between six and seven weeks from the receipt of the application and the award or otherwise of the payment.  On an operational basis they try to fast-track people who contact them.  There is considerable dialogue between the Department and individual clients in trying to address that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012100300006#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin &Oacute; Seaghdha","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349257200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Dea mentioned statistics for the numbers of people with disabilities in the workforce.

The three main schemes are as follows: the disability allowance scheme with 103,000 people; illness benefit with 69,000; and invalidity pension with 49,000.

I welcome the departmental officials and the Self-Employed Alliance Dundalk to the meeting.  I apologise for being late and for missing Ms Mary Kennedy's presentation.  I got a lesson in driving through Dublin today, as 15 miles in Dublin certainly is not like 15 miles in Killarney.<\/p><p>  When the Minister herself and the departmental officials appeared before the joint committee in recent weeks, I raised the issue of the self-employed and I continue to so do today.  I again ask that they be given the option to pay the contribution.  Ms Kennedy may have referred to this issue in her presentation.  Moreover, when people who were self-employed finally gain access to jobseeker's allowance, they are not allowed a credit contribution, which they need to ensure their pension in the future.  This absolutely fascinates me and I ask that serious consideration be given to allowing such people their credit contribution when they draw jobseeker's allowance.<\/p><p>  I can never understand the reason the family income supplement is not available to people who are self-employed.  A little help sometimes can keep people going, including those who are self-employed, and this issue should be examined.  All members know that self-employed people pay their tax, their PRSI and their employees' PRSI.  The departmental officials have informed the joint committee in recent weeks that self-employed people's own contribution would have to increase to approximately 16% in order to derive any benefit but I am sure the benefits would be worth it.  It would be just like taking on one additional person, for whom one would be paying the extra 10% or 12% to ensure one's own benefits were in order.  When such individuals apply for benefits such as medical cards or the jobseeker's allowance, trying to get and provide figures involves a quagmire of bureaucracy.  I ask the officials present to ensure that a memorandum is issued to all social welfare offices advising them they are not to ask people to deregister as self-employed because, regardless of what the witnesses might say here today, this does happen.  Perhaps the creation of uniformity among the departmental offices around the country would prevent this from happening.<\/p><p>  Many people who draw illness benefit or invalidity pension have a small farmholding and they pay PRSI and tax on the income from the farm.  They might have a few dry cattle or whatever the case may be.  When their accountant registers this income, it now emerges that they are drawing illness benefit while making self-employed contributions by paying PRSI.  Consequently, they are in a lot of trouble with the Department and in some cases, the fraud squad has contacted such people, alleging they are working and drawing the benefit.<\/p><p>  Two weeks ago I asked the officials for figures in respect of the overseas pensions being paid but I have not received anything to date.  Consequently, they might provide me with an update in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012100300008#H00300","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1349257800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>First, I welcome the Self-Employed Alliance Dundalk.  I myself was self-employed for a number of years.  I took a chance and I gave employment.  I do not understand the reason self-employed people cannot pay the same PRSI contributions as their employees.  Being self-employed, one pays all one taxes, one pays one's PRSI, one's universal social charges and one's PAYE obligations.  One takes a chance every day that one will get paid for the service one supplies.  One pays all one's staff holiday pay and overtime and one is taking people off social welfare.  However, if things change and if business gets bad, one does not get paid.  Moreover, when one's business can no longer survive, one spends all one's savings.  If one seeks help from the social services, one is told that as one was self-employed, one is entitled to nothing.  Even if such people have families to look after, where do they go?  After working all their lives and paying all their taxes, they do not even get jobseeker's benefits, as to so do one must pay PRSI at the class A rate.  Similarly, one does not receive redundancy payments.

While I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick with regard to the self-employed, I wish to revert to the issue regarding the supports available to enable people with disabilities to gain access to the workforce.  The key job for this joint committee and for Members of the Oireachtas is to try to ensure that each euro being spent on disability services is making a difference.  With that in mind, I wish to discuss the wage subsidy scheme.  The departmental officials should outline what checks are carried out to make sure the aforementioned scheme is actually working for the employer who is availing of it in the name of an employee with a disability.  What background checks are conducted or what evidence does the Department have that the employees are receiving the reasonable support and accommodation they are meant to receive?  As I am sure have many other Oireachtas Members, I have encountered instances in which employees in a company who are doing precisely the same work as other employees without a disability, are not being given that reasonable level of accommodation.  They are not being allowed to start a little later or to finish a little earlier or whatever may be required to accommodate their disability.  One must remember that in many cases, the employer is receiving nearly 50% of the hourly wage from the Department for that perceived lack of productivity.  This is one of my questions because I am not convinced that in every case, sufficient checks are being carried out to ensure that employers are passing on the benefit to the employees for which the taxpayers are paying.<\/p><p>  When one talks about helping people with disabilities to get into the workforce, it really is a cross-departmental and cross-Government issue.  Obviously, the Department of Social Protection has a key role in this regard but so has the HSE, the Departments of Health and Environment, Community and Local Government and so on.  What sort of cross-departmental work is under way at present?  By way of example, many employees with a disability might need the support of a personal assistant, PA, to actually access work.  I note there has been much recent media comment on PA hours.  Obviously, the issue of PA hours is a matter for the HSE and the Department of Health but if such hours are not available, the Department's initiative to get people with disabilities back into the workforce obviously cannot happen.  I have witnesses to comment on such cross-departmental work.<\/p><p>  In the context of disability, one hears a great deal from those who provide the services, from officials and from politicians but one rarely hears the voice of the person with the disability.  The witnesses should outline the structures the Department has in place to hear feedback from those who are availing of the employment support and the assisted employment services.  With that in mind, this may be something the joint committee could consider because while it is highly beneficial to have the officials in attendance today and I greatly welcome that, it might be useful at some point to hear from those who avail of such services about some of the anomalies they experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012100300008#H00500","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1349257800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I think the committee has such a meeting listed in its work programme and we can do that.

Mr. Denis Dolan who is self-employed had to leave to attend a prior engagement.  He did not expect to be here very long.  As a self-employed person, one cannot always hang around for as long as one would like.<\/p><p>  There has been much discussion on some of the issues we wish to address.  I get the impression that many members have been visited at their clinics by self-employed persons whose situation has increasingly become serious in the past few years owing to the downturn in the economy, which is what drove us to establish our organisation.  We thank the committee for providing us with the opportunity to state our case against the unjust and unwarranted discrimination against members of Self-Employed Alliance Dundalk and all self-employed persons in the country.  Self-employed individuals have contributed enormously to the financing and social structure of the country.  Latest Central Statistics Office figures show that in the first quarter of this year there were just under 300,000 self-employed persons in the State.  The people in question employ a larger section of the workforce than the multinationals which many consider are the dominant employers in the country.  <\/p><p>  I run a shop in my home town of Dundalk, selling outdoor activity products.  Self-Employed Alliance Dundalk was formed in early 2011 as a result of the fear, anxiety and lack of hope within the local business community.  Our members include a wide range of retail and service providers.  Many businesses have seen a dramatic reduction in turnover, while many others have closed in recent years, primarily as a result of the economic downturn.  Large numbers of shops have closed in Dundalk, some of which were in business for generations.  It was obvious from early meetings of the group that there was a wide diversity of factors which were having a detrimental effect on members, including a lack of credit from banks, the withdrawal of long-term overdraft facilities with little notice and no discussion, the burden imposed by the local authority rate increase, bad debts and redundancy payments, etc.  However, the number one issue of concern for many self-employed persons was that there was no safety net for them from the Government when things went wrong.  <\/p><p>  Examples of the disadvantages of being self-employed, as identified by our members, are, first, there is no exposure to unfair dismissal procedures; second, there is no guarantee of a weekly or monthly income; third, there is exposure to financial risk in carrying out work, including bad debts where they arise.  In addition, when things go wrong, family homes can be repossessed.  The fourth reason is the lack of social welfare benefits available should they become unemployed.  Illness, disability and unemployment are not covered by class 3 contributions.<\/p> <p> Fifth, most self-employed persons cannot qualify for jobseeker's benefit since it is only given to those who have paid class A PRSI.  Sixth, there is no requirement to provide for holiday pay.  Seventh, the self-employed are not entitled to extra pay or time off for working overtime - generally, the self-employed put in much greater hours.  Eighth, the self-employed are not entitled to sick pay.  Ninth, they have no invalidity pension cover; and, tenth, they are not entitled to redundancy payments.  Eleventh, in calculating jobseeker's allowance, if the amounts drawn are higher than income, the drawings figure is used.<\/p><p> Twelfth, in calculating income, the deciding officer will ask for the previous set or, possibly, the previous two sets of financial statements, but many self-employed persons' previous accounts will be for 2010.  It is possible, therefore, that a person with a year-end date of 31 January may be assessed on accounts for the period 1 February 2009 to 31 January 2010, that is, up to 2.5 years ago and much will have changed in that period.  Thirteenth, jobseeker's allowance is available if income is below a certain level.  One can remain registered as a sole trader.  However, the rules also state one must be available for work which, if self-employed, technically, one is not.  Fourteenth, there are problems in obtaining rent and mortgage interest supplement, as it is only available to those working less than 30 hours a week.  Self-employed persons have obvious difficulties in establishing the number of hours they work.  Fifteenth, owing to rules relating to the number of hours worked, self-employed persons are not able to claim family income supplement.  Sixteenth, the PRSI system is a disincentive to self-employment - a key component of economic recovery and job creation.  No safety net is provided if things do not go to plan.  Therefore, the risk taken in starting a business is greater.  This could put off would-be entrepreneurs from taking that risk.  Seventeenth, there is a reliance on social welfare deciding officers to decide on claims rather than having exact and complete rules.  As self-employed citizens, we do not enjoy equal status when it comes to unemployment assistance, which most PAYE workers take for granted.  Self-employed workers cannot make the same contributions as PAYE workers, but they must pay most of the PRSI contributions of their employees.<\/p><p> As self-employed workers, we have made significant sacrifices and are still making them.  Most of us work a minimum of 50 hours a week - some work more than 70 hours - yet there is no recognition of the hardship we must endure to keep our business going.  We invest our time, money and health to keep us from going under.  Most of us do not recognise words such as &quot;overtime&quot;, &quot;holidays&quot;, &quot;days off&quot;, &quot;sick pay&quot;, &quot;lunch breaks&quot;, etc.  The committee may not believe us, but these are luxuries we seldom enjoy.  Many of our members could not come here today because of work commitments.  Most of us are rushing back to our businesses after the meeting.  An employee could simply take a day off.<\/p><p> How much have we contributed in financial terms to the country through income tax, PAYE, PRSI, USC, RCT and VAT?  What is our reward if we find ourselves, as many already have, in a situation where we can no longer support ourselves?  When we turn to the system to which we have been paying most of our earnings in one form or another, we are told we are not unemployed citizens but unemployed self-employed citizens.  At social welfare offices we have been turned away because there are no benefits available and no recognition of self-employed unemployed workers.  One is then put through the mill of assessment to be told that one may be entitled to this or that, but, unfortunately, it usually means one is not entitled to anything, which leaves one feeling like a criminal.<\/p><p> This group of unemployed self-employed workers and self-employed workers who may yet find themselves unemployed came together to try to address this appalling inequality.  We want equality, like all other citizens of the country.  We want to be able to make the same PRSI contributions as all employed workers and also to receive the same benefits without omissions.<\/p><p> In accordance with a commitment given in the programme for Government, in 2011 the Minister for Social Protection established an advisory group on tax and social welfare.  Included in its terms of reference were:<blockquote>To constitute a forum to which the Minister for Social Protection may refer specific issues around the income supports and tax systems so that they provide good incentives to take up work and to contribute to the reduction of poverty and child poverty ...<br \/>To examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable ...<\/blockquote>The terms of reference also stipulated that the advisory group should consider any proposal for changes to existing arrangements in a cost-neutral or cost-reducing context.  The Minister recently stated any change to the PRSI system to provide access to short-term benefits such as jobseeker's benefit would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable.  She also noted that the question of social insurance cover for the self-employed was being considered in the actuarial review of the social insurance fund which was due to be completed in mid-2012.  We await same.<\/p><p> The Oireachtas website outlines three major areas covered by the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, two of which link directly with our goals: ensuring our most vulnerable citizens are protected by a strong and equitable social welfare system; and supporting economic recovery.  Therefore, we appeal to the committee to take on board our views when discussing the formulation of future legislation in this regard.  We want equality and justice.<\/p><p> I will hand over to Mr. Fred Matthews who has been through the process of seeking unemployment benefit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012100300010#K01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin McArdle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349259600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I have been self-employed as a pharmacist all my life and I am now 62 years of age.  I have employed between 20 and 25 persons for up to 25 years at a time and contributed millions of euro in tax to the State.  Three years ago my financial well-being hit a wall and I am now treated as worthless by the State.  My daughters decided to go back to education and, because they did not understand the social welfare system and had worked up until the time they sat the leaving certificate examination, were unable to access grants.  They had worked until the month of May, sat the leaving certificate examination and obtained their places.  However, if they had gone on the dole or received jobseeker's allowance in February, they would have been fully funded by the State.  I went to the VEC and other places looking for help because I did not have the ability to fund the fees.  I came out of the VEC in tears; I felt humiliated.  At 59 years of age the State had nothing for me.  I went back to work.  All I understand is that, as an individual, I can create wealth and generate an income.  It is humiliating that my adult daughters, because I am perceived to have the wealth I used to have, are being put through the mill to receive a basic education.  It is stressful and I have had to attend for counselling to get myself in fit shape to live a life.  It has affected my whole family.  This is the impact on the self-employed.  I am independent, but what I do is lunacy.  I create wealth instead of finding a job.  People tell us it cannot be done, but one goes and does it.  That is the core of independent SMEs, but it is being decimated and savaged by being ignored.  That independence leaves us totally isolated because we are easily picked off.<\/p><p>  I am looking for leadership from members and the Deputies and Senators who lead the country.  They give me the impression that they are on this treadmill that was vacated by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government and that they are busy running, but they lack a vision for the future.  Without the ability and support of SMEs, the country will collapse totally because they create the wealth and employment.  I employed 25 persons; now I am indebted everywhere.  Social services which are within the remit of the committee should be available to me and my family when needed.  No one should feel like a second-class citizen in the State.<\/p> <p>Social services, which fall under the remit of this committee, should be available to me and my family when needed, and one should not be made feel like a second-class citizen.  I ask that the system be changed so families associated with SMEs can have access to social services.<\/p><p> Normally SMEs go to the credit union when they are stuck.  I realise this is not in the remit of the committee.  The credit unions are currently being crucified.  To date, the organisation has not received one shilling from the State, yet it is being posited as a failure.  The unions were established by SMEs and people such as myself and my father, yet we cannot get money from them either.<\/p><p> Where does a person such as me go for money to educate my daughters?  The State does not give them support by way of social protection.  We have learned a lesson.  One of my daughters had a baby, went on maternity leave and is now on the jobseeker's allowance.  She buys my rugby tickets and funds my trips if I want to go away because I cannot afford them.  That is the current position; it is the state of the world in which I live.  While I will get nothing off the State - I do not expect to - it should at least treat my family fairly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012100300011#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349260200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>When we were examining this issue, Deputy Butler suggested the delegates would have some insight into it.

They put a lot of time and effort into their cause.  It is a sacrifice for the delegation to be present here today.  My party is now aware that there is a severe imbalance between the treatment of the self-employed and the treatment of employees with regard to the social insurance scheme.

It is great to see them making a presentation.  Their concerns comprise one of the most significant issues that arose on the doorsteps during the last general election campaign.<\/p><p>  I had a shoe shop for 24 years and have been self-employed all my life.  It is disappointing to see so many doors being shut and a lack of information.  Self-employed people really do not know their entitlements because they are busy protecting their businesses and getting on with what they do.  For a self-employed person to enter a constituency office is a huge step.  The self-employed have never been in looking for anything in their lives and, therefore, do not know their entitlements.  All self-employed people have done all their lives is paid.  They kept paying.<\/p><p>  My late father &ndash; Lord have mercy on him &ndash; used to say that once one puts one's name over the door and becomes self-employed, one becomes an unpaid tax collector.  It is great to see the delegates making their case.  Many of the Senators and Deputies are aware of the problem that exists because they have encountered it in their constituencies.  They hear about it daily.<\/p><p>  Many self-employed people have battled to retain their businesses, yet those businesses have deteriorated even more.  They are receiving no help from the banks or credit unions.  I agree totally with Mr. Matthews on this.  The self-employed have been using their savings and the savings are now drying up.  If we are serious about getting this country moving and taking it out of its current mess, we will need self-employed people and SMEs.  The latter will restore the country.  We need a safety net for SMEs.<\/p><p>  I am delighted to see representatives from the Department of Social Protection present.  They have changed their attitude to the self-employed and their entitlements considerably since I became a Member 18 months ago.  In fairness to the Minister for Social Protection, she is working on the issue.  An independent group is producing a report and we will determine how we should proceed when we receive it.<\/p><p>  Circumstances have changed.  During the last general election campaign, I was on local radio, LMFM, and remember Mr. Michael Reade asking me what I would like to do if I got elected.  The issue we are talking about is one I said I would like to address because it has affected me personally.  I know what it is like to go home with the stress and strain of trying to pay one's bills, including one's rates, electricity bill and staff bill.  The SME owner is the last person to get paid and does not get a shilling at all some weeks; he or she is just trying to survive.  I know what it is like to have no money and to bring all one's pressures home with one.  We need a safety net for the self-employed if there is to be progress.<\/p><p>  When I know we are in tough times, I realise we need a safety system if we are to get the country going again.  Self-employed people and SMEs will get the country out of the hole it is in if they are given a chance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012100300012#M00600","speaker":"1079"},{"type":"speech","time":1349260200,"counter":92,"content":"<p>By way of explanation, the reason the Senators left earlier is that they had to attend a vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2012100300012#M00700","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1349260200,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I apologise for my having had to leave to attend a vote in the Seanad.

At every meeting of this committee since I became a member two months ago, I have raised the issue, and I will continue to do so.  We await the advisory committee's report and I hope it will contain recommendations that suit the self-employed.<\/p><p>  While we are always worrying about the big multinational companies and saving 400 jobs here and 300 there, we must realise that if we concentrated on retaining one job here and two or three there, the combined number would be considerable.  The self-employed, while generating an income for their families and not drawing on the Exchequer, help their few employees.  It is vital, therefore, that we help the self-employed.

We were discussing another matter in private session and it overran.<\/p><p>  On behalf of the committee I welcome Mr. Pierre Vimont, the Executive Secretary General of the European External Action Service, EEAS.  He is accompanied by Ms Jutta Edthofer, the Antici counsellor, and Mr. Keith McBean, the Irish Ambassador to the Political and Security Committee in Brussels.<\/p><p>  The EEAS is a very young organisation, having been established in December 2010.  Mr. Vimont and his colleagues have faced the challenge of putting in place a very large organisation with a shared organisational culture, which is a daunting task given that the staff is drawn from so many various backgrounds.  Parallel to these organisational challenges, the EEAS has had to establish itself as an effective actor in international affairs on behalf of the European Union and has played an important role in Serbia and Kosovo, in talks with Iran and in efforts to bring about a resumption of talks in the Middle East peace process.  These few lines sum up a very daunting task.<\/p><p>  The committee is interested to hear how the EEAS approaches the challenges which determine its policy priorities and how it interacts for this purpose with the institutions of the European Union and the member states, in particular the state holding the Presidency, which we will do in the first six months of 2013.  I commend High Representative Catherine Ashton for her commitment in interacting directly with the committees on foreign affairs of EU national parliaments at their twice yearly interparliamentary conferences.  Since I became Chairman of this committee I have attended three Presidency meetings and Baroness Ashton has been there to brief chairpersons from throughout the EU and she also holds question and answer sessions.  I am very impressed with her and her role.  I hope over time the relationship between her and these committees can develop.  It is important that this happens.  In the meantime, we look forward to welcoming Baroness Ashton.  I believe she will be here for OSCE meetings in the first week in December.  We will host a meeting during the Irish Presidency, in the third week of March, and Baroness Ashton has committed to attend it.<\/p><p>  I wish to advise Mr. Vimont that he is protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances to this committee.  However, if he is directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and continues to do so, he is entitled, thereafter, only to a qualified privilege in respect of his remarks.  He is directed that only comments or evidence connected with the subject matter of the meeting are to be given and he is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside of the Houses or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>  Once again I apologise for the delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012100300003#D00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349271000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman, and there is no need to apologise as I was late myself so I feel responsible.  My only urgency is to catch a flight later but until then I am at the disposal of the committee for any questions the members would like to raise.<\/p><p>  My presentation will be brief and will focus on the reason I am here, namely, to prepare for the rotating Presidency which Ireland will hold at the beginning of 2013.  The EEAS must do this because the workings of the institutional system makes very close collaboration with the rotating Presidency very important for us.  The Chairman mentioned the High Representative several times.  As she has two hats - she is also Vice President of the Commission - she has an almost impossible task and therefore needs assistance from the rotating Presidency in some of the work she must complete.<\/p> <p>This is mostly with third countries in the meetings we organise or visits to those countries and in regard to our regular reports to the European Parliament on meetings with foreign Ministers.  That is one of the reasons we must work closely.<\/p><p> The other reason is that, in our daily work, working parties such as the EU Political and Security Committee, PSC, and COREPER, the daily work of the rotating Presidency is intertwined with the daily work of the EEAS.  On a regular basis, we must share our knowledge and our updating of the situation in order to work in the best way possible.  The third reason is to know the priorities of the Irish Presidency and precisely to join our common forces as we prepare the agendas for meetings in the Council and for our contact with foreign countries.  For these reasons, it is quite important to start working now and to be ready for the six months of the Irish Presidency.<\/p><p> The second observation concerns the state of play in the EEAS.  It is a young institution, less than two years old, having been set up in January 2011.  This is an ongoing process and a work in progress.  We need more time to be as efficient as possible but we have managed to deal with the daily work in practical terms.  We must keep working with the rotating Presidency as each one begins.  We have set up a network of EU delegations all over the world.  Our headquarters is working properly and we are chairing different working groups in the PSC.  The High Representative has three councils, including the foreign affairs Ministers, defence Ministers and development Ministers.  This is improving by the day but we still have much to do.  I can take as many questions as the Chairman wishes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012100300003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pierre Vimont","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349271300,"counter":145,"content":"<p>It is important to have some interaction with members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012100300004#E00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1349271300,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and I hope they have a safe journey back.  I have not been a member of this committee for long and I am not familiar with many of the terms referring to the organisations involved.  I am not familiar with the role played by the EEAS so I found the briefing document interesting in the questions it raises.<\/p><p>  Is the EEAS planning any activity on trade with Israeli settlements in light of this committee's proposal for an EU-wide ban on trade on settlement goods?  This arose from the discussion on what was happening in Gaza.  Does the EEAS have a role?  I am supportive of the ban on Israeli settlement goods in order to emphasise that the ban is only on goods produced in Israeli settlements.  We support it because of the illegality of the settlements and the human rights abuses that took place.  It seems that ethnic cleansing is taking place and different NGOs gave us the background to what is happening in the settlement areas.  Does the EEAS have a view?<\/p><p>  Regarding EU sanctions, in the Middle East the High Representative has ensured an ongoing European contribution to efforts to bring about a resumption of talks and to highlight the humanitarian situation in Gaza.  This is a concern shared by Ireland.  The EEAS refers to sanctions policies, another area that has developed significantly over the past year and a half, and the recent resumption of discussions on the Iranian nuclear programme has been in part attributed to the tough measures imposed in January of this year, including a ban on crude oil.  We know the Israeli Government is not signed up to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, and it seems to have nuclear weapons.  It certainly has nuclear power and is able to enrich nuclear fuel.  We have no ban or similar efforts in respect of Israel, despite what is happening in Gaza.  There seems to be a contradiction with what is wrong in one part of the world and what we are doing in another.  Perhaps it is beyond the remit of the EEAS to comment on these matters.  We are placing sanctions on one country yet we do not do anything to another country involved in the same thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012100300004#E00300","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1349271300,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  I am examining the role of the organisation in respect of human rights.  The ambassador referred to working on reform in terms of crisis response and crisis management structures.  Will it apply where there are significant abuses of human rights?  As the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, we have presentations, meetings and briefings with a number of countries and agencies concerned with human rights issues.  Today, three of us had a meeting on the appalling situation in Bahrain, where doctors are prevented from treating injured people because they were protesting.  Other meetings concern what happened in Syria.  It is all very well having human rights principles but we do not have the action to follow from the principles.  Is there a major role for the EEAS in that respect?  What power will it have to intervene in those horrific situations?  I am struck by the irony of certain countries sitting on human rights commissions and committees when such countries are to the fore in human rights concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012100300004#E00400","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1349271300,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Perhaps this point is too political but Ireland is a neutral country.

I recently met him in Brussels as part of a delegation on the Palestine issue and was impressed by his grasp of the situation and with some of the views he expressed on behalf of the European External Action Service.<\/p><p>  Establishment of the European External Action Service has allowed Europe to act in a more coherent fashion in terms of the application of foreign policy, which is to be welcomed.  A criticism appropriately levelled at the European Union in recent years was that there did not exist a type of resourced operation which allowed us to act in a coherent manner.  While, as we are all aware, the service is experiencing some teething problems, they are matters that can be addressed if the political will to do so exists and resources are made available.<\/p><p>  In terms of the Palestinian question, the international community has been rightly accused of inaction in recent years in terms of it allowing the situation to drift.  When a situation like that drifts, the prospects of vulnerable people, including those on the front line, are damaged.  It appears to many of us that the prospects for peace and a lasting settlement in Palestine are distant at this point given what we know about illegal settlements and various other activities.  It also appears that the Palestinian question is always at the mercy of the US electoral cycle.  It is self-evident that the European Union should be playing a much more proactive role in the resolution of the intractable problem on our own doorstep in our southern neighbourhood.<\/p><p>  I would appreciate if Mr. Vimont could outline the role he sees the European Union playing in the context of the EEAS in terms of the resolution of the Palestinian question and if he would comment on the prospect of an EU-wide ban on produce from illegal settlements, on which the committee took a position in recent weeks.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has a strong view on that issue in terms of how it applies to Ireland.  <\/p><p>  I had the opportunity to visit Tunisia in recent months, where I met with some senior public representatives of the new Administration.  We are all aware of the Arab Spring and the consequences in that regard.  A key concern of the Tunisian people, given their proximity to the European Union and historic relationship with Europe during colonial times and in recent times, is how the European Union can assist in bedding down democracy, trade and development and employment and so on in the Maghreb area in Tunisia and across into the Middle East to areas that are now hungry for democracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012100300005#F00200","speaker":"1067"},{"type":"speech","time":1349271900,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Vimont and wish him well in his challenging role.

Perhaps Mr. Vimont would address that issue and would also comment on the renewal of the chapter 7 mandate by the Security Council in November.  Some highly respected experts have warned of the ending of that mandate and the danger of the dissolution of Bosnia without the safeguards provided by the chapter 7 mandate.<\/p><p>  I have two brief questions in regard to humanitarian aid and action.

As regards trade in some products from Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory, this is an issue with which we have been dealing for some time.  It must be remembered that EEAS work can only go as far as member states allow.  Also, this is a competence that belongs to our colleagues in the Commission, with whom we work closely.  On an issue as political as this, we are of course very much involved.  We have stated several times, including again recently, in conclusions from the Council that this issue is one of concern for the European Union.  We have discussed this with member states several times.  To be totally honest, we have not been able thus far to reach an agreement of the 27 members.  What we are witnessing at the moment is member states individually trying to address the issue.  Members may be aware that some UK companies have taken the decision to tag these products in terms of origin.  The decisions which have been taken by individual member states or by enterprise or corporations in those member states are the only ones taken so far.  We recently discussed this issue again with the High Representative who told us she wanted us to continue to put pressure on member states to see how far we can go.  This is a matter of major concern for the Palestinian authorities with whom we are engaging.<\/p><p>  On the general issue of the relationship between the EEAS and the Palestinian Authority, I remind members that the major donor in terms of financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority is the European Union.  In spite of what is being said by many partners inside the region or from other entities around the international community, the European Union is providing most of the financial resources for the day-to-day work of the Palestinian Authority, in other words, the Palestinian administration.  We are supporting the UN agency in charge of Palestinian refugees outside of the Palestinian territory, either in Syria, Lebanon or Jordan.  I could go on.  There is no doubt but that the European Union is the major partner for our Palestinian counterpart.  We intend to continue that work.  Where we can act we try, as we have done in the past, to do so through the provision of financial resources, statements and support for the Palestinian position.  On some other issues which are rather controversial, including that of trade of products from the settlements, we have not been able to go as far as would wish to.  <\/p><p>  The issue of sanctions taken against Iran and against Israel on the issue of the use of nuclear energy for military purposes was mentioned.  Members will be aware, in spite of what has been said time and again, that there is no clear evidence and so on in the Vienna agencies of nuclear weapons in Israel.<\/p> <p> Iran, in contrast, has ratified the non-proliferation treaty and all the inspectors who have gone there are telling us that the Iranian authorities may be in violation of that treaty and of the commitments made by them with regard to it.  From a legal point of view, it is coming not from the European Union alone, but from the international community, as there have been several resolutions from the Security Council on that issue.  The Security Council has asked time and again for Iran to abide by the commitment it made to the NPT and this is why we are imposing sanctions.  We have stated time and again that if Iran goes back inside the framework of the non-proliferation treaty and abides by the advice of the Vienna agency, then we will look again at those sanctions, and we are quite ready to do that.  So far, they have not complied with this wish and this is why we are keeping on with this.<\/p><p> On the issue of human rights, we are trying to be as practical as possible.  The example of Bahrain was cited.  We are closely monitoring it.  On several occasions we sent a mission from our staff there to have contacts with the Bahraini authorities.  We have been in touch with the ambassador from Bahrain in Brussels and time and again have passed messages.  The High Representative has been in touch with her counterpart in Bahrain and, to be honest with the committee, so far to no avail.  We were hopeful at one point because, after incidents that took place during last year's repression, there had been a good report by an independent inquiry which came out with a strong recommendation on what should be done.  We supported that report and asked the Bahraini authorities to implement those conclusions.  We have not been very successful but we will continue to stick to our point.<\/p><p> On human rights in general, we have had adopted in the Council not only a clear statement of our commitment to human rights, but also the setting up of an action plan on what we want to do.  We appointed a special representative, the former Greek foreign minister and former Member of the European Parliament, Mr. Stavros Lambrinidis, who is now in charge and with whom we are working closely.  He is the one who will provide us with a clear indication of what we could do and what should be done everywhere we face difficult cases.<\/p><p> I totally agree on the matter of the contradiction which arises where sometimes there are countries on the board of the council of human rights in Geneva that should not be there.  When a case like that happens, at the time of electing those countries, we try to use all our efforts and all our best endeavours to prevent that.  On several occasions we have succeeded in convincing some of our partners to prevent that, but it is not always the case.<\/p><p> On the question of CSPD and the neutrality of Ireland, what can I say except that any kind of operation we launch in the field of security and defence can only be done with the approval of all member states by consensus.  So far, and with the most recent operations we have launched on the ground, those are mostly of a civilian nature.  It is about the training of military institutions so that we can support the rule of law in some third countries, such as in the Horn of Africa with Somalia, and it is about sending observers to Georgia.  It will be, perhaps tomorrow if we go ahead in the Sahel, about training police or military officers to bring back stability in the north of Niger and perhaps tomorrow in Mali, if there is an agreement among member states.  Once again, nothing in that field can be done without the support of all the member states and we intend to go on in that way because this is what the treaty requests.<\/p><p> On the relationship with regional organisations, such as the African Union or the Arab League, this is certainly one of the major priorities the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, has asked us to implement.  We have had strong requests not only from the African Union or the Arab League, but also from ASEAN and others, to increase our partnership with them.  This is a road for real improvement as we move along because we increasingly detect a common approach with many of these regional organisations and a sense of moving forward together.  The African Union has asked us time and again to work with it.  The Arab League has also done so.  We will have a ministerial meeting with the Arab League at the beginning of November in Cairo and it is eager to set up many new processes in order to work closely together.  This is an interesting road on which we could move as swiftly as possible in order to build a partnership with the different regional organisations, which, I hope, will help in stabilising to some extent the international community which is fraught with too many crises.<\/p><p> On Bosnia-Herzegovina, I have been told about the assessment made by Lord Paddy Ashdown on the disastrous situation as it exists at present in Bosnia, and he is certainly one of those who know best about that region.  We are very much aware that the situation has been deteriorating recently and we are, through the action of our special representative, Mr. Peter S&oslash;rensen, in Sarajevo and through our capacity, putting pressure on the Bosnian authorities because they are very much looking for an improved relationship with the European Union and, tomorrow, the possibility of starting an accession process.  We have told them time and again that we would not follow that road until there had been an improvement on their side and a fulfilment of the three or four clear goals we have set them in relation to the change of their constitution, the rule of law and justice in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  We are adamant on that and we intend to stick to that line.  In the near future, arising from the report the Commission will release in the next few days, one will see this position reaffirmed very strongly.<\/p><p> Briefly, we are trying to do as much as we can for Tunisia.  We have more or less doubled our financial assistance to Tunisia in the past two years, 2011 and 2012, and we need to do much more.  We have offered to start negotiation on what we call the deep and comprehensive trade agreement, in other words, to make Tunisia more or less part of the European Single Market.  We have offered them also negotiation on mobility of their citizens with all the necessary safeguards that would be necessary.  We very much hope they will proceed along those lines so that we can promote economic and social development with that country.  We are having regular political meetings.  Their Prime Minister was in Brussels yesterday.  There were meetings with the Tunisian President one week ago in New York.  This is certainly inside the events that are taking place in the Arab world.  It is one of the countries that we have, in a sort of way, prioritised compared to others if only because the scale of the problems Tunisia faces are manageable to some extent for the European Union.  This is where I hope we could have, if we work well, a good success story in the future and we are very much underlining the importance and the priority that Tunisia is for us.<\/p> <p> We are looking at the issue of humanitarian aid.  Humanitarian aid comes within the competence of Commissioner Georgieva but in the framework of the comprehensive approach that the EEAS is trying to promote in every national, regional or local crisis, at some point there will always be the humanitarian dimension.  This happened in Libya one year ago, and today in northern Mali and Syria.  We work closely with our colleagues from the Commission to ensure consistency, whether in political or diplomatic efforts, with what is being done in the humanitarian field.<\/p><p> In regard to national parliaments, what we are trying to do is more or less what I am doing today.  Every time we visit a member state we have contacts with the national parliament if only to listen to any grievances against the EEAS but also to try to improve and take stock of some of the good ideas and to inform it about the ongoing process.  As the Chairman said in his introductory remarks, the twice yearly meetings with national parliaments, at which the High Representative attends on a regular basis, are very important to us.  When the parliamentary assembly of the WEU disappeared we all agreed that we had to find another way of working with national parliaments as it was important for us to get regular inputs from them.  We are aware of that and ready to take stock of whatever observation or recommendation we can get from national parliaments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012100300005#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pierre Vimont","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349273100,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Vimont.

When a submission is made that should be taken note of, is it ignored?  The tendency is for warring factions in various places to ignore everybody.

To what extent has it been used by the EEAS as a means of promoting the positive progress in respect of the situation presented?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012100300007#H00300","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1349273100,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Perhaps I can explain a few elements.  The Deputy asked about Syria.  We have maintained our EU delegation to Syria, therefore, we are in contact with the Government of Syria and express strong messages, time and again, about the need for the Syrian Government to take notice of what the international community has repeated time and again.  Of course, we are a nuisance and Syria is not happy with that and has told us so.  At the same time, it respects us because we have remained in Damascus saying we want to be close to the people of Damascus and Syria at a time of great suffering and try to help them as much as we can through humanitarian assistance.  We should do much more and this is what we are trying to do.  The fact that we are there is important.<\/p><p>  In the case of Iran, the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, chairs the EU 3 plus 3 group, in other words the group that is negotiating on behalf of the international community to try to find a solution to the whole issue of the nuclear programme.  She has regular contacts with her counterpart.  Every time they have decided they should meet they have arranged a meeting without difficulty, which means they may not like what the High Representative has to tell them but they come, listen, discuss and, perhaps, contradict her but we are considered as a legitimate partner, which is not bad. <\/p><p>  On the question about the International Criminal Court and whether there should be a referral to that court, that is a complicated issue.  Do we have to push that issue as quickly as possible at the beginning of a crisis, with the risk of closing any possibility of finding a solution to make the leader involved in that crisis step down from office?  There is a need to think about this issue.   <\/p><p>  With regard to Syria, more than half of the member states are of the opinion that we should have a referral to the International Criminal Court.  A few member states wonder whether we should wait a little longer.  It was decided among all of us to discuss that issue with Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, the joint special representative of the UN and the Arab League for Syria.  We would not want to jeopardise his efforts and the plan he is trying to set up to try to find a political solution to the crisis.  If Mr. Brahimi is of the opinion that we should go ahead with a referral to the International Criminal Court, then the 27 of us will meet again to decide if we should go forward on that issue.  It is a tricky issue on which, every time, we have to look at the pros and cons and find the right balancing act.  While we have not yet decided on a referral to the International Criminal Court, we are trying to use, as much as possible, all the evidence we can gather and work very closely with the commission of inquiry in Geneva to have the principle of accountability with regard to what is happening in Syria implemented as fully as possible<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2012100300007#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pierre Vimont"},{"type":"speech","time":1349273100,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I thank the ambassador and his team for appearing before the committee.
