It serves as a repository for notices above EU thresholds and which must be advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union. In accordance with policy guidelines from my Department contracting authorities are also obliged to publish all tender notices for goods and services with a value greater than &#8364;25,000 on the eTender website. In 2012, there were 6,439 notices published on this site. <\/p><p><br \/>  It was necessary in 2011 to go to the market for a replacement for the old eTendering system as the contract with the original service provider was coming to an end. <\/p><p><br \/>  The tender for the new service followed an in depth market analysis by a cross-agency steering group, including representatives from the HSE and Departments of Finance and Justice. Research for the specification also included presentations of systems by some of the leading service providers in the market place.<\/p><p><br \/>  The new site, as well as publishing contract notices has a wide range of additional functionality that in effect will allow other aspects of the procurement process to be completed electronically, including assessment, awarding and contract management. This additional functionality is improving and generating efficiencies for both the public and private sectors. <\/p><p>Following an EU wide tendering process, during which no Irish company submitted a tender, the contract to provide the service was awarded to a new service provider, a Swedish company EU Supply Holding AB, Arbetargatan 33, 112 45 Stockholm,Sweden.<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>   The cost of the new system is &#8364;677,459 over the five-year life of the contract. This works out at &#8364;33,873 per quarter over the lifetime of the contract, which is a considerable saving on the &#8364;57,690, which was paid to the previous service provider - for the previous service - in the last quarter of 2012.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Prior to launching the new site on the 12 of November 2012, apart from detailed user guides and briefing of their representative bodies, registered Suppliers were also informed about the proposed change of system at various Meet the Buyer events and other seminars. Training on the system was offered to all public sector Buyers before the new system went live and over 1,200 buyers availed of these opportunities. These training opportunities are ongoing. The service provider also provides personal support to the approximate 80,000 registered users of this site through a Helpdesk facility.<\/p><p><br \/>  The new system went live on the 12 of November 2012. Even allowing for the trebling of the server capacity for the initial days following the launch, the volume of users accessing the system (10,000 users signed in that day where there would normally be a maximum daily average of 500 users) caused a delay in the server response times. Some incorrect server settings were also detected that day. These access and response issues were resolved that day and have not arisen since. <\/p><p>Separately users to the national portal informed the NPS during the week of 12 November of claims that they had received unsolicited marketing emails from the previous operator of the service, marketing a new service. This caused widespread confusion among public sector Buyers and Suppliers and resulted in a large number of calls of complaint to the Helpdesk. The NPS is in discussions with the Office of the Data Protection Commission and is aware that the previous operator has issued an apology to some users of the old eTenders website for using their contact details for this purpose.<\/p><p><br \/>  Most of the complaints since the launch of the new site relate to the confusion caused by the previous service provider who had issued user names and password for their new Mytenders system. Many users tried to access eTenders using these usernames and passwords, but obviously could not gain access, leading to a lot of angry calls to the Helpdesk. By the end of the second week after going live, and after the confusion caused by Mytenders had been resolved, Helpdesk calls were down to less than 250 routine calls per day. <\/p><p><br \/>  Data migration issues from the previous operator to the new operator of the eTender website also created problems for Suppliers to receive alerts within their area of business about new tenders published from Monday 12 November. <\/p><p><br \/>  In relation to live tenders that transferred from the old system to the new system, over the weekend of 10 November, some data migration issues arose and were resolved within a few days.<\/p><p><br \/>  The National Procurement Service communicated with all registered Suppliers and Buyers, in the days following the launch of the new site, advising them of the solutions to the issues that arose, apologised for the early problems and acknowledged the inconvenience arising.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300062#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300062#WRB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[2816\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300062#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the discussions he has had with Troika officials in respect of ensuring that departmental spending overruns are minimised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>For each of the nine quarters since the EU\/IMF Programme of Financial Support commenced in late 2010, the Government has successfully met all of the targets.  In the expenditure area, discussions with Troika officials have been proceeding satisfactorily with a focus upon the continued attainment of spending targets and the steps necessary to address particular areas of pressure.  It may be helpful to present a summary overview of the type of issues and considerations that are relevant in this overall area at present.<\/p><p><br \/>  The end-year underlying Departmental expenditure position, adjusting for PRSI receipts, has been kept on target, with only a 0.4% deviation from target.  The majority of Departments were broadly on profile by end-December.  There were net overspends in the areas of Social Protection and Health.  The Social Protection overspend was mainly due to lower than expected PRSI receipts in 2012 and increased expenditure on unemployment related schemes.  These pressures arise from a weaker than anticipated economic environment which has been factored into the latest forecasts underpinning Budget 2013.<\/p><p><br \/>  As regards health, the key factors contributing to the 2012 expenditure overrun include: hospital activity levels in excess of service plan targets, lower than projected income from private health insurance companies, and medical card and drug scheme expenditures increased at a higher rate than previously anticipated.  The Department of Public Expenditure &amp; Reform will continue to work with the Department of Health in ensuring that health spending is managed within the agreed ceiling for 2013.  <\/p><p><br \/>  This Government's approach to addressing the management of expenditure over the medium-term has been clearly set out in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014<\/i>   (CER) published by the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp; Reform on 5 December 2011.  The CER introduced fixed multi-annual expenditure ceilings for all Departments in line with commitments made under the Troika programme of support.  The intention of this reform measure is to improve the focus on medium-term, structural and strategic planning of expenditure within each area and to prevent spending overruns where possible.  Under this measure, multi-annual current expenditure ceilings are fixed for each Department in order to make clear, in advance, the resources available for each area and the level of savings required.  <\/p><p>The ceilings were set out on an administrative basis in 2012 and the <i>Expenditure Report 2013<\/i>   published by the Minister on 5 December 2012 accounted for minor technical adjustments to these ceilings due to a number of social and economic developments over the past year.  The ceilings will be put on a statutory footing in the coming months.  This will ensure that the reform becomes a permanent structural feature of Ireland&#8217;s budgetary framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300062#WRB00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Legislation","counter":17,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300062#WRB00950"},{"type":"question","counter":18,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[2838\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300062#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the way in which the designation of commercially sensitive information is arrived at; if his Department has specific guidelines in place for the designation of information as commercially sensitive; his plans to reform this area in future legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":19,"content":"<p>I presume the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the position pertaining under Freedom of Information legislation.  Section 27 of the Freedom of Information Act sets out categories of information which are classed as commercially sensitive and are on that basis exempt from release under the Act.  The basis to commercial sensitivity includes trade secrets, financial, commercial, scientific, technical or other information whose disclosure could reasonably be expected to result in a material financial loss or gain to the person to whom the information relates or prejudice the competitive position of that person in the conduct of his or her business or the conduct of contractual negotiations.  The consultation procedures laid down in section 29 of the Act must be followed before making a final decision on disclosure of such records.  In addition, commercially sensitive information may be released, for example, if the information, or similar information is already in the public domain or if the provider of the information was informed before providing the information that such information could be made available to the public.  It is also very important to note that if in the opinion of the head concerned, the public interest would, on balance, be better served by granting than by refusing to grant the request, the issue of possible commercial sensitivity can be set aside and the relevant records released. <\/p><p>  In view of the diversity of situations in which information which is potentially releasable under FOI can give rise to issues of commercial sensitivity careful examination is required of the individual circumstances applying in each case.  Detailed guidelines are available from the FOI Central Policy Unit&rsquo;s website www.foi.gov.ie on the interpretation and implementation of  section 27 requirements relating to commercially sensitive information including from relevant custom and practice and case law in this area.  In addition, the Office of the Information Commission publishes decisions on reviews on her website and special reports which provide extensive guidance to public bodies on how the Information Commissioner assesses decisions of public bodies in relation to FOI requests which would include records classed as commercially sensitive.  The steps that may be necessary to strengthen and enhance current guidance to FOI for decision-makers more generally relating to the operation of the Act will be considered as part of the forthcoming operational and management review of FOI which is expected to commence shortly. <\/p><p>  I do not currently propose to make any changes to section 27 of the FOI Act in relation to the exemption available for commercially sensitive information.

In order to be compatible with EU law, they must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States.<\/p><p>  The European Commission issued guidance in 2010 that identified a range of social considerations that could be relevant for procurement including promoting employment opportunities for young unemployed or long-term unemployed and promoting compliance with core labour standards. This guidance stressed that when incorporating social considerations into the procurement process one of the key challenges is ensuring compliance with the EU Treaty Principles and the Procurement Directives. The EU procurement directive primarily envisages that social considerations may be included as contract performance conditions, provided they are not discriminatory and are included in the contract notice or in the contract documents and relate to the performance of the contract. For example, the EU Directive states that contract performance conditions may be intended to favour on-site vocational training, the employment of people experiencing particular difficulty in achieving integration, the fight against unemployment or the protection of the environment. <\/p><p>  Challenges arise from the need to ensure that: value for money is not adversely affected; additional costs are not placed on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers; and the targeted benefit is capable of being measured and monitored during execution of the contract.<\/p><p>  The inclusion of social clauses in the procurement process would appear to be most suited to situations where the social benefit could be considered a core requirement and can be directly linked to the contracting authority&rsquo;s policy or strategic plan. Experience in other Member States, would also indicate that social clauses will tend to be used for services and works contracts rather than supply contracts.  A further consideration is the ability of contracting authorities to effectively monitor compliance with the social clause; this may be more difficult where some of the work is to be performed in another Member State. <\/p><p>  The Government has a wide range of measures that it is deploying to facilitate job creation and support labour activation, with particular emphasis on assisting the long term unemployed people.  Obviously, the main purpose of the public procurement process is to ensure that goods, services and works are purchased by the State in a manner that is legal, transparent and of high probity, and our key requirement is the achievement of value for money.  Within this context, I have been looking with the Department and the National Procurement Service to see whether the use of social clauses as an additional means of supporting activation and we are seeking to identify the scope for the use of social clauses in parts of the capital area in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300062#WRB02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":35,"content":"<p>Question No. 18 answered with Question No. 6.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works Expenditure","counter":37,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300063#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":38,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[2807\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300063#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he is satisfied that value for money has been achieved by the Office of Public Works in respect of expenditure incurred to date in relation to Ireland's EU Presidency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":39,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works is responsible for providing logistical support for Ireland's EU Presidency.

The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.

There are always certain limited exceptions for example in relation to some frontline posts, or statutory positions, etc. where a sufficiently strong business case is made.

Roscommon.  Under the scheme local authorities are responsible for the planning, procurement, detailed financial management and day-to-day implementation of the works. <\/p><p>  I am advised that, before undertaking works, the Council engaged a firm of Consulting Engineers to study and assess the catchment of the River Suck in the vicinity of Athleague and to recommend flood alleviation measures. <\/p><p>  The following works were undertaken by the Council:<\/p><p>  - Site investigation works,<\/p><p>  - The clearance of existing drainage channels within the village, particularly to the north of the main street,<\/p><p>  - The reinstatement of a drainage channel between the Creamery and old Church (now a craft centre) just west of the Suck River \tbridge,<\/p><p>  - The clearance of two existing large diameter pipes, just to the east of the Suck River bridge,<\/p><p>  - Accommodation works connected with the reconstruction of the Silver Stream under existing walls, and tree cutting and removal.<\/p><p>  I am advised that the Council did not proceed with the construction of a diversion weir and channel upstream of Castlestrange bridge as the report it commissioned prior to works commencing concluded that this would not provide an appropriate level of flood protection to Athleague.  The flood level of the River Suck within Athleague is significantly influenced by the backwater effect from capacity restrictions within the existing channel of the river and the proposed works upstream of Athleague would not have alleviated this. <\/p><p>  Regarding insurance, I am aware of the difficulties some people are experiencing in securing insurance cover for flood risk at affordable prices or at all.  It must be acknowledged that the provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies based on their assessment of the risks they are accepting.  These are generally considered on a case-by-case basis and an insurance company cannot be compelled to accept a particular insurance risk.  The Irish Insurance Federation say that insurers try to provide flood cover wherever possible but that flood insurance is sometimes not economically viable. <\/p><p>  In March 2012, I had a very constructive engagement with the insurance industry about the scope and scale of the work undertaken by the OPW on flood risk management, on the alleviation schemes being undertaken in many of our large cities and towns and, in particular, on the mapping of areas subject to flood risk nationally which will emerge from the CFRAM programme. <\/p><p>  I indicated then that I wished to see an agreement reached as quickly as possible between the OPW and the IIF on a sustainable system of information sharing particularly for locations vulnerable to flooding and for identifying flood alleviation schemes and works completed and where the standard of protection afforded by these works could be verified.<\/p><p>  A working group has been established between OPW, the IIF and representatives of several insurance companies to progress the work in this area in order that the insurance industry can be better informed as to the extent of the OPW's investment in flood protection measures over the last decades and to ensure that that investment is taken into account in assessing flood risk for insurance purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300064#WRD00300","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":65,"content":"<p>Question No. 29 answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":66,"content":"<p>Question No. 30 answered with Question No. 6.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme","counter":67,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300064#WRD00550"},{"type":"question","counter":68,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[2805\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300064#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if more effective procedures will be put in place to ensure that the overall Exchequer capital budget is spent in line with the annual published profile and, as occurred in the early part of 2012, is avoided; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":69,"content":"<p>The actual roll-out of capital expenditure is a matter for line Departments, operating within the multi-annual budgetary allocations decided by Government and within delegated sanction arrangements issued by my Department.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, capital spending has general characteristics which influence the allocation drawdown pattern.  Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year.  Obviously, this affects the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure.  In addition, public financial rules require that payments are only made on foot of matured liabilities, so payments made in the later parts of the year are made on foot of work that has already been satisfactorily completed.

Following publication of the policy paper, this consultation process will be expanded to include a broad spectrum of stakeholders and other experts. <\/p><p>  As part of the reform of the political expenses regime, in the context of the Expenditure Estimates for 2013, I announced further changes to the system of allowances and expenses payable to members of the Oireachtas.  There has been a 10% reduction - 25% in the case of Dublin members - in travel and accommodation expenses and the public representational allowance will be vouched and the vouched amounts reduced.  It also intended to reduce by 50% the number of pre-paid envelopes available to members and the unvouched elements of the secretarial scheme.<\/p><p>  The Government has also decided that a 10% reduction will be applied to the Party Leaders&rsquo; Allowance rates payable to qualifying leaders of political parties and to qualifying independent members.

We are bringing public expenditure back to a sustainable level and driving forward the public service reform agenda to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government began the process of medium-term expenditure management with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) exercise in 2011, which was carried out by all Departments to identify ways of reducing expenditure, in line with commitments under the Joint EU\/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland, while minimising the impact on service delivery.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ministerial expenditure ceilings for 2012 - 2014 were introduced on an administrative basis in the <i>Comprehensive Expenditure Report<\/i>, published in December 2011.  The CRE exercise forms the foundation of these ceilings and is the basis for all subsequent decisions on expenditure.  The precise composition of the 2013 budgetary consolidation was set out in the Expenditure Report 2013, published on 5 December, 2012.<\/p><p><br \/>  As regards discussions with the Troika, there has been a series of meetings held with the Troika to appraise all the elements of the programme covering fiscal developments, the macroeconomic outlook, progress on commitments regarding restructuring of the financial sector and structural reform.<\/p><p><br \/>  In keeping with an EU\/IMF Programme commitment, the expenditure ceilings are to be put on a statutory footing, which will ensure that this reform measure becomes a permanent structural feature of Ireland&#8217;s budgetary framework.  The necessary legislative change to introduce the Medium Term Expenditure Framework is included in the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2012<i>,<\/i> which was published on 28 September.  In essence, the Bill provides for the power of the Government to set out an overall ceiling for aggregate current expenditure for each of the following three years and for the aggregate ceilings to be apportioned into Ministerial expenditure ceilings.  The annual Estimates of Expenditure must, in turn, not exceed the overall limits set out by the Government.<\/p><p><br \/>  With reference to reform delivery, the Government&#8217;s ambitious Public Service Reform Plan was published in November, 2011 and sets out the basis for the comprehensive and strategic reform of the Irish Public Service.  Effective structures to drive and monitor the implementation of the reform plan have been put in place.  The Cabinet Committee on Public Service Reform is driving the reform agenda at political level. <\/p><p><br \/>  Last September, a statement on the progress on the implementation of the reform plan was published.  The Reform and Delivery Office is working closely with organisations across the Public Service and good progress continues to be made in the implementation of the reform plan.  For example:<\/p><p><br \/>  - The new approach to public procurement will involve integrating procurement policy, strategy and operations in one office; strengthening spend analytics and data management; much greater aggregation of purchasing across public bodies to achieve better value for money; evaluating demand levels to assess how demand (volume) can be reduced; and strengthening vendor and category management. <\/p><p>- Government approved the establishment of a HR Shared Service Centre for the Civil Service called PeoplePoint  .  The centre will provide routine high volume HR and Pensions Administration for 40 public bodies on one HR Management System.  Pensions shared service will be integrated with the HR shared service.  Following a baselining study on Civil Service payroll arrangements, a business case for the development of a Civil Service payroll is at an advance stage.  Baselining of finance management and banking arrangements across the Civil Service is also underway. <\/p><p><br \/>  -Following a Government decision last year, all proposed new services across the public service will be first tested for external service delivery before any approval to provide the service internally will be granted.  A shortlist of potential major projects for priority implementation is being prepared and the main sectors are also developing their own external service delivery plans.<\/p><p><br \/>  - The Croke Park agreement will continue to be an essential element in enabling the comprehensive reforms that are taking place across the system.  The agreement is supporting a significant and sustainable reduction in payroll costs in the public service as well as supporting the implementation of measures aimed at reducing operating costs and generating greater administrative efficiencies.  The implementation body has reported total savings in the order of &#8364;1.5 billion over the first two years of the agreement, which comprises of approximately &#8364;810m and &#8364;680m in pay and non-pay savings, respectively.  This is happening in a climate of industrial peace in the public service, the value of which is often overlooked.  <\/p><p><br \/>  While good progress has been made on delivering savings and implementing change, it remains a matter for each Minister and their Departments to ensure that the Vote-level allocations are adhered to and at the same time ensure that they continue to provide essential frontline services and respond to increasing demands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300064#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":89,"content":"<p>Question No. 37 answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services","counter":90,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300065#WRE00250"},{"type":"question","counter":91,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[2830\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300065#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans for new shared services across the public services; the lessons that have been learned from recent experiences in respect of shared services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1065","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":92,"content":"<p>Within the Reform and Delivery Office, the Shared Services Transformation Unit is leading a number of key projects. <\/p><p><br \/>  In May of last year, a formal decision was taken by the Government to set up a HR and Pensions Administration Shared Service Centre, called <b><i>PeoplePoint, <\/i><\/b>in Clonskeagh in Dublin.  <b><i>PeoplePoint <\/i><\/b>will commence HR services at the end of March, 2013. It is estimated that with the establishment of <b><i>PeoplePoint<\/i><\/b>   and post 2014, when all 40 Departments and Offices have transitioned and the shared service is stabilised that the annual cost of HR services for the civil service will be reduced significantly by &#8364;12.5m per annum.<\/p><p> - Payroll services administered by the Civil Service have been baselined and a business case to drive greater efficiencies and improved payroll services through Payroll Shared Services is well advanced. <\/p><p> - A project to gather data to baseline current Civil Service Finance Management and Banking activities has commenced.<\/p><p> - The Shared Services Transformation Unit in my Department is working with nominated senior officials to ensure that robust Share Services plans are developed and implemented in the other key sectors of Health, Education, Justice, Defence and Local Government.<\/p><p><br \/>  Shared Services aims to achieve effective, cost-efficient internal non-core services, that delivers high-quality services and value for money.  <\/p><p><br \/>  Global studies on implementing Shared Services in the public and private sectors highlights that shared services projects are complex especially where there are multiple stakeholders and multiple ICT solutions in place.<\/p><p><br \/>  The UK National Audit Office Report (2012) blamed poor co-ordination, costly IT systems, weak sanctions and demands for tailored services for the spiralling costs.  The report recommended that strong governance, baselining, standardisation of processes, robust service management, benefits realisation tracking, change management and continuous improvement be implemented for all future projects.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the Civil Service, we are seeking to implement the lessons learned from this report in the following ways: <\/p><p><b>1. Strong Programme Management and Governance: <\/b>We are building capability in programme management and project management. A strong governance model is being developed to ensure transparent accountability and to ensure a compliant harmonious service oriented organisation.  <\/p><p><b>2. Baselining:<\/b> Our Shared Service methodology involves managing each Shared Services programme at a controlled speed.  A business case is prepared for each Shared Service project. The financial and non-financial value of all possible options is considered to evaluate value for money to the taxpayer and to monitor the realisation of benefits.<\/p><p><b>3. Standardisation of processes: <\/b>Learning from others our risk mitigation for lack of standardisation of processes is to design common standard efficient processes for implementation with minimal customisations.  Processes are being designed in collaboration with Customer Departments and Public Service Bodies to ensure that their needs are understood and represented in any future design. <\/p><p><b>4. Service Management:<\/b> The approach being taken to Service management includes  the documentation of services to be provided by the Shared Services Centre; that there is a clear segregation of duties between the Shared Service Centre and the retained organisation; that all standards and measures of performance are documented within a Service Delivery Guide. <\/p><p><b>5. Change Management and Continuous Improvement: <\/b>Shared Services requires the redesign and transformation of the remaining organisation and making staff changes after transactional work transfers to the Shared Services Centre.  The change management activities are being led by an organisation design team as an integral part of each Shared Services programme. <\/p><p><br \/>  Overall, I am satisfied with the progress being made.  A robust transformation plan is being implemented for the Civil Service. The government&#8217;s reform programme is delivering results.  The public service is changing.

This will be retained in the reform legislation. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister detailed the Government&rsquo;s proposals in the area of the reform and extension of FOI at my recent meeting with the Oireachtas Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform Committee to discuss the General Scheme of the FOI reform legislation the drafting of which is currently underway.  Some of the main features of the reform of FOI are: -<\/p><p> - the significant additional restrictions in access to Government records introduced in 2003 are proposed for repeal in full;<\/p><p> - the mandatory &lsquo;blanket&rsquo; class exemption for records relating to security, defence, international relations and Northern Ireland is also being removed; <\/p><p> - the scope for certifying the existence of a deliberative process by Secretaries General is also proposed for repeal and the original public interest test applying in such circumstances is being reinstated.<\/p><p>  While repealing the exemption relating to the costing of a public body of a proposal by a political party, my proposals maintain the exemption for records provided to Ministers for the conduct of parliamentary business.  The retention reflects the Government&rsquo;s strong view that the potential for the release of all such records, could significantly undermine the direct and explicit constitutional accountability of Ministers to the Oireachtas, secured through ministerial statements in the Houses and to Oireachtas committees and through replies to parliamentary questions.<\/p><p>  Despite the very substantial restrictions and limitations to FOI introduced in 2003, the introduction of &quot;up-front&quot; FOI fees for non-personal requests is often presented in public debate as the most significant curtailment to FOI made at that time, notwithstanding that such fees apply to about three in ten of all FOI requests and the practice by those making frequent non-personal FOI requests has often been to make multiple requests within a single application while paying one application fee.<\/p><p>  Consequently, in assessing priorities for reform on fee levels overall, I concluded that the introduction of prohibitive fees for internal review and appeal cases to the Information Commissioner (i.e. &euro;75 and &euro;150 respectively) represented the most serious impediment to ensuring the effective operation of the FOI system overall.<\/p><p>  The evidence is that the introduction of high fee levels in these areas has acted as a very strong disincentive to applications for both internal reviews and appeals by requesters who are dissatisfied with the decision-making of public bodies. <\/p><p>  The consequent diminution in oversight and scrutiny by the Information Commissioner of the implementation of the legislation by public bodies is unlikely to have a positive effect on the quality of decision-making or the extent to which decision-makers would apply key balancing tests, in particular relating to the public interest favouring release.<\/p><p>  The sharp reduction in the level of these fees to &euro;30 and &euro;50 (in the case of internal review and appeal fees respectively) is therefore, a core element of the overall package of FOI reforms.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that in my meeting with the Oireachtas Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform Committee I made clear that in the context of the pre-legislative scrutiny process being carried out on the FOI reform legislation I was open to any case that may be made relating to any matter encompassed by the proposed legislation.<\/p><p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that the Information Commissioner already has the power, in effect, to publically reprimand a public body for the performance of its responsibilities under the Act.  In addition to the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s conclusions on the handling of FOI requests by public bodies under the Act arising from the publication of her Decisions and the content of her Annual Report under section 40 of the Act, if the Information Commissioner considers it appropriate to do so in the public interest, she may publish a report in relation to any investigation or review carried out by her including into the practices and procedures adopted by public bodies in facilitating requestors in exercising their rights under the Act.   I expect that the Information Commissioner would not hesitate to avail of this power - and others allowing her to report to the responsible Minister - in the highly unlikely circumstances that any public body essentially ignored its legal obligations under the Act which would also be likely to give rise to a criminal offence under the legislation.  <\/p><p>  I do not favour the introduction of a system of administrative sanctions such as fines for the Information Commissioner.  In addition to the significant and complex legal issues that arise in relation to any such scheme, I would be concerned that such an approach has the potential to erode the positive and constructive relationship between the Information Commissioner and public bodies overall in relation to the operation of the Act and the processing of appeal cases.  The Deputy will acknowledge that decision making on the release of particular records can often reflect finely balanced and carefully considered judgements. I do not believe it would be prudent or appropriate to provide a power to the Information Commissioner in such circumstances nor has the Information Commissioner sought such a power. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300065#WRE00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":99,"content":"<p>Question No. 40 answered with Question No. 10.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":101,"content":"<p>Question No. 41 answered with Question No. 7.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates","counter":102,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300066#WRF00250"},{"type":"question","counter":103,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[2824\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300066#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the discussions he has had with the Valuation Office in respect of valuing for commercial rates purposes assets to be transferred to any new State organisation when these assets are not currently subject to commercial rates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":104,"content":"<p>The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Act 2001.

These Departments estimate that there will be scope to effect about 2,000 exits from these areas over time, mainly from back office and support areas and management and administrative grades.

My officials have held consultations with the representatives of these organisations and this process is still underway. I am willing to meet other interested parties who express an interest in the provisions of the Bill as was pointed out in the course of the debate in the Seanad.<\/p><p><br \/>  As regards the definition of &#8220;material change of circumstances&#8221; (MCC), the position is that the valuations of individual properties are revised to reflect <i>physical <\/i>  changes that have occurred such  as new buildings, extensions, sub-divisions, exemptions, etc. This is a consequence of the statutory provisions expressly set out in Part 6 of the Valuation Act 2001 rather than any restrictive interpretation adopted by the Valuation Office. Individual properties the subject of applications for revision, are valued by reference to the values on the valuation list of other properties in the same rating authority area. The values are based on the actual physical characteristics of the property at the time of valuation.  <\/p><p><br \/>  On the other hand, the general revaluation provisions in Part 5 of the Valuation Act 2001 takes account of the economic changes that take place in the property market over time. A revaluation is where all properties in a rating authority area are valued by reference to market conditions prevailing at a specific valuation date and these valuations become effective for rating purposes at the same time across the entire rating authority area. Economic conditions prevailing at the date of revaluation are effectively frozen until the next revaluation takes place which, under the provisions of the 2001 Act, must take place every 5-10 years. As the property market is dynamic, it would not be possible to reflect ongoing economic changes in the valuation list and at the same time maintain stability between values on the list and equity and fairness between ratepayers. If revision of individual property values was to have regard to economic factors then a ratepayer whose property was being revised would be advantaged or disadvantaged vis-a-vis other ratepayers depending on the relative strength or weakness of the property market at that point in time. It is for that reason that a change in the MCC provisions has not been included in the Bill now before the Oireachtas.<\/p><p><br \/>  However, the restrictive nature of the MCC provisions means that in certain circumstances where it may be appropriate to amend a valuation, e.g. where an error occurred in relation to a valuation, it is currently not possible to do so. It is proposed therefore, to amend the Valuation Act, 2001, so that following a decision not to amend a valuation because no material change in the circumstances had occurred, the ratepayer may within 40 days make representations to the Commissioner of Valuation who can then amend the valuation so that it is comparable to the valuations of similar properties on the same valuation list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300067#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Private Partnerships","counter":131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300067#WRJ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":132,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[2837\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300067#WRJ01400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will consider making the contracts for public private partnerships publicly available to enhance accountability; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the designation of contracts such as these as commercially sensitive hinders the ability of elected representatives to hold public authorities to account and ensure value for money; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1033","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":133,"content":"<p>The current arrangements in place in relation to the control and monitoring of PPP contracts are in line with EU law in this area and are consistent with the approach adopted in the UK and other countries.<\/p><p><br \/>  PPP contracts involve the private sector partner designing, building, financing, operating and\/or maintaining the asset over a 25-30 year period.

The most important contribution capital investment can now make is in providing the capacity for the economy to grow, which will in turn create employment. <\/p><p>  The stimulus package included 1.4 billion euro to fund the proposed new Public Private Partnerships (PPP) programme.  This investment is directed towards projects that meet key infrastructural needs and are in line with the priorities in the Government's Investment Framework.  These projects will form the first phase of a new programme of PPPs designed to stimulate economic growth and create employment.  As the Phase 1 projects are progressed and as funding permits, projects that could be delivered as part of further phases will be considered.<\/p><p>  Job creation is a critical priority for Government.  Investment in the projects included in the Stimulus package is expected to generate significant numbers of jobs spread out across the country.  Analysis of each sector indicates that the investment may generate around 13,000 direct jobs and many more indirect jobs.  It will also create much needed social and economic infrastructure and aid economic recovery. <\/p><p>  The National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) are working closely with Departments to progress projects and to accelerate delivery of this much needed activity. The preparatory work for the projects is well underway in the various Departments and Agencies.  At this early stage in the process most of the employment impact to date has been in the technical and advisory areas.  Further employment benefits will be evident as the projects progress through the tendering phase and the construction gets underway. <\/p><p>  The indicative timetable for the projects shows that the most advanced ones will be proceeding to tender from quarter 2 of this year and construction is expected to commence by end of 2014.  <\/p><p>  My Department together with the NDFA and the Sponsoring Authorities are also looking at how to maximise job creation as part of each tender competition that is in line with procurement regulations.

Mali has also been discussed during a number of bilateral exchanges at official and political levels between Ireland and France, including following the French military intervention at the request of the Malian authorities on 11 January.   The situation was discussed in detail at an extraordinary meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council, in Brussels on 17 January.  The Council was addressed by the French Foreign Minister, as well as by the Malian Foreign Minister. The Council had a comprehensive discussion on the crisis and made important decisions on the EU&rsquo;s collective response in the period ahead. <\/p><p>  This latest phase in the crisis began during the week of 11 January when militants based in the north pushed southwards towards Mali&rsquo;s capital, Bamako. The previous day, the UN Security Council stated that the deterioration in the situation threatened the stability and integrity of Mali &quot;and constitutes a direct threat to international peace and security&quot;. The Malian army, with support from France, launched operations to repel the advance.<\/p><p>  Following a meeting of the UN Security Council on 14 January, the Secretary General welcomed the response by bilateral partners to the call for assistance by the Government of Mali. The situation in Mali is very complex and volatile. I welcome the decision taken to accelerate the deployment of African regional forces to assist the Malian authorities. This effort is being led by the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS. The European Union will support the African-led mission. Furthermore, an EU training mission is being established to help strengthen the capacities of the Malian army.<\/p><p>  Military action alone will not secure lasting peace and stability.  EU Foreign Ministers have consistently pressed the Malian parties to adopt and implement a roadmap for a transition to democratic elections.

It is also essential to have an inclusive process of reconciliation and peace building in Mali that respects the territorial integrity of the country and addresses ethnic divisions.<\/p><p>  We are seriously concerned about the impact of this crisis on the civilian population.

As the proceeds of all borrowing, including borrowing under the EU-IMF Programme, as well as revenues including tax and non-tax, are lodged to the Exchequer account to fund general expenditure, it is not possible to disaggregate the balance on that account by source or derive a single robust cost figure in relation to the balances maintained.<\/p><p>Funds in the Exchequer are used for the ongoing payments necessary for running the State. <i>Budget 2013<\/i>   estimated that the cumulative Exchequer deficit over the years 2013-2015 would be close to &#8364;35 billion. In addition to these day-to-day costs, there are large debt redemptions that are scheduled from early 2013, including a &#8364;5.1 billion bond repayment in April 2013 and a &#8364;7.6 billion bond repayment in January 2014. The continuing budget deficits and debt redemptions must be adequately and prudently funded.<\/p><p><br \/>  Decisions on the level of cash reserves, which are a matter for the NTMA, take account of various factors in addition to the cost of maintaining such reserves. These factors include considering the potential cost of not maintaining an adequate and prudent cash balance. This includes the risk that the Exchequer would be unable to meet its obligations and that market interest rates would possibly be higher than would otherwise be the case due to the perception that the State had a precarious liquidity position.<\/p><p>Exchequer cash reserves are an important component in bolstering investor confidence in Ireland as it continues on the path to full independent market access at sustainable interest rates. The EU\/IMF Programme ends this year making such market access of critical importance. With regard to the drawdown of remaining funding from the EU\/IMF Programme, I will continue be regularly advised by the NTMA, who manage the country&#8217;s debt, as well as my officials on Irelands debt strategy.

I know that Revenue is conscious of the difficult economic and financial climate that prevails and how this can pose challenges for businesses and individuals in being timely compliant.

The public service pay and pension bill at 36% of spending is an important constituent element on which a substantial part of the burden of adjustment has and must continue to fall. It is this significant fiscal deficit, and the need to reduce it in accordance with the EU\/IMF Programme, which is the primary driver for the ongoing reduction required in the cost of the public service pay and pension bill on which talks have commenced with staff representatives.<\/p><p>  While comparisons of public servants pay rates across different countries are not widespread, the best available figures, those published by the OECD as part of its &ldquo;Government at a Glance 2010&rdquo; report, do not show Irish public service pay rates to be significantly out of line with other OECD countries across a broad range of disciplines on a purchasing power parity basis.  Furthermore, the statistics on which the OECD based its report predate the pay reductions applied to all public servants, on a progressive basis, under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2010.  The pay reductions applied to higher paid public servants under that legislation were based on the recommendations of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, which conducted a cross-country comparative exercise on pay rates for certain senior grades.  On foot of that, the then Government cut the pay of the highest paid public servants by between 8 and 20%.  A further reduction of 10% was applied to the pay rates of new recruits at entry level across the entire public service on 1 January 2011.<\/p><p>  This Government,  to help ensure that pay expectations for higher paid public servants are set appropriately and having regard to the resources available to the State, has applied a further reduced pay ceiling at the highest levels in the public service.  That policy brings pay levels at senior levels in the public service in line with those the Government accepted for itself. In addition significant reductions in non pay terms of employment have been secured including standardisation and reduction in annual leave entitlements and a reduction in sick pay entitlements to a level less than those available to public servants in other EU member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300073#WRN00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Numbers","counter":280,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300073#WRN00950"},{"type":"question","counter":281,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[3298\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300073#WRN01000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which the numbers employed throughout the public sector in respect of each Government Department and bodies under their aegis have been reduced in each year to date since the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1097"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[3303\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300073#WRN01100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he is satisfied that staff reductions brought about by compliance with the Memorandum of Understanding signed by his predecessors with particular reference to sensitive frontline public services are not likely to damage the integrity and efficacy of such services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":283,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 110 together.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to reducing public service numbers to 282,500 by the end of 2014 as part of its Reform Agenda.  The overriding objective is to have a more customer focused, leaner, more efficient and better integrated public service which delivers maximum value for money.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that significant progress is being made in reducing the numbers employed in the public service. The numbers working in the public service have continued to fall, with the preliminary returns for end-2012 now standing at some 290,300, which means that, overall, we are now close to the 2005 staffing levels.<\/p><p>  Of course, such a reduction in public service numbers poses challenges. It requires a refocus on business processes and adjustments to the way all public bodies use available resources. It will also require changes to the way individual public servants go about their daily work and greater flexibility in the way services are provided, for example with greater use of technology and shared services.<\/p><p>  The Government is committed to making fundamental changes to the way the public service operates to safeguard the delivery of essential services in a way that is in keeping with the needs of a modern society while driving value for money for the citizen.<\/p><p>  The moratorium on recruitment will continue until such time that the targets agreed in the Programme for Government are met.  If the general moratorium on recruitment was lifted and numbers were allowed to return to their former levels, the paybill would increase over time and accordingly a substantial part of the savings already achieved would be lost.  However, the precise operation of the moratorium is being kept under review by my Department.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that there are with certain limited exceptions to moratorium for example in relation to some frontline posts, or statutory positions, etc. or where a sufficiently strong business case is made.  In the Health and Education sectors in particular special arrangements are in place for exemptions to the moratorium on recruitment for specified grades and positions.  However, I wish to make clear that it is part of the day to day function of the Boards and Management of all public bodies to assess, budget and plan for current and ongoing staffing requirements within allocated resources.  When any vacancy arises the first issue to be considered must always be if the post still needs to be filled, or if the work can be discharged in any other way.<\/p><p>  The historical data requested by the Deputy are available on my Department&rsquo;s website  which contains data for each year back to 1994.

State indemnity for personal injury and third party property damage was legislated for in the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act, 2000 where the management of personal injury and third party property damage claims against certain State authorities, and underlying risks, was delegated to the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA).  When performing these functions, the NTMA is known as the State Claims Agency (SCA). <\/p><p>  Under the general rule of State indemnity enacted through the statutory provisions above, certain State bodies are indemnified by the Minister for Finance for the following:<\/p><p>- Personal injury to employees of the State;<\/p><p>- Personal injury to third parties (the public) &ndash; this includes injury resulting from medical negligence;<\/p><p>- Third party property damage &ndash; this includes claims arising from road traffic collisions (RTC&rsquo;s);<\/p><p>  Since 2001 the remit of the SCA has been expanded through various delegation orders based on a value for money analysis.  More recently in 2010 the management of Health Service Executive (HSE) personal injury (non-clinical) and third party property damage claims was delegated to the State Claims Agency (SCA) under the National Treasury Management Agency (State Authority) Order 2009.  13 other State authorities claims associated with these risks were also delegated to the SCA in 2011.  <\/p><p>  Additionally, the following additional classes of claims were delegated to the State Claims Agency with effect from 7th February 2011:<\/p><p>- Bullying\/harassment claims by state employees, which allege personal injury.<\/p><p>- Claims by members of the Defence Forces alleging personal injury whilst serving abroad &ndash; includes stand alone PTSD cases.<\/p><p>- In-cell sanitation claims by current and former prisoners<\/p><p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (Delegation of Claims Management Function) (Amendment) Order 2012 formally delegated management of Thalidomide and Nimesulide (Aulin) claims to the State Claims Agency on 3rd April 2012. <\/p><p>  In conjunction with the State, the SCA has a strong track record in reducing the cost of managing claims under its remit.  For example, during 2012 the SCA achieved significant savings on claims and related legal costs associated with the management of the Clinical Indemnity Scheme (CIS). An independent actuarial assessment projected that &euro;127.5 million would be required to satisfy CIS claims and related costs in 2011. The outturn for the year was &euro;84 million, representing a saving of &euro;43.5 million.<\/p><p>  Prior to the delegation of the management of Employers Liability\/Public Liability\/Property Damage claims to the SCA, the HSE and 13 other State Authorities were paying in excess of &euro;22 million in insurance premia per annum. Only approximately &euro;2 million has been expended to date in the management of such claims since 2010, yielding a cash flow saving of approximately &euro;64 million. Based on the current outstanding estimated liability associated with these delegated claims since 1st January 2010, a long term saving of at least &euro;26 million will be achieved for the State by managing these claims on the &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; basis operated by the SCA.  <\/p><p>  Where Agencies have been dealing with their own insurance in many cases, it has been policy to encourage them to delegate the management of the risks and the processing of claims to the State Claims Agency. Analysis and experience has shown that the cost to the State of dealing with these risks and claims directly, through State indemnity managed by the SCA, is significantly lower than the premium cost of insuring these risks.  My Department are currently preparing a delegation order and have been in correspondence over the last few months with Departments on this.<\/p><p>  In addition, a State Legal Costs Unit is being set up in the SCA to deal with legal costs &ndash; initially to deal with Tribunal claims but with the intention of expanding this remit. Heads of a Bill have been cleared by Government with a view to the publication of legislation to underpin the SCA&rsquo;s remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300074#WRO00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":290,"content":"<p>Question No. 112 answered with Question No. 36.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services","counter":291,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300074#WRO00650"},{"type":"question","counter":292,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[3401\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300074#WRO00700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of non-core public service activities have been selected for priority outsourcing to Irish based companies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1071","askee":"1097"},{"type":"speech","counter":293,"content":"<p>Evaluating the opportunity for the external delivery of some non-core public services is an action in the Public Service Reform Plan agreed by Government in November 2011.

As for medium sized companies, the CLRG recommended that they continue to have the option of going to the High Court for the appointment of an examiner.

The process of ratification of the Agreement on the Unified Patent Court is one that must be addressed individually by each Member State and is primarily a national issue.  <\/p><p>  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, this will entail holding a constitutional referendum to allow the transfer of limited jurisdictional powers to the Unified Patent Court relating solely to patent disputes.  This is not without precedent, as Ireland previously amended the constitution in 1992 to allow for the ratification of the Agreement relating to Community Patents, which subsequently did not come into effect.  <\/p><p>  This proposed transfer of jurisdictional powers will enable a unitary patent for at least twenty-five EU Member States to be properly enforced, enhancing the Single Market for intellectual property.  This shift towards the Unified Patent Court will ensure uniformity of decisions on key issues relating to the new unitary patent and will create a new legal paradigm of a judicial remedy for unitary patents which will lessen costs and improve legal certainty in the EU.<\/p><p>  Under the current system, a European patent can be enforced only at national level, which entails translating it into the official language of the country concerned.  Under the proposed unitary patent system and associated translation arrangements, once the patent is granted, it will be automatically enforceable in 25 Member States without the need for further translations.  It is important to point out however that automatic machine translations of patent specifications into all EU languages is currently being developed and when fully implemented will uphold the principle of linguistic diversity within the European Union. <\/p><p>  Currently, translation costs of patent specifications represent a very high proportion of the cost of the European patent and this places Europe at a distinct disadvantage vis-&agrave;-vis other major trading partners such as the United States and others.  The European Commission estimates that patent translations can account for up to sixty-three per cent of the cost of protecting a patent in Europe. <\/p><p>  It is anticipated that the Agreement will come into effect in 2014, along with the corresponding EU Regulations on the unitary patent system.  This will enable participating Member States to obtain a unitary patent valid in 25 Member States at a fraction of the current cost, while also making it far more affordable to enforce their patent rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300076#WRQ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Intellectual Property","counter":345,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300076#WRQ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":346,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[54531\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300076#WRQ01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his actions to date and future plans in tackling digital piracy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":347,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[55491\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300076#WRQ01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his actions to date and his future plans to tackle digital piracy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":348,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 134 together.<\/p><p>  An effective intellectual property system should provide a legislative and regulatory framework that affords an appropriate level of protection to Right Holders that incentivises creativity and innovation and enables Right Holders to obtain fair economic reward from their investment in Intellectual Property be that from patents, trademarks or copyright and related works.

Ireland is generally regarded as having an effective IP system that provides comfort on both those fronts.<\/p><p>  With regard to enforcement which lies at the heart of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, Ireland has implemented fully the 2004 EU Directive on the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights (2004\/48\/EC).  The European Commission is currently reviewing this Directive and we will consider any follow-up proposals that the Commission may bring forward as a result of this review.  The provisions of this Directive complemented existing provisions of domestic patent, trademark and copyright legislation which set a high standard in terms of enforcement measures and remedial action that Right Holders can avail of.<\/p><p>  As regards digital piracy in particular, the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000 governs the protection of copyright and provides for rights and remedies against those who engage in such activities.

Specifically, in the context of the European Union (Copyright and Related Rights) Regulations 2012 which were signed into law in February 2012, these Regulations clarified beyond doubt the position that a court injunction could be sought and granted against intermediaries whose services were being used by a third party to infringe a copyright or related right.

To this end, and in line with commitments contained in the Programme for Government, I established in June 2011 the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to examine a number of specific issues and make cost effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes. To date the Group has held 22 meetings. <\/p><p><br \/>  In its Terms of Reference, the Group has been asked to examine a number of specific issues and make recommendations on them, including child and family income supports, working age income supports, the appropriate unit of assessment in both the tax and social welfare codes, the interaction of the tax and social welfare codes, issues concerning social insurance for self-employed people and any other issues that may be referred to the Group, which includes the Budget 2012 proposals concerning Disability Allowance and Domiciliary Care Allowance. The Group&#8217;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the terms of reference. The full terms of reference are set out below. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Advisory Group is chaired by Ms Ita Mangan, a barrister with considerable experience in public policy. Members of the Advisory Group have expertise from economic and social policy and other relevant areas, and are drawn from within and outside of the public sector. In line with a practical, problem-focused and evidence-orientated approach, they are appointed to the Group on the basis of their expertise and not as representatives of specific sectors. The current membership of the Group is set out below, together with details of their professions.<\/p><p><br \/>  Interested organisations, stakeholders and individuals are periodically invited to make submissions in respect of each work module, offering an opportunity to make proposals on the topics covered in the Terms of Reference.  I understand that submissions made to the Advisory Group are an important source of views for the Group in fulfilling its mandate and in assisting its deliberations. With regard to the work module relating to social insurance for the self-employed, I understand that 30 replies were received from a variety of groups and individuals, a number of whom are self-employed. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Group commenced its work programme by prioritising the area of family and child income supports and submitted its report to me during 2012. Since then, I have been considering the Group&#8217;s findings and have held discussions with my Ministerial colleagues on the issues raised in the report. I intend to formally bring this report to Cabinet in the near future and thereafter publish it subject to agreement. The Advisory Group also submitted to me in 2012 its report on the Budget 2012 proposals concerning Disability Allowance and Domiciliary Care Allowance and I intend to publish this report in the near future.<\/p><p><br \/>  Among the issues that the Group is currently considering are the issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons   in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable. The Group will submit its report on this issue to me once its examination of the various questions has been completed. The Advisory Group is also currently examining the issue of working age income supports and the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems and I expect that the group will complete its work on this module as quickly as possible.<\/p><p><b>Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare - Terms of Reference<\/b><\/p><p>1. The Government agreed the following Terms of Reference for the Advisory Group: <\/p><p><br \/>  a. To constitute a forum to which the Minister for Social Protection may refer specific issues around the income supports and tax systems so that they provide good incentives to take up work and to contribute to the reduction of poverty and child poverty in particular. In particular, the Advisory Group will examine the following specific issues and make recommendations on: <blockquote>i. Child and family income supports (in particular child benefit, increases for qualified children and the family income supplement);<br \/><br \/>ii. Working age income supports (including unemployment payments and similar payments made by other agencies, one parent family payment, one parent family tax credit, back to work tax credit, increases for adult dependants as well as secondary benefits such as medical cards and rent and mortgage supplementary payments);<br \/><br \/>iii. The appropriate unit of assessment in both the tax and social welfare codes;<br \/><br \/>iv. How to address identified anomalies in the interaction of tax and social welfare codes.<\/blockquote>  b. To examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable; <\/p><p><br \/>  c. To examine and report upon how to improve interaction between the tax, social welfare systems and other supports so as to improve the operation of both in a cost-effective way and in the delivery of positive social and economic outcomes; <\/p><p><br \/>  d. To examine and report upon any other issue that may be referred to the Group by the Minister for Social Protection following consultation with the Ministers of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform and the agreement of the Minister for Finance on taxation matters. <\/p><p><br \/>  It is intended that the Advisory Group should consider any proposals for change to existing arrangements in a cost-neutral or cost-reducing context<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>2. Following Budget 2012, the Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton T.D. refers the following additional terms of reference to the Advisory Group:<\/p><p><br \/>  a. To examine and report on the policy objectives underpinning the Budget 2012 proposals regarding: <blockquote>i. Changes in the eligibility criteria and rates of payment for Disability Allowance (DA); <br \/><br \/>ii. The increase in the age threshold for payment of Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA); <\/blockquote>  b. To assess the effectiveness of the Budget 2012 proposals in delivering on the policy objectives taking account, inter alia, the ease of implementation and the timing\/phasing of implementation; and <\/p><p><br \/>  c. To consider alternative ways as to how the policy objectives might be achieved.<\/p><p><b>Current Membership of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare <\/b><\/p><p><br \/>  Ita Mangan, Chairman of the Advisory Group (Barrister)<\/p><p><br \/>  John Bohan, Department of Social Protection (Civil Servant)<\/p><p><br \/>  Miche&aacute;l Collins, Nevin Economic Research Institute (Senior Research Officer)<\/p><p><br \/>  John Conlon, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Civil Servant)<\/p><p><br \/>  Gerry Harrahill, Office of the Revenue Commissioners (Civil Servant)<\/p><p><br \/>  Catherine Hazlett, Department of Children and Youth Affairs (Civil Servant)<\/p><p><br \/>  Paul Kealy, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Civil Servant)<\/p><p><br \/>  Pat Mahon, Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) (Partner in tax services)<\/p><p><br \/>  Geralyn McGarry, Citizens Information Board (Manager, Social Policy and Research)<\/p><p><br \/>  Aebhric McGibney, Dublin Chamber of Commerce (Policy and Communications Director)<\/p><p><br \/>  Brenda McVeigh, Department of Finance (Civil Servant)<\/p><p><br \/>  Mary P.

Hedgerows are an important reservoir of biodiversity and habitat for birds, insects, wild flowers and other wildlife during the summer breeding season.

Each year, aerial surveys are undertaken of key haul-out sites, gathering data that will contribute to an estimate of the national breeding population of Grey Seals.  The last of these surveys was completed in November 2012 and all data from the previous years are now being analysed in advance of the forthcoming report to the European Commission.<\/p><p>  The data from both the Harbour and Grey Seal monitoring programmes will be comparable with previously-collected data and will inform my Department&rsquo;s view as to the current status of the respective populations.<\/p><p>  In terms of ascertaining the likely effects of seals on the fishing industry, I will be informed not only by the population monitoring undertaken by my Department, but also by investigations into seal-fisheries interactions that have been commissioned by Inland Fisheries Ireland, who, I understand, will publish an interim report shortly and by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, who anticipate reporting later in 2013.<\/p><p>  While seals are protected under the Wildlife Acts, licences may be obtained under section 42 of the Wildlife Act to hunt seals where damage is being caused. Licences are issued in response to specific applications and each application is considered on its merits. This redress is available to individual fishermen to control damage to fisheries by seals at particular locations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300079#WRT01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":419,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 160 and 161 answered with Question No. 157.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Film Industry Development","counter":420,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300080#WRU00200"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[3379\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300080#WRU00300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the amount of money that was invested by the Irish Film Board in 2012 on film projects; the amount of this money that was returned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1054","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":422,"content":"<p>Primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland, in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions, is a matter for the Irish Film Board (IFB).

of the dangers posed by carbon monoxide gas to people in their homes and at their places of work.<\/p><p>  That is why I launched the first Carbon Monoxide Awareness Week on the 24th September 2012; a week which saw a sustained, multi-media publicity campaign to alert people to the dangers and give them advice as to what they should do to be safe.  The issue was widely reported on television, on national and local radio and in both national and local press.  This covered everything from personal testimony from bereaved family members to television demonstration of correct fitting of carbon monoxide alarms.<\/p><p>  There have been similar media campaigns at the start of the heating season, to try to prevent the tragic loss.  They have been organised by Bord G&aacute;is, approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and reported to the CER&rsquo;s Gas Safety Committee, in which my Department participates.  While the focus is on the start of the heating season, when people start up boilers and appliances that may not have been used for some time, there are media messages throughout the year.<\/p><p>  Publicity campaigns are only part of the work that the Government does to try to ensure people&rsquo;s safety.<\/p><p>  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has recently revised the Building Regulations so that it will become compulsory to fit approved carbon monoxide alarms to certain types of new building.  A lot of work has been done on the relevant standards that apply to these alarms, both at national and at European level.  The Gas Technical Standards Committee of the National Standards Authority of Ireland is currently working on guidance documentation to assist with proper installation of such alarms.  They also issued a special standard to fill the gap until the relevant European Standard can be enhanced.<\/p><p>  I also wish to acknowledge the great work done by the gas industry to raise safety standards.  The gas industry has worked with the energy regulator to establish a register of approved gas installers.  This has been a hugely important development in improving quality control in gas matters, including reducing the risk posed by carbon monoxide in gas installations.<\/p><p>  This &ldquo;joined-up&rdquo; approach to matters relating to carbon monoxide can be well demonstrated by the specific campaign last year to warn the public about gas cookers which could be operated in an unsafe manner, creating a carbon monoxide risk.  Industry, government, regulator, standards authority and the National Consumer Agency all acted together to identify and promote the risks and the solutions to consumers.  As a result, very many potentially dangerous appliances were identified and associated risks were mitigated.<\/p><p>  I assure the Deputy that I take this matter very seriously and that I intend to launch this year&rsquo;s Carbon Monoxide Week after the summer.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300080#WRU01000","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Postal Services","counter":430,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300080#WRU01025"},{"type":"question","counter":431,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[3153\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300080#WRU01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding the public procurement process for a post code provider; when it is envisaged the switch to post codes will take place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1026","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","counter":432,"content":"<p>It is Government policy to implement postcodes.

The latter allocation may be provided where anglers demonstrate that they have completed their logbook appropriately and used their initial gill tag allocation.<\/p><p><br \/>  An angler may receive one gill tag where a one day ordinary licence is issued up until the close of the season.<\/p><p><br \/>  Further controls on the issuing of gill tags will be implemented for certain rivers where it is considered necessary by IFI in the interest of conserving stocks to closely monitor the angling quotas and ensure that river based quotas are not exceeded.<\/p><p><br \/>  With specific reference to the River Feale, as requested by the Deputy, the surplus available for harvesting is 1,992 salmon so that number of tags is available.  There are 51 commercial draft net licences and approximately 600 angling licences are sold in the River Feale catchment.  The split of the quota between commercial salmon fishermen and recreational salmon anglers is yet to be determined.  For information, the allocation of tags for 2012 and 2011 was set at 60% to commercial draft net licence holders, 30% to angling with a 10% reserve withheld and divided between the sectors as the season progressed.

Where forged or tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, it is the policy that such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain.<\/p><p>  These requirements are designed to ensure that meat produced in approved slaughter plants is suitable for human consumption.  All equines (which include horses, ponies and donkeys) are required to be identified in accordance with EU and national legislation.  All equines issued with a passport after I July 2009 must have a corresponding microchip implanted by a veterinarian which is recorded in the passport and creates a link between the passport and the animal.<\/p><p>  The passport includes information on any veterinary medicines administered to equines.  An equine for slaughter for human consumption must be accompanied to the slaughterhouse by its passport in compliance with current veterinary requirements - this requirement is an essential part of the food-chain information required by food law and the information on the passport determines whether the animal can be slaughtered for human consumption.  Under EU legislation, horses treated with certain veterinary medicines such as phenylbutazone, known in the industry as &ldquo;bute&rdquo;, are permanently excluded from the human food chain in order to protect public health and the passport of the horse in question is endorsed by the prescribing veterinary practitioner to this effect.<\/p><p>  My Department has developed detailed procedures for the slaughter of horses in abattoirs and has communicated these and the checks required both to its staff and the business operators.

The relevant national legislation is S.I. No. 357 of 2011 - European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011 (as amended).  This legislation provides that if an equine animal has not been identified within six months of the date of its birth, or by the 31<sup>st<\/sup> of December in the year of its birth, whichever date occurs later, then the equine animal cannot be admitted to the food chain.  It is an offence under S.I. 357 of 2011 (as amended) Article 24(1) and (2) to forge or tamper with an equine passport.<\/p><p><br \/>  With regard to the slaughter of horses, an official veterinarian must be present in a meat plant when slaughtering is taking place.  All animals are subject to an ante-mortem inspection, which includes an identification check, by an official veterinarian prior to slaughter.  The horse passport is examined to confirm the identification of the animal and to check if any medications have been administered that might render the animal unfit for human consumption.  If there is evidence that the passport has been tampered with or if the passport is a replacement rather than original passport, the animal will not be allowed go for human consumption.  If the animal fails the ante-mortem inspection, it will be slaughtered and the carcase sent for disposal.  The animal is not permitted to leave the abattoir alive. If the animal passes the ante-mortem inspection, it is allowed go for slaughter for human consumption.  Where forged or tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, it is Department policy that such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has introduced enhanced<b><\/b>legislation and<b><\/b>procedures in relation to the registration of horse premises and the identification and slaughter of horses over the past year or so.  With regard to the registration of horse premises, my Department introduced new regulations in January 2012 such that, from May 2012, anyone who is the owner\/person in charge of any premises on which horses are kept is required to register the premises with the Department.<\/p><p><br \/>  On the issue of identification, my Department up-dated national legislation last September in relation to controls on the identification of horses in order to strengthen the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of an issuing body for equine passports, authorised officers and prosecutions in relation to equine identification.  Under this legislation, my Department revoked the approval granted to one of the passport issuing agencies (PIOs) to issue passports to non registered equines last year because of its non-compliances with the rules relating to issuing passports.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department also introduced enhanced procedures for the slaughter of horses in abattoirs in October 2011 and communicated these and the checks required both to its staff and the business operators.  It has liaised with PIOs in Ireland and has developed protocols to allow abattoir operators to check the details of passports with these agencies, which are obliged by regulation to maintain a database, to seek to ensure that they are valid and that only those horses eligible for slaughter are slaughtered.<\/p><p><br \/>  EU legislation provides that horses treated with certain veterinary medicines (such as phenylbutazone or &#8220;bute&#8221;) are excluded from the human food chain.  In order to verify the effectiveness of the intake procedures at slaughter plants carrying out the slaughtering of horses, my Department decided last year to increase sampling for &#8220;bute&#8221; from 60 in 2011 to 104 in 2012 and to 160 in 2013.<b><\/b> The last positive test for &#8220;bute&#8221; was in 2010.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department is developing a central database of horses which will involve migration of selected data from PIOs to the Department.  The database will be populated by information provided from the databases maintained by the PIOs, by the Department from records obtained at slaughter plants and knackeries and by Local Authority Veterinary Inspectors in respect of records maintained at appropriate slaughter plants.  The intention is that this database will be used at abattoirs to verify the authenticity of the passport for the equine presented and to record its date of slaughter.<\/p><p><br \/>  In conclusion, my Department maintains ongoing vigilance in relation to official controls on the identification of horses, including at slaughter, through national and EU legislation.  I am satisfied that robust procedures are in place in approved business establishments to ensure that only horses with valid identification are accepted for slaughter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300082#WRZ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Labelling","counter":565,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300082#WRAA00150"},{"type":"question","counter":566,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[3271\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300082#WRAA00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the checks that are carried out on imported pig meat; and if such imported meat can qualify to be labelled as of Irish origin.","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":567,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware the free movement of goods within the European Union provides that once goods (including pigmeat) are produced in an approved establishment in another Member State, then those goods are free to move without official checks to other member states.

During 2010, a number of meetings were convened with the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner and representatives of the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, and Temple Street, and Cork University Hospitals.  A policy was agreed in conjunction with the DPC to address both the legislative and ethical requirements of the National Newborn Screening Programme.<\/p><p>  In accordance with the policy, from 1 July 2011, the blood portion of the Newborn Screening Card (NSC) will be retained for ten years and disposed of during the child&rsquo;s 11th year for the purpose of confirming an initial diagnosis should this be deemed necessary.  Parents\/guardians are provided with specific information on the retention of the NSC&rsquo;s with regard to their use and written consent is sought in this regard.  The changes to the National Newborn Screening Programme since 1 July 2011 bring about compliance with both national and EU data protection legislation, uphold ethical principles and meet ethical obligations with regard to consent, privacy and confidentiality.<\/p><p>  The agreed policy also provided for the disposal of archived NSCs older than ten years.

It is anticipated that over 160 prisoners will benefit from this initiative in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300083#WRX02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":723,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 196 to 200, inclusive, answered with Question No. 194.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Investigations","counter":724,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300083#WRY00300"},{"type":"question","counter":725,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[3470\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300083#WRY00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if a decision has been made to conduct tests on unidentified remains found off the south east to determine whether they are part of the remains of men lost at sea.","asker":"1047","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":726,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will recall from previous replies on this issue, the Garda authorities have advised that despite numerous attempts by the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) to generate DNA profiles from the remains recovered off the South-East coast, all attempts to date have proved unsuccessful.<\/p><p>  I am also advised that Garda enquiries with the FSL indicate that further tests outside the jurisdiction may not necessarily be any more successful than testing that has taken place to date in the FSL.

Where forged or tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, it is the policy that such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain.<\/p><p>  These requirements are designed to ensure that meat produced in approved slaughter plants is suitable for human consumption.  All equines (which include horses, ponies and donkeys) are required to be identified in accordance with EU and national legislation.  All equines issued with a passport after I July 2009 must have a corresponding microchip implanted by a veterinarian which is recorded in the passport and creates a link between the passport and the animal.<\/p><p>  The passport includes information on any veterinary medicines administered to equines.  An equine for slaughter for human consumption must be accompanied to the slaughterhouse by its passport in compliance with current veterinary requirements - this requirement is an essential part of the food-chain information required by food law and the information on the passport determines whether the animal can be slaughtered for human consumption.  Under EU legislation, horses treated with certain veterinary medicines such as phenylbutazone, known in the industry as &ldquo;bute&rdquo;, are permanently excluded from the human food chain in order to protect public health and the passport of the horse in question is endorsed by the prescribing veterinary practitioner to this effect.<\/p><p>  My Department has developed detailed procedures for the slaughter of horses in abattoirs and has communicated these and the checks required both to its staff and the business operators.  It has liaised with passport issuing agencies in Ireland and has developed protocols to allow abattoir operators to check the details of passports with these agencies to seek to ensure that they are valid and that only those horses eligible for slaughter are slaughtered.<\/p><p>  Ongoing vigilance is maintained in relation to official controls in this area.  In that connection, the European Communities (Equine) (Amendment) Regulations, S.I. No. 371\/2012, introduced recently, provide for the updating of S.I.

The relevant national legislation is S.I. No. 357 of 2011 - European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011 (as amended).  This legislation provides that if an equine animal has not been identified within six months of the date of its birth, or by the 31<sup>st<\/sup> of December in the year of its birth, whichever date occurs later, then the equine animal cannot be admitted to the food chain.  It is an offence under S.I. 357 of 2011 (as amended) Article 24(1) and (2) to forge or tamper with an equine passport.<\/p><p><br \/>  With regard to the slaughter of horses, an official veterinarian must be present in a meat plant when slaughtering is taking place.  All animals are subject to an ante-mortem inspection, which includes an identification check, by an official veterinarian prior to slaughter.  The horse passport is examined to confirm the identification of the animal and to check if any medications have been administered that might render the animal unfit for human consumption.  If there is evidence that the passport has been tampered with or if the passport is a replacement rather than original passport, the animal will not be allowed go for human consumption.  If the animal fails the ante-mortem inspection, it will be slaughtered and the carcase sent for disposal.  The animal is not permitted to leave the abattoir alive. If the animal passes the ante-mortem inspection, it is allowed go for slaughter for human consumption.  Where forged or tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, it is Department policy that such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has introduced enhanced<b><\/b>legislation and<b><\/b>procedures in relation to the registration of horse premises and the identification and slaughter of horses over the past year or so.  With regard to the registration of horse premises, my Department introduced new regulations in January 2012 such that, from May 2012, anyone who is the owner\/person in charge of any premises on which horses are kept is required to register the premises with the Department.<\/p><p><br \/>  On the issue of identification, my Department up-dated national legislation last September in relation to controls on the identification of horses in order to strengthen the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of an issuing body for equine passports, authorised officers and prosecutions in relation to equine identification.  Under this legislation, my Department revoked the approval granted to one of the passport issuing agencies (PIOs) to issue passports to non registered equines last year because of its non-compliances with the rules relating to issuing passports.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department also introduced enhanced procedures for the slaughter of horses in abattoirs in October 2011 and communicated these and the checks required both to its staff and the business operators.  It has liaised with PIOs in Ireland and has developed protocols to allow abattoir operators to check the details of passports with these agencies, which are obliged by regulation to maintain a database, to seek to ensure that they are valid and that only those horses eligible for slaughter are slaughtered.<\/p><p><br \/>  EU legislation provides that horses treated with certain veterinary medicines (such as phenylbutazone or &#8220;bute&#8221;) are excluded from the human food chain.  In order to verify the effectiveness of the intake procedures at slaughter plants carrying out the slaughtering of horses, my Department decided last year to increase sampling for &#8220;bute&#8221; from 60 in 2011 to 104 in 2012 and to 160 in 2013.<b><\/b> The last positive test for &#8220;bute&#8221; was in 2010.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department is developing a central database of horses which will involve migration of selected data from PIOs to the Department.  The database will be populated by information provided from the databases maintained by the PIOs, by the Department from records obtained at slaughter plants and knackeries and by Local Authority Veterinary Inspectors in respect of records maintained at appropriate slaughter plants.  The intention is that this database will be used at abattoirs to verify the authenticity of the passport for the equine presented and to record its date of slaughter.<\/p><p><br \/>  In conclusion, my Department maintains ongoing vigilance in relation to official controls on the identification of horses, including at slaughter, through national and EU legislation.  I am satisfied that robust procedures are in place in approved business establishments to ensure that only horses with valid identification are accepted for slaughter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300083#WRZ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Labelling","counter":764,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300083#WRAA00150"},{"type":"question","counter":765,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[3271\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013012300083#WRAA00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the checks that are carried out on imported pig meat; and if such imported meat can qualify to be labelled as of Irish origin.","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":766,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware the free movement of goods within the European Union provides that once goods (including pigmeat) are produced in an approved establishment in another Member State, then those goods are free to move without official checks to other member states.

During 2010, a number of meetings were convened with the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner and representatives of the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, and Temple Street, and Cork University Hospitals.

Parents\/guardians are provided with specific information on the retention of the NSC&rsquo;s with regard to their use and written consent is sought in this regard.

All equines (which include horses, ponies and donkeys) are required to be identified in accordance with EU and national legislation.  All equines issued with a passport after I July 2009 must have a corresponding microchip implanted by a veterinarian which is recorded in the passport and creates a link between the passport and the animal.<\/p><p>  The passport includes information on any veterinary medicines administered to equines.  An equine for slaughter for human consumption must be accompanied to the slaughterhouse by its passport in compliance with current veterinary requirements - this requirement is an essential part of the food-chain information required by food law and the information on the passport determines whether the animal can be slaughtered for human consumption.  Under EU legislation, horses treated with certain veterinary medicines such as phenylbutazone, known in the industry as &ldquo;bute&rdquo;, are permanently excluded from the human food chain in order to protect public health and the passport of the horse in question is endorsed by the prescribing veterinary practitioner to this effect.<\/p><p>  My Department has developed detailed procedures for the slaughter of horses in abattoirs and has communicated these and the checks required both to its staff and the business operators.

In that connection, the European Communities (Equine) (Amendment) Regulations, S.I. No. 371\/2012, introduced recently, provide for the updating of S.I.

The relevant national legislation is S.I. No. 357 of 2011 - European Communities (Equine) Regulations 2011 (as amended).  This legislation provides that if an equine animal has not been identified within six months of the date of its birth, or by the 31<sup>st<\/sup> of December in the year of its birth, whichever date occurs later, then the equine animal cannot be admitted to the food chain.  It is an offence under S.I. 357 of 2011 (as amended) Article 24(1) and (2) to forge or tamper with an equine passport.<\/p><p><br \/>  With regard to the slaughter of horses, an official veterinarian must be present in a meat plant when slaughtering is taking place.  All animals are subject to an ante-mortem inspection, which includes an identification check, by an official veterinarian prior to slaughter.  The horse passport is examined to confirm the identification of the animal and to check if any medications have been administered that might render the animal unfit for human consumption.  If there is evidence that the passport has been tampered with or if the passport is a replacement rather than original passport, the animal will not be allowed go for human consumption.  If the animal fails the ante-mortem inspection, it will be slaughtered and the carcase sent for disposal.  The animal is not permitted to leave the abattoir alive. If the animal passes the ante-mortem inspection, it is allowed go for slaughter for human consumption.  Where forged or tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, it is Department policy that such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has introduced enhanced<b><\/b>legislation and<b><\/b>procedures in relation to the registration of horse premises and the identification and slaughter of horses over the past year or so.  With regard to the registration of horse premises, my Department introduced new regulations in January 2012 such that, from May 2012, anyone who is the owner\/person in charge of any premises on which horses are kept is required to register the premises with the Department.<\/p><p><br \/>  On the issue of identification, my Department up-dated national legislation last September in relation to controls on the identification of horses in order to strengthen the powers of the Minister in relation to approval of an issuing body for equine passports, authorised officers and prosecutions in relation to equine identification.  Under this legislation, my Department revoked the approval granted to one of the passport issuing agencies (PIOs) to issue passports to non registered equines last year because of its non-compliances with the rules relating to issuing passports.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department also introduced enhanced procedures for the slaughter of horses in abattoirs in October 2011 and communicated these and the checks required both to its staff and the business operators.  It has liaised with PIOs in Ireland and has developed protocols to allow abattoir operators to check the details of passports with these agencies, which are obliged by regulation to maintain a database, to seek to ensure that they are valid and that only those horses eligible for slaughter are slaughtered.<\/p><p><br \/>  EU legislation provides that horses treated with certain veterinary medicines (such as phenylbutazone or &#8220;bute&#8221;) are excluded from the human food chain.  In order to verify the effectiveness of the intake procedures at slaughter plants carrying out the slaughtering of horses, my Department decided last year to increase sampling for &#8220;bute&#8221; from 60 in 2011 to 104 in 2012 and to 160 in 2013.<b><\/b> The last positive test for &#8220;bute&#8221; was in 2010.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department is developing a central database of horses which will involve migration of selected data from PIOs to the Department.

The basis of the complaint, which was upheld by the Data Protection Commissioner, was that the NSCs should not be retained indefinitely without consent as this constituted a breach of the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003.  During 2010, a number of meetings were convened with the Deputy Data Protection Commissioner and representatives of the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, and Temple Street, and Cork University Hospitals.  A policy was agreed in conjunction with the DPC to address both the legislative and ethical requirements of the National Newborn Screening Programme.<\/p><p>  In accordance with the policy, from 1 July 2011, the blood portion of the Newborn Screening Card (NSC) will be retained for ten years and disposed of during the child&rsquo;s 11th year for the purpose of confirming an initial diagnosis should this be deemed necessary.  Parents\/guardians are provided with specific information on the retention of the NSC&rsquo;s with regard to their use and written consent is sought in this regard.  The changes to the National Newborn Screening Programme since 1 July 2011 bring about compliance with both national and EU data protection legislation, uphold ethical principles and meet ethical obligations with regard to consent, privacy and confidentiality.<\/p><p>  The agreed policy also provided for the disposal of archived NSCs older than ten years.  Following receipt of representations concerning the proposed destruction of archived Newborn Screening Cards, I requested the HSE to conduct a review of this decision.  The report and recommendations of the review group were submitted to my office in January 2012.
