We have done a job on this and some progress has been made but many home owners are concerned at the delay in publishing the enabling legislation to establish the pyrite resolution board and, most important, to allow the board to take applications from affected home owners.  I ask the Leader to inquire of the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, when legislation will be before the Houses to enable the establishment of the pyrite resolution board in order that affected home owners can make applications to the board for remediation.

There has been a disappointing take-up by primary schools.  I ask the Leader for a debate on provision of child care for children in school, which is a major issue for working parents.

The Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, Mr. William Hay, has written to ask that the meeting does not take place on that inappropriate day.  It seems ham-fisted by the Government to combine the two events.  I ask the Leader to support the speaker.

More than 5,000 of those families are in the west of Ireland where smaller holdings, longer winters and fewer agricultural land use options are the norm.  These are families that helped to build this country by harvesting the bounty of the land.  This Government has shown nothing other than absolute contempt and disregard for them.  I call on people like Senator Comiskey and those with a background in agriculture in the Fine Gael and Labour parties, to intervene.  It demands the Taoiseach's personal intervention because the Government cannot just cast aside these 13,000 families.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, said flippantly yesterday that a new scheme will be developed in 2015.  What are those 13,000 families to do in the meantime?  Are they to starve?

This commenced on a phased basis in 2009 and the benefit was withdrawn completely by 2010.  The removal of child benefit to students who are still in secondary school and are over 18 years, is unjust.  The Minister at the time, Mary Hanafin, stated that the effect would be minimal.  However, the opposite is the case.  Transition-year students stay in school an extra year.  Over 30,000 students completed transition year in the school year 2010 to 2011.  Practically all of these students were then over 18 years on leaving school but their parents were refused child benefit from the day the students reached 18 years.  This situation is proving most difficult for families from disadvantaged backgrounds and many students are leaving school before completing leaving certificate as a result.  It is recorded that this country has eight billionaires - it is probably more now - and more than 20 millionaires.  During discussions on this matter recently, one well-known business person suggested that the money could be given back by those who did not need it; just three families have returned child benefit to the State.  Nothing will happen unless this money is withdrawn from those who can afford not to receive this money and it is provided to those who need it.  I call on the Government to address this issue in the forthcoming budget and to allow child benefit to be paid to secondary school students until they complete their leaving certificate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500004#C00200","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1380102000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>The Irish National Teachers Organisation released figures yesterday which show that one quarter of all primary school students in Waterford - the Leader's county - are in so-called super size classrooms.

The union points to the problems for pupils created by super size classes.  It has been proven that larger class sizes have an impact on the education of children and on educational outcomes, not only for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and children who are challenged but also for some of the better students.  The Government needs to consider this issue in the budget.  We are not hearing good news from the Minister for Education and Skills who is talking about increasing class sizes from 28 to 30.  There needs to be a debate in advance of the budget.  We should listen to the parents, students and teachers at those public meetings and take those concerns directly to the Minister by way of organising a debate in the House during which we can challenge the Minister on spending in the education sector and in the primary level sector.  There is no doubt that if the Minister goes ahead to increase class sizes again, it will have an impact on the education of children and will have a negative impact on many teachers who are already under pressure.

He wrote about all the things he would do for education in Ireland.  He said if he were only allowed to do one thing it would be to ensure that preschool places were available to all children.  I worked in that area.  The agess from birth to three years and from the ages of three to six years are very important in child formation.  The seeds for growing the country are set at these ages.  I congratulate the Minister on legislating for the first time for the regulation of child care qualifications.  I ask for a debate on child care as soon as possible on the subject of preschool care, after-school care and home child care.  The range of child care is very important for our country.

The number of homeless people in the eastern region has more than doubled in the past year alone and a significant number of those are families.  A different type of person is presenting as homeless.  The lack of affordable housing is a cause of homelessness in many cases.  I ask if the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, would come to the House to explain her plans for the rent supplement budget.

Credit unions remain popular and trusted, with convenience and community ethos being the key drivers of this view.  Key highlights of the research indicate that half of the adult population of Ireland are active credit union members, with almost 80% of adults believing that credit unions are becoming more relevant.  Almost all people believe that service levels have improved.  Credit unions have over three times the number of people recommending them compared with other financial institutions.  They are seen as being stronger and are a preferred choice for personal and car loans.  Of non-members surveyed, 32% indicated that this year they are quite likely to join the credit union.<\/p><p>I ask the Leader to organise a debate in the House on the future of credit unions, as there is a significant appetite to increase the type of services provided by these unions.

There is no question that there is an upsetting and urgent need for accommodation and assistance for those with nowhere to go, and for whom living has become harsh and dangerous.

This would be a sensible move in two ways.  It would allow us to find a useful purpose for the existing boxes and the location of those boxes, which would otherwise revert to pavement when they are demolished in the coming years.  It would also allow the public to know exactly where the nearest defibrillator is.  People in towns and villages know where the phone boxes are and they are always easily recognisable.  It would be a very good way to make a defibrillator a very obvious part of the landscape in towns and villages.  The process has been used in some towns and villages in the UK, and to help prevent vandalism, anybody with a potential heart problem who calls 999 from a village would be given an access code to a vandal-proof steel box.  We could follow the example of the UK.

Not alone has Croke Park been used successfully for matches like the Mayo and Dublin match last week and next Saturday's hurling final replay, but it is used for conferences all year.  It makes a phenomenal contribution to the finances of north County Dublin and it plays a key role in sustaining businesses.  If it did not exist, I would like to see how the hospitality industry on the north side of Dublin would survive.<\/p><p>I would like the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to make a statement on how it is possible for a sporting organisation to be landed with that type of an increase in a rates bill.

The statement emphasises a housing-led approach involving accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  It is now the focus of Government policy on homelessness.  In 2012 in the Dublin region alone, 879 people moved from homelessness to independent living.  We should all welcome this.  The economic crisis has placed significant pressure on many individuals and families and the Government has supported work in this regard with a budget of approximately &euro;45 million in 2013.  This funding helped to maintain services across the country and is matched by a local authority contribution of at least another 10%.  However, the bulk of the funding is provided by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and directed towards funding the services of voluntary providers such as Focus Ireland, Simon Communities and Crosscare and daytime drop-in centres.<\/p><p>Senator Michael Mullins has made the point that Ireland has contributed again to the elimination of chemical weapons and given some funding in this regard in the case of Syria.

This can and will affect sports bodies throughout the country, but it will not affect sports bodies alone.  The revaluation process has caused significant problems in Dublin and Waterford, in particular.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, should halt the increases pertaining to the valuations until the valuation legislation is in the House.

As we remember and commemorate the 100th anniversary of the 1913 Lock-out, it is fitting and timely that ICTU's general secretary should address Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The 1913 Lock-out was a seminal moment in Irish history, when the ITGWU engaged in a long dispute with the organised employers of Dublin over the right of the Dublin work force to unionise.  It was a bitter struggle which saw great suffering among the striking workers and their families, with starvation forcing many back to work.  Speaking at the start of 1914, union leader James Larkin said \"We are beaten, we will make no bones about it; but we are not too badly beaten still to fight\".  The fight for organised labour did indeed continue.  It would be fair to say that the legacy of the Lock-out was the eventual recognition of the rights of workers and the concept of a decent, fair and safe workplace that would provide a reasonable standard of living for workers.  It is important that we remember the economic and political significance of the events of 100 years ago and the role played by unions and organised labour in the development of our State.<\/p><p>The history of Irish trade unions stretches back into the 19th century.  The Irish Trade Union Congress, ITUC, was founded in 1894 to act as the collective voice of organised Irish labour.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, was formed in 1959 by the merger of the ITUC and the Congress of Irish Unions, CIU.  It is the umbrella organisation to which trade unions in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland affiliate.  Given the role played by the union movement in shaping our State, it is appropriate that we should look at that pivotal moment in our history, the 1913 Lock-out, and examine its impact on the course of Irish history and the Ireland of today.  We are looking forward to getting the perspective that the general secretary can bring to our understanding of the events of 1913 and their relevance to modern Ireland.  Unions faced challenges 100 years ago.  Today, our country and the union movement face a different set of challenges.  We will be interested in hearing the general secretary's assessment and evaluation of the challenges for unions and their members as the country recovers from the economic crisis.<\/p> <p>He became general secretary of the ICTU in 2001.  For five years before that he was chief executive officer of Concern Worldwide, an international humanitarian organisation working in 27 countries, with offices in Dublin, London, Belfast and Chicago.  He has also held a number of director roles in State bodies and sits on the executive committee of the European Trade Union Confederation.  As Members are aware, this Seanad is determined to modernise its procedures and actively engage with civic society.  To begin this process we have changed Standing Orders to allow persons in public and civic life to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  We thank Mr. Begg for agreeing to appear before the Seanad, welcome him to the House and look forward to his presentation and a positive and enlightening discussion afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500007#F00200","speaker":"1120","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1380104100,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I bring the Cathaoirleach and Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann the warmest fraternal greetings and best wishes from the 8,000 men and women affiliated to the ICTU.  I thank Members for their kind invitation to address the Seanad, which is a singular honour and privilege for me.  In the course of my remarks I propose, first, to review the circumstances which led to the 1913 Lock-out, the most serious industrial dispute ever in Ireland.  I will then recall what happened during the Lock-out, how it ended and what happened in the aftermath.  I will also consider the relevance of this seminal event for contemporary Ireland.<\/p><p>  When the drivers and conductors of the Dublin Tramway Company abandoned their trams at 9.40 a.m. on 26 August 1913 and pinned the red hand badge of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, ITGWU, on their lapels, it was the culmination of five years of intense industrial and political activism.  James Larkin had come to Dublin in 1907 as the representative of the British National Union of Dock Labourers, NUDL.  James Connolly was still in the United States.<\/p><p>  By the summer of 1908 Larkin's organising efforts were meeting strong resistance from employers.  In July 120 dockers were locked out and the general secretary of the NUDL, James Sexton, took management of the dispute out of Larkin's hands.  Undeterred, Larkin continued organising and in November staged a strike of dockers in Cork, this time with more success, achieving a considerable rise in wages.  Relations with Sexton and the NUDL continued to deteriorate by virtue of the union's refusal to back Larkin's organising efforts financially.  On 7 December 1908 Larkin was suspended from that NUDL and, in consequence, founded the ITGWU - the forerunner of SIPTU - in January 1909.  The ITGWU grew quickly and spread throughout Ireland.  It became embroiled in many epic struggles with employers for the right to organise, including a national railway strike in 1911 and involving the Wexford Foundries in 1910 and 1911.  In due course Larkin was joined by James Connolly and William O'Brien.<\/p><p>  Recognising that industrial activism alone could not adequately achieve their goals, the trio also decided to pursue parliamentary representation for workers.  They saw an opportunity for a domestic Parliament with the passage of the second Home Rule Bill.  At the Irish Trade Union Congress meeting in Clonmel in 1912 Connolly proposed a motion to found the Irish Labour Party and Larkin and O'Brien supported it.  Notwithstanding the move into the political arena, organising activity continued such that there were 30 major industrial disputes in Dublin alone between January and August 1913.  This was of such concern to the authorities that the Lord Mayor, Lorcan Sherlock, proposed a new system of conciliation to the unions and the Chamber of Commerce.  In this endeavour he enjoyed the support of the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. William Walsh, who was widely respected by both employers and unions.  For a while it looked as if this initiative might bring industrial peace to the city, but it was not to be.<\/p><p>  We are told by Padraig Yeates, author of the definitive history of the Lock-out, that the summer of 1913 was glorious, with eight weeks of almost unbroken sunny weather.  Expectations for a successful Horse Show at the RDS were very high, with unprecedented numbers of visitors, causing hotels to have to turn away guests.  There were rumours of possible industrial action in the Tramway Company, sufficient to move <i>The Irish Times<\/i> to warn prospective strikers that, whatever legitimate grievances they might have, they would arouse public hostility by industrial action.<\/p><p>  Larkin and the owner of the Dublin Tramway Company, William Martin Murphy, were locked in a power struggle.  To be credible as a transport union, the ITGWU needed to represent the workers in this major transport utility.  Equally, Murphy was determined to keep the ITGWU out of his companies at all costs.  By requiring his staff to sign a pledge not to join or remain in membership of the union on pain of dismissal, he made a strike inevitable because when he dismissed 240 people, Larkin had to respond.  Murphy's trump card was to unite the employers of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce in a joint effort to break the ITGWU by locking out all who refused to renounce Larkin.  It was an effective antidote to Larkin's corresponding policy of using the sympathetic strike to advance his cause and thus began the worst dispute in Irish labour history.  It went on for five months from August 1913 to January 1914 and caused enormous suffering, not just to the 25,000 men involved but also to their wives and children.  Welfare systems were rudimentary or non-existent and it was only the support of the Trades Union Congress, TUC, in Britain which raised &pound;93,000 - equivalent to approximately &euro;10 million today - to send food ships to Dublin that kept starvation at bay.  I was very pleased on the national day of commemoration of the 1913 Lock-out to be able to invite Frances O'Grady, a lady with a good, Irish-sounding name, to lay a wreath at the Larkin statue on O'Connell Street.<\/p><p>  The plight of the working class people of Dublin in 1913 was appalling from a social perspective.  Over 80,000 families lived in tenements, mostly in one or two rooms.  The middle class had decamped to the suburbs, leaving the working class in possession of the city's subsoil and, in the words of Padraig Yeates, &quot;Its distinct smell complemented that of social decay and economic starvation.&quot;  It was in these awful conditions that families tried to subsist on an average labouring wage of 18 shillings a week.  One did not have to look far to find the causes of labour militancy in the Dublin of 1913.<\/p><p>  Labour militancy was to exact a high price in human suffering.  Within days of the commencement of the Lock-out, two men, James Nolan and John Byrne, died under the batons of the Dublin Metropolitan Police in civil unrest that had broken out in the city.  On 30 August James Connolly was sentenced to three months in jail, having refused to recognise the court.  The authorities banned a public meeting planned for Sackville Street - now O'Connell Street - on Sunday, 31 August, but Larkin vowed to speak anyway.<\/p><p>  Alarmed by Connolly's and Larkin's tactics, William O'Brien and the other leaders of the trade council feared that the presence of large numbers of ITGWU members on Sackville Street would risk very serious disturbances.  To avoid this, they organised an alternative event, a march to Croydon Park in Fairview.  Some 10,000 members took part in the march and the event went off more or less peacefully.  Larkin, however, insisted on fulfilling his promise and, accompanied by Helena Moloney, arrived in disguise at the Imperial Hotel - now Clerys - where he had pre-booked a room in the name of Donnelly.  The hotel was owned by William Martin Murphy.  At 1.20 p.m. he appeared on the balcony of the hotel and briefly addressed the crowd.  The police immediately moved to arrest him, sparking protests to which it responded by ferociously baton charging the crowd.  Within five minutes nearly 400 people had been seriously injured.<\/p> <p>An independent witness, barrister Thomas Patton, subsequently testified to the Commission of Inquiry into this incident:<blockquote><br \/>Police used their batons all the time and with great force, and, almost invariably, on the heads of people ... I should say that the demeanour of the crowd, before these charges took place, seemed to me to be quite respectable.  I did not see any disturbance, or riot, or any attempt at disturbance or riot.<\/blockquote>Needless to say, the savagery of this incident deeply embittered the strikers, but the employers were also determined on unconditional surrender.  Separate attempts by bodies such as the TUC, Thomas Kettle's industrial peace committee and the Askwith committee, as well as by enlightened employers like the draper Edward Lee, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Mr. Lorcan Sherlock, and Archbishop Walsh, to negotiate a settlement or even an industrial truce were all rebuffed by the employers.  Eventually after five months, unconditional surrender was, in effect, what they got.  Larkin's inability to convince British unions to support him by engaging in sympathetic strikes undermined his core strategy.  At a special conference on 9 December 1913 the Trades Union Congress voted decisively against the call for sympathetic strikes.  Railway union leaders led the charge arguing that if they acceded to this demand, it would set such a precedent that their members would never be at work.  While this was an understandable viewpoint, it was the beginning of the end for Larkin.  By January 1914, in the face of a united employer front and with his members and their families destitute, he had to advise them to get what terms they could for a return to work.  The bitterness of this outcome can be sensed in James Connolly's words in <i>Forward!<\/i>:<blockquote>And so, we Irish workers must go down into hell, bow our backs to the lash of the slave driver, let our hearts be seared by the iron of his hatred, and instead of the sacramental wafer of brotherhood and common sacrifice, eat the dust of defeat and betrayal.<\/blockquote>For some, of course, no terms were available.  They were blacklisted by employers and, like Fitz in <i>Strumpet City<\/i>, their only choice was to join to fight in the war that began in 1914.  Within three years many of them were dead, as was Connolly and others like the bricklayers' leader Richard O'Carroll, shot like Sheehy Skeffington by Captain J. C. Bowen-Colthurst during Easter Week.  Larkin had gone to America in November 1914, exhausted and suffering from depression after the trauma of the Lock-out.  He was imprisoned there and, convicted of criminal syndicalism, not to return until 23 April 1923 after his deportation by a young J. Edgar Hoover.  Nevertheless, the ITGWU and the union movement proved remarkably resilient.  At the end of 1913 the ITGWU had 22,935 members, compared with <br \/>24,135 in January.  By 1920 it had grown to 120,000.  By 1918 it was strong enough to mount a general strike against conscription.<\/p><p> Much of this was due to the organisational skills of William O'Brien.  When Larkin eventually returned to Ireland, he found the ITGWU firmly under O'Brien's control.  Inevitably, there was a clash and Larkin lost.  He went on to found the Workers' Union of Ireland and took most of the Dublin membership of the ITGWU with him.  This precipitated a long lasting divide in the labour movement of a industrial and political nature which was not healed until the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was formed in 1959, 12 years after Larkin's death.  The ITGWU and the WUI were fully reunited in 1990 with the formation of SIPTU which today has 250,000 members.<\/p><p> That O'Brien became so influential in the ITGWU is interesting in itself.  He was not originally a member because he was a tailor by trade and a member of a craft <br \/>union, although he was a key figure in the Lock-out as vice president of the Dublin Trades Council.  However, he joined the ITGWU and rose quickly in influence within it, becoming treasurer by 1919.  He was a great admirer of Connolly and it may be that, as Connolly became more and more preoccupied with the Citizen Army and militant nationalism, he was happy to leave the mundane task of union building to William O'Brien.  In the folk memory of Irish trade unionism William O'Brien has often been presented in a much more negative light than his contemporaries, Connolly and Larkin.  However, his biographer, Fr. Tom Morrissey,  reassesses him as a much more rounded character of great intellect who died widely honoured but not widely liked.<\/p><p> The formation of the Citizen Army was a response to the type of police partiality displayed on Sackville Street on 31 August and its function was initially to protect strikers.  However, it moved on from that role to play a key part in the 1916 Rising.  In some respects, the role of the labour movement in these events has been under-recognised.  It was a tragic paradox of the time that those who had fought in the class struggle in 1913 should end up on opposite sides a short time later.  It is said one reason there was such initial hostility to the captured volunteers after the Rising was that so many veterans of 1913 were fighting in the trenches at the time.<\/p><p> Reflecting on what was by any standard an out and out class struggle in 1913, it is perhaps puzzling that it did not have more of an influence on the polity of the emerging Irish State.  Given the contribution of these same actors to the subsequent independence struggle, it is remarkable that Mr. Kevin O'Higgins could claim in the early years of the new Irish Government that his was &quot;'the most conservative-minded revolutionaries that ever put through a successful revolution.&quot;  This demonstrates the extent to which Irish nationalism trumped political ideology.<\/p><p> There is an interesting contrast with an event that happened in Sweden a few years later.  In 1931 there was a strike in the wood pulp industry in a town called &Aring;dalen.  During a demonstration by union members in support of the strike the police shot five people dead.  This had such an impact on the Swedish psyche that the Social Democrats swept to power in 1932 and remained continuously in office until 1976.  The Nordic social democratic model that they created remains a byword for economic efficiency, equality and social cohesion.  On any indicator of social progress Nordic social market economies lead the world.  By contrast, social democracy had a harder time finding its feet in Ireland.  Perhaps the reason is that since the foundation of the State, the most important issues, even those related to our membership of the European Union, have been conceptualised in terms of independence rather than of class interest.  This reality, together with the overhang of Northern Ireland, has consolidated a political party structure which never aligned with the broad European typology of conservative, liberal and social democratic.  The Labour Party that Connolly, Larkin and O'Brien founded in 1912 has been unable to break through an electoral straitjacket where never less than 60% per cent of voters prefer the centre right of the political spectrum.<\/p><p> On the other hand, while Ireland is firmly part of the liberal market economy grouping of Anglo-Saxon countries, it has at times exhibited some countervailing tendencies.  Foremost among them is an interventionist industrial policy and, between 1987 and 2009, a sophisticated model of social partnership.  In this respect, it was close to the Nordic approach.  The difference is that their institutions are firmly embedded in what Peter Katzenstein's seminal work on small open economies, published in 1985, described as &#8220;an ideology of social partnership.&#8221;  This kind of conviction did not underpin the Irish model and, lacking firm philosophical roots, did not survive the economic cataclysm of 2008.  In time I think this will be seen as a public policy mistake.  Peter Katzenstein's core thesis is that institutions are crucial to success.  They may need to be reformed as circumstances change, but they should not be dispensed with lightly and without compelling reasons for so doing.<\/p><p> That said, it must also be acknowledged that there has never been an overt public policy hostility to trade unions.  No political party has ever made it a platform to attack trade union rights, as have, for example, the Tories in Britain or the Republicans in the United States.  Perhaps this, too, has something to do with organised labour's role in the foundation of the State.  Nevertheless, the reality is that the central objective that the women and men of 1913 fought for, the right of workers to choose their representatives and have them bargain collectively with employers on their behalf, has never been secured.  It is actively opposed by employers' organisations, IDA Ireland, the Supreme Court and some legislators who fear that granting a legal right to collective bargaining would inhibit foreign direct investment.  Why that should be so, given that the right is enshrined in ILO Conventions 87 and 98 and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and is the norm in virtually every European country, including Britain, is a mystery to me.<\/p> <p> We can erect statues to the 1913 leaders, we can name bridges after them, we can hold national days of commemoration to salute their sacrifice but so long as their great grandchildren are deprived of the basic human right that they set out to achieve, then we do not really honour their memory.  To some extent the events of 1913 are viewed exclusively in an historical context, the product of material conditions that have no relevance today.  This is to fail to understand the enduring nature of some of the influences involved.<\/p><p> Globalisation is one such influence.  The capitalist world of 1913 was smaller than today but no less globalised if one allows for the technological advances that have happened in the meantime.  It was a time of much industrial conflict across Europe as workers and capital owners struggled with issues of distributional justice.  To many it seemed as if the world then had reached the limits of economic progress.  Yet, it was all to collapse into the chaos and slaughter of the First World War 1 in 1914.  For its part organised labour was unequal to the task of preventing millions of its members from killing each other in that conflict.  One of our greatest historical failures, undoubtedly.  The lesson to be learned is that our well-being, our peace and our world is very fragile.<\/p><p> The current phase of globalisation that can largely be identified with the deregulation of capital markets began in the 1980s.  The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the decision of China to go capitalist by decree greatly accelerated the process.  One effect was to add one and a half billion additional workers to the pre-existing industrial workforce of 950 million.  Effectively this changed the balance of power between capital and labour and, with the increased mobility of capital and financialisation, meant that the collective bargaining power of labour was diminished.  Investment decisions became crucial to economic sustainability and so multinational corporations achieved much more leverage over corporate tax policies and labour market regulation in countries that sought that investment.  Ireland is a particular manifestation of this phenomenon, being described pejoratively by Professor Peadar Kirby and others as &quot;a competition State&quot;.  Interestingly, the change that I have just described was attended by considerable stability with relatively low inflation alongside robust global economic growth.  Policy makers thought that through policy alone they had achieved a new kind of equilibrium.  Alan Greenspan referred to it as &quot;the great moderation&quot; but it was only a chimera.  Reduced earning power consequent upon weaker unions with diminished bargaining strength was compensated for by easily available cheap credit.  People invested in property that appreciated in value quickly creating a wealth effect that, more or less, confused or disguised the anaemic levels of earned income growth.  All of us know how that ended.<\/p><p> When the financial crisis hit in 2008 rapidly increasing unemployment and precarious employment contracts had a certain chilling effect on the willingness of workers to oppose austerity policies in a sustained way across Europe.  Youth unemployment levels of 50% in some countries, 7 million of them not in education or training, NEETS, and an overall unemployed cohort of 26 million people in Europe is as close to a social catastrophe as one can get.<\/p><p> Keynesian demand management approaches were rejected in the 1970s because of perceived inability to counter the stagflation caused by the two oil crises at the time.  For a while, post-Lehman's collapse, it looked as if neo-liberalism would also be rejected.  The neo-liberals regrouped and by the G20 meeting in the summer of 2010 austerity was installed as the policy to counter recession.  Paradoxically, Barack Obama was the only Keynesian left standing but the recovery in the US, in my opinion, is testimony to his wisdom.<\/p><p> It is puzzling that there was not a more robust embrace of social democracy given the catastrophic failure of neo-liberalism.  A possible explanation may be the absence of a persuasive alternative narrative to austerity.  People did not believe that another way was possible and this is reflected, to some extent, in the electoral failure of social democratic parties with Australia and Norway, and Germany being the most recent manifestation of this failure to convince.  Right across Europe unions defaulted to the time honoured path of protest.  This was not, of itself, a sufficient response because nowhere, in truth, has it made a real difference.<\/p><p> In the concluding part of his magnum opus <i>The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, <\/i>John Maynard Keynes reflected on the potency of ideas over a period of time. He said: &quot;But, soon or late, it is ideas, not vested interests, which are dangerous for good or evil.&quot;  When the financial crisis began in earnest following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in mid-September 2008 Congress campaigned for an essentially Keynesian response under the banner of &quot;A Better Fairer Way&quot;<i>.  <\/i>It became clear, however, that orthodox economic opinion would have none of it.  We were virtually alone.  We realised that our capacity to undermine the meta narrative of austerity was unequal to the scale of opposing opinion.  For this reason we instituted a considerable reorientation of resources and it has paid off.  <\/p><p> By virtue of the quality of its analysis the Nevin Economic Research Institute, that we created to engage in the battle of ideas from a social democratic perspective, is gradually gaining some purchase on the attention of policy makers, parliamentarians, I think, and the public as well.  Not least in importance is its role in equipping our own members to engage in public discourse.  Understanding the reality that the way the EMU is structured, and the absent facility to devalue, the burden of adjustment in the event of an economic shock will fall on workers.  Understanding that is the key to the future because it is the essential cause of much of our difficulty.  The fact that the institutions of EMU are designed on the lines of the German Bundesbank means that German ordoliberalism is the policy effectively being followed.  However, the manner in which it is mediated through the troika means that it appears here as hard-nosed neoliberalism unlike in Germany where it is moderated by its social market economy context.  Therefore, the key to a more equitable burden sharing ultimately requires a rebalancing of the EMU institutions to allow for a social Europe in which the independence and power of the ECB is complemented by institutions appropriate to the social market economy.  In other words, the ECB needs to move closer to the approach of the Federal Reserve in the United States having not as its remit just price stability but the broader conduct of economic affairs, including unemployment.  It seems unlikely that the significant political momentum to achieve such an objective can be mobilised without a renaissance of social democracy in Europe, an event that does not seem imminent.  Nevertheless, recapturing the social policy ambitions of the Delors' era in Europe is the task of the European Trade Union Confederation in which ICTU tries to play an active part.<\/p><p> Thus it is that the imperative of both industrial and political representation of workers reasserts itself as it did during that tumultuous period between 1908 and 1913.  It is important to come to the realisation that the social market economy must be allowed to function in a way that allows for systems of collective bargaining to facilitate distributional justice and the opportunity of a decent job for all.  The alternative - and I am very serious about this because we have seen it happen in a number of European countries - is an acceleration of support for populist right wing, anti-European and anti-immigrant parties.<\/p><p> When Larkin came to Dublin the Dublin Castle authorities, or British authorities, at the time, did not want to take him in conflict due to the way he was able to organise even the police to join his union in Belfast, when he organised a big strike there in 1906.  In the heightened Nationalist fervour of the times that would have been a considerable worry to them.  Many employers were reticent about taking Larkin on but William Martin Murphy put steel into those employers.  He was an unusual phenomenon in the Ireland of 1913, a Catholic Nationalist entrepreneur in a city dominated by Protestant Unionist businessmen.  Yet they accepted his leadership of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.  Murphy's cause was not a dispute about pay and conditions.  It was to get rid of Larkin and the syndicalism that he practised.  The sympathetic strike was regarded as a dangerous weapon in the hands of women and men whose circumstances were so bad that they had nothing to lose.  Most of all he hated Larkin because he had an analysis of what caused those poor conditions in the first place.  Once again, the importance of ideas comes out.  Larkin was exceptional due to his charisma and leadership.  What was exceptional about those who followed him was their solidarity and willingness to suffer for his &quot;divine gospel of discontent&quot;.<\/p> <p>In some respects the labour movement regained ground lost more quickly than might have been expected after 1913.  By 1919, the International Labour Office had been instituted awarding, as of right, many of the protections William Martin Murphy sought to deny to the ITGWU.  By 1919 also, the democratic programme here, reflecting the values of labour, had been promulgated.  The recovery of trade union strength was helped by the demand for labour and economic conditions associated with the war.<\/p><p> Sadly, however, the return of Larkin from the United States in 1923 led to a virtual civil war over control of the transport union.  As a result, trade unions were marginalised from economic and social policy making for most of the next 35 years.  It is hard to deny that this was not a squandering of all the effort and hardship associated with 1913.  It is the reason Congress today remains so protective of the all-island unified structure instituted in 1959.  It was a settlement which created the largest civil society organisation in Ireland, unique in European terms, in having one trade union centre for two jurisdictions.  The acceptance of the <i>sui generis<\/i>nature of Congress has allowed it to stake out common ground for workers of all religious and political persuasions to oppose sectarianism and violence over the past 40 difficult years in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> The core mission of trade unionism to organise workers to force a more just distribution of the wealth created by markets, remains as it always has been.  This mission is predicated on a belief that: all human beings are morally equal; we all have an equal entitlement to self-determination; all life chances should be as equal as possible; and social justice is a condition of liberty.  Moreover, we believe that capitalism does not exist independently of society and it is proper for the democratic will to be asserted over business and private power.  Markets do not regulate themselves and best outcomes do not happen spontaneously.<\/p><p> The biggest challenge facing all of us today is to find ways to mitigate the social and economic risks to which people are exposed during their normal lives.  The very rich may have the means to insulate themselves from some, but not all, of these risks.  The rest of us need to band together for protection.  That is the purpose of the welfare state.  In recent years, high levels of public debt and an ageing demographic, bringing with it high pension and health costs, have undermined the sustainability of the welfare state.  In the future, it will only be possible to achieve sustainability with high levels of social investment.  This in turn will require high labour force participation rates and jobs capable of sustaining the tax revenue base to fund social investment.  In other words, decent work.<\/p><p> As things stand, the trend is in the opposite direction, with many of our citizens having an increasingly precarious relationship with the labour market through zero-hour contracts and the like.  Indeed it is the case that the welfare system is being increasingly used to subsidise employers paying low pay.  This is unsustainable.  In the same way, the retreat from defined benefit pension systems is transferring risk, through defined contributions, to the individual initially but ultimately to the State, because none of us can support a situation where our elderly population is left in destitution and abject poverty.  The State would have to step in eventually.  There is an enormous movement of risk taking place.<\/p><p> Decent work is now, and will increasingly become, an imperative for all industrialised countries.  The only way to achieve decent work is through collective bargaining.  The need for workers to organise and bargain collectively with employers for distributional justice is as relevant today as it was in the past.  The values which inspired the women and men of 1913 are, in fact, timeless.<\/p><p> In Padraig Yeates's marvellously detailed account of the Lock-out there is a poignant little story about the fate of some of those involved in the Lock-out.  I want to conclude with this, because it captures the tragedy of the whole thing and reminds me of the weight of history on the shoulders of those whose duty it is to lead the present day trade union movement.  The story tells how in 1914, a group of ITGWU men, who were unable to win reinstatement on the docks because of their involvement with Larkin, joined the Dublin fusiliers <i>en bloc.<\/i> They were part of the regular army that held the line in Flanders, while Kitchener's mass volunteer army was training in Britain.  On 24 April 1915, they took part in an attack on a village called Saint-Julien, near Ypres in Flanders.  They advanced in &quot;faultless order&quot; to within 100 yds of the village before their lines were swept away by machine gun fire.  The handful who crawled back gave &quot;three cheers for Jim Larkin&quot;, just as if they were once more outside Liberty Hall.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500008#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Begg","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380105900,"counter":43,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Begg, for a very enlightening and interesting presentation to Members.

In welcoming him to the House today, we acknowledge the significance of the 1913 Lock-out and the events surrounding it as moments of great importance in our history.  It is very important that during the decade of commemorations we will have over the next ten years, historical events such as the 1913 Lock-out are commemorated.<\/p><p>  As Mr. Begg stated, the Lock-out was an unprecedented event in Ireland, both in measure and intensity, and to this day remains the largest industrial conflict in Irish history.  Leading personalities, such as Larkin, Connolly and Countess Markievicz, showed exceptional charisma, courage and credence in their cause.  The Lock-out brought thousands of Irish men and women out on the streets of Dublin to assert their rights.  Recently I heard a radio programme which suggested that the establishment was very much against the idea of trade unionism, and as the Irish Parliamentary Party was elected by people of property, no support could be expected for trade unionism from that quarter. <\/p><p>  However, recently I read a speech delivered by John Redmond at the turn of the century in Ballybricken in Waterford, a place where, as Waterford people would say, I was born, bred and reared myself.  These were the words of John Redmond at the turn of the century:<blockquote>  I therefore am strongly in favour of the principle of trade unionism.  I would appeal to the labouring classes of Waterford to strengthen their organisation, act with due regard to the general interests of the community and with moderation, good sense and reason.  I am in favour of the limitation wherever possible, of hours of labour.  Every reasonable demand made on behalf of the labour movement has my support - seeing that the rate of wages is a rate which will enable men to live, educate and bring up their families, seeing that the class of labour employed is a legitimate class and I believe in the strict enforcement of this and the preventing of excursive employment of the young.<\/blockquote>These were strong words from Redmond at a time when such support would have been frowned upon by the ruling classes and the establishment of the time, but I am glad they were delivered on my home turf in Ballybricken.<\/p><p>  I listened with interest to the debate in the other House on the Lock-out on which some excellent contributions were made.  We decided to go one step further and invite Mr. Begg, as general secretary of ICTU, to come to this House.  I compliment him on an excellent and much appreciated presentation.  We have come a long way since 1913.  The modern Irish workforce is very fortunate to benefit from progressive and protective workplace regulations.  Workers here are privileged to work in a country where their rights are well respected and where there are stable structures in place to safeguard their rights when points of contention are raised.  The role of trade unions must also be acknowledged when speaking about workers' rights in this regard.<\/p><p>  The role of organisations such as the ICTU is fundamental to educating workers on their rights, safeguarding those rights and liaising with the Government and relevant bodies on behalf of working people.  In Ireland, we have had a model of social partnership that has served us well and kept industrial unrest to a bare minimum for a long number of years.<\/p> <p>Indeed, the leadership shown by the trade unions since the beginning of the recession has been exemplary.  While ICTU advocated for its members to protect their terms and conditions, it also took cognisance of the spending reality facing the State.  It is fair to say that the Croke Park and the Haddington Road agreements have facilitated the necessary adjustments without the unrest and the disruption to public services that we have witnessed in other European counties.<\/p><p>I reiterate my thanks to David Begg for coming here and for his most interesting and informative address.  I wish him well in the further commemorations of the Lock-out event and in his future work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500011#K00300","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380106500,"counter":46,"content":"<p>It is a great pleasure to welcome David Begg on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group.  I compliment you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Leader for not only facilitating this outstanding presentation from Mr. Begg, but facilitating presentations from other leaders from business and other walks of life over the past six months.<\/p><p>  Mr. Begg has had a long and outstanding career in public life.  He is very much the face of organised labour, representing hundred of thousands of people.  He holds an onerous and important position, which he carries out with great moderation.  Whenever a storm is brewing, he is a calming influence, although I have no doubt that there is plenty of steel behind that calm.  <\/p><p>  Congress must be recognised for the positive contribution it has made, particularly in recent years during this awful recession.  If and when we pull out of the recession - I am sure that we will - congress's role will be looked at and great credit will be due to it for the manner in which it has played its part in a disciplined and patriotic way.  <\/p><p>  The 1913 Lock-out is obviously one of the great events in Irish history.  It was for a long time overshadowed by 1916, which has been the main focus of commemorations down through the years.  The 100th anniversary gives us an opportunity to have a wider look at what went on during that tumultuous period.  While the Lock-out ended in defeat it was not ultimately a defeat because it highlighted a number of issues, including the appalling poverty in Dublin, that had been swept under the carpet.  It was also a success in so far as it taught workers the importance of organised labour.  As Mr. Begg mentioned, it was the bed on which the future of organised trade unions was made.  Without the 1913 Lock-out that may never have happened.  One only has to read or watch the plays of S&eacute;an O'Casey to realise the awful plight of the people at that time.<\/p><p>  I am most interested in the international element to the 1913 Lock-out and the help that trade unionists received from other countries, particularly from the United Kingdom.  Its trade union movement was very much in its infancy as well.  It probably started in the London dock strike of 1889, which was organised by Ben Tillett and others.  Subsequent to that event, Keir Hardie was elected as the first Labour Member of Parliament.  The UK was not too far ahead of us, so the manner in which they assisted the struggling workers in Dublin was exemplary and should be noted.  It is a pity that at the time some elements of the Catholic Church tried to intervene and prevent that assistance because they thought that some kind of proselytising was occurring, which was a rather short-sighted approach.<\/p><p>  I have one or two questions to pose to Mr. Begg.  First, I know that we live in more subtle times and we would not want to have fellows like William Martin Murphy around, but are there resonances of such confrontations ongoing when the union is trying to settle a point of issue with employers?  Will that confrontation always be there?  Is it part of life that employers want to pay as little as they can, while workers will try to get as much as they can?  Is it an inevitable part of the relationship?  <\/p><p>  Seco<font color=\"#222222\">nd, Mr. Begg, referred to Northern Ireland.  I know that the huge sectarian divide up there must have been impossible for anyone to bridge, but I have often wondered whether the trade union movement did enough to bring the sides together because it was not the wealthy Catholics and Protestants who were battling it out, but the poor.  I have often felt that trade unions should have been more proactive.  Finally, I am privileged and grateful to have been nominated by congress, along with other Senators here, such as Senator Brennan, to contest the Senate elections for the past two elections.  Congress has had the power to nominate seven Senators since the Constitution.  Does Mr. Begg find the engagement with the Oireachtas of use to congress?  Does he anticipate in the event that there is no longer a Seanad that he will have the same sense of engagement with a single chamber Parliament, namely the D&aacute;il?  As Mr. Begg knows, the Seanad is, 100 years on, facing its own lock-out.  Thankfully, that decision will not be made by William Martin Murphy but by the people, and we will abide by their decision.  I have no wish to put words into Mr. Begg's mouth, but does he think that the Seanad has been a useful conduit between congress and Government?<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500012#L00200","speaker":"1142"},{"type":"speech","time":1380106500,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I welcome David Begg to the House, it is a pleasure to have the General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions here.  It is important to mark the 1913 Lock-out centenary in this way and that we speak also about its relevance to modern Ireland.  I had to propose to a previous meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that Mr. Begg would address us, and it is great that he is here to do so.  As the Leader has said, we have gone one better than the Lower House in our approach to marking the centenary.<\/p><p>  I am personally delighted because I had the pleasure of working with Mr. Begg on the TASC democracy commission, which I view as a precursor to the constitutional convention in the sense that we looked at issues around participation in democracy and encouraging greater participation by young people in particular.  We did important work on that issue.<br \/> Mr. Begg has given a wonderful, clear and comprehensive overview of the complex history and the context of the Lock-out.  There is no doubt it was a tragedy and a defeat.  As Mr Begg mentioned, it was effectively an unconditional surrender and a betrayal of the working classes who had united in solidarity behind the charismatic and strongly revered Jim Larkin.  Of course, he was equally loathed by those on the other side and, in many ways, he became a divisive figure.  The Lock-out has achieved an iconic status and it was undoubtedly a pivotal moment in Irish history.  One strand of historical work focuses on the personality of Larkin and the relationship he had with other leaders, such as Connolly and O'Brien.  That highlights the splits and divide in the trade union movement which Mr. Begg described as a kind of civil war, which is one of enduring effects after 1913.  That is only one interpretation of 1913 and it is often the interpretation of those who take an anti-trade union perspective.  However, there is another important take on the Lock-out that has left a more lasting legacy to which Mr. Begg alluded.  The widespread and common perception of 1913 is that it was a brutal put-down by a ruthless employer, William Martin Murphy and his allies, of workers and their families who were living in appalling conditions and in starvation.  Those conditions are so far removed, happily, from current circumstances that it is often hard to see the relevance.  There is a renewed interest in the social context of the Lock-out.  One only has to look at the revived interest in <i>Strumpet City<\/i> and recent cultural events, including the reopening of the house on Henrietta Street, the television programmes about tenement life and people's living conditions, and recent dramas in the fringe festival and in Dublin City Hall for culture night to see that.<\/p> <p>All of these events have focused on people's living conditions at the time and the impact of the employers' tactics on women and children, in particular.<\/p><p>The Lock-out has left a powerful legacy in Irish society, namely, an enduring attachment not specifically to trade unions but to the principle of communitarianism and the idea of social protection, and, in particular, a determination that families should never again be left in that type of destitution.  As Mr. Begg observed, however, there is a great deal of analysis to be done on why social democracy has not had a stronger hold in Irish politics.  There certainly has been a strong adherence to a model of the welfare state and of social protection which is broadly in keeping with the European tradition of social democracy.  It has, however, taken a particular shape in this country over many years.  Some historians describe the Catholic Church as having operated here as a sort of shadow welfare state, providing many of the social protections that were undertaken directly by the state elsewhere.  The social protection model in this country is not the same model we saw develop in the Nordic countries, for example, but it none the less marks an enduring adherence to communitarianism.<\/p><p>There are many particular factors to which we can point that might explain why the Labour Party and social democracy more generally did not gain politically from this commitment to communitarianism.  The decision by the party to opt out of the 1918 general election is often seen as a pivotal moment in the development of what is referred to as the two-and-a-half-party system.  There is an important legacy to tease out in terms of the Irish political system and our social perspective.  In the context of our EU membership, we see that Irish governments, comprising a range of political parties and even where the Labour Party is not involved, have adhered very strongly to the social market model.  Mr. Begg also pointed to our long adherence to the social partnership model between 1987 and 2009, which is in keeping with the spirit I have described.<\/p><p>There is a further legacy to consider here, which is the unfinished business of 1913.  This legacy, which has lived on in the trade union movement and in our industrial relations system, is the voluntarist model of engagement, where traditionally there was no statutory basis for collective bargaining and where unions and employers instead negotiated on a voluntary basis.  As Mr. Begg observed, International Labour Organisation conventions and, more recently, the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights have pointed strongly to the need to ensure rights to collective bargaining and trade union recognition in the workplace.  This was the central issue in the 1913 Lock-out and in many trade disputes in this country in the intervening years.  It is the unfinished business of 1913 that we still have not implemented those rights in law.  An attempt was made in 2004, as Mr. Begg pointed out, in the amendments to the industrial relations legislation.  That attempt was undermined by the Supreme Court decision in the Ryanair case in 2007, which took a very restrictive interpretation of the legislation.  There is a strong academic argument that the decision in that case breached ILO Convention No. 98 and did not take sufficient cognisance of the true content of the freedom of association rights.  I am very pleased that the programme for Government negotiated in 2011 includes a commitment to review the need for the inclusion of the principle of union recognition in legislation.  I look forward to seeing that done in the lifetime of this Government.<\/p><p>I referred earlier to the cultural legacy of 1913.  In the year when we finally decided to name a bridge in Dublin after a woman - Rosie Hackett, a trade unionist involved in the Lock-out - it is clear that it is a cultural legacy that lives on very strongly.  As Mr. Begg observed, the values and motives that drove the women and men who took part in the Lock-out are still very much alive and kicking in this city and country today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500012#L00300","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380107100,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Begg for his interesting and provocative address.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the Cathaoirleach, Leader and Senator Ivana Bacik in facilitating this debate.  The opportunity to commemorate key historical events is always to be welcomed, provided it serves as a means to interrogate the present and perhaps offer some roadmap or vision for the future.<\/p><p>  I do not agree that we must be sensitive in commemorating or acknowledging our forthcoming centenaries, but we do need to be truthful.  We must get past the myths surrounding all these events and examine only the facts.  It is a fact, for example, that the 1913 Lock-out ended in failure.  It is a fact that capital won out over labour.  It is a fact, above all, that the events of the harsh winter of 1913 led to huge hardship, deprivation, emigration, death, and a subsequent flight to the fields of Flanders.  At the same time, however, the extraordinary men and women who supported the locked-out workers set us a moral challenge and standard that are still relevant 100 years later.  They have become our virtual conscience.<\/p><p>  Their vision of social justice, equality of pay and conditions, equal access to education and voting rights, the campaign against alcohol abuse and the right to paid holidays was born in the trauma and catharsis of 1913.  President Michael D. Higgins referred to the events of that year in a recent speech at the launch the Lock-out tapestry.  I am proud to observe that staff of the Abbey Theatre contributed to one of the panels of that tapestry, which is on display in the National Museum.  President Higgins said:<blockquote>National commemorations such as this one, honouring the 1913 Lock-out, are not mere protocol occasions and ceremonies; they are actions that invite us to reclaim our collective past, to appropriate and reinterpret it so as to broaden our understanding of our present condition and redefine our horizon of expectations.<\/blockquote>That is a good summation of the role of national commemorations, and it is the context in which this debate is taking place today.<\/p><p>  The emergence of new historians who have accessed primary sources in our archives and analysed personal testimonies is a remarkable development.  Learning about people like Rosie Hackett, who lived on Abbey Street, and her colleague Helena Moloney, an actress at the Abbey Theatre, gives us a better and more complex view of history.  If we are to make sense of the past we must examine the multiple narratives of history.  Senator Ned O'Sullivan referred to the work of Se&aacute;n O'Casey.  It is useful to consider the latter's observation that the single most important event in 20th century Ireland was not the Rising of 1916 but the Lock-out of 1913.  The events of that year set an agenda which has had an impact and consequence to this day.<\/p><p>  As Senator Bacik mentioned, the Abbey Theatre has considered, and will continue to consider, the cultural interpretation of the events of 1913.  This coming winter, for instance, we will present Jim Plunkett's &quot;The Risen People&quot; on the Abbey stage.  It is important to remember that the Lock-out did not start and end on the day in August known as Bloody Sunday but continued for five months over the winter of 1913.<\/p><p>  The Lock-out has become mythologised as an epic struggle between Jim Larkin on one side and William Martin Murphy on the other.  The reality was rather different.  It was an ugly dispute, with failings on both sides.  It was often mundane.  A prominent historian of the period in question, Padraig Yeates, has observed:<blockquote>The myth has survived in large part because it has suited everyone.  It gave the moral victory to the workers, while their material defeat underlined the comforting contention of the employers and other defenders of conservative ideologies that Larkinism, and by extension socialism, made for good rhetoric but was impractical.  For the most part the Lockout was a far shabbier, bloodier and more mundane affair than the myth allows.  Above all, it was an unnecessary dispute and probably would not have occurred but for the peculiarly perverse personalities of Larkin and the employers'  leader William Martin Murphy.  Few of the principals emerge well from this awful episode in Dublin's history.  It was left to what Tom Kettle referred to as the 'second class people on both sides' to pick up the pieces.  Of course, individual Dubliners of all classes and creeds, acting on the impulses of common humanity, did what they could to mitigate the worst aspects of the tragedy.  So did thousands of workers in Britain [as Mr. Begg pointed out] who contributed almost &pound;10,000 (the equivalent of &pound;10 million today) to help their locked-out brethren.  Nevertheless the Lockout raised passions that were by turn sectarian and nationalist.  The help from Britain was often resented and, perversely, helped strengthen separatist tendencies within the Irish trade union movement.<\/blockquote>The events of 1913 can help us today in deciding how we might reorganise Irish society.  Whatever we think of Larkin and Connolly, they believed in an ideology of enhancing human dignity and examining what might be possible for us all as a community.<\/p><p>  One of my questions to Mr. Begg relates to social partnership, which certainly had merit.  The Programme for National Recovery in 1987 represented the strong beginnings of a type of re-articulation of the relationship between workers and employers.<\/p> <p>It had merit but its merit was annulled and the vision and ideology fell apart.  It became a process to deliver action rather than a shared set of common values and a vision for our public service.  How will that appear again?  We have the Haddington Road agreement, but perhaps Mr. Begg can tell us how he sees the reorganisation of the discourse between worker and employer occurring in the coming ten to 15 years.  As a republic in name only, we need leaders of communities to adopt the spirit of Larkin and Connolly and use the opportunity of commemorations like the 1913 Lock-out to agree on a journey that will take us out of the current hardship with a more ethical base.  Therefore, although the Lock-out was a defeat, it was, as President Higgins suggests, the \"beginning of a journey towards human dignity and social justice, an unfinished journey for so many on our planet\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500013#M00200","speaker":"1167","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380107700,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I join the Leader and others in welcoming Mr. David Begg.  It is a reunion, in a sense, because for several years on Friday mornings we heard the thoughts of Mr. Begg at the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  They were always carefully prepared and forcefully argued proposals for economic improvement.  The tutorial has resumed, updated from the period when I left the NESC.  At that time, Mr. Begg would make a presentation and I would come in soon afterwards.  After that, each Department representative defended his or her Department and would not discuss the ideas we had.  Add to that the rigid Whip system here, and we have the great Keynes quote that Mr. Begg and I use frequently: \"It is ideas, not vested interests, which are dangerous for good or evil.\"  Mr. Begg and I aired ideas at the NESC and it stopped there.  The rest of the system was geared to prevent them from going further.  I came here with Keynesian objectives in mind and they were stopped.  People from Department X did not want to comment on whatever we had to say on Department Y.  Presumably, there were repercussions when they went back.  People come to me outside the Chamber and tell me they fully support me but when it comes to debating in the Chamber it is gone because Mr. Whippy has intervened and Members must do what they are told.  We need ideas and I always admired the way Mr. David Begg introduced them.  We try to do the same here.  The Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, is an important development in that regard.<\/p><p>Mr. Begg and Senator Bacik referred to social partnership running out of steam in 2009.  Was it hijacked?  Under the idea of being too big to fail, we invented a form of socialism for the rich and bailed out, at vast expense, the bankers and the accountants who prepared accounts that were not a true and accurate reflection of the companies upon which they were reporting.  There were disastrous failures in central banking.  It was supposed to be a regulated sector but the ideas were kept out.<\/p><p>One of the ideas of NERI and in the thinking of Mr. Begg, which we need at this stage, is that we have all seen the consequences of the 2008 collapse but we now need to look at the causes.  When union representatives appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, I mentioned that with the experience, expertise and knowledge they have, we must consider what kind of banks we should have.  The existing banks would do the same all over again, which would cost us another &euro;64 billion.  Mr. Begg and NERI could develop these ideas.  Why do we not have proper project appraisal and policy evaluation in the public sector?  How do we get a proper banking system that will not put the country back on the rocks, leading to the unemployment to which Mr. Begg referred?<\/p><p>It will not be so momentous an event when we leave the troika because we still have a bundle of debt.  We need to have a kind of economic policy to deal with the post-collapse society.  What institutions and regulation of institutions do we need to restore the progress we all want?  In the context of thinking out policy, Mr. Begg and I were members of the NESC after we sleepwalked into the euro.  Mr. Begg mentioned globalisation, and people are seriously concerned about how to protect a small country such as Ireland from a tsunami of capital that leads to property bubbles.  We had a system that gave no power to devalue, no control over interest rates, no bank regulation, no exit mechanism, not enough fiscal federalism and no anti-tsunami measures for capital flows.  It is interesting how countries like Germany and Canada have managed to survive this and have not gone down the route of debt that has befallen us.  Perhaps the emphasis in this House and in public discourse should be on how to repair institutions.  We have spent a lot of time and money trying to deal with the consequences.<\/p><p>I liked the references from the 1913 period to the solidarity we tried to achieve between working class people in Belfast and in Dublin.  One of Mr. Begg's predecessors in Northern Ireland, Mr. Terry Carlin, did magnificent work at the worst times of the Troubles in trying to keep the workers together and not split along sectarian lines.  I like the idea that institutions are vital to society and should not be dispensed with lightly.  Obviously this refers to what we are speaking about now.  Institutions are important and should redefine themselves and continue the flow of ideas.<\/p><p>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is a nominating body for the Seanad.  Can we expect to see Mr. Begg on these benches introducing his ideas every day rather than on occasional visits?  I would welcome that because I always find what he has to say of the greatest interest and stimulation.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding his appalling industrial relations image, Mr. William Martin Murphy was an entrepreneur of a kind and was widely admired in transport circles for the tram system he ran.  Maybe we need to find more entrepreneurs, as we are always trying to do in industrial policy.  There may be redeeming features that have not yet drawn much attention in the events of 100 years ago.<\/p><p>Mr. Begg's words were a masterful discourse of then and now, ending with blood and tears in Flanders for so many people.  Let us hope we do not do that again.  The revolt in the UK and US Parliaments stopped precipitous wars like the one in which so many trade union members died in 1914.  Public policy goes on, and the contributions to discourse Mr. Begg has brought today and always brings are most valuable and are part of the ambition of civic society.  I thank the Leader and the Cathaoirleach for inviting him and I thank Mr. Begg for his address.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500014#N00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1380107700,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Begg to the House.  I was one of the Senators who proposed that, as the general secretary of Congress, Mr. Begg should address the Seanad to mark the centenary of the Lock-out.  The speech was very good in setting the historical context to allow us to commemorate, remember and pay tribute to working people over the past 100 years and the people involved in the Lock-out for their struggle for workers' rights and the many battles and struggles that took place in Dublin city, across the State and on the island of Ireland.  It is fitting that Mr. Begg, as General Secretary of Congress, addresses the Seanad in the centenary year of the Lock-out.<\/p> <p>The strike by the Dublin transport workers in 1913 was, as we know, the foundation stone for the Irish labour movement.  It was also the foundation stone for that battle for workers' rights in all the years up to the present day.  The radicalism of the Lock-out was seen in the 1916 Rising.  There have been many different analyses and views of the ideologies that underpinned the actions of the employers and workers of that time and the motivation of those engaged in the 1916 Rising.  We need only read the 1916 Proclamation to see that its words were underpinned by socialist and social democratic values, as was the radical programme of the First D&aacute;il.  This must be our beacon of hope: that we can have a better society if we implement the words of the Proclamation to cherish all of the children equally.  The Proclamation promised equality for the people of this State and of this island.  It put equality front and centre.<\/p><p> The Lock-out was characterised by hardship, cruelty, poverty and inhumanity, but in my view these are overshadowed, quite rightly, by the spirit, courage and bravery of the trade union leaders and the workers of the Lock-out.  While it is important in this centenary year to remember, to pay tribute and to commemorate, it is also important to accept the reality that here in Dublin and in this State we still do not have the right to bargain collectively, nor do we have trade union recognition rights.  We owe it to all the people who were involved in that long struggle for workers' rights to make sure that in the centenary year of the Lock-out we enshrine in Irish law the right to collective bargaining and the right to trade union recognition.  I ask for David Begg's opinion on how this can be achieved.<\/p><p> We must also recognise that people being locked out of their jobs and being denied their rights as workers is not confined to 1913.  In recent years we saw what happened to the<b><\/b>Visteon workers in Belfast, the Waterford Crystal workers in Waterford, the Lagan Brick workers on both sides of the Border and the Vita Cortex workers in Cork.  Situations still exist in which working people are denied basic rights.  While it is important to commemorate the great sacrifices made and also the gains made by working people, we must look at the challenges facing working people in the here and now and acknowledge that many working families, not just in Ireland but across Europe and the world, are suffering under austerity policies.<\/p><p> David Begg referred to the political aspects and the fact that in the past decades in this State, 80% of the people have voted for parties of the centre right.  There is a change taking place in Ireland, North and South, which offers opportunities for socialists and social democrats to work together, whether in the political sphere, the trade union sector or the community and voluntary sector.  We have to grasp that opportunity because we must be much more ambitious, as people who are supportive of the labour movement, to ensure that labour and socialist and social democratic policies are those that win out.  I ask for David Begg's opinion on some of those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500014#N00300","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380108300,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I will take the first four Senators who are offering to ask questions, after which Mr. Begg will respond.

I welcome David Begg as a fellow trade unionist.  He has championed the cause of workers for decades.  I had reason to be involved in the trade union movement with David Begg in Telecom &Eacute;ireann and in Eircom.  It was one of the leading companies which showed how partnership in the workplace could function.<\/p><p>Some people like to obliterate the memory of history about certain aspects of our past.  Last week in this House, in a debate about history as a subject in the junior certificate curriculum, I made the point that the first I learned of Larkin and Connolly was not in the classroom but rather from my late uncle, a lifelong trade unionist and Labour Party activist.  David Begg gave an excellent resum&eacute; of the events of 1913.  It might be of interest to him to know that on 27 September 1913, within a few hours of a trade union congress in Clonmel, both Larkin and Connolly visited my home town of Carrick-on-Suir to inspect tenements, which Larkin described as the worst he had seen any place in Europe.  This problem was not confined to Dublin as it was also a problem in rural Ireland.  It is probably a little-known fact - it certainly was not known to Larkin at that time - that his great rival, William O'Brien, was actually living in Carrick-on-Suir at the time as his father was an RIC man.  As David Begg noted, William later moved to Dublin to become a tailor and he become involved in the trade union movement.<\/p><p>In the case of rural Ireland, the unrest led on to the issue of the soviets that were set up by workers across Tipperary - in Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir, Tipperary town and Cahir - and in Waterford, Cork and Limerick when the Cleeve's company unilaterally cut its workers' wages by 33.3%.  We are celebrating the centenary of 1913.  Is it not time this country, the Government and the party of which I am a member, which is in partnership with Fine Gael, introduced legislation for collective bargaining?  Is it not time we commemorated this centenary in a tangible way by bringing forward that legislation?  I ask David Begg to state ICTU's view on that legislation and how it should be shaped.<\/p><p>It was mentioned that William Martin Murphy travelled abroad and that he was an expert on the transport business.  He travelled to America and across Europe.  I wonder, if he had spent some little time studying humanity and human resources when he was abroad, whether David Begg would be addressing the House today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500015#O00300","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1380108300,"counter":56,"content":"<p>I too wish to join in the welcome to David Begg and thank him for his very interesting address.  Like all Members I have plenty to say about how present-day Ireland compares with the Ireland of the 1913 Lock-out.  I refer to areas such as child poverty, socioeconomic disparities, the promotion and protection of economic, social and cultural rights, sub-standard housing and accommodation - Priory Hall and the ghettoisation of direct provision - vested interests, property development and the relationship with banks.  It is interesting to note that at the turn of the 20th century it was lawful to hit one's dog, one's wife and one's child.  Sadly, in 2013 it is still lawful to hit one's child - and arguably, someone else's child - in the absence of an explicit ban on corporal punishment of children in the home and in alternative day-care settings.  This is, perhaps, a subject for a further discussion.  However, it is interesting to highlight the rights of children.<\/p><p>Because of time constraints I will limit my contribution to the following comments.  I commend the ICTU 1913 committee on the Dublin Tenement Experience: Living the Lockout project, which was delivered in collaboration with Dublin City Council and the Irish Heritage Trust.  I met the Irish Heritage Trust this morning and I was informed that the project received a community grant and the trust is looking for a reinstatement of community grants.  In August I had the pleasure of visiting 14 Henrietta Street.  It is no exaggeration to say that I felt completely transported during that hour.  The poverty, disease, desperation, pride, spirit and fight portrayed by the actors were tangible to all present.  Will this become a permanent project, and how can we support it?  The way in which the arts were brought together for such an experience is tremendously powerful, both for the people of Ireland and for visitors to the country.<\/p><p>I was delighted by the decision of Dublin City Council to name the Marlborough Street bridge after Rosie Hackett in recognition of her dedication to the trade union movement and her struggle for workers' rights.  It is very important to recognise the role of women.<\/p> <p>It is also very important to recognise that Rosie Hackett was just a girl of 18 when she helped to organise the strike in protest against the poor working conditions in Jacob's factory.  To galvanise and lead as many as 300 women at such a young age is a remarkable achievement and a testament to the potential of the young to be the driving force behind positive change.  We need to keep this firmly in mind when we speak of youth activism and we see organisations such as SpunOut, which has been in the news this week, the National Youth Council of Ireland and all its member organisations.<\/p><p>Mr. Begg mentioned the figures for those not in education, employment or training, NEETs, which is an obvious concern, as well as the youth guarantee, so what can we do to support this youth activism?  Rosie Hackett was 18 when she was involved in that strike and there are many Rosie Hacketts today that we should support as we look to bring about positive change in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500015#O00400","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380108900,"counter":58,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh Mr. Begg.

He must be a very busy man.  He has gone a long way, which is right, and he has reached the top of the profession.  His early days of negotiation were not that long ago and I witnessed them in my former role working with the ESB.

I have a page of scribbles before me so I will try to confine myself to two questions relating to models of welfare.  Mr. Begg mentioned the failure in Ireland in the initial years of the 20th century to build consensus across the entirety of society.  To what extent would Mr. Begg attribute that to the urban-rural divide that resulted from the land wars in the early 20th century?  For example, the 1913 housing inquiry was mentioned, along with the plight of Dublin workers in particular in the tenements.  At the same time vast quantities of Irish land had been transferred to smallholdings, and it has been suggested this provoked a spirit of conservatism in the country.  With regard to the failure to build consensus with urban workers, the agricultural rural labourers had housing needs met as part of the protest around the land wars in rural Ireland, although there was no similar consensus around the need to deal with people in urban Ireland, including Waterford and other cities and large urban areas.<\/p><p>This type of dominance of the concerns of rural Ireland, according to Professor Tom Garvin, brought a certain style of politics into the country, particularly up to the 1960s.  This can be seen in small ways, as the children of smallholders in rural Ireland had higher participation rates in education than the children of workers due to the supports given to smallholders in particular.  There was also a role for the Church, particularly in the 1920s, when there was a fear of Bolshevism.  To what extent was the model of welfare influenced by the urban-rural divide?<\/p><p>A second question relates to the more modern model of welfare that is emerging in the world at large.  I am referring specifically to the world economic crisis and the impact of globalisation.  Mr. Begg mentioned the issue of transferring risk from the State to the individual.  In both the developed European world and in the emerging economies of south-east Asia, housing, in particular, has been used as a way of providing what is known as &quot;asset-based welfare&quot;.  In other words, individuals would be able to pay for their own needs, particularly those which arise as populations age across the world.  The idea is that people have the assets to pay for their own needs in old age.  Even in Sweden - one of the countries regarded as being among the most equal in the world - they travelled down that path.<\/p><p>In spite of the world financial crisis and a lack of regulation - I believe there was international collusion among governments in this lack of regulation and the promotion of asset-based welfare - to what extent can societies deal with problems, given the mobility of capital in the modern world?  It is very difficult to guarantee excellent jobs when the mobility of capital is such a major factor in the equation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500016#P00300","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1380108900,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Begg to respond.

I am not sure I can do justice to all the comments and questions but I will try to do so.  It may be easier for me to work in reverse and I will respond to Senator Hayden first.<\/p><p>  Her question concerned the urban-rural divide, which is a very significant subject.  Ireland is probably significantly different from many other European countries in that there has been a long delay in the emergence of an industrial working class.  We have never politically held what would be called a &quot;red-green&quot; alliance that was certainly very prominent in Sweden and some other Nordic countries.  There has been a rift, I suppose, which is somewhat unreal, as <i>The Irish Times<\/i> today indicates the number of people in farming who are working in industry at the same time.  This unreal divide has affected our history.<\/p><p>  The issue was most comprehensively addressed by a report which the National Economic and Social Council commissioned in 1992 from Lars Mj&oslash;set, the Norwegian academic, who considered the question of why Ireland had not managed to develop an autocentric system of development in the manner of other European countries.  He dealt with many of the questions raised by the Senator regarding rural and urban sectors, as well as emigration, brain drain and its effects.  He also dealt with the social influence of Catholicism and how that affected what happened in our country.  It is a very big and interesting question.  It is unfortunate that Mj&oslash;set's report in 1992 did not get a great deal of attention, as just after its publication the country began to take off as the Celtic tiger.  The issue could be revisited with some benefit to us all, as it was a very perceptive insight into our position.<\/p><p>  The Senator's second point concerned the emerging welfare model, and there is a really big problem.  As I mentioned, there are some really strong limiting factors concerning demographics and debt, the provision of welfare states and their sustainability.  One could ask what is the basic requirement of a welfare state, which should be to mitigate the risk that all of us are exposed to in daily life.<\/p> <p>Some people can manage to handle that by virtue of their wealth but, in truth, nobody can handle all of the risks.  That is why we need collective action.<\/p><p> In Europe, there is something of a collective action problem at present, even for those advanced welfare states that have insisted that competence on welfare should remain at national, rather than European, level.  The reasons are very understandable.  The Nordic countries, for example, wanted to protect their very good welfare states.  The difficulty, however, is that the structures of the EMU and single currency are centralised in Europe.  Irrespective of whether one agrees with European Central Bank policy, one must conclude it has extraordinary power and independence that are not balanced in any way by any social institution within the Community.  Here we are stuck; there is a decision trap for us in Europe.  Unless we find some way of unravelling it, we will not be able to make the type of social progress we would wish to make to complement whatever economic progress is made.  This is an extremely interesting question.<\/p><p> I thank the Senator for the remarks on the tenement museum.  It would be very desirable to try to make it permanent, if possible.  Our idea is that, as we approach 1916, the story could evolve.  I do not know whether many Senators have had the opportunity to visit the museum.  It is a bit different in that some scenes from 1913 are re-enacted by a theatre group.  They expose the tensions among families.  In the more recent piece about 1913, there was a scene about the tension between a man who was deeply involved with Larkin and the strike and his brother, who signed the pledge.  Further tensions that we all know about may be included.  They obviously culminate in the civil war.  In educational terms, the museum can be very useful.  We were extremely pleased with it and what it achieved in the short time it was in existence.  If we can arrange finance for it, we will certainly try to keep it going.<\/p><p> I absolutely agree on youth unemployment, a most appalling problem.  The real danger is that a whole generation will be affected.  I doubt that any person present in this room is unaffected by it.  My nephew had to go to the United States last week to try to find employment.  He was the first person in my extended family who had to do so.  This is happening in thousands of houses every day of the week.  It really is a very difficult problem.<\/p><p> Senator Landy referred to collective bargaining and its shape. In this regard, Senator Bacik addressed the crucial question, namely, the definition of collective bargaining in the first instance.  Their lordships in the Supreme Court adopted a very strange definition.  They said there should not be an industrial relations definition of collective bargaining but a dictionary definition.  The dictionary, however, states collective bargaining is defined in terms of the ILO conventions, which is crucial.<\/p><p> It is very much necessary to build in genuine protection for people involved in organising activity.  Any employer with pockets deep enough will take the hit of paying two years' salary, or whatever, to dismiss someone.  There should be a really effective instrument whereby the courts can protect a person's job and ensure he is not victimised in that way.<\/p><p> The original attempts in the 2001 and 2004 Acts were quite good attempts to sort out the issue.  Many might have called them an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  They worked after a fashion but not everybody bought into the solution, and that is why we ended up in the Supreme Court.  I hope we will be able to address this successfully.  I am hopeful legislation on this will emerge before the end of the year.  Senator David Cullinane addressed this.  Everybody recognises that this year brings with it a certain drive in this regard.  However, I am not under any illusion that it will be easily agreed upon by all the parties concerned.  The most important point is that whatever is done on this occasion should be real and enduring.  It should not really be some kind of fix-up that will fall apart at the first legal challenge.<\/p><p> I thank Senator Barrett very much for his comments.  We had very good dialogue when he was a member of NESC and I enjoyed his contributions to the body.  In many ways, we came from somewhat different perspectives but the dialogue was very fruitful.  We certainly miss the Senator in this regard.  One of the problems with NESC at present is that it is something of a stranded asset.  In the period during which is constituted the intellectual underpinning of the social partnership model, it had a much more defined role than at present.  What will happen in this regard I really do not know.<\/p><p> The Senator asked whether we sleepwalked into the EMU.  Let me admit very honestly that it did not dawn on me that, in the event of an external economic shock, the full burden of adjustment would be borne by workers.  If one considers everything drawn up on this at the time, one will note that the most influential paper was probably the 1996 ESRI commentary.  This does not come out very clearly.  I do not know the extent to which all the policymakers knew what occurred was likely to be the case.  I believe Ireland entered the process without understanding fully what the discipline of monetary union actually meant.  In countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium, and even Denmark, which is not a member but which is joined at the hip, everything is done with one eye on Germany.  We did not look at it that way but just proceeded to do our own thing.  We did not really realise just how serious all of that was.  Sometimes I am inclined to say Ireland's relationship with Europe has been a little like the Irish breakfast.  We conceive of ourselves as a bit like the hen in that we were involved in the breakfast.  Very shortly, however, we will be like the pig, that is, very deeply committed.  I refer to getting to the stage of a much more deeply integrated union when the institutional structure of the EMU is developed fully and finally.  I am assuming that what I describe will be the ultimate outcome if the single currency stays.<\/p><p> Senator Fiach Mac Conghail spoke about the necessity for truth.  That is a very good point.  Perhaps we can now begin to look at the events of 100 years ago stripped of the myths that we have all grown up with.  It just occurs to me how matters evolved in Ireland.  <i>The Informer<\/i>, by Liam O'Flaherty, was published in 1925.  The key figure in it, a man called Gypo Nolan, a member of a communist party cell in Dublin, is involved with a guy called McPhillips who has messed up an operation and has managed to kill someone.  Nolan informs on McPhillips.  That is the story in the book but the film of the same name has Nolan running from the IRA, not from a communist cell.  A sort of cultural transition took place.  Many events of this kind happened and we should examine them frankly.  The truth of the matter is that, irrespective of how heroic, brave, wonderful or bad these people were, they were all human beings like ourselves and all had flaws.<\/p><p> Let me address the idea of Northern Ireland.  Senator O'Sullivan asked whether we did enough to deal with sectarianism in Northern Ireland.  I want to relate this to a point Senator Cummins made.  He spoke about the Waterford connection and the Redmonds.<\/p> <p>One of the things we have been able to do in recent years is to take some people from the Protestant working class areas of Belfast, such as Mount Vernon, and bring them, along with some of their Nationalist fellow workers, to the Peace Village in Messines in Belgium.  There is a very interesting story about Messines and Major William Redmond, who was a member of the 16th (Irish) Division which fought alongside the 36th (Ulster) Division.  In one of the battles, William Redmond was injured and the man who rescued him was John Meeke, a Protestant from the 36th (Ulster) Division.  Meeke managed to pull him back behind their own lines and get him some treatment but Redmond was so badly injured that he died several hours later.  Major Redmond had a particular view on the reasons why he was involved in the conflict.  He did not want to be seen as someone who was supporting the British war machine and left instructions that he should not be buried in a military cemetery.  His grave is just outside the cemetery in Messines.  Ironically, Meeke, who survived for three years afterwards before eventually succumbing to his injuries, died outside the period of time when he could be legitimately buried within the military cemetery.  That was his aspiration.  He wanted to be buried there but could not be.  Between those two characters there is an extraordinary historical bind, which is quite different from how many people in Northern Ireland perceive their heritage.  Work like that can be quite useful.  My colleague in Northern Ireland, Peter Bunting, has done quite a lot of work in this area, much of which is below the radar.  Because of its nature, it has to be kept below the radar.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik referred to the question of voluntarism in industrial relations.  We have a conundrum here because the voluntarist system worked very well when everybody wanted it to work.  When we get to a point in any system at which the first recourse is to the courts, then we begin to migrate into a more legalistic system.  We have not really found the correct water level for all of that.  However, in the course of this legislation, if it is forthcoming, that issue will have to be addressed.<\/p><p>Yesterday the Central Bank launched a &euro;15 coin to commemorate 1913.  The launch took place in the museum in Glasnevin Cemetery, which is a beautiful facility.  The irony is that if one looks out the window of the upper floor of that museum, one can see the graves of both James Larkin and William Martin Murphy.  That speaks of what a tragedy the Lock-out was.  It begs the question of why people should not try to agree.  Should the lesson for us be that we must figure out ways of having some national agreement about the distribution of wealth in the country, rather than resorting to zero-sum conflicts?  That is what our Nordic friends and, particularly, countries such as the Netherlands have managed to achieve.  They have very deeply embedded institutions for that purpose.  That is why I feel that institutions are so important.<\/p><p>In response to the Senator's key question, Congress has no position on the future of the Seanad.  My personal position is that institutions of a political and labour market nature are always important in a country and should not be dispensed with unless and until one is absolutely sure there is no purpose to be served by continuing with them, or they cannot be adjusted into a better set of circumstances.  It strikes me that in our new relationship with Europe, to which I referred earlier, we will have to become very deeply involved in a way that the Oireachtas has not been before.  There is a big difference in the way, for example, the Danish Parliament has handled Europe and the way the Irish Parliament has handled it.  In that context, there is a strong case for some institution of the Parliament, whatever it might be, to be much more deeply involved and engaged with Europe, in examining the European questions coming our way, bearing in mind our future role as the pig in these relationships.<\/p><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach again.

As Senators will be aware, the introduction of protected disclosures legislation in this jurisdiction has a long history.  It is worth recalling that it was as long ago as 1999 that my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, introduced a Private Members' Bill proposing the introduction of a regime for the protection of whistleblowers.  Although initially accepted by the then Government, it had a long and tortuous passage, only to be eventually dropped as a Government priority in 2004.  By 2006 the Government of the day had decided to deal with the issue on a sectoral basis, but, as we are all aware, this resulted over time in an incomplete, uneven and patchy framework of protections.  I am pleased to be able to say the Bill I am introducing today fulfils a commitment in the programme for Government to introduce whistleblower legislation and reflects commitments I have made on several occasions to introduce a single overarching framework of protections for workers in all sectors, public and private.<\/p><p>The Bill addresses what has been identified as a significant gap in Ireland&rsquo;s anti-corruption framework, highlighted, in particular, in the final report of the Mahon tribunal which recommended the introduction of pan-sectoral whistleblower protection legislation.  It also addresses the significant issue highlighted in the Nyberg report on Ireland&rsquo;s banking crisis that those expressing contrarian views risked sanctions and potential loss of employment.<\/p><p>The Bill which closely reflects international best practice provides a detailed and comprehensive statutory framework within which workers can raise concerns regarding possible serious wrongdoing, knowing that protections are available if they are subject to penalisation by their employer.  The legislation provides a safety net.  If no penalisation occurs, there need be no recourse to the legal protections.  Where such protections are required, they will be available under this legislation.  The Bill provides, as I have stated, a single overarching framework protecting whistleblowers in a uniform manner in all sectors of the economy.  It substantially replaces the patchwork of protections in particular areas which has resulted heretofore in a fragmented, partial and incomplete standard of protection for whistleblowing.<\/p><p>A key feature of the legislation is the protection afforded for a disclosure made on the basis of a reasonable belief, even if it ultimately proves to be incorrect.  No protection is provided for a disclosure determined to have been made without a reasonable belief, for example, for a deliberately or recklessly made false report.  The Bill introduces a framework which seeks to regulate whistleblowing in the best interests of the whistleblower, his or her employer and in the public interest of having concerns of serious wrongdoing reported and investigated.  It is intended that this will support and encourage disclosures being made to the person best equipped to examine and resolve the issue, for example, an employer or an appropriate public body.  Whistleblowing into the public domain will, however, be facilitated under the legislation where particular conditions are met.<\/p><p>The Bill provides for a stepped disclosure regime in which a number of distinct disclosure channels are available, namely, internal disclosure to an employer, externally to a prescribed person, or potentially into the public domain where the circumstances are such that this may be warranted.  As a consequence of the conditionalities associated with external disclosure, it is anticipated that the simplest form of disclosure &ndash; to an employer - will be availed of most frequently.  The threshold for a report to an employer is set at a relatively low level in order that, most importantly, a worker can make such a report on a no-fault basis.  There is a clear public interest in the making of such reports in order that any real or possible wrongdoing can be addressed and ameliorated at the earliest possible stage.<\/p><p>One of the main objectives of the legislation is to provide protection for workers who suffer detriment for having reported wrongdoing.  The protections set out in the Bill fall into two broad categories: protection for employees from penalisation by employers and from suffering detriment as a consequence of the actions of others.  In the case of penalisation by an employer, an employee will have access to the normal industrial relations machinery or, in the case of dismissal, the protections of the Unfair Dismissals Acts, regardless of length of service.  In the case of the broader category of worker defined under the Bill, where a worker, including a contractor who has no employer, suffers detriment as a consequence of the actions of any person other than the employer, he or she will, among other things, have a capacity to take an action for damages in tort.  Workers who make protected disclosures will also be provided with a defence against criminal proceedings, as well as a wide immunity from civil liability.<\/p><p>As I have highlighted, the Bill is designed to support and encourage disclosures being made to the person best equipped at the lowest level to examine and resolve the issue, namely, the employer.  It is appropriate, therefore, that arrangements should be such that any wrongdoing raised by a worker with his or her employer should, as much as possible, be satisfactorily dealt with at a local level and that the issue of a worker having to seek recourse to the protections should represent the exception rather than the norm.  With this in mind, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton has, following a request from me, asked the Labour Relations Commission to prepare a code of conduct for employers and employees which will set out practical matters as to how a disclosure might be made and how an employer ought to handle such a disclosure upon its receipt.  Work on the preparation of the code will commence in the near future and, with good will from all concerned, it is to be expected that the code will ensure that in the majority of cases where the issue of a protected disclosure arises, the matter will be resolved in a satisfactory manner without recourse to the legislation.<\/p> <p>I am satisfied this Bill represents a significant step forward in the framework of existing protections for workers, while at the same reflecting best international practice in whistleblower protection legislation.  It takes a fair, balanced and proportionate approach which will ensure Ireland&rsquo;s international reputation in preventing corruption is significantly enhanced.  <\/p><p>I would now like to turn to the specifics of the Bill and present a brief outline of its main provisions.  Part 1 provides for the date of the coming into operation of the Bill, a review of the legislation after a period of five years, the interpretation of a number of terms and the standard provisions for expenses incurred.  It is my intention that the legislation will be commenced immediately on its enactment.  Section 1 sets out the Short Title to the Bill.  Section 2 provides for a review of the legislation after a period of five years and the presentation of a report to the Oireachtas.  Section 3 sets out the interpretations and definitions used in the Bill.  Section 4 is a standard provision providing for expenses incurred by the Minister.<\/p><p>Part 2 establishes the concept of a protected disclosure, on the wrongdoing that can be reported, the persons to whom reports can be made and the details of the stepped disclosure regime.  Section 5 provides that a protected disclosure is a disclosure of &ldquo;relevant information&rdquo;.  Information is relevant information if in the reasonable belief of the worker it shows or tends to show one or more of the relevant wrongdoings.  A broad range of relevant wrongdoings, the proper reporting of which will attract the protections, are set out.  <\/p><p>Section 6 provides for the first step in the stepped disclosures regime, namely, a disclosure to an employer or another person where the matter falls within the area of responsibility of that person.  A disclosure to an employer simply requires a reasonable belief on the part of the worker that it shows or tends to show one or more of the relevant wrongdoings.  As this is the simplest form of disclosure to make, it is anticipated that this will be the most commonly used.  We will provide clear guidelines on how it should happen.<\/p><p>Section 7 provides for the second step in the stepped disclosure regime, namely, an external disclosure to a person prescribed by the Minister.  A statutory instrument will be required and examples of prescribed bodies could include the Health Information and Quality Authority, the Health and Safety Authority, the National Consumer Agency and the many other bodies and agencies which have responsibility for regulation.  In the case of a disclosure under this section, a worker must have a reasonable belief in the substantial truth of the matters disclosed.  This is a step up from the simpler reasonable belief requirement in the case of a disclosure to an employer.  Section 8 provides that a disclosure by an employee of a public body may be made to the appropriate Minister with responsibility for that public body.  Section 9 provides that a disclosure made in the course of obtaining legal advice from a barrister, solicitor or trade union official shall be protected.<\/p><p>Section 10 provides for the third step in the stepped disclosure regime, namely, an external disclosure to another body or individual such as a member of the media.  If the protections are to be attracted to such a wider form of external disclosure, even stronger qualifying criteria must be met.  In addition to the substantial truth requirement, the disclosure must not have been made for personal gain and at least one of the following conditions must be met: the worker must have reasonably believed he or she would be victimised if the matter had been raised either internally or with a prescribed person; there was no prescribed regulator and the worker reasonably believed the evidence was likely to be concealed or destroyed if the disclosure was made to the employer; or the concern had already been raised with the employer or a prescribed person and that the wrongdoing is of an exceptionally serious nature.<\/p><p>Part 3 establishes the nature of the protections.  In a case of dismissal, the protections of the Unfair Dismissals Acts, without the usual exceptions and with increased compensation, will be available.  In the case of a penalisation falling short of dismissal, the worker may seek access to the standard industrial relations machinery.  Other important provisions in this Part provide for a right of action if a third party causes detriment to the worker or another person because a protected disclosure was made; immunity against civil proceedings; a defence against criminal prosecution; and the protection of the discloser&rsquo;s identity.  Section 11 amends the Unfair Dismissals Act 1997 in order that its protections will on a day one basis be available to employees dismissed for having made a protected disclosure.  The compensation payable is increased to a period of five years.  On considering this aspect of the Bill, I felt a new employee who saw something egregiously wrong should not have to wait for six months before enjoying the protections of the Bill.<\/p><p>Section 12 prohibits an employer from penalising or threatening penalties against an employee or from causing or permitting any other person to penalise or threaten penalties against an employee for having made a protected disclosure.  If penalised, the worker may seek access to the standard industrial relations machinery.  The compensation payable is increased to a period of five years.  Section 13 provides for a right of action if a third party causes detriment either to the worker or another person because a protected disclosure was made.  The term &ldquo;detriment&rdquo; is widely defined.  <\/p><p>Section 14 provides immunity against civil proceedings.  It amends the Defamation Act 2009 with a view to ensuring a statement made under a protected disclosure will have qualified privilege under that Act.  Section 15 provides a defence to criminal prosecution for an offence related to disclosure of information.  This section is necessary to overcome the many provisions relating to non-disclosure in other legislation.  <\/p><p>Section 16 imposes a duty on persons handling protected disclosures to protect the identity of the discloser.  The necessary and pragmatic exceptions to that duty are also set out.  A person who suffers loss as a result of a failure to maintain confidentiality of identity may pursue an action for damages. <\/p><p>Part 4 sets out further conditions associated with the external disclosure of a particularly sensitive class of information relating to law enforcement, security, defence or international relations.  Disclosure can continue to be made to the employer in the normal fashion, but the issue of external disclosure is covered.  Section 17 sets out a number of conditions that must be satisfied in addition to those in section 10 for an external disclosure of information relating to law enforcement matters.  An external disclosure of such information can only be made to a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or, if it contains taxpayer information, the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p><p>Section 18 sets out the conditions that apply in the case of an external  disclosure of information that could adversely affect the State&rsquo;s security, defence or international relations.  The only external person to whom a disclosure of information may be made is the disclosure recipient whose role and functions are described in Schedule 2.  <\/p><p>Section 19 provides for the making of regulations covering protected disclosures by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  and the securing of redress where a member has been penalised or threatened with penalties for having made a protected disclosure.  While these regulations will be specific to the force, the protections available to members of the force will, I am assured, reflect the broad thrust of those available to all other workers.  Section 20 provides for an amendment to the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act of 2004 allowing the Defence Forces Ombudsman to receive and investigate external disclosures from members of the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>Part 5 provides for the establishment of internal procedures by public bodies, a prohibition on protected disclosure gagging clauses in contracts and the amendment of a number of existing legislative provisions.  Section 21 requires every public body to establish and maintain internal procedures for dealing with protected disclosures.  Section 22 prohibits the contracting out of the protections provided under the Bill and is designed to prevent employers from preventing workers by way of gagging clauses from seeking its protections.<\/p> <p> Schedule 1 sets out the redress provisions in respect of a penalisation falling short of a dismissal and reflects the existing standard provisions of the industrial relations dispute mechanisms.  Schedule 2 establishes the office and functions of the disclosures recipient.  Schedule 3 sets out amendments to a total of 16 sectoral Acts and one statutory instrument containing diverse whistleblowing-type provisions.<\/p><p>I am conscious that although this is a relatively short Bill, certain elements are, at first read, complex enough in nature.  I have dealt with its provisions in summary here today and I am happy to expand on any of its provisions during the course of the debate.  If Senators wish to raise any particular issues I will be happy to have them examined in detail.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of Senators during the debate and I hope the Seanad will support the passage of what I believe is long-awaited and absolutely essential legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500019#S00700","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380111900,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

It is not in Deputy Bruton's better nature to be at the type of activity he is at.  He has been forced to do it by the Taoiseach as far as I can see.  It is a pity the Taoiseach does not do his own dirty work in a debate on RTE.<\/p><p>We in Fianna F&aacute;il welcome the legislation.  We support the principles of the Bill, which represents an advance on the piecemeal sectoral approach to whistleblowing.  I accept a pan-sectoral approach is needed, but it is not fair to dismiss entirely many of the improvements that have occurred in the area of whistleblowing in particular sectors in recent years.  They are not the answer and are not sufficient, but quite a number of reporting obligations in general have been imposed, particularly with regard to the knowledge of tax professionals, theft and fraud legislation and children.  None of this is entirely satisfactory or takes from the fact the Minister is correct in stating that an across-the-board provision is necessary at this stage.  We accept this, and it is one of the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal report. The Nyberg report also mentions it.  The Nyberg report was greeted with huge disappointment when it was published, particularly by the media and many in government at the time.  As the Minister acknowledged last night, the Nyberg report is a wealth of information, recommendations and pointers as to where the country went wrong.  It is about time the report, which was instigated by the previous Government, was acknowledged for what it is, namely, a pretty damning indictment of what went on under the previous Government and in society in general.  Let us make no bones about it.<\/p><p>As the Minister rightly pointed out, one of the issues to which Nyberg referred was the dangers to which people holding contrary views expose themselves.  On this point, I enjoyed listening to Mr. Tony Spollen on the radio yesterday.  He has moved on to other things.  We remember very clearly all of the whistleblowers over the years because there have been so few of them.  They came before committees and to public prominence because they revealed information.  In some cases, such as that of Tony Spollen, it was part of his job as an internal auditor, and such people already have professional obligations.  I use the term &quot;whistleblowing&quot; but I am conscious it may not be the correct term.  This was an issue raised at the pre-legislative hearings.  It is seen as a somewhat pejorative term but it is the generally accepted term.  I wish to emphasise that I do not mean to be pejorative in using it.<\/p><p>Nobody expects whistleblowers to jump out of every company and organisation in the land but it is to be hoped the Bill will mean that people who feel an obligation to blow the whistle will do so.  Those who are willing to reveal information that it is necessary to reveal are very important.  Since 2007, Transparency International Ireland has highlighted the absence of blanket safeguards and this was also highlighted by the report of the Mahon tribunal and the Nyberg report as a reason for low levels of reporting in Irish banks, the health service and public bodies.  We saw the case of Louise Bayliss, who temporarily lost her job after she spoke out about the needs of female psychiatric patients.  In the course of our work as Oireachtas Members many of us meet people with serious concerns about how things happen in various organisations but who conclude the meetings by stating that one cannot quote them, for very obvious reasons.  There is a level of fear that their honesty and public-mindedness in bringing forward such information could get them into trouble.<\/p><p>What are the Minister's views on the pre-legislative scrutiny in the Oireachtas which concluded in July 2012?  Did it have an impact on the drafting of the Bill?  Approximately a year passed between the finalisation of the report and the publication of the Bill.  It is a key part of the alleged reforms introduced by the Government.  It happened with this Bill and I wonder whether it was useful to the Minister.  What are the Minister's views on the time it takes committees to deal with the new procedure imposed by the Government?  I am not convinced they have time.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform is meeting at present and I am absent.  I am sure it will be recorded in a newspaper that I was absent, but I am here.  Committees already have a huge burden and I do not know whether they have the structures or resources to do the work they already have with regard to pre-legislative scrutiny.  Legislative scrutiny is far better done in the Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly on Committee Stage when one goes through a Bill line by line.  We are discussing the general principles of the Bill and the need for it, and I on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il offer full support for it, but the detailed scrutiny will be done on Committee Stage.  If my understanding is correct, the Minister had his own public consultation process, after which the Oireachtas committee had another public consultation process.  The process is developing and we are in its early stages, but I am concerned about whether it duplicates the Department's process and whether it has any value.  The jury is out.  The Government would have been wiser to see how it worked with some Bills before announcing it for all legislation.  I am not sure whether it is necessary for all Bills but I am certainly willing to listen to the Minister's views on it.<\/p><p>We fully support the Bill.  The passage of the legislation, in whatever form it takes ultimately, will send out a message that Ireland is changing and we are beginning to learn the lessons of the crisis.  The Labour Party would not agree because its members called for this legislation when in opposition, but as a nation we were embarrassed into introducing the Bill because of the Mahon tribunal, the Nyberg report and all of the scandals that occurred in banking and the local authorities.  I acknowledge the work done by the Minister and his colleagues.  This is not to say we do not have any whistleblowing whatsoever.  Numerous professionals have significant obligations to report wrongdoing and these have led to improvements in compliance, particularly with regard to the tax code.<\/p><p>The application across the board of protected disclosures is welcome.  We support it and I wish the Minister all the best with the Bill.  I look forward to a more detailed debate, section by section, on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500021#U00400","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1380111900,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The Bill will establish a detailed and comprehensive legislative framework protecting whistleblowers in all sectors of the economy.<\/p> <p>This Bill represents a positive step in our programme for political reform.  We have tackled corruption head-on in our term in office.  The legislation will provide a robust statutory framework within which workers can now raise concerns regarding potential wrongdoing that has come to their attention in the workplace, knowing that this new legislation is there to protect them.<\/p><p>We set out our stall before the last general election by stating we would deal with whistleblower protection and this Bill is honouring the commitment we gave in that programme for Government.  The Mahon tribunal and other inquiries highlighted the need for comprehensive legislation and the Protected Disclosures Bill addresses the concerns that were raised in such inquiries.  The Minister has consulted with the finance committee, Transparency Ireland and groups like IBEC and ICTU.  I believe we have come up with an agreed way forward in this Bill that addresses the concerns but balances the needs of all parties.<\/p><p>The Bill provides for compensation of up to a maximum of five years' remuneration, which can be awarded in the case of an unfair dismissal for having made a protected disclosure.  Limitations relating to the length of service that usually apply in the case of unfair dismissals are set aside in the case of protected disclosures.  These measures are important.  The old saying still holds true today: bad things happen when good people do nothing.  This legislation will allow people to do what is right.  It will allow people to speak up and will contribute to a culture where corruption and wrongdoing are seen as unacceptable.

I commend the Minister on his efforts and I welcome the Bill.<\/p><p>I have one query for the Minister on the code of practice, which is to commence in the near future whereas the Minister expressed the hope the Bill would commence immediately on its enactment.

I want to begin by saying how brilliant it is to have the Bill before us today and to note, like my colleague, Senator Byrne, that it is being initiated in the Seanad.  I commend the Minister for putting in place a significant plank of the political reform agenda that is contained in the programme for Government, and one I very much agree with.  The Minister talked about the Bill as comprehensive whistleblower protection across all sectors of the economy and as addressing a significant gap in Ireland's legal framework for combating corruption, which I believe it does.<\/p><p>  When reviewing the Bill, I thought it a product of an exemplary process of law-making, which included the heads of Bill, the general scheme, referral to the committee, the Minister's exchange with the committee, its request for submissions and public hearings and its issuing of the report back to the Minister.  I read the report while preparing for this debate and I note that the committee's report, not unlike other reports coming from the committee on pre-legislative scrutiny, identifies issues that could be addressed in the drafting of legislation.  That is different from making recommendations in regard to aspects of the legislation.  I sometimes wonder whether it would be better for us to have the opportunity within committee work to make recommendations as distinct from merely noting issues that need to be addressed.  This would encourage a more robust analysis and a need to come to a better consensus on certain issues.  That said, it was done and brought to the Minister's Department, which then conducted a regulatory impact analysis prior to the putting in place of the legislation.  There is also the Minister's commitment to review the legislation after a five-year period.  All of that is a terrific process of law-making which has contributed to the quality of the Bill.<\/p><p>  It is an improvement on the heads of Bill and is a signal that greater transparency and accountability is encouraged in Irish life.  Some of the improvements since the heads of Bill stage include the removal of varying degrees of evidential burden or the levels of belief placed on the whistleblower, depending on whom the disclosure is made to.  The Bill still incorporates some of these but others have been removed, which is positive.  As the Minister said in his speech, it is based on the general standard for the disclosure of information being that it is based on a &quot;reasonable belief&quot;.  Section 10 adds another level to this, in that the disclosure must be shown to have &quot;substantial truth&quot;.  However, there is no definition in the legislation of &quot;reasonable belief&quot; nor of what &quot;substantial truth&quot; means.  Both of these phrases will be open to interpretation by the courts.  Would it not make more sense to define these terms within the legislation, particularly to assist workers in understanding the legislation?<\/p><p>  A further improvement has been made in regard to the protection of whistleblowers from the unscrupulous action of their employers following a disclosure, which is a strengthening of the position since the heads of the Bill were published.  The broader definition of the worker, to which the Minister referred in his speech, is positive and allows for a range of those in employment to be covered by the legislation.  However, I have some concerns about a number of general issues.  Perhaps the most important one concerns the purpose of the legislation.  The legislation must be a clear signal to encourage people to come forward where they have information on wrongdoing.  If this is kept as an overarching principle, it will have a positive impact on the operation of the legislation.  If, instead, the view is given that the State is trying to regulate, restrict or penalise whistleblowers, then it will not have that same strong effect in its operation of promoting transparency in the country.<\/p><p>  I believe the legislation could benefit from a statement of purpose or principle.  Clearly, there are a number of principles that underpin the legislation, such as the need to maintain public confidence in the institutions of the State through transparency and accountability, the primacy of the public interest over the loyalty to an employer, the need to prevent corruption and the need to promote sound corporate governance.  As the Minister is aware, the courts tend to use the Long Title of the legislation as a point of analysis.  From that perspective, I believe the Bill could benefit from a statement of principles or an expansion of the Long Title to clarify its purpose.  This is particularly important given there is no definition of &quot;public interest&quot; contained in the Bill, even though it is mentioned in the Title.<\/p><p>  I am also concerned about the level of complexity contained in the Bill, to which the Minister referred.  Of course, I am aware that legislation, by its nature, is bound to be somewhat complicated.  However, in the case of this Bill, it is especially important that anyone who may potentially be a whistleblower understands what he or she can and cannot do.  A particularly striking example of this is the definition of what is a protected disclosure in section 5, which states: &quot;For the purposes of this Act &#8220;protected disclosure&#8221; means, subject to <i>subsection (6)<\/i> and <i>sections 17<\/i> and <i>18<\/i>, a disclosure of relevant information made by a worker in accordance with <i>section 6, 7, 8, 9<\/i> or <i>10<\/i>.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500022#V00200","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1380112500,"counter":82,"content":"<p>That is why we are drawing up a code of practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500022#V00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1380112500,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Perhaps that is true, and perhaps the Minister could say a little more on that.  I suggest that this level of cross-referencing in the Bill makes it very complicated to understand exactly what a protective disclosure is.  By contrast, the UK's Public Interest Disclosure Act amended version lists all of the necessary information in one section.<\/p> <p>It also defines protected disclosure and the persons to whom it needs to be made in order for it to be protected.  I urge the Minister to look at that when considering comparative law<\/p><p>Another issue I want to bring to the Minister's attention is the fact that the Bill does not contain any provisions for oversight by a State body.  He will probably be aware that the Irish Human Rights Commission in its comments on the heads of the Bill recommended that consideration be given to empowering an independent mechanism, such as the Standards in Public Office Commission, to monitor complaints so as to ensure that any systemic issues, especially as complaints come forward within or across public services, are identified and to ensure that whistleblowers are not victimised.  Good international practice points to the involvement of either an ombudsman or a national human rights institution as a point of reference for whistleblowers who need support in making a disclosure.<\/p><p>I would like the Minister to say a little more about the code of practice as I have some concerns that the legislation lacks a requirement for the creation of guidelines.  We need a provision for the creation of guidelines and for an explanation of the legislation in light of its complexity.  The Minister has called for a code of practice, but is there any legislative basis for that?  What approach will be taken to a code of practice?  It could be formulaic, but it also has the potential to be educational and to raise awareness.  I have concerns in this regard.  The code of practice or guidelines must ensure that workers will know transparency is encouraged, what the process for whistleblowing is and their legislative rights.<\/p><p>There are some other issues, but I will raise them on Committee Stage.  I welcome this legislation, which provides us with a comprehensive framework for dealing with whistleblowing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500022#V00400","speaker":"1176","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380113100,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I welcome the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 as a very necessary and detailed legislative framework which will protect whistleblowers across all stratifications of the workforce.  There is no doubt that the details within the Bill are necessary reforms to the law and that they will encourage employees to come forward with reports of suspected wrongdoing within their place of employment while at the same time shielding those employees for disclosures they believe to be in the public interest.<\/p><p>As the Minister and I know, this legislation very much formed a key part of Labour Party policy and our political reform agenda.  We fought the last general election on a reform platform.  It is great to have a Minister from the Labour Party, like Deputy Howlin, spearheading this important piece of legislative armour.  While we reflect on all that has happened in our recent political and economic history, it is arguable that had this very important piece of legislation been enacted before now, we might have combated the kind of corruption we have seen within the various sectors in Ireland which ultimately led to our collapse.<\/p><p>The essence of this legislation is that it protects those whistleblowers who speak out against wrongdoing or cover-ups, whether in the public or private sector.  The problem until now has been that when a person knows something about wrongdoing in their workplace, they are confronted with a plethora of reasons not to disclose details further, such as the prospect of isolation, or more seriously, the risk of prosecution for breaching laws relating to government secrets.  Indeed, the response to the actions of Edward Snowden serves as a very public demonstration to whistleblowers as to why they should not reveal any secrets.<\/p><p>This legislation ameliorates this occupational hazard in that it provides a robust statutory framework that allows workers to raise concerns regarding potential wrongdoing in their place of work, safe in the knowledge that they can avail of significant employment and other protections if they are penalised by their employer or suffer any detriment for doing so.  In particular, the identity of the whistleblower is protected under the Bill and the person to whom the protected disclosure was made must take all reasonable steps to ensure any information that may reveal the identity of the whistleblower is not disclosed, thus placing the onus on the confidante.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding this, there are circumstances where the identity of the whistleblower may be disclosed, including where the whistleblower agrees to the disclosure of their identity, as well as other defined circumstances within the Act.  This framework is ostensibly pro-whistleblower and seeks to ensure that workers the length and breadth of the country are encouraged to raise any concern with his or her employer in the first instance, where she or he reasonably believes that the information being disclosed shows or tends to show wrongdoing.<\/p><p>Other relevant provisions in the Bill include compelling public bodies to establish procedures for handling protected disclosures, the prohibition on opt-out clauses or other clauses that preclude the application of the Bill or provide for an action for breach of contract regarding the making of a protected disclosure, as well as amendments to other pieces of primary and secondary legislation.  However, it must be pointed out that while the Bill has universal application, it has no effect on existing immunities, privileges or defences.  Whistleblowers can be safe in the knowledge that the legislation contained in the Bill reflects international best practice recommendations on whistleblower protections made by the G20, the OECD, the UN and the Council of Europe.  It is great that we have these recommendations and that the Bill follows them to the letter.<\/p><p>The Minister outlined some of the key features of the Bill, but I will not go into detail on those as he has given a succinct explanation of them.  However, we must be mindful that many businesses, private and public, will try to circumvent this legislation in so far as they can.  No doubt, they will develop some sort of internal procedures for handling disclosures to ensure that any problems are fixed before they become public knowledge.  While they may feel this is necessary and while I welcome the Minister's comments regarding a code of conduct, it is imperative the unions would disseminate a charter of rights for whistleblowers and employers so that both parties are fully apprised of the legal circumstances and the situation in the event that either party needs to avail of this legislation.<\/p><p>There is no doubt this legislation shows the Government is serious about accountability and integrity.  At the end of the day, insiders know things about their organisation that outsiders can never find out.  This Bill is a huge advancement from the previous piecemeal approach, where there was no reasonable standardised protections for whistleblowers.   Indeed, compared to the previous situation where whistleblowers had no protection at all, this is an historic and meaningful step. The Bill will provide much-needed guidance to a whistleblowers across all sectors in Ireland and it will do much to restore Ireland's integrity and international esteem in combating corruption.  The Bill will also do much to restore international esteem and Ireland's integrity in regard to combating corruption.<\/p><p>On behalf of the Labour Party group in the Seanad, I thank the Minister for moving so quickly to bring this Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas and implement it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500023#W00200","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1380113100,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I welcome the Bill and agree with the comments just made by Senator Higgins.<\/p><p>  I welcome any Bill in the area of whistleblower protection.  I particularly welcome the fact that workers who are victimised for whistleblowing could receive up to five years pay in compensation under new legislation.  However, what goes unsaid in many whistleblower cases is that employers can come to settlements behind the scenes with employees who want to whistleblow.  We are all aware also of situations where whistleblowers are blacklisted by employers.  In a small country like Ireland, this is a massive issue.  Indeed, I remember well the ordeal that one bank brave bank employee, the AIB auditor, Tony Spollen, had to go through in public as part of the DIRT inquiry.  His integrity was attacked and he was called &quot;childish&quot;.  However, he was vindicated after much personal pain and the Revenue Commissioners eventually collected almost &euro;1 billion.<\/p><p>  Will the Minister elaborate on whether the Government has any figures on how State bodies have effectively gagged former employees?  I would be very interested to hear the views of other Senators on this.  This sort of retaliation is at the nub of the issue.  How do we tackle this and how do we get people to come forward in the real world?  First, to put this in context, we must remember that financial regulators all over the world failed to out wrongdoing before 2008.  Thus there is a big move towards whistleblowing.  We must remember that, as <i>The Economist<\/i>  points out, tips are by far the leading source of fraud detection.  I believe, whether we like it or not, that compensation is the core issue in regard to whistleblowing.  Should we consider rewarding whistleblowers and giving them the &quot;nudge&quot; and confidence to report?<\/p> <p> In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the Securities and Exchange Commission, in cases where the Government recoups more than $1 million, to award to qualifying whistleblowers no less than 10% and no more than 30% of the total monetary sanctions collected as a consequence of the information they provided.  The fundamental idea behind the whistleblower reward programme in that country is to encourage whistleblowing by giving people a reason to come forward.  The argument could be made that the prospect of a reward might encourage so-called gold-diggers.  The experience in the United States, however, is that the Office of the Whistleblower has been receiving a manageable eight tips per day on average, most of them high-quality.<\/p><p>It is evident that many of those working in the financial sector were aware of the problems that existed before the crisis hit.  Even in the months leading up to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, that institution's vice president, Mr. Matthew Lee, attempted a whistleblower action in regard to the firm's accounting methods.  His contract was terminated just a few weeks later, in June 2008.  In Ireland there have been many examples of bankers and others working in the financial sector whose careers were severely affected when they raised concerns about malpractice on the part of their employers.  The reality is that these are often the only people in a position to highlight such abuses.  We must do everything to protect them and to incentivise disclosure of vital information.<\/p><p>I do not subscribe to the view that we must have a vast financial reward scheme as part of any effective whistleblower framework.  At the same time, however, it is an aspect that is worth considering.  The promise of financial reward could tip the balance for potential whistleblowers who fear for their career and job.  In the case of the banking collapse, a reward of some small percentage of the moneys potentially saved by the State would probably have been a fair and modest price to pay for an early warning, in the context of the &euro;64 billion it has thus far cost to bail out those institutions.  Will the Minister consider an amendment to the effect that whistleblowers would be entitled, as a consequence of the information they provided, to 5%, say, of every &euro;1 million recouped by the Government?  If the State obtained &euro;1 million in lost revenue, for example, the whistleblower would receive &euro;50,000.  That might be sufficient incentive to give people the peace of mind and, hopefully, the subsequent financial security, to feel able to whistleblow and thus potentially save the Irish taxpayer billions of euro. We have an opportunity to put out a signal in terms of our commitment to transparency and our willingness to put our money where our mouth is when it comes to tackling this issue.  Should a person like Tony Spollen, who helped the State recoup some &euro;1 billion, have received some type of reward after all the pain he went through?  I would argue that he should have.<\/p><p>On the issue of financial incentives, it is worth noting that the United States Internal Revenue Service agreed to pay UBS Bank whistleblower Bradley Birkenfeld $104 million for his role in exposing the giant Swiss bank's efforts - illegal in the United State but not in its home country - to help American taxpayers to hide money in offshore accounts.  After the Birkenfeld case, the IRS introduced amnesty programmes allowing Americans to repatriate the contents of undeclared offshore accounts at a modest penalty rate.  At least 33,000 have done so to date, netting the United States Government more than $5 billion in back taxes and penalties it might otherwise never have seen.  Some people have argued that the Birkenfeld case gave people 104 million reasons to come forward.  His actions have resulted in massive revenue being generated for the United States Government.  Notwithstanding the immense financial strain on the economy, the introduction of a similar incentive in this jurisdiction is worthy of consideration.  We might consider following the lead of the United States in providing some type of amnesty or emulating its Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act as a sort of complement to the Bill before us today.  That legislation requires foreign financial institutions to identify American account holders and disclose their balances and withdrawals.<\/p><p>These issues should have been tackled in the whistleblowing legislation.  I hope we can have a mature debate on my proposals rather than their being dismissed out of hand simply because they did not emanate from the Government side.  A campaign to offer rewards to whistleblowers is under way in Britain.  Will it be the case, as it so often proves, that our neighbouring country will introduce innovative legislation and we will pat ourselves on the back when we do the same ten years later?  Let us not be afraid as legislators to take a lead on this issue, to show we mean business when it comes to protection for whistleblowers and empowering them to come out from the shadows.  An innovative approach would have significant potential benefits for taxpayers and citizens.  It is certainly worthy of consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500023#W00300","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380113700,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and offer my support for the legislation before us.  For too long we turned a blind eye to so-called white-collar crime and corporate malpractice.  A culture of impunity was pervasive, with a widely observed &quot;do not ask, do not tell&quot; culture.  In Ireland and across the globe, corporate malpractice played a significant part in the financial crisis.  The Enron scandal was merely the tip of a very large iceberg.  Anybody who believed that such practices did not exist in Ireland was extremely naive.  In that context, the Government's legislation on the protection of whistleblowers, new freedom of information provisions and provisions regarding the regulation of lobbying are to be welcomed, and I commend the Minister on his efforts in this area.  They are important aspects of building a regulatory and enforcement regime that will help us to reduce white-collar crime and corporate malpractice into the future.<\/p><p>  The Bill we are discussing is designed to protect workers when they disclose information and, as such, is undoubtedly a welcome initiative.  There are several additional provisions we would like to see included in the Bill and we will, therefore, be bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage and in the D&aacute;il.  I am sure my colleague, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, will elaborate further on these issues.<\/p><p>  The first issue relates to interim relief.  The British whistleblower legislation includes a provision whereby whistleblowers who are dismissed may seek interim relief whereby they keep their job until such time as the case is heard and adjudicated on.  Fear of losing one's job is a major obstacle for any potential whistleblower.  The Council of Europe resolution in this regard states:<blockquote>Relevant legislation should afford bona fide whistle-blowers reliable protection against any form of retaliation through an enforcement mechanism to investigate the whistle-blower's complaint and seek corrective action from the employer, including interim relief pending a full hearing and appropriate financial compensation if the effects of the retaliatory measures cannot reasonably be undone.<\/blockquote>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is seeking an amendment to the Bill to make provision for injunctive relief to be granted to prevent the unfair dismissal of employees following their making of a protected disclosure in accordance with the legislation.  The purpose of interim relief provisions is to ensure, in the public interest, that employees are free from retaliations when making protected disclosures.  The Planning and Development Act 2000 helped to point the way in this regard by way of its provision for relief in respect of a planning injunction.<\/p><p>  Another concern we have relates to resourcing, enforcement and review.  The positive intentions of this Bill will only be realised if sufficient resources are made available to those charged with upholding the law.  A recent draft research paper by Dr. Elaine Byrne, entitled Ireland's White-Collar Crime Oversight Agencies - Fit for Purpose?, noted that 289 cases of illegality were identified in regard to the largest tax evasion scheme in Irish history but not one person was prosecuted.  The Competition Authority has secured 33 convictions against companies and individuals, but the yield has been low and nobody was sent to jail.  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, is yet to secure a prosecution for insider trading or market abuse since its establishment in 2001.  Transparency International, in its national integrity study, noted that full analysis of trends is impeded by an absence of clear and consolidated statistics on investigations or prosecutions for corruption-related offences by law enforcement agencies and the various regulatory bodies.  For instance, the ODCE's statistics on convictions under the Companies Act are at odds with those supplied by the Central Statistics Office, which takes its data mostly from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's record management system.<\/p><p>  As I said, the whistleblower legislation, the new freedom of information provisions and the Bill on lobbying are all progressive initiatives which herald a new era of accountability and transparency.  However, without the necessary resources to ensure enforcement, supports and training and, critically, the collation of data, they might not do what they say on the tin.<\/p> <p>In terms of the regulatory impact assessments, I am worried it did not identify the need for some limited potential Exchequer costs or compliance costs.  If the legislation is to do its job properly, there will be costs.  However, these can be limited by working closely with not-for-profit organisations such as Transparency International.  Sinn F&eacute;in will support the legislation but will table amendments on Committee Stage to strengthen it.  We look forward to working with the Minister on this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500024#X00200","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380114300,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank all Senators for their contributions and for the warm welcome the Bill has received across all sections of the House.  That is what I expected.  We have talked about consequences of our economic collapse in great detail but it was multidimensional and was more than an economic collapse.  It was a failure of politics and of administration and we need to change the culture, which is a much more difficult thing to do than to change legislation.  In order to change the culture, one must change the framework within which people operate and that means legislative change.  We have a suite of legislative measures designed to inculcate a sense that the norm is to out the wrongdoer.  I am very much taken by the comments of Senator Zappone on the purpose of the Bill.  It is not simply to facilitate whistleblowing, to use the phrase that Senator Byrne had difficulty using because it is a loaded phrase, but to encourage that to be the norm.<\/p><p>  I strongly agree with the comments of Senator Byrne on the Nyberg report.  People did not read the Nyberg report in detail as well as they might because of the visceral view that we must point the finger at someone.  Understanding the background to what happened is important if we are to put in place a framework that prevents what happened, on the adverse side of things, recurring.<\/p><p>  The Senator asked a specific question about the pre-legislative scrutiny and the work of committees, which was taken up by Senator Zappone.  I have long been an advocate of a different way of legislating.  I will not have too many allies here but I believe in a single Chamber Parliament, having considered it carefully and approaching the issue with an open mind.  However, this must be an effective single Chamber and should not be a conveyor belt for legislation.  It should open itself to external inputs, which was the original idea of the Seanad.  The idea was to have external influences of a specialist variety from the panels of expertise deemed to be the norm in the 1930s, such as labour, education and cultural panels.  The items of legislation in the suite of legislative changes being introduced on the reform side will go through an extensive pre-legislative consultation.<\/p><p>  With regard to this Bill, we had an extensive external dialogue and submissions from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, IBEC and civic society.  The committee had its own views and held hearings and invited submissions.  I found the committee's report to be of great value.  It is instanced in some of the commentary that there was a migration of thought on a range of issues from the original heads of the Bill to the finished product.  We migrated into the original proposals the idea of good faith reporting.  People might ask why it is not in the Bill now but we looked deeper and got the advice of people.  It is actually an impediment to reporting because people can report wrongdoing with bad motivation.  The Shipman report in Britain was cognisant of that.  Impugning the motives of the whistleblower could destroy the whistleblowing.  That was one of the myriad issues that changed during the thought process that we opened to external views.<\/p><p>  I am not suggesting for a second that it is perfect legislation.  There is no such animal and all legislation is subject to further modification and refinement but the Bill must also slot into the Irish situation.  We cannot take an off-the-shelf view of the UK, Australian, South African or New Zealand legislation, which are exemplars, and slot them in.  We must take cognisance of our situation.<\/p><p>  Senator Sheahan spoke about a code of practice and its timing.  I do not expect this to fly through the Oireachtas.  There will be a process in this House and then in the other House.  It is envisaged that the code of practice, which is important, will be in place at that time.  There is always a dichotomy between saying whether the ordinary citizen can read legislation.  Very few try to and we need the citizen's guide to it and the code of practice will function as that.<\/p><p>  This is a firm delivery of a programme for Government commitment.  Senator Zappone referred to the complexity of the Bill, which I acknowledge, but it needs to be legally robust as it will be interpreted and challenged in the courts.  That is why there is unavoidable complexity at times.  I do not accept, subject to listening to the argument, that we need oversight of oversight and providing a role for the Ombudsman or the Irish Human Rights Commission to oversee the overseer.  If HIQA is the mechanism to which someone whistleblows about something going on in a State-funded nursery, do we need to have someone to monitor the monitors?  Perhaps we need a reporting regime.  We do not want to have evermore reporting mechanisms to deliver more reports.  We need practicality in these matters.<\/p><p>  I welcome the kind comments of Senator Higgins with regard to the history and evolution of these proposals but we are now where we want to be.  The idea of an overarching single comprehensive item of legislation, affecting both private and public sectors, is important.  Senator Higgins raised an interesting point about the trade union charter.  It is not a bad idea and I will raise it with ICTU.  Perhaps IBEC will do the same with its members.  It should signal to union members and workers that this is important, that these are their rights and that the union will provide help with it.<\/p><p>  Senator Quinn raised a number of issues.  It is very hard to provide in legislation for a regime whereby, if I raise the matter with an employer, the employer offers a little bung if I shut up.  How do we deal with that?  It is a difficult question.  There is no log of State employees who have been gagged.  It is not a matter that is reported and it is not something we can have a charter about, but I am sure it happens.  Senator Quinn posits his solution, which is a reward system.  I am a little uncomfortable with this.  Motivation should be the best motivation although I have already said that people may be motivated by the wrong issue.  I can provide a concrete example.  In the Morris tribunal concerning Garda corruption in Donegal, one of the whistleblowers was in a family dispute.  Very important information came into the public domain because of a family dispute.  We can impugn the motive but the information, which was shocking, would not have come to light if the person had not been motivated, for good or ill, to put it into the public sphere.  I am a little nervous about the notion of rewards <i>per se<\/i>.<\/p><p>  Senator Reilly welcomed the Bill and proffered her party support, which I welcome.  She underscored the issue of white-collar crime and I agree it is important.  We are looking at new legislation to deal with white-collar crime specifically.  It is an area we have not handled very well as a society.  We put less focus on it than we do on ordinary decent criminals.  We have been egregiously damaged by white-collar criminals.<\/p> <p>Many of them have not felt touched by the law forces of the State.  I hope that is changing and will change because we certainly need it to change.  <\/p><p>We looked at the issue of interim relief.  It is contained in the UK legislation, but its labour regulatory bodies are judicial bodies, whereas ours are not because under the Constitution, the courts are the only bodies which can stand as a court.  It is not readily applicable, but we have not given up on looking at the prospect of providing some mechanism in this regard.  This issue will be considered during the passage of the Bill.  <\/p><p>I thank all Senators for their contributions and look forward to detailed interaction with them.  I am completely open to good suggestions from wherever they come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500025#Y00200","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380114900,"counter":92,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380114900,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 1 October 2013.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380114900,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.10 p.m. and resumed at 5 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of Seanad","time":1380115200,"counter":95,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500027#AA00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1380115200,"counter":96,"content":"<p>As the Minister is delayed I move the suspension of the House until 5.30 p.m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500027#AA00200","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380115200,"counter":97,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.05 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Joint Committee","time":1380115500,"counter":98,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500028#BB00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1380115500,"counter":99,"content":"<p>The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality has completed its consideration of the Fourth Programme of Law Reform prepared by the Law Reform Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500028#BB00200","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Pathways to Work Strategy: Statements","time":1380115500,"counter":100,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500028#BB00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1380115500,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss the Department of Social Protection's Pathways to Work strategy.  This debate was requested prior to the summer recess.  The idea is to provide a pathway back to work, education or training for people who, for the most part through no fault of their own, find themselves without work or find that their business has collapsed and are claiming jobseeker's allowance.  The strategy, which was launched last year, was the blueprint for the largest set of reforms that our welfare services have ever experienced.  It provided for the establishment of an integrated employment and income support service with an intensified work activation focus.  The initial reforms concentrated on how we deliver services to the newly unemployed.  The 50-point action plan was published in July this year and it sets out to maintain the momentum developed under the pathways strategy and to build on the progress we have made to date.  It also has a particular focus on increasing and intensifying our level of engagement with the long-term unemployed.  The best way to prevent long-term unemployment is get people who become unemployed back to work as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>Following years of job losses, I am delighted that there are several welcome signs of progress in the labour market.  There was an annual increase of 33,800 in the year to June 2013 in the numbers at work.  More than 20,000 went into full-time jobs and approximately 10,000 into part-time jobs.  That is a positive development because often at the end of a recession the first sign of recovery in the labour market relates to part-time jobs.  In addition, unemployment fell by 22,200 over the same period to 300,700 per the Central Statistics Office, continuing a downward trend that began at the start of 2012.  By the end of June, the live register, which includes anybody who receives a jobseeker's payment such as part-time workers and those signing on for credit as jobseekers, had fallen to 415,300, from a peak of 466,000 in 2010.  The unemployment rate, at 13.4%, is down from a peak of 15.1% in early 2012.  When the banks and the construction sector crashed, the country fell off an employment cliff.  We lost 250,000 jobs between 2008 and 2010 and this was one of the largest reductions in employment in any country.  There are 21,000 fewer people on the live register this week than this time last year, which is a positive sign.<\/p><p>Despite these tentative signs of improvement, unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, remains unacceptably high.  As a society we should move towards an economic goal of full employment, which would mean the unemployment rate falling below 7% and then to 5% and under.  Unemployment is also relatively concentrated in households where no adults are working.  More than one fifth of the population under 60 years of age lives in such jobless households.  Amazingly, the percentage of jobless households increased during the economic boom, indicating a structural problem that was never addressed.  It may well be that during the boom, people were parked and almost seen as unemployable or were transferred to other payments such as disability and illness benefit and did not recommence employment.  The major concern is that children in jobless households tend to have weaker outcomes than those in households where some or all the adults have significant work.  As a society, it is something we must worry about.  We need to ensure economic recovery does not leave behind people who are long-term unemployed and in jobless households.<\/p><p>Pathways to Work 2013 builds on the significant progress we made in implementing the reforms and delivering on the targets in Pathways to Work 2012.  More than 20,000 people who were long-term unemployed at the start of 2012 have found employment.  Approximately 700 staff in F&Aacute;S employment services and 1,000 staff in the community welfare service along with 300 other staff working on community employment and other schemes were transferred into the Department of Social Protection on time and within budget.  The roll-out of the new Intreo model of operation integrating the relevant employment and payment services commenced in Sligo in October 2012.<\/p><p>A total of 12 Intreo offices have been opened to date and the OPW, which is our agent for the delivery of these offices, has promised that there will be a significant pick up in the conversion of offices.  When clients visit an Intreo office, they first receive a public services card which has a biometric photograph, and they provide an electronic signature.  The capacity for fraud, for example, where a claimant tries to claim in multiple offices is significantly reduced.  We have, therefore, a solid proof of identity.  When clients sign in, they are asked to sign a contract with the Department which outlines the service we will provide.  We will treat them with dignity and respect and provide income support paid for by our taxpayers and, in return, they are expected to do everything we require to make them work ready.  People sign that contract and it is discussed with them.  They then attend a group engagement where we tell them about their services.  We also profile the individual.  We consider their educational attainment because we can predict how quickly they are likely to find a job.  The higher the level of educational attainment, the faster they return to employment.  They have to sign the social contract of rights and responsibilities.  If people decide not to respond to that social obligation that they have to other citizens and taxpayers, we impose penalties.  For example, we can reduce their social welfare payments.<\/p> <p>If they fail to respond at all, we can suspend their payments for up to nine weeks.  <\/p><p>The national internship scheme, JobBridge, was rolled out and is delivering a clear pathway to employment for many people, particularly in the 24 to 37 year old cohort.  Over 20,000 people have participated in this scheme.  Indecon&rsquo;s review of the scheme indicated there is a progression rate to employment of over 60%.  The feedback to me personally, particularly from small employers, is very positive.  They have been strongly impressed by the quality and calibre of the people in the scheme.  There is also positive feedback from interns on the experience they got on the scheme.  Many of them were in college at the height of the boom but when they came out of college during the downturn they hit a brick wall getting employment opportunities.<\/p><p>The Momentum programme, a collaboration between my Department and the Department of Education and Skills, which aims to provide work-focused training to long-term unemployed people was developed and is operated by providers from the public and private sector.  More than 4,000 people are now benefiting from this innovative programme.  For example, people can avail of digital skills courses.  I am hoping we will be able to continue this programme next year.<\/p><p>The number of places available on activation schemes such as community employment, T&uacute;s and JobBridge was increased by 10,000 as part of budget 2013.  T&uacute;s started in July 2011 and now has 7,000 people on it.  We have had tremendous co-operation in developing this from the local development networks across the country.<\/p><p>The Springboard programme has supported more than 10,000 unemployed people to re-skill for emerging employment opportunities.  Pathways to Work 2013 seeks to maintain the momentum in the implementation of the original Pathways reforms, while introducing an increased focus on the long-term unemployed, in particular among those who became unemployed in the height of the crisis between 2008 and 2011.  Many of these people are male who were employed in the construction industry.  They worked with great energy, up at 7 o&rsquo;clock in the morning and finishing at 10 o&rsquo;clock at night.  Many of them had to change employment fields completely.<\/p><p>Focusing on long-term unemployment, we will be profiling all clients on the live register, not just new claimants.  This means there are 420,000 people to be profiled.  We will be looking at their education, work experience, where they worked and what they earned.  This will be a good predictor as to whether the person will find it easy or difficult to get another job.  There will be 10,000 additional places on employment programmes this year, mainly for the long-term unemployed.  We will be reserving 40% of training places for the long-term unemployed and reviewing the possible further contribution of the further education sector to this area.<\/p><p>We will ensure that work pays through reforms to housing support under the new housing assistance payment, as well as through continuing simplification and promotion of the in-work payments under the family income supplement in FIS.  We have cleared the backlog of applications in this area.  The Department pays just under &euro;250 million in FIS to support people going back to work in low-paid work.  In some cases they have too few work hours; in others, they may be on a low wage.  We will be implementing the JobsPlus incentive for employers to recruit people who are long-term unemployed.  Under this programme, if an employer takes someone on who was unemployed for more than one year, they get a cash payment of &euro;300 per month for up to two years.  If they take someone on who has been unemployed for two years or more, they get &euro;400 a month cash back for every month they employ the person paid by electronic fund transfer the month after the person has worked.  I inherited several supports for employers when I took office that spanned the Revenue Commissioners and my Department.  From my commercial experience, I found them hard to understand.  We have tried to make the JobsPlus programme as easy as possible.  Employers and individuals can register for it.  Essentially, it is about giving a long-term unemployed person a job.  An employer, once registered for the scheme, will get the cash back at the end of the first month the person commenced working.  We started this scheme in July.  It generally takes three months before we first start seeing results so I look forward to feedback from Senators on this.<\/p><p>We will be monitoring and encouraging recruitment from the live register by client firms of the enterprise development agencies.  This week alone there have been announcements of more than 600 new jobs.  Obviously, some of these jobs will be filled by existing workers or new entrants into the labour market.  We are doubling the number of caseworkers employed within the Department on activation duties to increase capacity to engage with live register clients, in particular long-term unemployed people, while also finalising proposals for contracting additional capacity for employment services for long-term unemployed people.<\/p><p>Measures reducing long-term unemployment will have spill-over benefits for jobless households.  We also plan to take additional measures in this area.  These include, for example, monitoring the migration of people from jobseeker to other welfare payments and reviewing, over a number of years, the capacity for work of long-term recipients of illness and disability payments.  Two years ago, I introduced a partial capacity benefit.  The Department will facilitate those who had a serious illness or disability to get back into work.  In the current economic climate, they find it difficult to get back into the workplace.  This benefit and the employability services concentrating on their abilities will assist those in such circumstances.<\/p> <p>We are also considering activation interventions for lone parents and the partners or spouses of unemployed people.  We will continue to work to identify the specific factors underlying the concentration of joblessness in particular households, and to bring forward further measures to address this problem.  We have set detailed targets and have approximately 50 planned actions.  When people have come back to me and asked if I can do something to make JobBridge or T&uacute;s more flexible, we have tried to listen and introduce a level of flexibility that meets the requirements of employers.<\/p><p>The reduction of 21,000 in the live register is a very positive development.  The growth in employment of more than 33,000 is a very positive development.  Were we in the United States, those would be taken as two key indicators of being on the road to recovery.  That is why we see those figures almost every week, asking whether the number of people at work is going up.  That is the key indicator.  I am happy to say that slowly but progressively we are beginning to offer people who have been locked out of employment an opportunity to participate in the workforce.  Since we took over community employment I have visited many of the community employment schemes around the country.  Where people are on a placement for two years or more we are trying to ensure they emerge from that with an educational qualification, such as FETAC level 5, so that no only are they contributing to the community but developing skills that will help them get back to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500028#BB00400","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380116700,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I welcome to the Visitors Gallery a former colleague of ours, former Senator Geraldine Feeney, and Father Peter Casey, parish priest of Kilmore, County Cavan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500030#DD00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1380116700,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and wish her continued success in her very serious responsibility.  Despite the improvement and stabilisation of the economic system in our country, there is a very serious crisis in the number of people unemployed.  We seem to be immune to the 13.4% of unemployed people and the increasing number of long-term unemployed.  On Saturday, 14 September I attended the Career Zoo recruitment event at the Convention Centre in Dublin.  Leading companies such as Amazon, Accenture, AOL, Boston Scientific, Facebook and many others were in attendance as well as leading Irish colleges such as Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, and the National College of Ireland.  Springboard and Skillnet were also represented, two admirable schemes.  There are 3,000 jobs available but we have not got the people to fill those jobs.  That is the tragedy.<\/p><p>  We have a very high unemployment rate, which would be far more serious if we did not have 245 people emigrating per day.  Many people want to emigrate, including members of my family, who want to be in the United States, Singapore or wherever, but there is a bitterness in society among grandparents.  I find that very moving because we had that in the 1980s with so many people emigrating, as the Minister will remember.  Some returned but many did not, so grandparents were deprived of the relationship with their grandchildren and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Any of us who knew our grandparents know they are a major influence on our lives.<\/p><p>  After speaking to the people at Career Zoo, we are not getting the message across.  As a business person I find it very frustrating that people have to upskill to get the available jobs.  This is going on and on.  The pace of catching up and upskilling is far too slow.  There is a mismatch between the market and the demand for highly-skilled graduates in IT, finance and a wide range of subjects.  We are not meeting that demand.  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs spelled out the same.  We had the winner of the Nobel Prize for economics in the House a year ago and I drew his attention to this matter of 3,000 jobs being available.  We do not have the graduates with the multilingual skills.<\/p><p>  There is a kind of lethargy about solving the problem.  As I said numerous times in our party, there is a lack of political drive for the Minister, not the Department officials, to resolve the problem.  Maybe it should be opened up to the private sector to resolve the problem.  Having established Lir Chocolates during the last recession, when we had 40% unemployment in some parts of the country, I saw the physical and emotional transformation in a person when he or she got a job.  It is a major responsibility on the shoulders of the Government to deal with this in a more proactive manner.  Projects such as the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, Skillnets and Momentum are admirable but there must be a passion about resolving this 13.4% unemployed rate and the increasing number of long-term unemployed, which has terrible, debilitating effects on their families and themselves.<\/p><p>  We must take into consideration the view of the OECD and the EU.  In its report in September the OECD said: &quot;Ireland's long-term unemployed are at risk of becoming permanent casualties of the recession as new and better qualified jobseekers take advantage of the recovery.&quot;  The OECD report showed that one in five children live in households where nobody works.  This is the highest proportion in the EU, indicating serious risk of the persistence of social exclusion.  Pathways to Work 2013 has some impressive headline goals.  Unfortunately the Government's record in implementing these goals in previous plans has not been good, as outlined in the OECD and EC reports.<\/p><p>  There must be a much more aggressive response to solving this problem.  The OECD report stated:<blockquote>Decisive interventions in the labour market are needed to avoid the unemployment rate remaining high for many years to come.  Higher aggregate demand and job creation are essential for bringing down unemployment but they will not be sufficient.  Decisive interventions in labour market policies are needed to avoid the unemployment rate remaining high, risking a rising structural unemployment rate which would hamper growth and exacerbate inequality and social exclusion.<\/blockquote>  The European Commission report this year stated that progress has not been sufficiently fast and more needs to be done.  Delays have been experienced in some other priority areas for structural reform.  The Commission went on to say the pace of reforms and resources mobilised are, at times, insufficient given the scale of the situation.  It also criticised the lack of case workers to help the unemployed, rapid decision making and attention to upskilling young people and the long-term unemployed.<\/p> <p> I accept that the Minister is doing her best and that she is first-class, but when young people seek advice on where they should go for jobs, they only have a couple of minutes with a career adviser.  It is not good enough that she hopes to be on top of the problem by Christmas.  If this was a private business dealing with an issue that had arisen, it would be working on a 24-7 basis until it was resolved.  There is a psychological distance between the Government and the reality of unemployment.  Having seen how people can transform when they find jobs, I want to see greater passion.  I am not blaming the Minister because she must contend with a traditional bureaucracy that works at a different tempo in solving problems.  I know exactly how this works because when we were in government, we had experience of blockages in the bureaucratic system.<\/p><p>Every day 245 people emigrate.  The unemployment rate is 13.4% and the number of long-term unemployed is on the rise.  The Minister should be attending meetings of the four man economic council that is running the country, given the serious nature of her responsibilities.  Approximately 10,000 people attended the career guidance fair in the Convention Centre.  The fair was aimed at professionals and those with graduate skills.  Some 3,000 jobs are available, but we have to be faster in upskilling people to fill these vacancies.  I do not have a problem with the fact that people are coming here from abroad to work in PayPal because of its requirements for individuals with linguistic skills.  Cross-fertilisation of ideas and people coming here from abroad enhance all of us.  However, we also want to look after our own people.  It is disturbing that the Government thinks it is great that the unemployment rate has fallen to 13.4% and it is irritating that it gets excited about a growth rate of 0.4%.  It claims that we have turned the corner based on an increase in one quarter, while overlooking the overall trend.<\/p><p>I speak as a former employer and a current board member of Lir Chocolates which I set up to create employment.  I had never heard of the word &quot;profit&quot;.  I got pleasure from creating jobs and I am still on a mission to do this.  On 12 December I will be hosting a conference in Dundrum Town Centre on revitalising the reatail sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500030#DD00300","speaker":"1156","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380117300,"counter":107,"content":"<p>We cannot have commercials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500031#EE00200","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1380117300,"counter":108,"content":"<p>We will be exploring the issue of bad planning.

In the Taoiseach's address at the recent IBEC president's dinner he stated: \"When this Government came into office we declared that we could no longer tolerate a passive welfare system that abandoned hundreds of thousands of people to unemployment without any real support or engagement.\"  The Government has been proactive in addressing this issue by introducing the Pathways to Work strategy.  I compliment all Departments on their commitment in tackling the issue head-on.  Long-term unemployment is a cancer in our society.  It is demoralising and the psychological implications can lead to the loss of friends, confidence, isolation and depression.  Skills previously acquired become obsolete, which, in turn, decreases the chances of gaining meaningful employment.  Long-term unemployment also increases the economic burden on the State in the form of higher social welfare payments which lead to increased Government borrowing and less tax revenue.<\/p><p>The Pathways to Work strategy seeks to address some of these issues by putting in place a strategy not only to assist the long-term unemployed but also to support the betterment of society as a whole.  The 50 point action plan involves all of the relevant stakeholders from Departments and State agencies working together.  The plan contains ten key performance indicators, the first of which is completion of personal profiles of all 422,900 people on the live register in order that personalised employment supports can be developed for them.  The second involves initial one-to-one guidance interviews with job seekers, with 185,000 such interviews to be carried out this year.  The availability of profiling of individuals is crucial to the success of the strategy.  This includes the length of time an individual has been unemployed, the implications of long-term unemployment and the individual's ability to engage with employment services and possible employers.  To this end, I hope profiles will include self-development support and training for individuals before they enter any level of employment.  It is imperative that any psychological need they may have is addressed, including confidence building.  Many who have been out of work find it difficult to re-enter the workforce without adequate holistic supports.  These interviews should not be about ticking the right boxes to create favourable statistics.  They should be aimed at developing genuine understanding of a person's situation and his or her needs in returning to the workforce after a long period of unemployment.  Will adequate upskilling, self-development and confidence building programmes be made available to them before they are expected to engage in interviews or re-enter the workforce?<\/p><p>The provision of a one-stop-shop of service supports is welcome as a means of creating a more streamlined approach to the service and support systems needed by the long-term unemployed.  It is the intention to roll out all of the Intreo offices by the end of the year.  The Pathways to Work strategy will not be implemented properly until all of the support mechanisms are in place throughout the country to meet the needs of those who require support.  I urge the Minister to progress the delivery of the Intreo network in order that all of the services can be delivered effectively and in a timely manner.  The pace of roll-out of these office is slower than promised.  Is there any way Senators might help the Minister to expedite delivery of this vital cornerstone of the Government's jobs agenda?<\/p><p>An interim report recently produced by Indecon found that 52% of almost 3,000 JobBridge participants had been in paid employment since completing their internships.<\/p> <p> The JobsPlus scheme introduced earlier this year offers employers fixed cash grants to hire people who have been long-term unemployed for periods ranging from 12 months to four years.  To qualify for this payment, positions must be for more than 30 hours a week spanning four days and subject to the usual PAYE and PRSI deductions.  A total of &euro;7,500 is available to employers who take on people who have been unemployed for more than 12 months and less than four years, while &euro;10,000 is available to those who are unemployed for four years or more.  Unemployed persons who wish to take up employment under the scheme must be signing on for jobseeker's benefit, jobseeker's allowance or credits.<\/p><p>We are discussing the issue of the long-term unemployed, but we must also ensure school leavers or those who, for whatever reason, are on the live register do not become another statistic and in the future are classed as long-term unemployed.  Is it necessary to review the eligibility criteria for those wishing to avail of internships under the JobBridge scheme?  The current qualifying criteria to avail of a placement under the scheme are to be in receipt of social welfare payments for approximately three months or signing on for credits.  We must guard against the danger that young graduates or those who recently lost their jobs may lose enthusiasm and self-esteem while they wait for three months before being eligible for an internship which may hold the possibility of offering new employment prospects.<\/p><p>The OECD report recommends that Ireland do much more to assist the unemployed, notably long-term jobseekers.  It points to a critical need for support and retraining to ward against social exclusion and ensure young people are prepared to work as the recovery strengthens.  Research undertaken by the ESRI in 2012 indicated a specific policy approach was required to address the issues of jobless households.  During the boom years of the early 2000s the rate of joblessness at household level was very high by European standards.  The ESRI concluded this reflected structural factors and had little to do with the recession.  During the period between 2005 and 2007, when the economy was ostensibly strong and the unemployment rate was at a very low level of 4% or 5%, Ireland had a very low work intensity rate which oscillated between 13% and 15%, while it was 10% on average in the European Union.  The ESRI found Ireland reported a relatively high rate of joblessness among working age adults.  The research found that the proportion of people in jobless households had increased very rapidly following the onset of the recent economic downturn from 15% in 2007 to 22%, double the average throughout Europe.<\/p><p>The Government inherited a passive social welfare system which did not empower the people it was supposed to help.  We now have a window of opportunity for long overdue reform of social welfare structures through the roll-out of the Intreo offices, tackling poverty traps such as replacing rent supplement with the housing assistance payment scheme, and additional management resources to assist in dealing with long-term unemployment.  I commend the strategy of the Government and its commitment to tackle the problem of long-term unemployment once and for all, an issue which was neglected in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500031#EE00900","speaker":"1187","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380117900,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Senator on her maiden speech and wish her well in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500032#FF00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1380117900,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500032#FF00300","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speech","time":1380117900,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.

I feel very positive and feel like cheering.  We can only move in one direction and I am delighted.  I know it is small, but I welcome it.  I also welcome the Minister's efforts to ensure work pays.  This is a huge problem.  The Minister deals with very sensitive issues, but reform of housing supports and simplification of other payments are very much welcome.<\/p><p>I wish to put a number of ideas to the Minister.  I would like to see the awareness of employers raised.  I am lucky to be here because when I attend management meetings, I am aware of schemes such as JobsPlus, but I have many friends in the food business who simply do not seem to know about them.  We have the media and agencies, but would it be possible to use a little funding to raise awareness?  The JobsPlus scheme is a gift from heaven for an employer.  It is welcome that the Minister is increasing the number of caseworkers.  Does she believe caseworkers have received enough training and upskilling?  Are they motivated enough and have we injected them with enough passion to help people?  Most people have been unemployed for several months at some stage.  I was only 19, but I remember being such a depressed Dan at home with my parents because I thought I would never get out.  We all have friends who are unemployed and know how demotivating it is.  The caseworkers need to be on top of their game.  I am beginning to sound like someone from the United States, but as we are putting employers on related bonuses for employing people, would it be possible to have caseworkers in performance related bonus schemes?<\/p><p>I love heritage and old Ireland and would like to see the dots being joined between the areas of tourism, education and social protection.  The heritage budget was cut from &euro;22 million to &euro;7 million.  We are in serious times and cannot cut for the less well-off and the heritage budget is easy to cut, but we are spending a fortune on tourism and have lost a lot of income through cutting the VAT rate.  However, if we stop our work in the heritage sector, what will be there for tourists when they come?  Heritage is all about communities and when work is done on an old building, it is usually people involved in construction or creative individuals who are involved.  We are putting the country back together and making beautiful old things safer and better.  We allow beautiful old buildings to be restored for tourists to see and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is as happy as the tourists.  Community self-esteem also increases.  I, therefore, ask all Departments to please join the dots and help the Minister in this regard.  I call for the heritage budget to be increased because it will help to create jobs in an area in which we do not have to upskill people.  We have many brilliant individuals such as stonemasons and those involved in construction.  England seems to have beautiful thatched cottages in abundance, but ours are disappearing before our eyes.  All anybody from the United States who comes to Ireland wants to see is a thatched cottage.<\/p><p>I was very touched by what the Minister stated about children in families where people had been unemployed for generations.  The Minister for Education and Skills will come to the House tomorrow.  It is very important that we keep motivating and injecting passion in these children who are so unlucky to be living in such houses because it is hard for parents to be good role models.  I feel so elitist in saying this, but the dots must be joined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500032#FF00400","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1380117900,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I heard she was at the ploughing championships and that she had been very well received, which is great to hear.  I welcome the great work she is trying to do in overhauling the social welfare system.  I will not quote all of the statistics she has given for the schemes available, as Senator Hildegarde Naughton has already done so.  We need a change of culture because for some going on social welfare is a job for life.  This has always been the case.  Once somebody is in the system, everything else is free.  This has frustrated taxpayers for years.<\/p> <p>As the Minister knows, I was a community welfare officer for 28 years and I have worked with all of the various types of people who are unemployed.  The ones I feel most sorry for are those who have been affected by the recent Celtic tiger crash as they are suffering more than anyone else.  The reason for this is that, throughout the Celtic tiger era, we kept increasing social welfare and we could not get the long-term unemployed of the day to take all of the jobs that were available - we did not even ask them.  No effort was made either by civil servants or the then Department of Social and Family Affairs to take people off the live register.  It was simply the case that we would bring in the workforce from Europe.  That was grand and we welcomed them all.  However, the problem now is that we still have in excess of 100,000 who were unemployed back then on all types of social welfare payments, and we also have all the foreigners now on social welfare payments as well.  That is the problem.  I will repeat the point.  No effort was made to deal with that problem at that time.  If Deputy Burton was Minister at the time and had been trying to achieve what she has tried to achieve today, that problem would have been solved.<\/p><p>Another point is that, as the Minister noted, more and more people were becoming unemployed during the Celtic tiger years.  Again, I credit that to the fact we were encouraging people to stay on the dole because we were promising that in every budget there would be an increase in social welfare.  It was a giveaway during that time and the problem was not dealt with.<\/p><p>On another point, there are all kinds of poverty traps and welfare traps, and things we sometimes see and sometimes do not see.  Senator Landy raised an issue this morning in regard to 18-year old children who are told they cannot get child benefit although they might still be going to school.  During my time as a welfare officer, I witnessed many children who had just left school and who, on their 18th birthday, were down at the dole office.  In an effort to take on board what Senator Landy was trying to achieve this morning on the Order of Business, we should look at issues like this.  It might encourage people to stay in school until such time as they do their leaving certificate if they were able to keep their child benefit.<\/p><p>The Minister's targets under Pathways to Work are exactly right, namely, to ensure that every job goes to a person who is on the live register and to ensure that work pays in order to avoid welfare traps.  I appreciate what she is trying to do with the rent allowance and the many other good initiatives undertaken by her.  There are critics of the internship scheme and, of course, they will say that employers are milking it.  However, I believe employers use that scheme to evaluate employees better than if they had just interviewed them.  We all know plenty of people who are brilliant at interviews but then they will not pull their weight.  I am glad to point to the proof that this scheme is working, which is that 60% of those who went onto it have now been employed.<\/p><p>With regard to the JobsPlus scheme, I have been beating this drum since I joined the Labour Party, as the Minister is aware.  It is ridiculous to be paying social welfare to somebody to stay at home when half of the amount could be offered to an employer to take them off the dole.  I appreciate Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's point and we need to get the message out there because I do not believe many people know about it.  I have made the point repeatedly in recent years that if we created 100,000 jobs on that scheme, this would save &euro;1.1 billion per year.  It is there for everyone to see.  There are also tax breaks for employers on top of the JobsPlus scheme.<\/p><p>I am glad to see that over 2,000 jobs a month are being created in the private sector.  Senator White raised the issue of the 3,000 jobs for which we do not have the skills in this country.  If I am not mistaken, there are as many under-skilled people in Europe as there are unemployed people in Europe, so it is not just an issue in Ireland but right across Europe.  There is only one way to deal with it, namely, to upskill people.<\/p><p>As far as I am concerned, there are very positive signs out there.  We can certainly see this in the cities and larger towns, and it is rural Ireland that is mainly hit, in particular through migration, although people do not mind that as long as there is a job at the end of the road for them.<\/p><p>Finally, I ask the Minister, as I ask her before every budget, to please look after the carers and not to consider any cut to the carer's allowance.  That is another area where people are doing a job that we could not pay for, given the amount of work they put in while saving the Exchequer money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500032#FF00500","speaker":"1161","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380118500,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I am afraid I am not as upbeat as some of the previous contributors in regard to Pathways to Work.  If one talks to most unemployed people in Ireland, when they think about Pathways to Work it is about the route through terminal 1 or 2 of Dublin Airport to get off the island.  We cannot congratulate a Government when the unemployment rate has remained almost stagnant and we still see almost one in four young people unemployed in this State, even though we have seen 400,000 people leave the island in recent years.  I believe that is an abject failure on the part of this Government to create employment.<\/p><p>I also feel very strongly for the personal stories.  Families are being split up by the economic policies of this Government.  My cousin's husband is at this moment in Christchurch in New Zealand, having had to leave a couple of months ago because there was no work for him here.  He had to leave his wife and two young children behind him as they could not go with him.  He was not eligible for social welfare because he had been self-employed and he had no other choice but to leave.  It is a disgrace this kind of thing is happening.<\/p><p>On the broader picture, the austerity policies of this Government, which are being driven by Fine Gael but totally embraced by the Labour Party, have been proven by international commentators to be the wrong way to go.  The fact is that our economy is still flat-lining, as we hear from all the different sectors, including the business and retail sectors.  People are just not spending money.  The Government has decided to cut the income of people on the lower income brackets, who use all of their disposable income, and this has not helped at all.  It is very important that we reiterate those positions.<\/p><p>It is true that a tiny amount of employment growth has been recorded by the CSO but it is a long way off the Minister's own targets and far behind the scale of the job recovery that is needed.  As in previous years, Sinn F&eacute;in's prebudget submissions will be seeking more investment in capital and infrastructure in order to kick-start the economy once more.  I hope the Minister will take that on board.  Numerous international commentators now say that if we had gone that route a number of years ago, the austerity would not have kicked in as hard as it has.<\/p><p>Pathways to Work talks about deeper engagement with jobseekers and a greater emphasis on activation but that is very difficult to achieve without significant additional staff.  What is happening is that the Government is redeploying staff from one Department to another but, without significant additional staff, it will not be possible to cope with the huge caseload that exists.  The OECD economic survey of Ireland report, which was just published, correctly makes the point that the number of case workers supporting long-term jobseekers must be increased.  However, the OECD and the Government are wrong if they think they can do that through redeployment rather than significant recruitment.  As a solution, redeployment is a non-runner because it will exacerbate delays in the processing of payments of other schemes.  It is robbing Peter to pay Paul to move staff from one scheme to another.<\/p><p>I take umbrage with a number of the statements made by the previous speaker, and I found one of them bordering on racist, that about foreigners on social welfare.  I think it is appalling to make a sweeping statement of that type.  The fact Senator Kelly mentioned that social welfare is seen as a job for life for many people is, again, a very dangerous and sweeping statement to make.  There are many reasons that people can be long-term unemployed, such as historic, geographic and socioeconomic reasons.  However, to try to tar everybody with the same brush is extremely wrong, and appalling coming from a Labour Senator.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Kelly on the issue of carers, and people with disabilities are also being forced to wait an inexcusable amount of time for support.  I agree that no cuts to carers should be introduced in the next budget.<\/p><p>Since the Government took office, some of the waiting times have actually worsened for people on the different schemes, and we can see that many of the schemes have been abused in recent years.  A Minister came into the House last year and told us that people on JobBridge schemes were being used to clear the Garda clearance waiting lists.  To me, that is not the reason the scheme was set up.  We have to be very careful that meaningful schemes are set up and that meaningful employment is provided.<\/p><p>Between June 2011 and May 2013, the waiting time for carer's allowance doubled from 17 week to 34 weeks, while for the disability allowance it increased from 17 to 23 weeks.<\/p> <p>Does the Minister intend to recruit or redeploy staff and, if so, in what numbers?  Has the Department conducted an assessment of the impact on other schemes of redeploying staff to undertake the work on these activation schemes?  There are not enough Intreo offices and there are not enough departmental staff to work in the number of one-stop shops that are needed, given the scale of unemployment and the growing numbers of long-term unemployed.  <\/p><p>I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that since the CWOs have been subsumed into her Department, the services provided previously have been withdrawn from Connemara and most other rural areas.  The Department is now asking unemployed people from places like Carna, Cill Chiar&aacute;n and Leitir Meall&aacute;in to travel to places like Clifden in Galway to these Intreo offices.  In many cases, there is no public transport available.  This places an additional burden on those unemployed people.  They will either have to pay for transport, get a hackney or hitch a lift.  That is absolutely disgraceful.  This issue has already been raised in this House on the Adjournment and I ask the Minister to review that policy because it simply will not work.<\/p><p>Pathways to Work plans to privatise support for jobseekers.  The term &quot;contracting out&quot; is being used, perhaps because more appropriate terms such as &quot;outsourcing&quot; have negative connotations for a Labour Party Minister, party members and supporters.  Indeed, one wonders what profit margin private companies will be taking on those contracts.  In the final analysis, &quot;pathways to poverty&quot; would be a more apt title for this scheme because the Government is not creating jobs for the unemployed to move into.  Without new training places, new investment in education and new jobs, the plan really is no more than spin.  It is aimed at building up the hopes of those languishing on the dole queues, only to dash them when it cannot deliver.  Pathways to Work is dependent on work being available and this Government is failing miserably to create the jobs we need in this State.  If we took a much more proactive approach, such as that put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in in its pre-budget submissions, we would not be in the current situation.  Austerity is not working and I hope the Minister will impress that on her Fine Gael colleagues, in particular, at the Cabinet table in the run up to the next budget so that we do not see a further exodus of our young people and those who are unemployed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500033#GG00200","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380119100,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank her for engaging with us on a very regular basis in the Seanad.

There is no need to remind him of the appalling situation that this Government inherited when it came into office two and a half years ago.  All Ministers and Departments were charged by the Taoiseach to be innovative and job-creating and to work together to create significant employment.  The Action Plan for Jobs is certainly working and I know that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, working with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, is bringing about a situation where it will be easier for people to obtain employment and engage with employment opportunities.<\/p><p>The scourge of long-term unemployment is an indictment of successive Governments, which allowed two and three generations of families to be forgotten about.  Such people have never experienced the dignity associated with going out to work to provide for a family and make a positive contribution to their country and to society.  This has had a significant impact on peoples' health too, a fact which we should not lose sight of.  Having people in gainful employment would have a very positive impact on the health budget.  <\/p><p>Jobseekers are now offered group engagement, one-to-one interviews, skills and experience assessments, as well as training and work placements with the roll-out of the Intreo offices nationwide.  I acknowledge the point raised by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh and indeed, in my own town of Ballinasloe, the community welfare officer will no longer be based in the town but in Loughrea.  Effectively, the largest town in the county will not have a community welfare officer and I am concerned about the hardship that will impose on people who will have to travel significant distances.  However, I have been assured by the manager of the service that, in the main, interaction with people will be by telephone and e-mail and that in situations where people are unable to travel to the office, a community welfare officer will call to them.  I welcome that assurance and ask for further assurance from the Minister that this will happen.  <\/p><p>The JobBridge scheme was mentioned and I welcome the fact that 20,000 people have availed of it to date.  It is a great scheme but I would like to see significant ongoing employment of the individuals involved at the end of the placement period.  We should consider making it more attractive to employers to hold on to scheme participants because it has tremendous potential.<\/p><p>Senator Mary Ann O'Brien welcomed the cash incentive of &euro;7,500 over two years that is available to employers who take on people who have been unemployed for 12 to 24 months.  This scheme is under-marketed.  We need to put more effort into ensuring that all employers are aware of this particular scheme, which has huge potential.  Employers continue to complain that it is very expensive to hire an additional person and this is a real incentive that should be availed of.  Senator Kelly spoke passionately about ensuring that work pays and that is an issue that must be addressed.  We have to bite the bullet on it.  Whether we like it or not, there are family configurations in this country in receipt of very significant amounts of welfare payments and such income is totally tax free.  When one factors in the possibility that such people are in a local authority house with a very modest rent and may also be in receipt of a medical card, then taking up an offer of employment might not be worth their while.  We cannot ignore that fact, which is contributing to significant numbers of people and families not taking up employment or even being interested in taking a job.  <\/p><p>The community employment schemes are wonderful initiatives which bring great benefits to the participants and to the their communities.  I urge the Minister to further increase the number of CE scheme places.  I often wonder why some who are very long-term unemployed never seem to be offered the opportunity to participate in some of those CE schemes.  <\/p><p>We have a culture of dependency and entitlement in this country that we need to address.   We must, through the education system, instill more ambition into some of our young people.  Children who come from families with no history of employment, in some cases for two or three generations, lack ambition.  This must be addressed.  Finally, we must make it easy for people to access employment and to sign on and off when they obtain short-term employment.  I spoke to an employer earlier today who said that people who are offered work for five or six weeks should be able to submit their unemployment docket, sign off for the days they are working but be able to re-activate their social welfare ---<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500034#HH00400","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1380119100,"counter":126,"content":"<p>They can do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500034#HH00500","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1380119100,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500034#HH00600","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1380119100,"counter":128,"content":"<p>We brought that in last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500034#HH00700","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1380119100,"counter":129,"content":"<p>Great.

It is always good to see a Minister outline his or her brief, not read a script, which tells us that she knows exactly what she is talking about.<\/p><p>There are a number of issues.  We have talked about how the unemployment rate has stabilised but not about the people who have emigrated.  If they were taken into account then the unemployment rate would be at a very worrying level.  Obviously the youth unemployment rate is an issue of great concern.  The Minister outlined many issues of concern.  For example, one in five children live in a household with nobody in employment.  That has been the case for some time but was hidden by the Celtic tiger.  <\/p><p>I note the Minister talked about having 20,000 people who have been employed over the recent past and the aim is increase that to 75,000 people.  It was not the Minister's party but other parties in government, who shall remain nameless, that promised 40,000 jobs per year.  One candidate asked whether we would have to wait ten years to reach a satisfactory employment rate and a 40,000 jobs target has proved impossible to meet in terms of employment generation. I would like to get a view on all of those young people who have left the country.  Emigration has always been a safety valve for Ireland and their leaving is a great loss.<\/p><p>I wish to raise a side issue that perhaps the Minister will raise with her colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  The people who leave because we cannot create employment for them here have been told that they will never be given a vote in our Parliament, reformed or not, because they have social media.  It is insulting for a member of the Government to tell members of our community who have emigrated, not only that we will not provide employment but we will not even give them, as citizens of the Republic who live outside of the State, the hope that they will have a vote, unlike 115 countries around the world.  There are 33 members of the Council of Europe and only four countries do not give their citizens who live outside of the jurisdiction the vote.  Ireland is in august company with Malta, Cyprus and Greece.

These are the types of people who could help us formulate ideas for job creation and to improve the economy yet we will not bring them in or allow them to be brought into Leinster House.  It is doable.  Leinster House is not the most secure building in the world, its not the Pentagon and these people do not pose a threat.

It does great work but in some instances one must ask where job opportunities will come from for its participants.  We are lucky to have many tourism jobs in Kerry but the work is seasonal.  Obviously agriculture also provides seasonable work.  Hope is the most important thing that we can give unemployed people who are in their 50s and 60s.  There are some excellent initiatives.  Some people have been taken off F&Aacute;S schemes and one wonders whether one should put them on another training course.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister on the idea of having people sign up to engage with their community which is right because citizenship is about rights and responsibilities.  It is important that people in receipt of social welfare do not spend all day sitting at home watching television, as does happen.  They should be out in the community.  They benefit from the community so they should be of benefit to the community.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500035#JJ00700","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1380119700,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  Without doubt she has done enormous work since she went into the Department and took up her brief.  Some of my colleagues in the Seanad Chamber have failed to realise the mess that she inherited and the number of people who were signing on for welfare payments when she first became the Minister, and subsequently.<\/p><p>Over the summer period I had cause to be in my constituency of Galway East and met a number of people who work in the business community.  A lot of them acknowledged that their businesses are going well and feel as if they have turned a corner.  They were particularly happy with her JobsPlus initiative.  There are also the Intreo offices that she opened in Galway, particularly in my constituency in Loughrea.  I noticed that a common theme among the business owners was their reservation regarding people moving from welfare to work.  Let me give an example.  I met a lady who owns a coffee shop.  She stated that she had noticed an upturn in the economy and that her business was going well.  However, she said that she had great difficulty getting her staff to work extra hours and provide cover for a member of staff who was off on sick time or holiday time.  One of her greatest barriers is the fact that her staff do not want to take on extra hours for fear of losing their family income supplement, rent allowance or single parent allowance.  That is regrettable.<\/p><p>One cannot blame staff for opting for a more financially rewarding route.  Perhaps the Minister can assist the small business community by introducing a sliding scale of benefits tailor-made for the individual in question.  I understand such an initiative would create a heavy administrative workload.  Surely a system of some description could be formulated within her Department that would enable people to take a lesser welfare payment one week because they are given more work.  The Exchequer would benefit in two ways from such a scheme.  The welfare due to the person would not have to be paid in full and the increased taxation would go to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>PRSI was another issue that arose.  There was speculation that PRSI might be increased from 3% to 4.5% on foot of a report that was launched during the summer.  I have spoken to a number of self-employed people who are delighted at the potential of being eligible for benefits if they fall ill or sick long term.  However, other self-employed people find it very difficult to cope with, for example, paying high rates on their properties and making a lot of extra payments.<\/p> <p>It is a difficult time for businesses.  It would be an unnecessary burden on the sector if PRSI was increased to 4.5% as speculated.  Instead of introducing a standard PRSI rate of 4.5% rate across the business community I ask the Minister to allow employers to opt in or opt out of this benefit scheme.  I ask the Minister to look at that in the context of the budget negotiations and the introduction of social welfare supports for the small business community and the self-employed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500035#JJ00800","speaker":"1173","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380120300,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I thank all the Senators who contributed so thoughtfully to the debate.  Some people said there are no jobs.  That is not actually true.  Some 280,000 jobs were taken up by unemployed people in the past year.  Senator Daly will be aware there is much seasonal employment in Kerry in hotels.  A person who is unemployed for, say, five months may get a job in the hotel business for another five months following which he or she may have a period of unemployment because of the seasonal nature of the employment.  The technical term is that there is much churn or turnover of people on the live register.  As we speak the number of new people signing on for jobseeker's payment is 14% less than last year.  I agree that the unemployment rate is far too high for anybody to be less than deeply concerned about it.  Finally, the figures have begun to move in the right direction.  That progress and momentum is important.  Once there is a start in the right direction, confidence builds confidence and builds expansion.<\/p><p>  In regard to young people, Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh suggested that as many as one in four young are unemployed.  That is not true.  Many young people in Ireland, as Senator Daly will be aware, are choosing to remain longer in education, completing masters degrees and so on in order to make themselves more job ready.  We also have demographics where we have peaked currently in terms of 18 year olds but we have a large number of young children so that there is a little change and we estimate that we have lost probably 20,000 people under the age of 25 to emigration-migration.  It is heartbreaking for the families of those who are emigrating, who having reared their children during the Celtic tiger, felt that emigration was a choice rather than a necessity.  For many parents, notwithstanding the availability of social media and Skype, it is difficult to see their children and grandchildren depart.  Our hope is that because many of the people who go abroad are highly educated we will be in a position to welcome them back home in the next few years.<\/p><p>  As of today, there are about 5,870 job vacancies advertised on the Department's job bank website, up 20% on this time last year.  It is clear from <i>hired.ie , <\/i>a website that aggregates vacancies from all public and private sites, that there are about 22,500 jobs advertised.  Some of these may be duplicates.  The role of activation is to try to ensure that as many of these jobs as possible are filled by people from the live register.  We have now had two positive quarters of growth in employment levels in the first two quarters of 2013.  In terms of people looking at Ireland's debt sustainability, particularly those from the US, even if that job growth is not as great as we would wish, it is as<b><\/b>Senator Mary Ann O'Brien said, a positive start and we must build on that momentum.<\/p><p>  I agree with Senator John Kelly in respect of changing the culture.  Everybody knows of some families where if the children have not got on particularly well in school that at the age of 18, they sign on.  Speaking as a Minister for Social Protection I would like to see us move to a culture and a policy change where that would not happen, that instead one would do something else, such as giving to one's community through participation.  &quot;Participation&quot; is a key word.  It may be that in some communities or areas it is very difficult to get a job but contributing to one's own community is one way to start.  I was happy to be able to negotiate the youth guarantee framework during the Irish Presidency when my colleague Ministers came to Dublin last February.  This is an issue not only for Ireland but the whole of Europe.  One must have hope in terms of young people.  It is our responsibility to create pathways and opportunities for them, to coax and cajole them, and make it attractive for them.  In terms of a social contract we almost have to reach further back into schools.  In looking at education and training we must have a vision for the future of young people as they come through.  One can see this among students in transition who are involved in entrepreneurship courses of various kinds.  We have to start transmitting the message, &quot;Yes you can do it&quot;. <\/p><p>  In regard to back to education courses, where we support about 25,000 people at second and third level, questions were asked by Senator<b><\/b>Mary Ann O'Brien and others about the training of the case management officers.  This is a new direction for the Department of Social Protection.  We have community welfare officers who are very experienced in one-on-one interviews.  When the community welfare officer service came into the Department there were more than 700 one-hour or two-hour long clinics by community welfare officers in locations around the country.  We examined the issue and found that a modern quality telephone service would do much.  Where the Intreo offices are developed - we are relying on the Office of Public Works to roll them out as quickly as possible - we do not need the emergency payments of supplementary welfare assistance.  <\/p><p>  In areas such as Sligo, one can get one's jobseeker's payment or other payments sorted within a week.  Contrary to what Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said - I said this to him during the debate on the recent Social Welfare Bill - Sinn F&eacute;in's figures are out of order in terms of delays.  They refer back to figures several years ago.  In fairness to the staff, particularly in Longford but also in Letterkenny, there has been a huge reduction in the delays because we have put in place new IT platforms.  We have cleared all the backlogs on FIS, domiciliary care allowance and carer's allowance and we are working on disability issues.  The question of whether everybody who makes an application receives the award is a different matter.  We are working on improving the quality of application and information that people provide.  That the backlogs have been cleared is a tribute to the staff who have been able to do that.<\/p> <p>We have also made changes in the circumstances allowing people to qualify for FIS payments and for self-employed people and farmers who suffer catastrophic losses of income.  It used be the case that accounts covering a long period had to be submitted.  Eighty-five percent of people who had been self-employed and who made applications for social welfare are now getting jobseeker's allowance.  Their contribution of 4% does not entitle them to jobseeker's benefit, but if they have suffered a catastrophic loss of earnings we allow them to present updated information, which will be examined in detail.  Some 85% of those applications have been successful.  A critical reason people might not get much support is that they may have a spouse who is working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500036#KK00200","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380120900,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Will the Minister explain why the appeals system takes so long?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500037#LL00200","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1380120900,"counter":140,"content":"<p>That is an independent process, although it falls within the remit of the Department of Social Protection.  I expect that as we improve IT platforms, that system will improve.  Those in the appeals system have been working to clear the backlogs, some of which arose due to the fact that when the economy hit the wall there was an enormous upsurge in applications, under every heading, for social welfare.  Many of the IT platforms needed to be renewed and I made a decision that we would go for an update and renewal.  This has taken some time, but I am happy to report that with regard to the first three schemes - FIS, domiciliary care allowance and carer's allowance - the new systems are now installed.<\/p><p>In regard to dealing with employers, I agree with everybody that we should communicate more with employers on this.  It is a budgetary issue, but it is important.  Today, the Taoiseach and I met the labour market advisory council that I have established in the Department.  The council is chaired by Martin Murphy, CEO of Hewlett Packard, and on it are a significant number of people from the private sector, such as Heather Reynolds, who is one of the chief executives of Eishtec in Waterford.  Also on the council is the labour market economist John Martin, the recently retired deputy director of the OECD.  The council will work in depth with knowledgeable people on how to get more people back to work.<\/p><p>Comments have been made on the OECD.  Much of the commentary in this regard is about what did not happen in Ireland during the boom.  The OECD has said that if we had adopted an activation approach during our economic boom, we would have entered the downturn with 100,000 fewer people unemployed.  We did not and as a result we must start from our current position.  With due respect to Senator White, the fact is that employment fell off a cliff in Ireland after the bank and construction collapse, resulting in a loss of 250,000 jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500037#LL00300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities: Motion","time":1380120900,"counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500037#LL00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1380120900,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to the House.<\/p><p>Before we begin our debate, I would like to announce a correction to the Government amendment to the motion on the Supplementary Order Paper.

The reality, however, has been very different.  Over the past two years, there have been major cuts in services for people with disabilities.  Some, such as the &euro;300 annual reduction in the respite care grant, which was implemented last year, have been up-front budget cuts, but others have been stealth cuts.  For example, capping special needs assistants at a time of rising enrolments has amounted to an effective cut, whatever the Government's counter-motion wishes to claim.<\/p><p>  No matter how many times the Government tries to pretend otherwise, putting a cap on the number of special needs assistants at a time when the number of kids with special needs in schools is increasing means that schools are not in a position to give children the services they need and to which they are entitled.  All Senators have met families affected by this cut in SNAs.  Last night I attended a public meeting organised by the INTO in Ayrfield and it is organising similar meetings across the country in the run-up to the budget.  At that meeting, a number of parents spoke very emotionally about how special needs cuts have affected their children, both in terms of SNAs and the reduction in resource teaching hours.  <\/p><p>  Despite the row-back by the Government a couple of months ago, resource teaching hours have been reduced by 15% over two years.  The proposal made a few months ago to reduce this by a further 10% was overturned, but the previous cuts still stand.  The result is that a child with autism who was entitled to five hours of resource teaching is now getting only 85% of that.  This makes a huge difference in terms of that child's ability to engage in education and the opportunity to get the extra support he or she needs for real inclusion.  From the point of view of the teachers, they are left in a heartbreaking situation in which a child has been brought into the mainstream classroom so as to have the opportunities that come with that, but that child is not getting the support he or she needs to avail of those opportunities.  This is heartbreaking not just for parents but for teachers also.<\/p><p>  We have also seen a wide range of other cuts.  For example, funding for university access programmes for students with disabilities was cut by 20% in 2012.  Provision for school leavers with intellectual disabilities has also been cut, as highlighted by Inclusion Ireland.  I am aware that Members from all parties attended the Inclusion Ireland briefing, not just this summer but also the previous year, where they expressed their concerns about whether there would be sufficient places for school leavers this September.<\/p> <p>We all took at face value the Government's announcement last year as bona fide that that situation would not occur again and it would ensure sufficient resources were put in place so that young people with intellectual disabilities who are finishing the second level system would have adequate education, training places or day placements to give them the same opportunities every other young person takes for granted.  When the latter finish their leaving certificate they decide whether they wish to go on to the third level and study at a PLC college or use other further education services - a range of services is offered to them, whereas children with intellectual disabilities do not have that choice.<\/p><p>I have written to the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Lynch, about the matter over the past couple of months.  The Government's response is that placements are offered to all the young people affected.  However, what is happening on the ground is that young people who would have previously got full-time placements are being given only part-time hours, which is woefully inadequate.  They have no input into the type of services they are given, so they are being asked to fit into what is on offer rather than what suits their needs and abilities.  The situation is deeply upsetting for the young people and their families.<\/p><p>Earlier this year, the Government also announced that the mobility allowance is to be discontinued without putting in place an alternative.  That is another decision that does not seem to have been thought through.  It took people with severe disabilities protesting outside Leinster House before the Government would even listen to what impact the policy would have.<\/p><p>We have tabled this debate in advance of the budget to flag these issues because we do not want to be in a position in a couple of weeks time when Ministers make similar cuts only for them then to say they had not really thought about how they would affect people but that they would now consider that.  We want the issues to be on the agenda.  We hope that Members of all parties will lobby Ministers over the coming weeks to ensure that that is the case.  I know that some Fine Gael and Labour Senators were deeply uncomfortable with having to support last year's cut in the respite care grant.  We had an emotional debate in this House about that cut - the vote was very close.  Labour lost one of its Senators over the issue, which was regrettable.  Senator Gilroy might disagree - perhaps that is why he is smiling at me or perhaps he wants to lose more Senators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500037#LL00600","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380121500,"counter":145,"content":"<p>It is your touching sympathy for us that makes me smile.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500038#MM00200","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1380121500,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I thought he would be inclined to join Fianna F&aacute;il.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500038#MM00300","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1380121500,"counter":147,"content":"<p>Members on all sides of the House in the course of that debate expressed sympathy for the people involved and said that they wished the cuts had not happened and that they would lobby Ministers after the event to have them overturned, but the cut stands.  All we are asking is that, ahead of the budget, Members put pressure on Ministers to avoid a similar situation happening again.<\/p><p>Other cuts in the past year include the housing adaption grants, which saw funding to local authorities cut by 38% on average.  That led to a farcical situation two months ago when Dublin City Council had to close down the grant scheme altogether.  It is in the position that when someone has a serious accident or disability and cannot return home because of something simple such as a lack of a ramp, downstairs toilet or guard rails for their showers, he or she is left in hospital instead.  That is deeply damaging not only to that person's dignity and independence, but it costs the State far more because the person is stuck in the health system when they would rather be at home.  The cuts are in so many ways socially incredibly unfair and economically silly.  They simply do not stand up and the Government will end up having to spend more in other areas.    <\/p><p>As Senator O'Brien will outline in more detail there have also been huge cuts to St. Michael's House and similar services.  I am more familiar with St. Michael's House than other areas because they serve many people in north Dublin and I know that Members will be familiar with other services with which I am not.  St. Michael's House has had to reduce its staffing levels across the organisation, including in day services, clinical services and administration.  It has been forced to implement a contraction of its residential and respite service and it has had to close its residential day service for one day each month.  Elderly parents have spoken to me about that and they have been upset about how they are going to look after an adult child with a disability on that day because they feel that they are not able to look after them for the day yet the person is being forced out of the day service.  In addition, St. Michael's House has had its trainee allowance ended and the transport services have been reduced.  Due to the huge cuts in its HSE grant, they have had to cut services right across the board. <\/p><p>There have been a whole range of areas in which major cuts have occurred affecting people with disabilities over the past three years.  Fianna F&aacute;il accepts fully that cuts must be made.  There is still speculation about the size of this year's budget and the tax increases and expenditure cuts needed to reach our target, whether that is &euro;3.1 billion or a smaller amount.  Unlike other parties, we are not arguing about the need for cuts.  Indeed, I was at a meeting last night in which another former Member of the Labour Party stood up and said that there was no need for any austerity or cuts in the budget, that everything could be rosy in the garden and nobody would be affected.  That is not credible.  I have never argued that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500038#MM00400","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1380121500,"counter":148,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1380121500,"counter":149,"content":"<p>It not a fair message to the parents.  We must all accept economic realities.  However, there are alternatives, and last year we proposed an alternative budget that reached the same overall target as the one implemented by the Government but that protected services, including mental health services and those for people with disabilities.  We will do the same again this year.  All we ask is that the Government consider fairer alternatives, such as increasing the universal social charge by 3% for people who earn more than &euro;100,000.  I do not understand why that was not done last year; it is precisely the type of policy that should be looked at before making the unthinkable disability cuts that I have mentioned.<\/p><p>As I have said, the purpose of the debate is to highlight the cuts that have already been made.  That is not to score a political point, but to ensure that Members are aware of how wide the cuts are.  I know that Members will be aware of the cuts relating to their individual briefs.  For example, while some may be aware of the education cuts, they may not be conscious of all the other cuts that people with disabilities have experienced.  As the Disability Federation of Ireland constantly points out, as well as seeing reductions in specific services for people with disabilities, people have also had their basic payments cut, so they are experiencing a double whammy, and the cuts are having a doubly unfair effect.  <\/p><p>As I said, the primary reason for tabling the motion is to get in ahead of the budget and to signal that disabilities should be prioritised and to seek all-party support for that approach.  We were hopeful that the Government would not table an amendment and that we would all agree that this area deserves support from us all.  Unfortunately,  I saw this morning that such an amendment was tabled, which is regrettable.  However, I ask Members that, should there be a vote later and we walk to opposite sides of the lobby, if in their hearts they agree that disability services should be protected, they should at least use the next few weeks to reach out to their Government and ask them to ensure that in making choices in the next budget they pick ones that are fairer than those picked last year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500038#MM00450","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1380121500,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I second the motion.

I only learned this morning that the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch is in hospital and that she would not be here to take the debate.  I wish her well in her recovery.<\/p><p>Since mid-August I have called for the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, as the senior health Minister, to comment on the most recent cuts to St. Michael's House to which Senator Power alluded.  I will cover some of those matters, but that is just an example of other services in Dublin and across the country that have been cut.  Why did the Government feel it appropriate to announce the cuts in August during the recess and why did it backdate those cuts to 1 July?<\/p> <p>In the case of St. Michael's House, &euro;1 million was taken out of its budget.  It was announced at the end of August but backdated to 1 July.  It makes it nearly impossible for the service to manage the reduction in its budget.<\/p><p>The Government tends to forget that the period to 2011 featured some of the toughest budgets every announced, a point it tends to forget when it talks about the level of adjustments it has made.  There have been six incredibly difficult budgets, four of which were delivered by the previous Government.  In the 2011 budget there was an effective total cut of 1.9% in disability services.  It was made in consultation with the Disability Federation of Ireland.  The Government has no regard for the sector.  There has been an 80% cut in respite services for children in the north east.  In the cases of St. Michael's House and the Del Val house, on which the Minister for Health will not comment, four respite beds have been taken out of circulation completely.  I will not talk about the medical cards being withdrawn from children with disabilities.  We all know about it and it is happening every single day of the week.  People are being asked to reapply and for reviews.  As the Government directs the HSE, I do not like the idea of blaming the HSE for everything.  The Minister appointed the board and Mr. O'Brien without interview.  The HSE board is the Minister's board and the HSE is an arm of government.  Medical cards are being withdrawn; day care services have been reduced and, in the case of St. Michael's House, I learned last night that in residential locations for adults with Down's syndrome medical services were being stopped between 10.30 a.m. and 2.30 p.m.  I have the specific details from an email and a conversation I had yesterday evening.  Between the hours of 10.30 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. there is no emergency medical cover in a number of the houses.  This is the effect of the cut of &euro;1 million for that service on 1,500 people in the north east.  I use this as an example, but it could be replicated throughout the Twenty-six Counties.<\/p><p>I ask colleagues to think about why these cuts are happening.  The Minister mismanaged his budget last year.  He brought forward a budget last year that required a &euro;300 million supplementary budget the day before the Christmas recess.  He produced a budget before the start of this year that we said did not stack up.  This has been already proved.  In the first five months of the year he was already &euro;100 million over budget.  He will require another supplementary budget at the end of the year and will probably come in, under cover of darkness when there is no one in the D&aacute;il Chamber, to have it rubberstamped by the Government.  We must get control of spending.  Difficult decisions have been made, but I remind both parties what was said in advance of the last general election.  The Minister's party leader, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, said the Labour Party would be &quot;looking after people with disabilities&quot;.  The Taoiseach said he agreed with this and felt an absolute priority should be the 300,000 people who suffered from mental illness every year.  How can these comments be married with the reality of what the Government is doing?  My colleague has mentioned the cuts to the mobility allowance and the respite care grant.  They delayed the passage of the Social Welfare Act in this House and it was almost defeated.  It is a pity that some people did not support it, as difficult a decision as it might have been.<\/p><p>This is in advance of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, bringing forward budgets on 15 October.  We have had no formal discussion in either House on ring-fencing budgets.  In an alternative budget last year we showed that it could be done.  Difficult choices must be made elsewhere and if the Government states it must raise taxes or cut transport services, most people will agree with it in the interests of protecting those with mental and physical disabilities and the elderly.  All I ask, in the absence of the Minister of State and the continued absence of the Minister for Health is for the Leader to do his level best and ask colleagues on the Government side to lobby Ministers to ensure funding for the disability sector is, at the very least, ring-fenced and protected from further cuts.  I remind colleagues of what happened last year when some &euro;8 million worth of home help hours were taken out of the system.  There was an apparent U-turn which we welcomed at the time.  The Minister for Health said it would not happen, but that was untrue.  He kept the budget the same as it was the previous year, even though more people had applied for home help services.

Members from all sides send her our very best wishes.  She is very passionate about disability services.  <\/p><p>  This is a very reasonable amendment.  I thank my colleagues on the other side of the House for putting disability services on the agenda.  It is, however, regrettable to see so few Members in the Chamber for such an important Private Members' debate.  <\/p><p>  There is agreement on all sides of the House on the need to protect services for people with disabilities.  Some of the cuts that took place last year were painful and we all found them difficult.  It has not been easy and the Government parties lost one colleague.  I will give credit to the previous Minister of State, John Moloney, who was excellent.  He saw the waste in certain areas of expenditure and initiated a value for money audit which the Government continues to support.  It was carried out by Mr. Laurence Crowley.  The recommendations were groundbreaking and proposed a system of funding individuals, known as individualised budgeting.  It is a commitment in the programme for Government.  At least, John Moloney did not keep throwing good money after bad and decided that it was time to carry out a proper evaluation of the money spent on disability services.<\/p><p>  People often talk about the astronomical salaries paid to chief executives and senior management in the NGO sector in providing supports for people with disabilities.  It is even more regrettable that a number of the charities and NGOs refused to publish the bonuses paid to senior management, citing the fact that the bonuses were paid from charitable donations, not by the taxpayer.<\/p> <p>As far as I am concerned, the people of the State were the ones who were making the charitable donations, just as it was they who were paying the taxes that were supporting the senior management salaries in the first place.  When we talk about disability services, we must talk about the whole system.  We must talk about waste in administration and administration costs, including rent.<\/p><p>The body that nominated me to run for the Seanad is known as People with Disabilities in Ireland, PWDI.  The Government removed its funding in my first year as a Senator, rightly so, because 92% of it was being spent on renting offices and paying travel expenses and wages.  Only 8% of the funding actually went to provide meaningful support and training for people with disabilities.  That is the type of thing that went on under the previous Government.  Nobody here is to blame for this.  What I describe is the type of cleaning up that had to be done.  There was a barrage of criticism when the funding was removed from PWDI, but I supported the decision because it was the right thing to do.  When one gives &euro;1.6 million to an organisation, one must ensure one is getting value for money.  If one gives &euro;1.60 to somebody, one expects to get value for money.<\/p><p>There will, I hope, be no further deterioration in services for people with disabilities.  I will be the first to acknowledge that the communication of decisions in recent years on alterations of supports for people with disabilities was badly handled.  That has been agreed by everybody.  I firmly believe the Government is totally committed to ensuring the money being spent on front-line services for people with disabilities and their supporters will be maintained.  However, no Government would be doing its job right if it did not try to ensure savings could be achieved in administration, at senior management level and in office rental costs.  When an organisation, particularly a very big one, loses 5% of its budget, there is plenty of scope for ensuring money can be saved in administration and other areas without having to hit the people on the front line.  It is far too easy for organisations to send people with disabilities out to protest when they know well that making cuts to senior management wages, etc., would be the appropriate approach.<\/p><p>Today I was at the launch of a training programme for organisations providing support for sports groups.  The idea of the training manual is to ensure all people with disabilities have access to sports facilities.  The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, launched the programme, with individuals such as Mr. John Delaney, chief executive of the FAI, and representatives from the GAA and other organisations.  The programme is run on a shoestring budget and supported by the Government.  Great value for money is achieved from it.<\/p><p>The money being spent on support structures for people with disabilities is more than adequate.  The problem is that we are not getting value for money.  The amendment to the motion which I am proposing outlines the commitment of the Government to ensuring the people who should benefit most benefit.  A clean, lean, properly funded operation with no waste is the ultimate goal.  That goal is shared by my colleagues on the other side of the House.  In fairness to Fianna F&aacute;il, it has used its Private Members' time to highlight issues surrounding disability.  That can only be good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500039#NN01000","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380122700,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Like my colleagues, I sympathise greatly with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I am very upset to hear she is still unwell.  <\/p><p>I thank Senators Averil Power and Darragh O'Brien for tabling the motion.  It covers an area in which we all have a great interest.  I am sorry there are not more Members present; I do not know where they are.  We know we are in hard times and face considerable challenges and problems, but, as other speakers have said, there is nothing more important than protecting the most vulnerable in society, which is why we are here.<\/p><p>Rather than being highbrow, I will just focus on some reality stories of people I have encountered in recent months and the problems encountered.  Not all of I will say will be critical of the Government and its performance in this area.  The motion is very broad and deals with a considerable variety of issues relating to disabilities.  Consequently, I contend the Government is doing very well in certain areas when it comes to protecting people with disabilities.  However, there have been times when it has let itself down very badly.  At other times, its good work is not being communicated properly.  There is a lack of joined-up thinking across various Departments and even within Departments which is a symptom right across government, not alone in the area of disability.<\/p><p>The time of the respite care grant cut last December was one of the most depressing any of us has ever spent in the Seanad.  It was my view at the time and remains my view that the Government showed a lack of compassion and comprehension of what the payment meant to families and the unnecessary stress and pain caused to families in the intervening months.  I could spend time discussing a week in the life of a Jack &amp;amp; Jill Children's Foundation family; suffice it to say we all know people affected by the cut.  As I always say, we are all so lucky because one does not really know the reality unless one is a member of the affected families.  We could all use the term &quot;elitist&quot; in respect of ourselves unless we went to somebody's house and just said we cut the grant.<\/p><p>I hope that when the budget is announced in mid-October, it will be completely proofed.  That is why we are here.  I hope it will be completely proofed against savage, unjust measures such as the respite care grant cut we witnessed last year.   If we have to cut something in the area if disability, please let it not be anything on the front line.  I hate even saying that, but I am just trying to think of something.  Senator Martin Conway spoke about administrative costs and salaries in the many disability services.  Advocacy is the only area I can think of that might be subject to a cut if we have to cut something.  <\/p><p>Delays in processing disability allowances and the carer's allowance which comprise a well seasoned problem have been discussed over and over.  I am certain that the Minister of State will tell us that there has been an improvement in application processing rates and that any delay is caused by an increased volume of applications.   I believe the Minister of State in respect of an improvement, but it is not being felt on the ground.  I have a letter on my desk upstairs from a Jack &amp;amp; Jill Children's Foundation family.  Such families comprise the majority of my constituents.  Has anybody looked after a baby with a disability who takes 20 hours per day to mind?  Applicants must take 11 items into account, including documentation on one's mortgage, proof of marriage and documents that even those of us without a child with a disability could not readily find.  Applicants have 20 working days in which to find the documentation.  They receive a letter to this effect before they can renew their medical cards.  There has to be a way, but we are fighting all the time.  I have tabled an amendment on the subject.<\/p><p>There is a lack of joined-up thinking.  I am aware of the case of the young lady with a disability who is going to study in the United Kingdom this year to better herself.  This is great news.  As she is a good citizen, she has already communicated to the disability service that she does not need her allowance and needs to be transferred to an education allowance.  She has gone to Edinburgh, but her disability allowance has been cut, although her education allowance has not come through.  She should not have been a good citizen; she should have allowed the disability allowance to continue until she received the other one.  We now have a citizen who has gone to better herself by way of further education in Edinburgh and who will have to endure at least two months without any contribution from the State.  She is asking for her education allowance.  What is she to do for two months?<\/p><p>On the topic of the disability allowance, I am aware of two cases of blind people who have secured employment.  I wish to be upbeat about people with disabilities.  Senators will all know Kevin who works for me.  He is a magnificent person who has taught me so much.  One or two of the people to whom I refer are friends of his who have gained employment.<\/p> <p>The disability section asked to be informed by letter but these people are blind so they cannot write letters.  They asked those in the service if the submissions could be made by e-mail but they do not accept confirmation in that way.  I need not go on and what I am saying is almost laughable.  It is a true story but it demonstrates a waste of administration time.  I know sometimes we do not like e-mail because of the possibility of fraudulent activity.  Perhaps we should not even mention that.<\/p><p>There is a disturbing case of a child in Donegal who is leaving the children's system to go to the adult system.  The parents were told there are no services left.  The child's parents are strong people and once this process started, they contacted the people involved in the services.  To make a long story short, there were services available and, although I hate to say it, the HSE and the Government were telling lies.  I could tell the proper long story in this regard, as the people were told there were budget restrictions or no spaces available.  At one stage they were told three days were available but in the end, a five-day service is available for the child.  Why are there such discrepancies in the system?<\/p><p>Thank God we are putting a regulator in place as we need to examine the administration costs.  The charity sector is getting &euro;4 billion and Senator Conway addressed some of the issues.  The Minister is representing us at the Cabinet table and should think carefully before we act in such a way as to affect any of these people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500040#OO00200","speaker":"1169","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380123300,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber and I add my voice to those wishing another Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, my good friend and constituency colleague, a speedy recovery.

It is important we have this conversation in advance of the budget and that is a benefit of today's motion.  Nobody has a monopoly on concern in the area and there is no question that there have been cuts.  Of course it is unsatisfactory that we have seen cuts, although I am afraid I supported cuts last year.  On balance, although it was difficult, the savings had to be found.  We can call the process a reduction, reallocation or whatever we want, but no matter what they are called, they are cuts because they affect ordinary people's lives.  That they do so in a negative way is regrettable.<\/p><p>Senator Power acknowledged the necessity for reductions in the general economy, and to find sufficient savings, one must go to the big-spending Departments, which include those dealing with social welfare, health and education.  If we do not look for savings in such Departments, we could take every penny from other Departments and not make sufficient savings.  No matter how we make reductions or cuts in the Departments, they will be perceived as being unfair by the people affected.  That is a truth that must be acknowledged.<\/p><p>Does this mean we can stand back and not make any cuts?  We cannot do so, although the motion before us asks us to.  We will probably vote on whether it should be done now.  Senator Power has argued that if we feel in our hearts that this is the wrong action, we should act accordingly, which is a very good point.  We should do that in this Chamber a bit more often.  It may be premature to support or reject a motion at this time and lose the Whip because of the way our democratic party system works in this and the other House.<\/p><p>We can examine what is proposed in the budget rather than getting ahead of ourselves in seeing what cuts, reductions in service or reallocations will be made.  At that time we could decide whether to support such action; that is what I intend to do.  I will support the amendment to the motion but I welcome today's discussion, which is very important.  We should have such discussions on every issue between now and budget day, teasing out the matters.  That is a function of this House and we should leave aside party political allegiances until the budget is published.  At that stage we can decide if our parties are correct and make decisions accordingly.

There are 600,000 people with disabilities of one form or another in the country, and they should be protected in the best way possible.  That amounts to 18.5% of the population having some form of disability, and the manner in which the Government gives support is critical.  To clarify the matter for my learned friend opposite, mismanagement in the health services is an issue, with budgets going over every year since the current Government took office.  Extra funding is being sought for the running of the health service because the Minister, Deputy Reilly, has not been able to grapple with it or get on top of the brief, despite being in the Department for two and a half years.<\/p><p>People with special needs, those needing resource teachers and people with intellectual disabilities have all had services cut, with allowances reduced as well despite promises they would be protected.  There is the issue of the health services, its funding and the fact that it is unable to manage its budget, with continuous overruns.  That means the Minister is required to seek extra funding to pay for what are mostly wages.<\/p> <p>We have cases in Kerry in which funding, instead of being given to people with Down's syndrome and their families, is diverted to care providers and others for speech and physical therapy.

We agreed, with the British Government, that these languages would get official recognition in the North and South.  While Irish Sign Language is recognised in the North of Ireland and policy has been put in place on the ground to implement it, here in the South there has been no implementation of it 15 years on from the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  I ask the Minister to make her Cabinet colleagues aware that it is a fundamental breach of international law and a disgraceful act for a government to sign up to an international agreement in good faith and then to blatantly ignore its provisions.<\/p><p>When the Good Friday Agreement was signed, interpreters had to be physically in the room.  With modern technology one can have online interpreters.  We can imagine how difficult it is for a member of the deaf community to explain his or her symptoms to a doctor.  Something lost in translation could have a detrimental effect on the outcome.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, gave us an excellent presentation on how unemployed people no longer have two-hour interviews in person, but do it over the phone.  For a member of the deaf community that is not a possibility.  Social welfare officers in offices around the country have computers.  An online interpreter engaged by appointment would allow members of the deaf community, many of whom are unlikely to get full-time employment and are therefore more likely to be in need of social welfare assistance, to engage with social welfare services.  Yet we have not put in place the infrastructure for them to do so and we continue to breach international agreements by failing to recognise Irish Sign Language.  I will introduce a Bill on this.

The more often disabilities are spoken about in this House the better.  I contributed two items, one of which was on employment rights for people with disabilities.  Only last year did public bodies reach the target for employing people with disabilities.  It is a small target at 3%, which amounts to 6,171 people.  I would like to see a more proactive approach.  That EU target was set in 1977.  The economy is not great now but hopefully we could re-examine that target.  We should not just try to meet a target.  We could put measures and supports in place that would make it easier for people.<\/p><p>I would like to see a scheme for public representatives here in the House.  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien mentioned this and we can do it.  A strategy should be laid down to ensure we are afforded the opportunity.  It is not easy to match needs with the facilities available.  In the area of internships, we have deals with various colleges.  There should be a deal with the disabilities associations.  Often people with a disability have difficulty getting experience.  It is like the chicken and the egg - which comes first, experience or a job?  I ask the Minister consider something like that to ensure the Members of this House do our bit in ensuring we reach the target.<\/p><p>When I was on South Dublin County Council, no local authority had reached the 3% target.  Now 88% of local authorities have reached it.  Targets work.  Our manager at the time, Mr. Joe Horgan, made us take a week to ensure there were strategies for employing people with disabilities, Travellers and people with different types of expertise.  They all bring their own expertise and we can learn from everybody in our own employment.  Everybody has their own ability to bring to us.<\/p><p>The first Adjournment debate matter I tabled in this House was on Irish Sign Language, because I have been campaigning for it for years.  I established the Model School for the Deaf in Irish Sign Language in north Dublin with Mr. Brian Crean and Dr. John Bosco Conama.  It was a pilot project that went on for three years, after which funding was pulled.  I would like this Government to do what it can on Irish Sign Language.  Senator Conway has a motion coming up but I would like to see more than motions.  It was sad yesterday that people supporting the Irish Deaf Society had to parade outside the D&aacute;il gates to bring it to our attention once more.  When Fianna F&aacute;il was in power I came here on many delegations to try to get something done.  I met Minister after Minister and nothing was done.  I would like to see this Government doing even one small thing.  There are not huge numbers of people out there, but it is their culture.  It has nothing to do with the Irish language.<\/p> <p>It is their culture.  They want it and they should be afforded the means.  I am involved in the North-South body and I raised the issue in that context because, as Senator Daly noted, it is part of the North-South agreement.  I proposed a motion which was passed by all of the Parliaments, including Wales, Northern Ireland and England, and forwarded to the relevant Ministers.  We are waiting for a report on the matter before considering whether we can proactively engage on the basis of the North-South agreement on Irish sign language.  The issue is more advanced in the North, although it is not yet a statutory right.  I believe we could work together to do something in this regard.<\/p><p>I want to ensure there are no cuts to this area in the forthcoming budget but when I asked about it, I received a note from the Government stating that it has passionately defended the provision of special education spending since it came to office.  Some &euro;1.3 billion will be spent on supports for children with special educational needs this year.  I hope some of that goes to Irish sign language.  We are only seeking a small percentage of the overall budget.  The Government has said it will continue to provide 1,100 teaching posts in special schools.  The National Council for Special Education has also opened 118 new special classes for the 2013-14 school year, which means that 740 special classes are currently in place.  This represents an increase of more than 40% in the number of special classes being provided since the 2010-11 school year.  It is not all bad news, therefore.  The Government is doing what it can in the context of our current situation.<\/p><p>It is important that we contribute to this debate.  I have attended three debates already and some of the Senators who contributed in this debate were not in the House for the earlier debates.  It is difficult to be in the House all the time.  I was late coming to this debate but I followed it on the monitor.  The fact that Senators are not in the Chamber does not necessarily mean they are not interested.  They are following the debate on their monitors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500042#QQ01400","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380124500,"counter":199,"content":"<p>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for disability, equality, mental health and older people, Ms Kathleen Lynch, I welcome this opportunity to put on the record of the House the Government's commitment to the provision of effective and responsive public services for people with disabilities and to strongly re-affirm the Government's commitment to the national disability strategy.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has expressed to this House her strongly felt view that people with disabilities are not ill and do not require to be fixed.  What people need is for us to break down the barriers which society puts in the way of them living a full life that is worth living.  They also need the supports necessary for them to live a fully inclusive life.  This is the aim of the national disability strategy, which was launched in September 2004 and which continues to be the focus of Government policy for the sector.  The programme for Government contained a commitment to publication of the first ever implementation plan for the strategy and to the achievement of even greater levels of progress in progressing the strategy over the next three years.  With this in mind, the Minister established and is personally chairing the national disability strategy implementation group, which was tasked with developing and monitoring the implementation plan.  I am happy to report that the plan was approved by the Government and published in July of this year.<\/p><p>The aim of the implementation plan is to engage with the disability sector and build on the traditional problem solving and constructive approach of the community and voluntary sector.  Acknowledging the current economic climate and diminished resources available across government - in the spirit of Seanad harmony I will not refer to the fact that the previous Government signed up to the troika agreement - this implementation plan seeks to ensure available resources are used to best effect in ensuring people with disabilities have more choice and control in their lives and in achieving their aspirations for the future.  This aim is also fundamental to the value for money and policy review of the health funded disability services which the Minister of State published last year.  The value for money review will be pivotal in progressing and supporting the implementation of significant elements of the national disability strategy.  The review also echoes the health care reforms signalled in Future Health, the Government's blueprint for the restructuring of the health services over the coming years.<\/p><p>Collaboration is key to progressing the national disability strategy and the value for money review.  The Minister of State is a passionate exponent of the motto &quot;Nothing about us, without us&quot; and is committed to working with people with disabilities and to opening channels of communication wherever she can.  To this end, she set up a disability forum under the stewardship of the National Disability Authority.  The first meeting of the forum was held in June last year and the views expressed at it provided an input into the development of the national disability strategy implementation plan.<\/p><p>This is a time of major change in the delivery of social care in this country and we have embarked on a transformation programme that will put the citizen at the heart of everything we do.  This change can best be illustrated by the disability services provided by the health sector, in which regard we are at the start of a journey to migrate from a segregated, group delivered service to a person-centred and individually chosen supports model.  The implementation of this new model requires a more effective, transparent and accountable use of the &euro;1.5 billion in funding which the Government is providing to the HSE this year for its national service plan.  Within the funding provided, the Minister for Health has emphasised to the HSE that it must maximise the provision of services within available resources and maintain a consistent level of service compared to that provided in 2012.  Both the HSE and the voluntary disability service providers have introduced significant efficiencies over recent years to remain within budget and the HSE has advised that these changes have not resulted in service contraction.<\/p><p>Despite the difficult economic conditions in which we find ourselves, there can be no compromise on the quality and safety of the services we deliver.  Earlier this year, the Minister of State launched a set of standards for residential services and she hopes to be in a position to announce shortly that the regulations to allow the scheme of registration and inspection to commence on 1 October have been signed.  The regulations, which will be enforced by the Health Information and Quality Authority, seek to ensure that the unique and complex needs of each child and adult with a disability in a residential service are met in an appropriate and effective manner by service providers and their staff.  This is a positive development for both service users and service providers.  We believe that it will set the bar for quality care in the years ahead.<\/p><p>The way in which we support people with disabilities to live normal lives is undergoing a seismic change.  The process of moving away from congregated settings towards a community-based model of residential services has been happening gradually for a number of years and is now gathering momentum.  At this point I would like to highlight the co-operation between myself and the Minister of State, and between our respective Departments, in regard to housing issues.  My Department, together with the Department of Health, has developed a housing strategy for people with disabilities and an implementation framework for that strategy which aims to support people with disabilities to live in their communities and to have maximum independence and choice.  Collaboration on the housing strategy is an excellent example of the cross-sectoral working and whole-of-government approach which is a central theme of the national disability strategy.  I have had a number of meetings with the Minister of State on this topic and from my perspective as Minister of State with responsibility for housing, I have highlighted the importance of addressing the needs of people with disabilities.  The funding I administered recently was allocated to local authorities solely for the purpose of housing people with disabilities.<\/p><p>I will now turn to the subject of education.  This Government has passionately defended the provision for special educational spending since coming into office.  Some &euro;1.3 billion, or 15% of the entire education budget, will be spent in support of children with special educational needs this year.  This provision is in line with expenditure in recent years and shows that despite the current economic difficulties, funding for special education has not been cut.  This year we will again provide funding for 10,575 special needs assistant posts.  There has been no reduction to the overall number of SNA posts available for allocation to schools.  In June 2013 the Minister for Education and Skills authorised the National Council for Special Education to maintain the level of resource teachers at the 2012 levels.  There will not be a reduction in resource teaching time compared with last year.<\/p><p>Education does not end with childhood, however, and people with disabilities are one of the target groups for the back to education initiative, which provides part-time further education programmes for adults.<\/p> <p>They may also avail of adult literacy and community education courses provided by the education and training boards throughout the country.<\/p><p>The fund for students with disabilities allocates funding to PLC colleges for the provision of services and supports to full-time students with disabilities.  The fund aims to ensure students can participate fully in their programmes.  The disability access route to education scheme also provides a third level admissions scheme for school leavers who have a disability or specific learning difficulty.<\/p><p>F&Aacute;S mainstream programmes are open to all unemployed individuals, including those with a disability.  In addition, this year F&Aacute;S will provide up to 3,000 places, through specialised training providers, for people with disabilities.  The Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Social Protection also support learners attending courses through the provision of payments, allowances and maintenance grants.<\/p><p>Every year young people finish their formal education and progress to the next stage of their lives.  For most children, including those with disabilities, the aim is that they progress directly to further education, vocational training or employment and I have described the resources provided by the Department of Education and Skills to facilitate this.  However, for more than 800 young people who have higher support needs, the requirement is for lifeskills training or day supports provided by the HSE.  After following an appropriate lifeskills training programme many of this cohort will also progress in time to mainstream training and employment, with personal social supports provided by the HSE where needed.<\/p><p>The HSE national service plan includes an additional &euro;4 million to provide training places and day services for young people who will finish their formal education this year.  However, the provision of services to an additional 800 young people is challenging even with the additional funding, and some may have to wait longer than others until a fully suitable placement or support service is available.  I know this is of concern to Senators.<\/p><p>Training is only part of the journey people with special needs must face to obtain longer-term sustainable employment.  In the area of disability activation, the Government is committed to supporting people to participate more fully in training and employment through activation measures, income supports and work-related supports.  The integration of the employment services and community services divisions of F&Aacute;S into the Department of Social Protection is enhancing the delivery of employment services for all people, including people with disabilities, and will assist in overcoming barriers in this area.  The Department has also launched a disability activation project, with funding of more than &euro;7 million, which aims to identify the optimum approaches to mainstreaming labour market activation measures for people with disabilities.  This may be of interest to Senator Keane who has raised specific issues with regard to the 3% target, activation for people with disabilities and job opportunities.<\/p><p>This brings me to the issue raised by Senators with regard to the processing of claims.  I assure Members of the Seanad the prompt processing of claims remains a priority for the Minister for Social Protection.  I am pleased to report the backlog in processing carer's allowance applications has been eliminated.  All backlogged disability allowance applications have been decided where possible, with the remainder awaiting additional information necessary to decide the claim, and the Minister for Social Protection has allocated additional staff to assist with this work.<\/p><p>The contribution people provide in caring for members of their own family is critical for society.  It was for this reason the Government last year adopted the national carers' strategy with a view to giving greater public recognition to carers and their work.  Carers receive significant income supports from the Department of Social Protection so people can continue living at home as long as possible. The supports available to carers in Ireland are among the highest rates of income support in Europe, and are expected to total &euro;776 million this year compared with an estimated outturn of &euro;771 million in 2012.<\/p><p>The issue of Irish sign language was raised by a number of Senators.  I am aware of the issue and when I first entered the D&aacute;il in 1998 I was spokesperson on equality and I met Dr. John Bosco Conama and others from the Irish sign language support group.  As Senator Daly acknowledged, nothing has been done so far but we are all aware it is an important issue.  I note Senator Conway stated he would table a motion on the issue.<\/p><p>I welcome the opportunity provided by the debate to put on the record the Government's position on services for people with disabilities.  There is an onus on us all to use the substantial resources committed to disability services throughout the public sector more effectively, but also to achieve better outcomes for this funding and to bring about a real and substantial improvement in the lives of people with disabilities.  This is a central tenet of the national disability strategy and a high priority for the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500043#RR00200","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380125100,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion.  It is very important and recognises the need to protect services for those who are most vulnerable in society, namely, those with disabilities who are more dependent on the State to provide services than any other group in society.  With regard to people with disabilities attaining educational advancement and the employment rates of people with disabilities, the most recent census showed the level of advancement for persons with disabilities was lower than for persons without disabilities.  This highlights the fact a disability can provide an immense difficulty for any individual, and as a result it is important compensation is provided, whether financial or through other resource supports, by the State.<\/p><p>I listened, in my office and in the Chamber, to what the Minister of State has said.  I do not doubt her enthusiasm for supporting the disability sector and individuals with disabilities, but unfortunately what is happening at present calls into question the support being provided to persons with disabilities, whether this is at primary, secondary or university educational level, through employment initiatives or through disability or social welfare payments.<\/p><p>I heard the Minister of State refer to social welfare payments, and I cannot agree with her that the processing of social welfare payments has been speeded up.  I am not sure what timeframe she means.  I presume she may be speaking about decisions on new applications.  Decisions may be made more quickly, but the vast majority of applications for carer's allowance, disability allowance, disability benefit, invalidity pension or any other payment are being refused.  The decisions may be made sooner, but the majority of all decisions are being refused.<\/p><p>I know of people diagnosed with very severe forms of cancer whose applications for disability payments were refused by the Department of Social Protection.  Individual members of their families or persons providing supports have applied for carer's allowance to support them but they have also been refused.  For God's sake let us introduce a system whereby any individual diagnosed with cancer is given all of the support available from the State during the illness.  There should be no qualification to this.  The best medical supports are available to those diagnosed with cancer but they do not always survive.  When they and their families are dealing with this illness they should be provided with the required support.  It is not acceptable for a civilised country to refuse payments to individuals diagnosed with cancer.  This is not a political point.  I see it every week dealing with people in clinics.<\/p><p>Recently I pleaded with the Minister for Social Protection during an Adjournment debate with regard to a case.  It was also dealt with through parliamentary questions and representations to the Minister with regard to getting the application processed.  The application was processed and a carer's payment was approved, but unfortunately it was approved a week after the individual died.  This is not acceptable.  We must have a new system in the Department of Social Protection to deal with genuine applications.  There has been abuse of the system, and I know some of the checks and balances in place are to deter abuse of the system and we all subscribe to this, but we must have a system which will support the genuine cases.<\/p> <p>I plead with the Minister of State to sit down with the Minister for Social Protection to look at this issue which needs to be dealt with as quickly as possible because we cannot allow the current situation to continue.<\/p><p>With regard to the disability cuts, there is the generic issue of the processing of claims.  While the social welfare budget is vast at some &euro;21 billion, cutting disability payments within the overall budget is wrong.  These payments should be ring-fenced.  There were cuts to the respite care grant and other disability payments in budget 2013 which I believe were wrong.  Every effort should be made to ensure no cuts are introduced that would affect anyone with a disability, physical, intellectual or otherwise.<\/p><p>The Minister has said no cuts are taking place, in so far as it is possible to do so.  However, I point to the case of specialist preschools for individuals who cannot feed themselves.  There were three such preschools in County Donegal, but one has closed, the one in Donegal town is not accepting new applications from this year and the other in Letterkenny will be closed from September 2014.  That is happening from within the Department of Health's budget.  These schools are being closed in line with the HSE service plan which is signed off on by the Minister and agreed at a national level, the regional plans which are agreed by the regional directors and the county plans which are agreed on a county-wide basis.  Because the funding is cut, services are being withdrawn.<\/p><p>I will support the Minister in every way, but we need to make sure funding for people with disabilities is ring-fenced and not cut in the forthcoming budget.  Unfortunately, the cuts that have taken place to date have been far too painful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500044#SS00200","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380125700,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I thank all those who contributed to the debate.  As I said at the start, this is an issue that should cross party lines.  I appreciate that members of all parties feel strongly about the need to protect services for people with disabilities.  I had hoped, when we tabled this Private Members' motion last week, that there would not be a Government counter-motion and that we would all be able to agree to the motion.  When writing it, I went to great lengths not to include anything in it that I thought would be difficult for Members of other parties to support.  That is why all it does is \"calls on the Government to provide the appropriate funding and services necessary to honour all its commitments to people with disabilities\".  I did not include anything political and kept it as basic as I could because I did not want to put other Members in a difficult position where they would feel they could not support it.  Therefore, I was disappointed to see that there was a counter-motion, as well as being disappointed with some of the language used in it.<\/p><p>Given that the counter-motion has been tabled and will be put to a vote, I want to explain why from our perspective we cannot support it.  It denies the fact that cuts have been made to education.  Although the total number of special needs assistants remains the same, as the Minister of State said, I point out that, owing to rising enrolments, this is an effective cut, regardless of how the Government wants to sell it.  <\/p><p>The Government amendment also points out that the Government has &quot;protected the numbers of resource teachers&quot; when there has been a 15% cut in the number of resource teaching hours.  It is difficult, therefore, for me to support this.  <\/p><p>I had hoped we would all be able to take the position of acknowledging the reality that cuts had been made in recent years and agree that this area should be protected from further cuts in the budget.  I regret that this does not seem to be the case.  That is why we will have to push our motion to a vote and also why we cannot accept the Government's counter-motion.  The reality is that people with disabilities have suffered greatly, as Senator Mary Ann O'Brien so eloquently pointed out in a quite upsetting way in actually putting before the House the reality of these cuts and the way they have affected people personally.  That can sometimes be lost in overall numbers or when one is saying the overall budget has been protected.  Because individual sectors have been hit - I outlined the impact on St. Michael's House services - the reality is that the personal experience of people with disabilities has deteriorated greatly in the past two years.<\/p><p>As I said, I regret that we will not agree to the counter-motion, but I appeal to Fine Gael and Labour Party Members, even if they are going to vote against the motion, to use the next couple of weeks to reach out to Ministers and argue that the disability sector should be protected from other cuts.  There are fairer ways of making savings.  I hope these Members will use their influence to ensure we will not end up in a similar situation this year to that on the Social Welfare Bill last year and that we will see off cuts in this area from the start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500045#TT00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"vote","time":1380125700,"counter":204,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 22; N\u00edl, 15.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Aideen Hayden and Michael Mullins; N\u00edl, Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Diarmuid Wilson..<\/p><p>Amendment declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500045#TT00300","aye":["1148","1138","1150","1114","1165","1158","1130","1166","1160","1117","1144","1172","1152","1173","1135","1161","1162","1174","1134","1118","1187","1153"],"nay":["1157","1116","1159","1140","1149","1122","1123","1139","1169","1127","1142","1154","1171","1156","1164"]},{"type":"vote","time":1380126300,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Question put: \"That the motion, as amended, be agreed to.\"<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 23; N\u00edl, 15.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Aideen Hayden and Michael Mullins; N\u00edl, Senators Ned O'Sullivan and Diarmuid Wilson.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500046#UU00100","aye":["1148","1138","1150","1114","1165","1158","1130","1166","1160","1117","1144","1172","1152","1173","1135","1161","1162","1174","1134","1118","1187","1153","1125"],"nay":["1157","1116","1159","1140","1149","1139","1169","1127","1142","1122","1123","1154","1171","1156","1164"]},{"type":"speech","time":1380126300,"counter":206,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500046#UU00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1380126300,"counter":207,"content":"<p>&Aacute;r 10.30 maidin am&aacute;rach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500046#UU00300","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Adjournment Matters","time":1380126600,"counter":208,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500047#VV00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Births","time":1380126600,"counter":209,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500047#VV00500"},{"type":"speech","time":1380126600,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to address the need for the Minister for Health to put in place a special system to enable the births of babies in need of palliative care to be registered in the hospital of their birth, owing to the unnecessary burden being placed on the parents of these acutely ill children in having to travel to local offices to register the birth and, as a consequence, the delay encountered in accessing State services such as medical cards and nursing supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500047#VV00600","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1380126600,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter, to which I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection.<\/p><p>We all agree that the care of extremely ill children is of the utmost importance.  Parents who find themselves in need of such care for their children must be able to access the necessary State supports as soon as possible.  I assure the Senator that the registration of a birth does not delay to access to such services.  Although the registration of a birth is a legal requirement, it is not the trigger for the delivery of State supports to that child and should not be a reason for any delay encountered.<\/p><p>Many of the supports provided are matters for the Minister of Health, Deputy James Reilly.  I include in my response information received from his Department and the HSE.  The care of the child is of paramount importance.  If a baby is in palliative care, an emergency medical card may be issued by the Health Service Executive.  Neither a birth certificate nor a personal public service number for the baby is needed in order to apply for a medical card.  If the baby has been discharged from hospital, provision of nursing care in the home may also be provided by the Health Service Executive.  <\/p><p>The provision of palliative care is based on Palliative Care for Children with Life-Limiting Conditions In Ireland - A National Policy, which was published in 2010, which provides the foundation and sets out clear direction for the development of an integrated palliative care service for children and their families across all care settings.  Following publication of the policy document, the Health Service Executive established the national development committee for children's palliative care.  The committee which is chaired by the HSE has overall responsibility for overseeing implementation of the national policy.  Its membership includes statutory, voluntary, professional and parent representatives, the Irish Hospice Foundation, IHF, LauraLynn and - the Senator will be familiar with this organisation - the Jack &amp;amp; Jill Children's Foundation.<\/p><p>In 2012 the HSE regions spent approximately &euro;8.58 million on home nursing services for children with life-limiting conditions.  However, it is widely acknowledged that because of how the financial system is set up, that figure does not capture all of relevant expenditure and that the total spend is significantly higher.<\/p> <p>It is also acknowledged that children with life-limiting conditions, particularly those with palliative care needs, are prioritised in the HSE regions and every effort is made to care for these children to the maximum extent possible.  That includes the provision of home care for the children and their families.<\/p><p>Other State supports are also available and are initiated by the birth notification form through which hospitals fulfil their obligation to inform a registrar of all hospital births.  A birth notification form outlines the information to be recorded in the register of births and should be completed by one or both of the parents to guarantee that correct and accurate information is registered.  Relevant details in the birth notification form are forwarded to various Departments in order that certain State services are initiated, including the provision of child benefit and the assignment of a personal public service number by the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p>The registration of births is governed by section 19 of the Civil Registration Act 2004.  The registration of the birth is carried out based on information provided by a qualified informant who is required to attend at the office of the registrar to sign the register of births.  The mother and father of the child are the main qualified informants.  Registration is required to be completed no later than three months from the date of the birth.<\/p><p>A birth may be registered in the office of any registrar of births, marriages and deaths, regardless where it took place or the area of residence of the parents.  Some of the larger maternity hospitals have registrars on site and a parent may register the birth with them.  Parents are required to attend personally for the registration of the birth.  Parents can also contact a registrar and arrange for a specific appointment to register.  If the parents are in a recognised marriage only one parent need attend.  If both wish to sign the register both must attend.<\/p><p>I hope that information is of use to Senator Mary Ann O'Brien.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500047#VV00700","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1380126900,"counter":213,"content":"<p>That information is of great use to me, and I thank the Minister for her detailed and informative reply.  I hope everything that she has said is correct.  I raised the issue because of the unfortunate case of a family who had a baby in need of palliative care.  They found that the system has changed, that registration in hospital is no longer possible and that they needed to go to the births, marriages and deaths office to do that.  As the Minister explained, only one parent in a recognised marriage needs to attend but both parents need to go if they are unmarried.  I was contacted because the parents were not able to visit the office of the registrar.  As the Minister will be aware, anyone who has a seriously ill child are beyond being able to organise themselves.  I welcome her comments and I will take her reply back to my constituents.  I will communicate with the relevant Ministers if I find that her information is not correct.  The Minister mentioned that an exception can made for someone with an extremely ill child and the application can be processed without the PPS, and that is they key matter.<\/p><p>I also thank the Minister for her comforting words - I was not expecting that - on children's palliative care services.  However, the reality is that the Jack and Jill Foundation's services have been cut, and people are not getting the HSE support for nursing their children in their homes because the money is simply not there.  The provision of such services may be down on paper, but it is not happening in reality, but that is a matter for another evening's discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013092500048#WW00200","speaker":"1169"},{"type":"speech","time":1380126900,"counter":214,"content":"<p>There is a registrar present in some hospitals.
