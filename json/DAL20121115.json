Yesterday the Taoiseach said he would not rule out an independent inquiry into Savita's death and this is an option that could and should still be pursued.  There have been calls from the medical profession for a legislative framework to be introduced along the lines of the Medical Council guidelines.  Two days ago the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, received the expert group's report.  The expert group was set up to assess what had to be done following the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the A, B and C cases.  He will obviously be studying it, but will the T\u00e1naiste outline when it will be published?  Surely it will be published as soon as possible.  It has already been reported in the media that the export group does not recommend the introduction of specific legislation but discusses a number of options and it will be left to the Government to decide whether primary or secondary legislation is required.<\/p><p>  Obviously, this issue brings out different opinions in people and communities across the country.  Debates will, unfortunately, be heated, personal and, at times, irrational.  As we know, every Deputy has been lobbied from all sides.  I hope the tragic death of Savita will allow the expert group's report to be debated in an open, sensible and mature manner.  We do not need to create more division.  In this regard, we have three questions for the T\u00e1naiste.  Will he outline when the report will be published in order that it can be debated in the House?

This is an appalling loss which has, rightly, touched the hearts of all Irish people.  It is, of course, true to say we do not yet know the full circumstances of what happened, but anybody who listened to Savita's husband yesterday has to be deeply concerned having heard his very dignified and moving account of what happened to Savita.  I thank Deputy Niall Collins for the tone with which he raised the issue this morning.  It is one of those issues on which we are all reminded of our duties, as legislators.  It is not a moment for shrill voices but for respect for a grieving family, dignified discussion and determined action.<\/p><p>  We have to await the outcome of investigations under way into Savita's very tragic death, but there are issues we have to address and to which we need to bring legal clarity.  Essentially, it centres on what happens in a set of circumstances where a woman's life is at risk and medical professionals may not be entirely clear on where the lines of their responsibilities and duties lie.  These were the issues addressed in the cases which went before the European Court of Human Rights and it was to address these issues that the Government decided, on its formation, to establish an expert group, chaired by a High Court judge and made up of medical and legal experts, to bring to the Government recommendations on what steps we could take.  That group has now reported to the Minister for Health.  I understand the Taoiseach and I will receive the report some time today and it will be considered by the Government.  It will, of course, be a decision for the Government as to whether it will be published.  There is a timeline with which we have to comply, as we are required to make a further report to the Council of Europe by the end of this month.  We will comply with that requirement.  Therefore, the steps will be as follows: the report is in - the Minister for Health obviously needs time to consider it and judge what issues arising from it he will bring to the Government; it will be considered by the Government; a decision will have to be made on its publication; and a decision will also have to made on how it is to be dealt with in the House.<\/p><p>  We all need to be clear on this issue.  It is 20 years since the Supreme Court made its finding in the X case.  It is time to bring legal clarity to the issue.

His testimony was truly shocking and heart-breaking.  Like the rest of the country I was not just upset and moved by what he had to say but I was also very angry.  We have debated these matters for 20 years.  This is probably the only jurisdiction on earth where urgency is defined by a delay of 20 years.  I accept absolutely that there have to be inquiries into the precise circumstances of the death of Savita.  We need the medical detail and we need a full account of it.  I support that but I fear that we will hide behind reports and inquiries and we will kick the issue down the road yet again.<\/p><p>  We do not need a report or an inquiry to tell us that the medical profession is left in legal limbo.  We know that.  Neither do we need a report or inquiry to tell us that as a result of that, women\u2019s health and lives are left in jeopardy.  We know that.  It would be easy for us to point the finger at the Catholic Church, the medical profession, a particular hospital or the HSE, but the blunt truth is that the limbo exists because this House has failed to legislate.  We now have the seventh Government that has not yet introduced the legislation to give effect to the Supreme Court judgment.  The Oireachtas shows itself as a bit farcical when we find ourselves in those circumstances.  Successive Governments failed to act.<\/p><p>  The T\u00e1naiste has not given the kind of clarity we need.  Why has the Government not decided to publish the report?

We must ensure that in this country no doubt can arise in a hospital in a set of circumstances which puts a mother's life at risk.  I heard a medical professional speak about this on the radio this morning.  We also need to provide clarity for medical professionals who must make judgment calls on these matters in the real-life situation of a hospital, and must hear the concerns they have about making a decision that may expose them to action if some person disagrees with it.  We must also take into account the ethical concerns that some medical professionals may have about this issue.  A range of complex considerations must be weighed up, and that is what the expert group was asked to do.

The first priority of the Minister for Health is to ensure that the health needs of those who have had symphysiotomies are met quickly and effectively.  The HSE provides a range of health services to women who have undergone symphysiotomies.  Patients who underwent this procedure have, on application, been granted full GMS eligibility on medical grounds.   Advice with regard to pathways of care is available to women on request through the five symphysiotomy liaison officers in the HSE.  Necessary medical expenses related to symphysiotomy in respect of medical and private treatments may also be refunded.<\/p><p>  A report has been commissioned by the chief medical officer in the Department of Health.  This is an independent research report into the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland from 1944 to 1984.  An independent academic researcher, Professor Una Walsh, was formally appointed on 1 June 2011.  The compiling of the independent research report has two stages.  The first is the production of a draft report based on an analysis of published medical reports and research.  This report contains information about how frequently symphysiotomy was carried out in Ireland and compares rates with other countries.  It also provides reasons the procedure was carried out.  The second stage of the research is planned as a consultation process led by the researcher, who will seek feedback on the contents of the draft report from those with experience of the procedure, particularly the women concerned, and health professionals. She will then use this material in finalising the report.  The final report will be presented to the Minister for his consideration of any actions that may be required to address the issues concerned.

I acknowledge that the Government has no option but to legislate for this issue, but I have mixed feelings about it.  It is difficult to see where this legislation fits into the overall scheme of reform of the health service.  I would like the Government to provide a road map for these reforms.  A universal, single tier system may not be possible within the lifetime of the Government, but there needs to be a time line.  We could soon be at a tipping point with regard to the viability of the private health insurance market.  Many people - young people, in particular - are ceasing to pay into private health insurance plans.  This leaves older people or those with chronic illnesses to absorb most of the costs.  Social solidarity is essential if the provisions of the Bill are to be viable.<\/p><p> There is a pecking order in family finances as people prioritise mortgage repayments and heating and food bills.  Where there is indebtedness and falling income, health insurance is lower in the pecking order, particularly among the healthy.  I am concerned about this.<\/p><p> It is positive that the Bill establishes criteria preventing discrimination against patients by charging them higher premiums on the basis of age, sex or health status.  It is important that this be achieved.  It requires us to establish a permanent risk equalisation scheme with levies and credits.  One can envisage the VHI, for example, attracting a large number of credits because many of its customers are likely to have greater medical needs.  This raises the question of whether we will be legally compliant in terms of intervention regarding the fund.<\/p><p> The Health Insurance Authority will have extended powers to establish and administer the risk equalisation fund.  Where an insurance company incurs the cost of paying for treatment for a higher-risk patient, it will be able to reclaim some of the cost from the fund.  It is in respect of those people who are most likely to end up in hospital that credits will be drawn down.  Currently, the system applies only to people over 60.  This Bill, when passed, will change this.<\/p><p> The health insurance industry has a for-profit aspect, which implies people will be lobbying for changes.  One must be careful to ensure the consumer is the centre of attention rather than the industry, although I accept that the latter must be listened to in a balanced way.  One must remember the industry has a motive other than the provision of health insurance cover.  One cannot have social solidarity if a sufficient number of people who are not drawing on the fund are not paying into it.  People with long-term chronic illnesses or disabilities and the elderly are the most likely to draw on the fund.<\/p><p> When the Minister is wrapping up, I would like him to outline the roadmap and timeline.  If a large number of people no longer purchase health insurance cover, we will have to respond quickly.  They could opt for cover in a lower category, meaning they will no longer be treated in private hospitals, thereby placing more pressure on certain parts of the public health service.  The public system is already under serious pressure.  People may remove themselves from the system entirely because they simply cannot pay for premiums.  Has the Government determined the tipping point?  The decline in the purchase of health insurance cover has gone beyond a trickle and is becoming a steady stream.  If we end up with a cascade, when will there be an urgent remedial response thereto?  Over the past three years, for example, 175,000 people cancelled their health insurance policies.  This has serious implications.  There was an overrun in the HSE to the tune of \u20ac400 million in September.  The legislation is not likely to be cost-free if an additional burden is placed on individuals.<\/p><p> While I accept that there is a need for the Government to legislate, I have mixed feelings on supporting the Bill because we need to know how the system will be handled if we run into the kinds of difficulty it is possible to envisage at this stage.  We are good at creating a crisis and then trying to unpick it.  This occurred in respect of the centralisation of the medical card system and SUSI.  Both crises were predictable.  We are not good at putting good institutional architecture in place.  The Government has not had sufficient time to deal with some of the issues that have been presented as crises requiring remediation, reform and compliance with the guidelines of EU institutions.  Considerable work must be done to achieve reform and to be compliant.  With legislation such as this Bill, we realise there is potential for failure.  Where this failure could be serious, it is incumbent on the Government, in response to the Second Stage debate, to determine the risks and put in place a strategy to anticipate and respond to imminent problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500007#E04500","speaker":"1052","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352978400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I welcome the provision of a permanent risk equalisation scheme for private health insurance.  It will replace the current interim scheme on 31 December 2012.  No one in this Chamber needs to be reminded of the fact that hospitals and other health care service providers throughout the country are facing an extremely difficult task to stay within ever-shrinking budgets while the population expects and deserves a high-quality health care system.<\/p><p>  Maintaining an attractive private health insurance system within reach of a large segment of the population is crucial to protecting the public health system from greatly increased volumes.  The objective of the Bill is to ensure that private health insurance will remain within the scope of large numbers of people, not just when they are young and healthy but also when they are older and more at risk from illness.<\/p><p> The provisions of this Bill will see insurers compensated for differences in costs that may arise due to the age of their customers.  Without the introduction of such a risk equalisation scheme there is a danger that people will pay vast sums for health insurance during middle age, when hopefully they enjoy good health, only to find that as old age approaches and their health difficulties increase, the cost of health insurance increases to a level they can no longer afford.<\/p><p> Without risk equalisation, everyone would face the possibility of being left without health cover in old age.  As of December of last year, 47.1% of the population had health cover.  It is interesting to note that ten years earlier, in December 2001, that figure was 48.2%.  The level of health insurance in this country peaked at 51.7% in December 2008 and has been in steady decline ever since.  What the figures do not show are the huge sacrifices being made by many people in an effort to ensure that they retain their private health insurance.  For many families that financial burden is becoming increasingly heavy.  This risk equalisation measure is vital if we do not want to see private health insurance levels go into free fall, which in turn would greatly increase pressure on the public health and hospital system.<\/p><p> Important provisions in the Bill before the House include open enrolment and lifetime cover.  Under open enrolment, all applicants for private health insurance must be accepted, regardless of their risk, age or sex, but subject to waiting periods.  Lifetime cover guarantees the right of people to renew their cover irrespective of risk factors, and it is only in very limited circumstances that an insurer can stop or refuse to renew insurance.<\/p><p> I commend the Minister on the timely introduction of the Bill, as it replaces the current interim scheme of age-related tax credits and the associated community rating levy, which is due to expire at the end of the year.  It also fulfils an element of the Programme for Government 2011-2016, which committed to introducing a system of risk equalisation for the private health insurance market.  The permanent scheme provided for in this Bill differs from the interim scheme in that it extends to cover differences between the healthier members of society and the less healthy.  It also strengthens the hand of the Health Insurance Authority in a number of important respects.  Health insurers will be required to notify the Health Insurance Authority of new types of contract or changes to existing ones.  This Bill also gives the Health Insurance Authority and its officers power to enter premises with a warrant or permission from the owner to secure documentation for inspection and to require the production of books or records.<\/p><p> Under the current Bill, each age band over 60 years receives a tax credit.  The cost of an insurance policy for an individual is then reduced by the amount of the tax credit and the insurance company recoups the money from the Revenue Commissioners.  Policy holders continue to pay the same amount in a transparent system, and health insurers can also calculate in advance the amount they are to recoup under the new system.<\/p><p> The ramifications of risk equalisation are huge.  For example, under the new scheme, a 75-year-old person could expect an annual policy to cost \u20ac900, while the real cost of the insurance could be as high as \u20ac3,000.  The remaining portion of that bill could be recouped by the health insurance company from the Revenue Commissioners.  Were the risk equalisation to be removed, how many pensioners could afford to pay almost \u20ac3,000, or \u20ac243 monthly, for health insurance?  The effects of the lack of a risk equalisation scheme would not only be paid for by the elderly.  Faced with the prospect of paying high health insurance bills while young and healthy only to be knocked out of the scheme by prohibitive costs when they reach old age, many more will be tempted to drop their health insurance and attempt to save the money towards the cost of health care when they are older.<\/p><p> The Bill is important in creating a fairer society and in incentivising those who can afford to do so to purchase health insurance.  I hope it will encourage the 47% of people who currently have health insurance to continue to subscribe to their schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500008#F00200","speaker":"1041","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352979000,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I too welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Risk equalisation has been a central plank of private health insurance from the outset.  It is designed to take account of the differences in costs that arise due to the age or well-being of customers.  That was relatively simple when the VHI was the only health insurance provider in the State, but with the introduction of other players into the market it has become more complicated.  We need only recall the legal controversy that ensued when BUPA challenged the concept of risk equalisation in the courts.  As a result of the actions of BUPA the current interim scheme was introduced, although it too was controversial.  The Government\u2019s commitment to the risk equalisation policy led to the withdrawal of BUPA from the Irish market.  BUPA was then replaced by Quinn Insurance, which has now become Liberty Insurance.<\/p><p>  The Bill will deliver on the Government\u2019s commitment to strengthen the risk equalisation scheme.  The principle involved is the provision of greater balance, which for the most part is fair.  Most mainstream political parties agree with this principle but it is not true to say that healthier or younger people will pay more for their health insurance because of this new legislation.  Equalisation has always been a central plank of Government policy regardless of the government in power.  However, this is the first time health status has been included as a means of risk regulation in the insurance market.  Until now the only factor considered was the age of the subscriber.  Younger, healthier people may have to pay more for health insurance while they are young and healthy.  It is inevitable that as they grow older or more infirm they will not be able to afford health insurance without equalisation measures.  The idea is that equalisation benefits everybody in the long term.<\/p><p>  The real controversy arose when other health insurers entered the market and were asked to make substantial financial contributions to the VHI.  This is because the VHI has the majority of customers across all levels of well-being and, as a result, pays out by far the highest proportion of claims.  People who joined the VHI many years ago are now using their services increasingly as they grow older.  People are also living longer, and that inevitably contributes to increase demand for and utilisation of the health services.<\/p><p>  It is important to ensure that there is genuine and fair competition among health insurers.  The VHI should not be allowed to abuse the system or to use the system to cover up shortcomings in its operations.  Administration costs should be similar across all insurance companies.  The VHI has decided to increase its prices again from 22 November this year.  This seems to be necessary to meet the requirements of the European Court of Justice on solvency, which are standard across the sector.  The only way to reduce insurance costs, therefore, is to reduce hospital and care costs.  There are many issues with regard to the way we deliver care services, judging from the past and present actions of the HSE and its inefficient handling of the recent change to home help services.  It is highly unlikely that organisation is capable of doing anything more than squandering taxpayers' money at the expense of the most vulnerable in our society.  Despite the fact that the HSE is overstaffed at an administrative level, all it was capable of doing was a desktop study of its customers' needs, which appears to bear no relation to the situation on the ground.  Despite the fact that it has many administrators, the HSE seems unable to communicate with or even discuss cases with public representatives or people on the ground.<\/p><p>  If the Minister and those of us in Fine Gael are to follow through with our election commitments to introduce universal health insurance at an affordable cost, we must begin by abolishing every bloc in the HSE.  The organisation is unfit for purpose.  Instead of promoting better health services, it is the main reason progress is not being made.  We talk a great deal about how good we are at innovation in this country but I have yet to see any of that in the processes and the delivery of our health services.<\/p><p>  This legislation for risk equalisation is an essential building block in moving towards universal health insurance, which is what the Government wants to deliver.  We must now find ways in which we can deliver that.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500009#G00200","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speech","time":1352979000,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Health Insurance Bill.  Health insurance is a topic that is gaining ever more discussion time and when one considers the nation's demographics it comes ever more alarmingly into focus.<\/p><p>  While much of Europe is already experiencing the phenomenon of an aging population, Ireland will have to wait until after 2025.  None the less, Ireland's population is aging, with the number of young adults in the country falling by 10% according to recently released figures by the Central Statistics Office.  The latest census results indicated that the 19 to 24 age group was the only category to show a fall, with a decrease of 12% since the last census in 2006.  In contrast, the number of older people - those aged over 65 - has increased by 14%.  There are more older people now living in nursing homes - 20,000 - and in residential hospitals - 5,000 - and because those over the age of 65 use about four times the number of health services that younger people use, that could have major implications for the country.  By 2030 there will be 818,000 people over 65 years of age in the country.  That has significant implications for both health and social welfare, and this Bill is the Government's far-sighted response to the issue of health insurance.<\/p><p>  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012 provides for a permanent risk equalisation scheme to replace the current interim scheme of age-related tax credits and associated community rating levy provided for in the Health Insurance Acts.  The interim scheme expires on 31 December 2012.  Risk equalisation is essentially a method for compensating insurers that carry heavy risk burdens by means of payments from other insurers that carry lighter ones, and its role is to protect the current system of community rating in private health insurance.<\/p><p>The interim scheme is a system of tax credits which provides for a cost subsidy from the young to the old.  On current estimates, the scheme will have transferred a net amount of some \u20ac275 million from younger to older lives in 2011.  The estimated amount for 2012 will be \u20ac360 million.  The VHI has been a net beneficiary of the scheme due to its older client base.  The scheme is funded through a community rating levy, or stamp duty, charged to insurers.  This amounted to \u20ac197 million in 2009, \u20ac318 million in 2010 and \u20ac343 million in 2011.<\/p><p> This Bill is a welcome addition to the Statute Book and I have no hesitation in commending it to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500009#G00300","speaker":"1068","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352979600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I welcome the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012.  Risk equalisation is an issue with which I am quite familiar as I spoke about it many years ago in the Seanad.  It was one of the few issues on which we in the then Opposition agreed with the then Government.  When it was first debated, it was in the heady days of open markets and value for money.  I believed then risk equalisation was a fundamental cornerstone in ensuring fairness in health insurance.<\/p><p>  I am a member of the VHI along with my mother.  We find with the costs going up, it is getting more expensive and, like everyone else, we have had to check the various plans.  We need to examine the health insurance system because many people are getting out of it due to the state of the economy.  In turn, this is placing a significant burden on the health system.  Over the years, we have thrown billions of euro at the health system but never checked the large wastes of money in it.  A lot has been done in the past three years to address this but a lot more still needs to be done.  When \u20ac1.7 billion is taken out of the health budget, it is a tribute to the front-line staff and those who run it that it is functioning pretty well although there still is a need for improvements.<\/p><p>  There is much negative publicity about Roscommon County Hospital which is factually incorrect.  Nearly two years on from when it was downgraded, the hospital is busier now.  Before one had to wait three to six months for a procedure in Galway and Dublin while now it can be done in Roscommon.  There was a meeting yesterday with the design team for Roscommon hospital which announced a \u20ac3 million endoscopy project to be located on the hospital site which will bring patients from far and near.  When I hear people claim Roscommon hospital is closed, I ask them to do me a favour and call into the hospital to see for themselves what is happening there.  In three years\u2019 time, more procedures will be carried out in the hospital than there were in 2009.  Sometimes we should shout from the rooftops the magnificent work being done in the hospital and across the health service.  Now, we have the Galway University-Roscommon hospital group for which staff from consultants to nurses will be appointed and will be able to move around the various locations.  This has happened not because the Minister ordered it but because the management and staff on the ground have worked together to achieve better efficiencies.<\/p><p>  No matter how much money is put into health insurance, unless we tackle gross inefficiencies in the health system, then insurance will continue to become more expensive.  We need to examine the provision of home-care packages and primary care centres.  Primary care centres should become a cornerstone of our health system.  Why do people need to clog up an accident and emergency department with routine ailments when they could be attended to in a primary care centre?  The group hospitals idea is excellent.  The demise of the Health Service Executive is the right approach because we need to be the masters of our own health system\u2019s destiny to ensure whatever budgets are set for a hospital are spent in it.<\/p><p>  Risk equalisation protects the healthy and the less healthy.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500010#H00200","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1352979600,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012.  Generally, Fianna F\u00e1il supports the Bill&#8217;s principles but there are several issues which will have to be dealt with on Committee Stage.  What is extraordinary about this legislation is that it is to come into effect on 1 January 2013 but much of its critical detail is not yet before us.  Many of the figures to see how this risk equalisation scheme will operate in practice will be provided on Committee Stage in the next week or two.  With just a few sitting days to go before Christmas, we will be passing this legislation which we have not seen yet with a view to it coming into operation at the beginning of next year.  This short timescale is unacceptable.  It is a pity we do not have the full details of the legislation as published rather than waiting for them.  Inevitably, only a handful of Members will attend Committee Stage and it is not fair on the broad membership which will probably be debating the budget, the Estimates or social welfare in the Chamber when Committee Stage is taken.  Accordingly, this detailed legislation might not get sufficient attention.<\/p><p>  A key element of this legislation deals with the Health Insurance Authority, the regulator in health insurance.  I believe the authority should be closed.  It is a stand-alone independent quango which should be merged with the Financial Regulator.  There is a convincing case for such a move.  I am calling on the Minister or Public Expenditure and Reform to put this authority on the list for amalgamation, if it is not already, as part of the rationalisation of State agencies.  Its 2011 annual accounts, signed of in June, stated:<blockquote>The health insurance market is the largest non-life insurance market in Ireland, followed by motor insurance.  Premium income in 2011 was &#8364;2.0 billion, having risen from &#8364;1.9 billion in 2010.  Of the total, &#8364;109 million was accounted for by restricted undertakings.<\/blockquote>Health insurance should be under the Financial Regulator like all insurance products.<\/p><p>There is no reason to have an independent, stand-alone organisation to deal with one segment of the insurance market, albeit health insurance.<\/p><p> Four companies are currently operating under the new Health Insurance Authority.  All of them do a good deal of non-health insurance business and are regulated by the Financial Regulator in that regard.  Again, we are imposing extra bureaucracy on the companies which must deal with two regulators in the insurance industry.  On the one hand, they have to deal with the Health Insurance Authority and, on the other, with the Financial Regulator.  This makes no sense.  At one stage every time there was a new idea, a stand-alone agency was set up.  If this was being done today in the cool light of day, we would not be setting up a stand-alone agency.<\/p><p> I will list the four companies because people are utterly confused.  I have seen advertisements on television for Laya Healthcare, but I had no concept of who owned it.  I believe most people do not know who owns it.  I now know it is owned by Swiss Re, a Swiss-owned company which took over the health insurance part of Quinn Insurance, the part not taken over by the mutual company we see advertised on the television during the &quot;Late Late Show&quot;.  Quinn Insurance, in turn, took over BUPA some time ago.  Aviva is an international company operating in the market.  GloHealth is also operating in the market, although I am unsure who owns it, and then there is VHI.  I am a VHI customer and have a good policy with it.  It is important to have private health insurance, of which I am a supporter.  Those who choose to spend their hard-earned money on health insurance are entitled to do so and should be encouraged rather than be discouraged from doing so.  I have a separate travel insurance policy with VHI.  If people go on a foreign holiday, they can take out travel insurance from an insurance company.  The annual VHI foreign travel insurance premium works out at \u20ac70 for my wife and me, which is modest.  It is a good price.  I hope VHI makes money out of it and imagine it will if people such as me do not make too many claims.  I assume the travel insurance wing of VHI is regulated by the Financial Regulator, the organisation led by Mr. Matthew Elderfield.  Even VHI must deal with two regulators.  As there is no sense in this, I call for the matter to be examined.<\/p><p> Up to 4% of the total private health insurance market is held by the restricted membership scheme for prison officers, members of the Garda and ESB employees.  They have their own arrangements, which is fine.  <\/p><p> Will the Minister clarify the role of the Financial Services Ombudsman?  There is a reference in the annual report to a fee of \u20ac15 for freedom of information requests.  It must have received one during the year.  There were several thousand consumer complaints about various issues referred to in the annual report.  Why must the Health Insurance Authority deal with the matter if it relates to an insurance product?  Is the Financial Services Ombudsman excluded from dealing with queries on health insurance, although it deals with every other aspect?  It appears to be excluded for no good reason.<\/p><p> The Health Insurance Authority has a staff of 11.  I know nothing about them, but I imagine they are excellent and do good work.  I have no doubt that they are competent in engaging in their activities, but there is no case to be made for the HIA to be a stand-alone State organisation, commonly called a quango, when there are only 11 staff.  I accept that times have changed.  If the Minister was to come to the House today to state he wished to set up a new stand-alone State agency with nine staff, which number would eventually grow to 11, he would be laughed out of court and would not do it.  It would not make sense to do so.  That concept should not be followed anymore and there should not be a separate headquarters or administration centre for 11 staff.  The Health Insurance Authority should be subsumed into or taken over by the Financial Regulator.  I am not suggesting, however, any of the staff should lose his or her job.  They have a role to play, but the cost of administration in having a separate organisation is unnecessary in this day and age.  There are linked costs for the four insurance companies in the health insurance market.  They must deal with the regulator for health insurance products as well as the regulator for non-health insurance business, which puts an unnecessary burden on them.  I see no reason to have a separate organisation in this day and age.<\/p><p> I have the annual accounts of the Health Insurance Authority before me.  They are germane to the Second Stage debate because the Health Insurance Authority is the regulatory authority for the insurance companies in question.  I have never seen a set of financial statements like the Health Insurance Authority statements for 2011.  I say as much not because they are so bad but because they are so outstandingly good.  The public should know that it receives income each year by way of a levy of 0.12% on premiums.  That rate was applied on 1 January last year.  Income in 2011 was \u20ac2.4 million and a little more the previous year.  Expenditure totalled \u20ac1.1 million and the profit on the figure of \u20ac2.4 million was \u20ac1,338,535.  There was a net profit of 55%; the figure was 57% in the previous year.  No organisation in Ireland or the rest of the world should have an operating surplus of 55% of total income.  This has been happening every year since the authority was set up, although the levy was reduced from 0.14% to 0.12% on premiums recently.  It is clear that the levy is double what it should be.  It produces income of \u20ac2.4 million which is double what is required for the organisation to do its work.  The authority is not using 55% of its income to carry out its functions.<\/p><p> Page 33 of the annual report is striking.  Although these are hard-pressed times, on 31 December 2011 the Health Insurance Authority had \u20ac5.884 million in cash in the bank.  It added to this figure during the year.  At the end of 2011, it had \u20ac7,337,874 in the bank.  I imagine that figure is now well in excess of \u20ac8 million.  There is no reason the authority should have \u20ac8 million cash in the bank, while cuts are being made to front-line health services.  This cannot be rationalised or accepted.  This income comes from people who are for paying private health insurance, which represents their contribution to cost of care in public and private hospitals should they need to attend them.  Many are cared for in public hospitals by arrangement with consultants and the beds are handsomely paid for.  There is no reason for such a cash-rich organisation to have an income double what is required.  The organisation has 11 staff.  The four organisations it regulates must deal with the Financial Regulator in respect of other insurance business.  The case is clear.  The authority should be merged with the other organisation that deals with insurance products and the 11 staff could continue to carry on their good work.  We will table an amendment to more than halve the levy charged because clearly the income received is double what it should be and the surpluses are increasing every year.  Next year it will have \u20ac10 million in the bank while we are cutting home help packages.  There is no rational explanation for it.<\/p><p> I have no argument with the five directors whose fees are modest and imagine they do good work.  There is a chairman and four other board members.  I am not here to nitpick with regard to the staff or directors' fees.  I am simply suggesting we would not set up such a body in this day and age.  Instead, it would be taken over.  We all agree that we must regulate the insurance market in the interests of the common good and that we need intergenerational solidarity.  In previous times this was present between old and young.  Now, it extends to the healthy and the less healthy.  There is also an allowance depending on whether males or females are making contributions.  It is important to respect the age, sex and health status of individuals and not simply focus on age.  This will strengthen the legislation and I am pleased with this aspect of it.<\/p><p> The Health Insurance Authority's annual report is informative on the health market in general.<\/p><p>I appreciate the document and it can continue to provide this type of information on health insurance as part of the overall organisation I mentioned.  The difficulties are set out in it.  For example, at the end of 2011, VHI Healthcare had 57% of customers in the country but, according to the schedule, 90% of customers over 80 years; Laya Healthcare, formally BUPA Ireland and Quinn Healthcare, had 21% of customers and only 5% of customers over 80 years; and Aviva Health had 18% of the insurance market but also only 5% of customers over 80 years.  I have no information on GloHealth but perhaps it will come into the reckoning at a future year.  Clearly, VHI Healthcare has correctly been a beneficiary of the risk equalisation fund in the past.<\/p><p> The Supreme Court, in the earlier decision, upheld the principle of risk equalisation.  It was only the methodology that, on previous occasions, was not gone about satisfactorily by the then Minister and the Department, and I think it was rushed.  I stress the importance of VHI Healthcare and the other private health insurance companies.<\/p><p> VHI Healthcare must be far more conscious of its costs, which are far too high.  It is paying far too much to the hospitals, which should not be charging such amounts.  I came across a classic example of this recently when a bill was presented to me in my office.  A person saw the private consultant in his private office and went into their local hospital in Portlaoise in the midlands for surgery to get a little lump removed from the knuckle of a finger.  The person registered as a daily outpatient in the office, went to the operating theatre at 9 a.m. and left the hospital with the few stitches on the knuckle and went home at 9.20 a.m., and the bill that VHI Healthcare paid to the hospital and the consultant amounted to almost \u20ac1,000.  The hospital automatically bills VHI Healthcare for the full daily rate and VHI Healthcare automatically pays whatever bill issues.  I am aware that customers have rung VHI Healthcare furious when they have seen that a couple of thousand euro are being paid in respect of the few hours they spent in hospital and VHI Healthcare promptly told them it is none of their business as it has a rate set with the hospital and it is its financial arrangement.  VHI Healthcare does not have control on the costs or on what is happening in the hospitals and some of the hospital charges are excessive, and the matter needs to be examined.  VHI Healthcare needs to be making unannounced site visits to see whether the bills are presented.  I do not want to delay the process of the money being paid to the hospital, but VHI Healthcare should conduct a sample audit after the fact and check with its customers whether the fee seems reasonable for what they got.  In most cases it may be but in many cases, VHI Healthcare has been paying bills which should neither have been charged nor paid where a fraction of the sums concerned would have been sufficient, and that adds to the cost of health insurance with VHI Healthcare, Laya Healthcare and Aviva Health which makes it difficult.<\/p><p> The biggest difficulty is we need to get more young people into the health insurance market.  One might ask, &quot;Why would I start paying private health insurance?&quot; if one was a reasonably healthy person under 40 and knew one would go into this market containing the risk equalisation formula at a later date.  The cost of private health insurance will prevent many younger persons, and those with mortgages, going down that road.  We all will be aware that people are making cutbacks.  Health insurance is not a cut people want to make, but it is one they are being forced to make because of the cost, and it would help if VHI Healthcare's cost control was a little better.<\/p><p> Returning to my original point about regulation, we all will be aware VHI Healthcare must be one of the biggest insurance companies, not only in Ireland but in Europe, that is not regulated by a financial regulator because of a unique statutory process.  If the company were to regulated tomorrow, the regulator would probably close it down because it would not meet the various reserves criteria necessary for future claims.  We are in a situation here where the main player is unregulated and competing with players whose other insurance business and health insurance business are regulated, and we have a stand-alone regulator which should be part of the main regulator.  The Financial Services Ombudsman is the person who should be dealing with complaints about all insurance products and health insurance should not be excluded from that.<\/p><p> An attitude I do not like which is always an undercurrent in the debate is the tendency in some way to demonise the 1.5 million with private health insurance as if they are doing something wrong by providing money for their own health care.  They could go off and spend it on holidays and cars or in the pubs, but they choose to spend it on health care in case the rainy day comes when they have a heart attack or stroke and must go into hospital for a fortnight or where, if they have cancer, they will get the costs of their chemotherapy, etc., covered.  There is an undercurrent against those with private health insurance.  People are entitled to spend their money on health insurance.<\/p><p> I would not entertain the concept where, if people go into accident and emergency, as happens in hospitals across Ireland, they would be asked for their VHI Healthcare number.  It is none of the hospital's business.  The accident and emergency departments are for public use and for every person in the country, especially taxpayers.  Most VHI Healthcare customers have paid their tax and they are entitled to a public bed.  Some have the idea that the hospital should charge the private insurer.  Where two patients, one of whom does not have private insurance cover, go into accident and emergency with the same complaint and both are admitted to a bed, they should be treated equally.  The patient without cover would be placed in a public bed and the other person, who is put in the next bed, has paid for the public bed through the payment of taxes but happens to have a private insurance policy as well.  That should not have to be called upon because the person's taxes have paid for the public bed to start with.  The idea that because one is a private patient, one's private insurer should pay for one in a public bed is nonsense.  The public bed is one's right and entitlement and one has paid for it, and VHI Healthcare should not be paying for public beds.  I agree that where one is put into a semi-private ward or private ward one should pay the full whack but if one is in a public bed paid for by one's taxes, private health insurance, if one happens to have it, should not be called into play.  If one did not have health insurance, it could not be called into play.  It should be to do with the treatment given and the category of the bed, the hospitals should cease the practice of asking for VHI Healthcare numbers at accident and emergency departments throughout the country, which are public facilities paid for by all taxpayers including those with private health insurance, and those facilities should be made available through the public health system to which people have contributed their taxes.  My party will be proposing amendments on Committee Stage, but we agree with the principle of and the need for the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500010#H00300","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1352980800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Matters","time":1352980800,"counter":135,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500012#K00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1352980800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy John O'Mahony - the effects of procedures used by North East Leader Company, County Mayo on funding following the investigation by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government; (2) Deputy Liam Twomey - the need to reduce orthopaedic outpatient waiting times for patients in the south east; (3) Deputy Thomas P.

I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by the previous speaker.  This issue has been affecting the people of this country for ten years.<\/p><p>  The main object of the Bill is to ensure that in the interests of societal and inter-generational solidarity the burden of the costs of health services be shared by insured persons by providing for a subsidy between the more healthy and the less healthy, including between young and old.<\/p><p>  We were told back in the mid-1990s, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will recall, that with the increased competition in the health insurance market there would be increased benefits by way of reduced premia, and, of course, that was not the case.  In fact, this particular measure of competition worked in the opposite direction because one or other company robbed its competitors of a particularly lucrative segment of the market notwithstanding the risk equalisation legislation already in place or the community-based rating to which we had previously adhered.<\/p><p>We all know that medical inflation is the most voracious of all forms of inflation.  It seems to take place overnight, to go on incessantly and to have no boundaries.  The previous speaker gave instances of that and I wish to mention a particular case that came to my attention, although I am aware that such cases have come to the attention of every Member of this House.  A person was admitted to a public hospital for a procedure and had an overnight stay there, for which he received a bill of almost \u20ac10,000.  When queried, the hospital authorities apologised and said they thought he had been involved in a road traffic accident.  Where does that leave us?  I have spent a lot of time in recent years trying to get information on where health insurance moneys go, how the market is regulated and who is benefiting most from it, but I have found it difficult to get that information.  <\/p><p> There are countless people all over this country who have opted out of private health insurance because they can no longer afford it.  As the previous speaker said, that is not good for society because it means that more people are going to be thrust upon the public health service and the taxpayer will have to pay to a greater extent.  I do not know why medical inflation is happening because in the current economic climate it is incumbent on everybody in the health sector to recognise that we cannot afford inflation of that order.  It is not acceptable.  Unless something is done we will eventually have no private health insurance at all because it will not be economically viable.  I agree with the proposal before the House and I hope it works, but legislation is only as good as its efficacy when put into practice.<\/p><p> I am concerned about the warnings we hear on a regular basis of further increases in health insurance premiums.  This is conditioning the public to expect large increases on an annual basis.  Ultimately, it means that the unfortunate person who expects to pay a premium at a certain level decides that he or she cannot afford health insurance any longer.  This decision might be based on the fact that he or she is in insecure employment or is unemployed.  It is a pitiful situation to be in and I ask that the Minister, in his reply, address the questions of how inflation is hitting the insurance industry, where insurance premiums are going, to what extent they are divided between public and private health providers and to what extent taxpayers and insurers are getting value for money.  It appears, for example, that extraordinarily large bills are issued for some medical procedures.  There seems to be no limit on some charges and no scrutiny of whether they are merited.  <\/p><p> The presumption is that those in a particular age group are the culprits, and I am in that particular age group.  Before I alarm the House too much, I wish to point out-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500012#K00700","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352981400,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Durkan going to retire?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500013#L00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1352981400,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I do not intend to retire before Deputy McGrath, if that is all right with him.<\/p><p>  There is a large cohort of people who have paid for private health insurance for many years but do not get any recognition for that.  At least with motor insurance one can get a no-claims bonus if one has been insured for a number of years.  It was understood that in the area of health insurance, the no-claims bonus would lie within risk equalisation and that the benefit would extend to all insured people.  Unfortunately, that does not seem to be happening.  Instead, insurance companies see the merit of attracting the younger cohort on the basis that this is the most lucrative area of the market, while squeezing the other group of people out of the market all together.  What is happening now, however, is the reverse of what was expected, as younger people, who were hit to the greatest extent by the recent downturn in the economy, have been squeezed out of the market altogether.  They have large mortgages obtained at the peak of the boom and they simply cannot afford health insurance.  Indeed, many cannot afford their mortgages or to continue paying for mortgage protection policies.  The whole thing has turned into a woeful vicious circle, which is squeezing a lot of people to an extent that is worrying.<\/p><p>  Considering all of the regulation we have talked about and the fact that it has been in existence for some time, I cannot understand how it has not been possible to conduct a thorough assessment of the health insurance industry.  Such an assessment would probably conclude that there has been a huge rake-off for somebody's benefit, but not for the benefit of those who are paying insurance premiums or the taxpayer.  Ultimately, the taxpayer may have to carry the can for the entire health service at some point in the future.<\/p><p>  Certain actions must follow in the wake of the passing of this legislation.  If that does not happen and we do not have the degree of supervision that is required, we will be back here in a few years' time saying the self-same thing all over again.  That is not good for the country, the taxpayer or the insurance industry.  <\/p><p>  Certain procedures are carried out in both public and private hospitals and there must be some equalisation of the cost somewhere along the line.  It challenges credulity that costs can vary to the extent that they do, given that the procedures are identical.  The cost differential between public and private hospitals is unbelievable.  <\/p><p>  I hope this intervention works because what happened previously did not work.

The Bill will provide permanent risk equalisation within the health insurance sector.  The objective is to ensure that access to health insurance cover is available to everybody regardless of age, gender or health status, and that is to be welcomed.<\/p><p>  I wish to put on record my concerns for the people of my generation, many of whom are trying to raise families in a very different Ireland and who simply cannot afford to pay health insurance at the current rates.  This is clear from the drop-off in the number of people who are contributing to private health insurance.  If we are to sustain health insurance and health services, we must reform how we deliver those services.  In that context, I welcome the objective of the Government to introduce universal health insurance, as set out in the programme for Government.  This has the potential to eliminate the two-tier health system that currently operates here.  That system is unfair and discriminatory for those who cannot afford to pay health insurance.  There is no reason citizens should not have equal access to health services regardless of where they live.  Why should the people of the south-east region, for example, not have the same access to cardiac and emergency services as everyone else?  Such questions must be posed because, as we speak, people in that region do not have 24-7 access to cardiology services.  The Government must address this. <\/p><p>It is welcome that the Government is reforming the governance structure of the hospital network.  There is grave concern in the south-east region that we may fragment the existing network of hospitals in Waterford, Kilkenny, Wexford and south Tipperary which already offers an integrated system of acute services.  In a letter to <i>The Irish Times<\/i>of yesterday, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland stated:<blockquote><font color=\"#333333\">RCSI wishes to strongly support the proposal to formalise the existing relationship of the hospitals in the south east to form a hospital group. This proposal outlines bringing together Waterford Regional Hospital (WRH), Wexford General Hospital, Kilcreene Regional Orthopaedic Hospital, South Tipperary General Hospital and St Luke&#8217;s Hospital Kilkenny under a new single management and governance structure.

The programme for Government commits to introducing a system of risk equalisation in the current insurance market.  It also commits to introducing a system of universal health insurance by 2016 and states Exchequer funding for hospital care will be put into a hospital insurance fund to subsidise or pay insurance premiums for those who qualify for subsidies.  The programme states the hospital insurance fund will oversee a strong and reformed system of community rating and risk equalisation.<\/p><p>  Currently insurers are compensated for differences in costs due to the age profile of their customers.  Among other measures, the Bill provides that the risk equalisation system will take account of gender, level of cover and rate of hospital utilisation.  A previous speaker used the analogy of car insurance and the no claims bonus, but I would have to disagree on the applicability of the principle of the no claims bonus to a person\u2019s health care needs.  <\/p><p>  The Bill provides for a permanent risk equalisation scheme to replace the interim scheme of age related tax credits and associated community rating levy provided for in the Health Insurance Acts.  Risk equalisation is essentially a method for compensating insurers which carry heavy risk burdens by means of payments from other insurers which carry lighter ones.  Its role is to protect the current system of community rating in private health insurance schemes.  The interim scheme is a system of tax credits which provides for a cost subsidy from younger age groups to older groups.  On current estimates, the scheme will have transferred a net \u20ac275 million in 2011 and an estimated \u20ac360 million in 2012.  VHI has been a net beneficiary of the scheme owing to the age profile of its client base.  The scheme is funded through a community rating levy charged to insurers, which amounted to \u20ac197 million in 2009, \u20ac318 million in 2010 and \u20ac343 million in 2011.<\/p><p>  The permanent scheme provided for in the Bill differs from the interim scheme in a number of respects.  Under the permanent scheme, risk equalisation will be extended to subsidies from the healthy and the less healthy.  The Bill provides that, in addition to age, the risk equalisation system will also take account of gender, the level of cover provided by a health insurance policy and the level of hospital utilisation.  Risk equalisation credits will replace the tax credits under the interim scheme.  The Bill also aims to support the revised risk equalisation scheme and discourage market segmentation by strengthening product change restrictions.  Health insurers are required to notify the Health Insurance Authority of new types of insurance contracts and changes to existing ones.  The Bill extends the notification period required for these changes.  In addition, the authority has considerable additional powers under the legislation, including the power to enter premises and secure documentation for inspection, as well as to require the production of books or records.<\/p><p>  There is a long legislative and legal history to the issue of risk equalisation, with a key issue being the impact on market competition.  Issues raised by stakeholders include the impact on competition and market entry, health insurance affordability, the effect of the health status measures and the regulation and role of VHI.<\/p><p>  The Bill states the principal objective of the Minister and the authority is to ensure access to health insurance cover is available to consumers of health services, with no differentiation.  This objective will be given effect by risk equalisation credits, stamp duty or other measures, or any combination of these measures.  The Bill now includes the desirability of ensuring the less healthy, including the old, have access to health insurance cover by means of risk equalisation credits.  This is done in the interests of social and intergenerational solidarity and regardless of the health risk status, age, gender or frequency of provision of health services for any particular generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500014#M00600","speaker":"1021"},{"type":"speech","time":1352982000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012.  The programme for Government commits to providing a system of universal health insurance.  I recognise that the Government has to get through a full list of legislation, but I am concerned that we are down to the wire on health insurance, given that the current interim scheme expires on 31 December.  Rushed legislation is often bad legislation.  Clearly, there is a huge crisis for the private health insurance market and it is deepening by the day, if not the hour.  I first started thinking about health insurance when I got married in 1984 and then started my family and established a business.  When the health insurance products first came on the market, I welcomed them with open arms.  I do not dismiss those who cannot afford private health insurance, but there is some comfort to be gained from having it.  However, the issue has been abused and hijacked during the years.<\/p><p>A situation existed across the insurance industry where spurious claims were made.  I remember RTE had very good advertisements on this describing how when John had an accident and decided to claim he was putting his hand in our pockets.  Many people have their hands in pockets with regard to costs, not in a sly way but in an up-front way.  I remember being in Shanakiel hospital about 15 years ago for a number of days.  I was quite sick, but believed I was covered by VHI.  However, on the morning I was leaving, having recovered and lived to tell the tale, the sister came in and slipped a white envelope under my plate.  I thank all the medics who were involved in my care, who were tremendous people.  I am aware medical professionals are bound by the Hippocratic oath and I sympathise with the medical staff in the hospital in Galway involved in the recent very sad case, but I obviously await the outcome of the independent investigation that will take place.  In the main, 99.999% of people in the medical area, doctors, nurses and so on, are in health care because it is their vocation and passion and they want to do good.  However, mistakes will happen.<\/p><p> When I opened the envelope, I was quite taken aback to find a bill for \u00a3600.  The reason I got the bill was that I had to go to Cork University Hospital for a special test.  I could have walked over, because the distance was only from here to Grafton Street.  The walk would have been good for me and would have helped reduce my blood pressure before going for the test.  However, a private ambulance was hired to take me over.  I could not have walked back because I was comatose, after an anaesthetic.  However, the bill for that came to \u00a3600, absolute daylight robbery.  Some \u00a3100 would have been a big sum at that time.<\/p><p> The problem is we use and abuse the scheme and there are no checks on it.  I do not blame the current Minister for this or the Minister of State present.  When the scheme was set up first we were all delighted with it.  It seemed like progress and many good causes were championed.  However, people get used to a scheme and it gets hijacked.  Far too many people get on its back and start pulling and drawing off it, but nobody watches what is happening or sets up checks on it.  There is a chronology to this, since the establishment of health insurance and the VHI in 1957.  A liberalised market was promised in 1992 when the third life directive, thankfully, forced competition in the area of private health insurance.  We blame Europe for many things, but some of its directives have been good.  However, things can go wrong depending on how we implement them, fail to implement them or use them to suit ourselves and different vested interests.<\/p><p> The Health Insurance Act 1994 made provision for the establishment of the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, but the body was not brought into existence until 1 February 2001, a long time later.  Why did it take this long?  The 1994 Act was amended by the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2001, providing for, among other things, an enhanced role for the HIA, with more responsibility than envisaged under the 1994 Act.  I welcomed that.  The HIA is funded by a levy imposed on private medical insurers, but obviously this, like everything, is passed down to the punters.  Premiums were to be independent of the State.  The role of the HIA includes acting as a registrar of medical insurers and undertakings and vetting new market entrants.  It is also involved in consumer protection and provision of information and also provides advice on matters of medical insurance to the Minister for Health.  The HIA receives returns from medical insurers every six months and on that basis makes recommendations to the Minister regarding risk equalisation.<\/p><p> One would wonder, considering the massive increases that have applied over the past 18 to 20 months, whether the HIA has been disbanded.  Does it still exist or is it one of these quangos that is just there to rubber stamp things?  What has gone wrong?  Where is it and why is it not acting on behalf of the hard pressed people of Ireland, ordinary people who got mortgages and jobs and started families and decided to pay for health insurance?  Now these people find themselves without jobs, unable to pay their mortgages and unable to pay ever higher premiums.  In some cases premiums have increased by 100%.  It is daylight robbery.<\/p><p> I do not understand why insurers cannot see that these increases are creating an even bigger mess.  The drop-out rate from health insurance is enormous.  I do not have the figures to hand, but I know the drop-out rate is significant.  I know what is happening from seeing what is happening with my own health insurance.  I am a parent of eight children and naturally I expect my insurance to be expensive.  I moved from VHI to Aviva, but have found that the goalposts keep changing.  Now, we find if we go for a procedure we are covered for very little.  We are covered to get in the door.  The health insurance industry could be compared to the people on Grafton Street with billboards, coaxing customers into their premises.  However, once customers go in, they are fleeced.<\/p><p> We do not have the health care we should have.  I will not use the words I would like to use to describe the situation, but it is disgraceful.  It is not fair, equitable or sustainable.  What is happening is that pressure is being piled on our already overcrowded public hospitals because people cannot afford health insurance they could afford previously.  They get a huge shock then when they have to wait on the public system where there is huge pressure and the Minister is fighting a battle to ensure services are maintained.  When in opposition, he promised that if Minister he would eliminate the need for people to wait on trolleys, but that cannot be done.  Situations occur every day in hospitals which give rise to the need for the use of trolleys.  However, the Minister claimed he would be the messiah in this regard and would rid all hospitals of the need for trolleys.  However, while wards are being closed in hospitals because of the financial situation and the cutbacks, we are bound to have trolleys.  A trolley free hospital is not achievable.<\/p><p> When Barry Desmond was a Minister 25 or 30 years ago, before I was ever in politics, he was fighting this battle.  I look at the situation this way.  If a farmer wants a vet at 2 a.m., 3 a.m. or 5 a.m, he can get a vet within half an hour.  However, despite the CareDoc system and everything else, it is very hard to get access to a medical practitioner at those times.  One could get three vets if one wanted in the middle of the night.  They are there.  They work hard and provide their own laboratories and everything else.  Any child over four or five can tell a doctor what is wrong or where he or she has a pain, but an animal cannot speak.  Therefore, vets must be better at making a diagnosis.  They have no help.<\/p><p> The point I am making here concerns consultants.  I met some consultants here last week when they were fighting the cause of the south-east regional hospital and I support the work they do.  However, I believe they should have their own facilities to treat private patients.  It is a no-brainer.  They are able to charge enormous fees.  They do great work, but why should the public be disenfranchised and have to wait.  If consultants want to carry out private work, let them go to the Beacon or other clinics.  That is the choice they should have to make.  That is business and the way things are done.  Why should the State carry them?  Why should the State provide those services?  Why should the State provide for them to have a public clinic for just a few hours and then allow them use the facilities for a private clinic?  That is not right.  I recognised what Barry Desmond was trying to do and supported him.  He is a long time gone from this House, but his party should continue in that vein.  The party to which I belonged did not and the Minister with whom I had to deal in the previous Government, Mary Harney, did not.  She was all for privatisation, the more the better.  He who pays the piper calls the tune.  However, let them do it in private hospitals.<\/p><p> I am very concerned by this Bill.  The deadline is too short and we seem to be rushing into this.  Why are those drafting the legislation and advisers not dealing with this situation?  We can blame the Minister, but he can only do so much.  However, there are layers of bureaucrats involved.  Why are they not dealing with this?  Why does all legislation have to go on and on?  The previous Government failed to grapple with and deal with these issues on several occasions.  I admit this happened when I was a member of the Government party.  However, I argued constantly with the Minister at the time, Mary Harney, about her ideals with regard to private health care.  I wrote to the then Taoiseach when the Progressive Democrats disbanded, asking him to remove Mary Harney from the Department of Health, because of the lack of accountability.  She had no party to answer to.  She came to our party rooms to answer questions a few times, but we got no answers.<\/p><p> I am not saying I have all the right on my side.  However, the situation must be dealt with.  We can discuss risk equalisation and age etc., but  Deputy Durkan was right.<\/p><p>I know other Deputies who spoke after him said he was wrong.  They did not agree that one should be able to build up and use a no claims bonus.  That is fine, but I think people should get some recognition for paying their premiums regardless of what they are charged.  When these companies increase their prices, their customers have no say in the matter.  They have to pay when they receive their bills.  Some people have to take out loans to do so.  It is gone over the top.  Many people cannot pay.  If the economy had stayed going the way it was - we all knew it could not - people would find it hard to pay these increased charges.  Do the insurance companies and the people who are billing the insurance companies think that people will keep paying as they continue to increase these immoral charges, percentage point by percentage point?<\/p><p> It is not rocket science to suggest that this approach, like the austerity approach, is not working.  We saw all the trouble all over Europe yesterday.  I do not advocate any kind of activity like that.  Thankfully, we did not have any in this country.  This is austerity in the other way.  There is another word for it, but it is not coming to me at the moment.  As far as I am concerned, it is a question of milking the system.  We cannot continue to pay it.  As I have said, the pressure is going back on the public hospital system.<\/p><p> I spoke about the need for fairness in the system when Deputy \u00d3 Caol\u00e1in and I raised a matter on Topical Issues in the House last week.  I understand that Deputies from the Waterford area raised a similar matter this week.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who had many backers when she came into office, has been trying to regionalise services and put services out into the community.  I was opposed to it, but I have to say it seems to be working fairly well so far.  I will never say that I have all the answers, or that I am not open to change.  I am open to change.<\/p><p> The people of my local area, led by consultants at South Tipperary General Hospital including Dr. Peter Murchan, Dr. Paud O'Regan and my late brother, Dr. Eddie McGrath, bought into the mantra that was being trotted out, which was that cancer services should be provided at eight regional centres of excellence throughout the country.  Even though it is not possible to get to Waterford from many parts of my constituency within the golden hour, we accepted the new approach and put our shoulders to the wheel.  As politicians, my colleagues on all sides and I had to sell this change to the people.  As Deputy Coffey said, everything was working well and certain services were being returned to the smaller hospitals, for some reason.  I compliment the Deputy, who mentioned the hospitals in the south east - Waterford Regional Hospital, which we knew as Ardkeen; South Tipperary General Hospital, which we knew at St. Joseph's; Wexford General Hospital; St. Luke\u2019s Hospital in Kilkenny and Kilcreene Hospital.<\/p><p> Everyone in the region has been working together on this package.  We have the magical figure that is required for a centre of excellence.  We have the population of 500,000 that is needed to ensure there is enough throughput to make such a centre viable.  When HIQA was created - it is a bit of a monster as far as I am concerned - it watched us to make sure we had what was needed.  Something funny is going on now.  I do not like it.  I suspect it was going on during the term in office of the last Government.  Certain authorities in Kilkenny, who have the ear of the Minister and of certain consultants, have decided they want to go to Dublin.  One can travel between the two cities in an hour on the new motorway because it is a good road.  The approach that is being taken is depleting the cohesion that existed in the south east when all medics and consultants were buying into it.  We need to maintain that cohesion.<\/p><p> We do not know what will happen next.  We might be told we will have to go to Cork.  We are waiting to see the report of Professor Higgins.  There is nothing worse than a report that is being leaked when we do not have it in front of us.  I have no axe to grind with Professor Higgins.  I do not know the man at all.  I am just saying that we are undermining ourselves.  Certain people in Kilkenny have gone off and done a solo run.  I suspect that my friend, big Phil - the Minister, Deputy Hogan - is not far away from the shenanigans that are going on.  Those involved are undermining the credibility and sustainability of the ideology we bought into and on the basis of which substantial investment was made.  While I suspect that the Minister is involved, he can answer for himself.  I heard that his answers were not too helpful when he was interviewed on local radio yesterday.  I am concerned that certain interests are diminishing the cohesion that has existed before now.<\/p><p> When I spoke on Topical Issues last week, I mentioned that there is a population of 1.2 million in Dublin.  I do not know exactly how many major hospitals there are in Dublin - I have not gone around to count them - but I have been told there are nine or ten.  There is a population of 500,000 in the south-east region, which covers counties Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, south Tipperary and Wexford.  We have found out that loads of patients from the Thurles area, who used to be catered for in Limerick, have been moved into the south-east region because the Mid-Western Regional Hospital cannot cope.  The leak is coming in.  People from parts of east Cork who are just 20 minutes from Cork University Hospital are also going to Waterford Regional Hospital to be treated and looked after.  Something is very wrong if that is happening.  Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.<\/p><p> I have observed what has been done with the system in various parts of the country, including the Monaghan-Cavan area - my wife is from County Monaghan - and Sligo.  There were some terribly heated debates and protests etc.  We cannot buy into the system if the goalposts keep moving.  As I said, the Bill before the House is moving them further.  I accept that it is an attempt to straighten the goalposts and keep them visible.  However, it will not affect the mighty fat cats who took a Supreme Court challenge when the then Government acted in a similar manner in 2004.  These people have the power, money and resources and the little people of Ireland do not matter anymore.<\/p><p> It is time we started to listen to ordinary people again.  We heard what they told us last Saturday.  Every other Deputy in the House and most of the people in the system were saying &quot;Yes&quot;, but the people sent a message telling them they did not trust them.  I did not go out canvassing or knocking on doors.  I did not intend to do any public engagements on the matter.  I took a family decision.  The people out there are watching us.  They are not happy with us.  Governance seems to have become the preserve of the elite.  The ordinary people who want these services are as entitled as anyone else under the Constitution to receive them.  If we cannot ensure every citizen enjoys a meaningful modicum of respect, what did Connolly and Pearse - I do not need to mention the rest of them - die for?  We need to deal with everyone equally and fairly.<\/p><p> We have to listen to what the Royal College of Surgeons, which is an eminent body, has to say in this present case.  Who else would we listen to?  Those involved in the college are the experts in the field.  They have expressed their support for the situation in Ardkeen and throughout the south-east region.  We must be left alone.  We cannot have Ministers or anybody else doing solo runs and undermining the credibility, sustainability and good work of these consultants.  Some of them will throw away the tools of the trade and retire because they will not be willing to put up with what is being done.  They have families and lives of their own.  They have to know what the future holds for them.  Above all, they have to serve a population of 500,000 so they have the proper throughput that is demanded by HIQA and every other body.<\/p><p> Ministers can make statements and take actions, but the mighty HIQA often follows them like a hoover.  Everybody shivers when this powerful body gets involved.  When it decides to visit a small community hospital that is trying to keep going, it sends out a bill of \u20ac3,500 for its services.  I am all for the standards that are needed in health care, but it is not all about badges, tags, folders, proper entrances and exits and everything else.  Health care must be the most important thing.  Where are the representatives of HIQA between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., when 20 or 30 patients are to be found on trolleys?  They are not resting because one could not rest on narrow and small trolleys.  It is indecent, immoral and wrong.  We have to go back to the drawing board.  We have to be cognisant of the people we are supposed to serve in here.  We should not be serving ourselves.  We have to be honest with ourselves.<\/p><p> I conclude by wishing the Minister and the Minister of State well with this legislation.  We have to examine the dots and commas.  We will need to be strong and careful.  We should make haste slowly.  We should not allow ourselves to be boxed into a corner just because this is expiring in 2012.  There is a limited number of days left in 2012.  When one is pushed into a corner and forced to make rushed decisions, it is a bad business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500014#M00700","speaker":"1090","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352983200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>I would like to share time with Deputy Twomey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500016#O00200","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1352983200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

This Bill is another step on the road to the delivery of a health service that is supported by universal health insurance and in which access will be based on need rather than ability to pay.  In other words, we will have a single-tier health system at the end of this process.  This legislation will ensure we maintain a sustainable and competitive health insurance market as we move to universal health insurance.  It is part of a range of actions being taken to that end, including the ongoing development of primary care services.  A number of primary care centres have been opened around the country and more of them are in the pipeline.  They are working very well to deliver effective health care at local level, close to the patients, and ultimately at a lower cost than that which applies when these services are delivered by the bigger institutions.  As they can provide a better quality of service, they are protecting patients' quality of life.  The development of primary care services is another arm of this approach.<\/p><p>  The roll-out of special delivery units, which is part of the same process, has been a great success.  Objective statistics compiled by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation demonstrate that special delivery units have considerably reduced waiting times.<\/p><p>In the context of overall reform, I salute the Minister's achievement of a \u20ac125 million transfer from insurers to publicly funded hospitals in 2012.  This will assist in dealing with the overrun in the health budget but it is also a correct transfer from private to public when public wards are used.  Where private patients use public beds, there has to be a reallocation of resources to match that.<\/p><p> Another aspect of the reform and ongoing development of the health services must be the reduction of costs to the consumer of private health insurance.  Greater steps and greater transparency in this sector are necessary.  We cannot have arbitrary, almost annual or biannual, increases in the cost of health insurance without very active scrutiny and without rigorous control by the Minister and his Department.<\/p><p> For example, there should be a breakdown of invoices in the private health sector.  When somebody has a procedure where a private health insurer is covering the cost, there should be a breakdown of all aspects of the costs so it is a very transparent process.  This would put an onus on the health providers to provide the insurance company with a proper breakdown which would have to be clear and allocate the costs.  There is an inherent saving to be made in this regard and, in any case, proper practice would dictate it should happen.  I ask the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is present, to ensure as a matter of urgency that proper invoicing, with a detailed breakdown, as applies in every other sector, is available within the private health insurance area.<\/p><p> I have also come across sustained anecdotal evidence from people who come to our advice centres and others that, when patients have a procedure carried out, it is performed by a junior doctor, who is in the pay of the HSE - in other words, in the pay of the State.  However, the consultant who is in overall charge then invoices the VHI, Aviva or another private health insurer of the patient for the procedure, so there is a double payment for the one procedure.  A bill goes to the private health insurer, which is upping the cost of premia, and a bill goes to the State for the fact a junior doctor in the pay of the State performed the procedure.  This is outrageous.  There is sufficient anecdotal evidence to merit an investigation.  I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to take this back to the Department and to have the matter investigated as a priority.<\/p><p> There is also anecdotal evidence from people who have told me they have gone for a private procedure and are then brought back for an over-the-top number of check-ups, whether annual, biannual, three-monthly or otherwise.  I am not convinced that all of these check-ups are necessary and, as there is certainly not parallel activity in the public sector, one wonders if it is a bit of an industry.<\/p><p> What I am effectively saying is that there is a real onus on Department officials and the relevant Minister and Ministers of State to take a vigorous, investigative, proactive approach to the cost of health insurance for the sake of the consumer and the health service.  If we are to move to a single tier health system and universal health insurance, this would be a prerequisite.  However, we could not go there without getting competitive, properly priced insurance and evidence-based bills, and without ensuring that only necessary procedures are carried out.  I am well aware there is a change in the demographic and in the costs that go with older patients - I am aware of all of those phenomena.  However, there is still sufficient evidence to suggest the malpractices that have been identified merit investigation and, at a minimum, merit a response from the Minister on the conclusion of Second Stage.  I would appreciate that.<\/p><p> Risk equalisation will provide for the extra cost that goes with certain older people who have certain sets of illnesses, so there will not be a discriminatory factor and the money will be refunded to the insurer where there is extra cost involved.  It is really community rating in terms of providing assurance in the long term and it is replacing the interim legislation.  It will be implemented from January 2013 and, as a result, many packages have recently been offered to younger people and there has been a breakdown of the market into different segments by the insurers.  It is important equalisation is in place and that it is written into the legislation that a person's contract cannot be broken.  It is important that a person who is insured will remain insured by the same insurer right throughout the process and that anyone under the age of 65 who seeks to join a private health insurance scheme cannot be precluded from joining it on the basis of risk.  It is important that the older cohort of people, who will cost more, benefit from equalisation and that money will come by way of a charge from the less risky younger sector of the population.  Ultimately, everyone gets to benefit from this, it ensures the viability of the insurance companies and it ensures reasonable costs for the person accessing the services.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I welcome the legislation and the interim measures being put on a permanent footing.  I welcome the safeguards that are built into the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to examine the cost of health insurance, the prospect of detailed invoicing, the use of junior doctors while the charging is done by consultants, the possible over-use of check-ups and the duplication of activities.  We need to be rigorous in analysing any attempt to increase insurance costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500016#O00400","speaker":"971","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352983800,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I concur with many of the remarks made by Deputy Joe O'Reilly on this issue.  It is vital the Minister would take on board what is happening and deal with this issue, which has been raised time and again in regard to audit and governance.  The bills issued to and by the VHI and other health insurance companies would essentially be considered meaningless in private business as there is no breakdown of costs or of why patients are paying so much.  To be honest, such practices are unacceptable.  We have known about this for years and it has been discussed time and again, both in our clinics and in public fora, including in this Chamber.  Patients are paying for a service they did not receive and they have no idea why certain costs were incurred.  If one puts in a request to the insurance companies, they simply stonewall.  During the era of the Celtic tiger, it was perhaps felt this was not an issue worth tackling but that has changed dramatically.<\/p><p>  Risk equalisation is vital for community rating and solidarity between the generations is extremely important, but there are dark clouds around the private health insurance market at this time.  The pool of people paying is getting smaller and we now have historic deficits that are being carried over to the next generation of people, who will have to pay.  The VHI apparently needs \u20ac80 million to \u20ac90 million in order to meet its EU requirements into the future.  These are deficits that were built up when there  were 100,000 to 150,000 more people paying for private health insurance in this country but they are no longer doing so.<\/p><p>A smaller pool of patients who are less able to pay private health insurance are now being landed with this burden.  In order to continue intergenerational solidarity and to encourage younger people to accept that they will have to pay a little more to provide private health insurance to older generations, they must have full confidence that we are doing everything in our power to keep costs down.  What Deputy O\u2019Reilly said is true and it must be considered and dealt with urgently by the Minister.<\/p><p> One of my concerns about the legislation is the addition of health status to the criteria for risk equalisation.  Perhaps there is a reason for that connected with the ruling or it might be in order to get around European Union regulations but, whatever the reason, it must be fully explained to the House because it could complicate the issue in the future unless a clear protocol is set out for how one defines ill-health.  If the definition is based on the number of nights one stays in hospital, we are running the risk of a return to the problems experienced in the private health insurance market in the past, when private patients were kept in hospital for longer than was necessary because hospitals and consultants were paid per bed night.  There is a need to examine how we will deal with this issue.<\/p><p> Simplicity should be the order of the day when it comes to private health insurance in terms of how we monitor costs and premiums and how we sell the concept of intergenerational solidarity and community rating.  It is surprising in some respects that 40% of the population feel compelled to have private health insurance.  It is an indictment of the health care system.  When the VHI was set up in the 1950s it was because people with a certain income had to pay for all of their health care needs as there was no universal free health care service.  Currently, the private health system is different.  Essentially, everyone is entitled to access to public hospitals.  Although there may be a charge, one would not be driven to bankruptcy if one ended up in hospital, whereas 50 years ago one had to pay for every single hospital procedure or operation at significant cost, which did break people in the past.  We must also drive forward reform and efficiencies in the public service.  We must reduce waiting times and ensure procedures are carried out at an appropriate time because the only reason the vast majority of people pay for private health insurance is to get access to health services.<\/p><p> We must also examine the type of company the VHI is.  The judgment from the European Union states that the VHI and other such companies must have reserves of 40%.  Other companies do but the VHI does not.  We must examine the position seriously.  Health insurance is not like house insurance, which is affected by factors such as storm damage and must plan for an unpredictable future.  For instance, costs increase dramatically for an insurance company following a major storm, but in the case of health insurance the VHI could calculate to within a couple of million euro the health insurance costs for the next two to three years.  We could factor in a 6% to 7% increase in health costs.  The VHI will more or less be aware of the procedures involved.  A 40% reserve is probably too much.  If the VHI were involved only in health insurance the reserve could be much lower.  I wonder whether the possibility has been explored by the Minister at European level because it would reduce the considerable amount the VHI is expected to keep in reserve.  It is the patients of today and tomorrow who will have to pay higher premiums to fund the reserve.  There is an opportunity to do things differently in order to continue to make private health insurance more affordable for patients.<\/p><p> I was involved in the discussion about risk equalisation.  BUPA originally took the court case to Europe in which risk equalisation was struck out and, as a result, there has been much confusion in the private health insurance market in recent years.  That is one of the reasons I wish to ensure that when we introduce legislation on the issue we aim for simplicity so that the legislation is not open to future challenge.  I am a strong believer in community rating and risk equalisation.  The other system of private health care is a risk-rated one, whereby as one gets older one pays a bigger premium.  That is completely unacceptable because as people get older their incomes decrease, their premiums go through the roof and they cannot continue to pay for private health insurance.  The risk-rated model of private health care is a complete rip-off and does nothing for patients.  We must work hard to ensure that the model of private health insurance we have is affordable and accessible to as many people as possible.<\/p><p> Because of their financial situations, young people are leaving it as long as possible to take out private health insurance.  The longer they leave it, the greater the proportion of older people in the market, which will put more pressure on the community rating model we have in place.  It is vitally important that the Minister consider the need to examine the cost base.  We talk a great deal about the cost of premiums, but insurance companies take the cost and add a little on top of it to obtain the premium.  There is great scope for us to examine the cost base of private health insurance by focusing not just on consultants and how hospitals bill private insurance companies but on how hospitals calculate bills.  In this way we can dramatically reduce the cost of premiums to patients.  Otherwise, I predict a serious crisis in the health insurance market in the near future because premiums simply will not be affordable for young people and older people will be left without cover.  There is a role for the private health insurance market in this country.  We could not afford to deal with all of the patients who are treated in private hospitals currently in the public system.  It would crash the system.  The public system is already under huge pressure.  We must acknowledge the good work that is done in private hospitals.<\/p><p> Deputy Mattie McGrath was all over the place in referring to the elite in one breath and then saying in the next that those in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland are a fine bunch of lads and that they are not the elite at all.  One wonders what point he is making.  He criticised HIQA.  We set up HIQA because we did not like what was happening in the health service, with cases such as the Susie Long case, the abuse of elderly people in nursing homes and the regrettable incident in Galway in recent days.  I do not wish to comment too much on the latter case until we have the full facts of what happened in Galway.  The purpose of HIQA is to give confidence to people that the health service is safe and that it exists to work for them.  We must be supportive of such organisations rather than undermining them.  We might not always be happy with how they operate but they are there to look after patients, which is our number one concern.  I hope that what we say about the cost base of private health insurance is taken on board and that something is done about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500017#P00200","speaker":"1095","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352984400,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy English.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500018#Q00200","speaker":"1056"},{"type":"speech","time":1352984400,"counter":158,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Difficulties in the area of risk equalisation have arisen since 2005.  I was a member of the Joint Committee on Health and Children during that period and it was extremely frustrating that progress could not be made.<\/p><p>  I raise another issue that was mentioned, namely, that private beds in public hospitals should be paid for 100% by patients.  There is an argument for that because the beds are private, but I offer another argument.  Those of us who use public services pay for this through our tax.  We know how much the public health service requires from the taxpayer in order to ensure provision of proper health and hospital services.  However, private patients who seek private accommodation and treatment in public hospitals also pay tax for the running of hospitals.  There might be an argument that they should pay a certain premium in insurance but it should be recognised that private patients who have private insurance or who opt for private treatment are contributing to those beds through their taxes as well as through the fees charged.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Health has consistently raised the issue of cost with health insurers and has stated his intention to address costs in the sector in the interest of consumers.  In discussing this matter, we use terms so lightly they roll off us.  I offer the example of community rating, which is not fully understood by the public.  We should be careful when we use language in public discourse so that people can understand what we are saying.  Community rating is a system whereby a person's age does not determine the level of premium he or she pays.  There are some exceptions to the rule under which people pay the same premium regardless of age, one of these being children, whose premiums must be no more than 50% that of an adult.  This applies also to full-time dependent students under the age of 23, whose premiums may be reduced, although not below 50%.  All of us are members of group schemes which offer a 10% reduction.  In addition, pensioners or those who have restricted membership with an insurance scheme may have their premiums reduced.<\/p><p>  Health insurance claim costs indeed increase with age, as the previous contributor noted.  The average claim cost for people aged 70 to 79 in 2011 was \u20ac4,442, compared to \u20ac224 for those aged 18 to 29, which equates to less than 10% of the pay-out for the former group.  VHI Healthcare has a much higher proportion of older lives than the other two organisations, Aviva Healthcare and Laya Healthcare.  For example, in December 2011, the VHI had a 56% market share in the 0 to 49 age group and a 90% market share of the over 80 age group.  This means that the VHI has a higher average claim cost per member than Aviva or Laya.  Risk equalisation is a process that aims to neutralise in an equitable way differences in insurance costs that arise from variations such as age and insurer profile.  It involves the transfer of payments among health insurers in order to spread some of the claim costs of the high-risk older members among all private health insurers in the market in proportion to their market shares.  In the absence of an effective risk equalisation scheme, there is a threat to the existence of a community-rated market when significant differences in risk profile exist between competing insurers.  Risk equalisation is a common mechanism in countries that have community-rated health insurance systems.  Although private insurers do not actively market towards younger persons, there are ways of encouraging a younger membership.  It is important that there is a system of comparison between products of different insurance companies.  For many who might consider moving from one provider to another, the differences in benefits offered by the various products are often unclear.<\/p><p>  In 2005, the Health Insurance Authority recommended commencement of risk equalisation, and in December of that year the Minister for Health and Children decided that risk equalisation payments would commence on 1 January 2006.  A court-imposed stay was made on payments until there was a ruling on constitutional challenges to the risk equalisation scheme.  In July 2008 the Supreme Court ruled that the scheme was unconstitutional.  In November 2008, the Government announced an initiative of an interim age-related tax credit and health insurance levy to support the cost of health insurance for older people.  The interim system was designed to last for three years and to be Exchequer-neutral.  In May 2010 the Government announced a comprehensive strategy and set of actions for the health insurance market.  These included the development of a full and robust new risk equalisation scheme that would start in 2013, and the implementation of a new transitional arrangement from 2012 that closely approximated the effect of the full risk equalisation scheme.  The Health Insurance Authority published a consultation paper on risk equalisation on 21 June 2010 which was submitted to the Minister in December of the same year.  That is the background to the presentation of the Bill today.<\/p><p>  The State supports the private insurance market through tax relief at source of 20% of health insurance premiums.  It also supports the community-rated market by providing age-related tax credits in respect of those aged over 60 in order to help meet their higher claims costs.  This is the commitment by the State.  Everybody accepts that community-based health insurance should be protected.<\/p><p>  The Government's policy on private health insurance states that private health insurance can also play an expanding role in providing cover for primary care.  The Minister has stated that expanding primary care with health insurance minimum benefits can dovetail with reform of public health eligibility legislation.  Primary care can thus play a more pertinent role in the health care of the entire population.  At the same time, the Government has left open the option of introducing compulsory private health insurance.  Public health insurance does not offer satisfactory protection for poor people at high risk or for high-risk individuals.<\/p><p>Little research has been carried out with regard to the real effects of mandatory public health insurance on quality, care and efficiency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500019#R00100","speaker":"1056","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352985600,"counter":161,"content":"<p>The Deputy has used ten minutes of the time available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500020#S00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1352985600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I will leave it at that so in order to allow Deputy English to make his contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500020#S00300","speaker":"1056"},{"type":"speech","time":1352985600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Neville for sharing time.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012, which is an important item of legislation and which I am happy to support.  The Bill forms part of the bigger picture.  Health insurance is still very expensive for some people, while others cannot afford it at all.  However, at least the Bill will be of assistance in ensuring that the system will be somewhat fairer.  It will also ensure that people who have been affected by ill health over the years or with whom age is catching up will not be hit with massive increases in their bills.  The term &quot;intergenerational solidarity&quot; is very nice, particularly as in this instance it means that the costs involved will be shared by everyone.  However, we must remember to ensure that it is used when we are debating legislation relating to other Departments.  We do not always witness intergenerational solidarity.  We may, however, remember to use the term more often in the future as a result of our debate on this Bill.<\/p><p>  The Minister indicated that the legislation before the House is part of the reform agenda which is detailed in the programme for Government and which was also outlined in Fine Gael's and Labour's manifestos for the most recent general election.  Prior to that election, both parties indicated that they wanted to reform the health service and introduce a fairer and more equitable system within which people's access to care would be based on need rather than on their ability to pay.  Health care was not provided in this way in the past and the Bill is part of the process that is aimed at ensuring it will be in the future.  There is a great deal more work to be done in this regard and we must ensure that we remain focused on that fact.<\/p><p>  We are concerned here with creating a level playing field.  I accept that Opposition parties are of the view that there are different ways to achieve the same result.  Having carried out a great deal of research and done much work in respect of this matter while in opposition, Fine Gael and Labour are both of the view that what is outlined in the Bill represents the way to go in the context of introducing a level playing field and thereby ensuring that people's access to services will be based on their needs.  Regardless of whether one has money, the waiting lists, etc., relating to children are generally dealt with on a fairly even basis and access to care is based on need.  This ethos must be spread to every other part of the health service.<\/p><p>  I accept that some people have been placed at a disadvantage in certain instances, particularly where other individuals had private insurance.  We are trying to balance it out but it is not possible to do this in six months, a year or two years.  The Minister for Health and his Ministers of State have been very careful to state that the reform agenda will take some time to implement.  It was clearly flagged before the election that it would probably take seven years to fix the problem.  The programme for Government is very ambitious in aiming to have much of the reform carried out during this Administration's five-year term of office.  I get somewhat fed up when other Members of this House, those in the media and people in the street state that we have been in power for nearly two years and we have not yet fixed the health service.  It would never have been possible to fix it in such a short period.<\/p><p>  For once, politicians were honest in their election manifestos and stated that it would take a number of years to reform the health service.  It is not often that politicians are willing to state that it might take two terms in government to achieve something.  In the area of politics, there is often a demand for immediate results.  As a result, everyone should recognise that in this instance it was clearly stated that reform will take some time to deliver.  That reform will happen but it will take a number of years to achieve.  I have no difficulty with people being critical in respect of particular matters.  However, everyone should accept that it would not be possible to fix the health service - not to mention the economy - six months, a year or two years.  All good projects take a number of years to complete.  That is the case in this regard.  I hope that three to four years from now our health services will be close to being fully reformed and that people will have access to health care when they require it and that this will be based on their needs and not just on their ability to pay.<\/p><p>  Progress has been made in the context of the reform agenda.  I have seen evidence of this in the area in which I live.  We must take the opportunity thank all of the staff involved in bringing about the reform to which I refer.  The Croke Park agreement is often sneered at and people sometimes criticise it.  However, I have witnessed major reforms in the area of health which are due to the efforts of all of those in government with responsibility in the area and also those of the staff involved who are willing to accept changes.  As a result of the Croke Park agreement and their own common sense, those to whom I refer know that these changes were the right ones to make.  The concept of the money following the patient has worked very effectively in the orthopaedic unit at Navan Hospital.  The work done by the special delivery unit is yielding great results throughout the country.  This has not been the case everywhere but that is because it takes time to implement reform.  We are getting there.  In the majority of cases, the number of people on trolleys in hospitals throughout the country has been greatly reduced.  The figures in this regard are independently assessed.  I accept, however, that we have more work to do.<\/p><p>  Hospital waiting lists have been dramatically reduced.  It is not good enough that people are still being obliged to wait nine or 12 months for procedures but these periods have been reduced.  The Minister has put in place a plan to ensure that the amount of time people are obliged to wait will be reduced even further next year.  The outpatient waiting list was previously way out of control.  When we entered Government, there were 250,000 people on it.  However, the Minister and his colleagues have set a target in respect of reducing the numbers on this list next year.  When we were in opposition, I always stated that in order to fix something one must first admit that a problem exists.  It was not possible to fix the problem when the figures were being hidden.  When a Government initially releases figures such as those to which I refer and admits that there is a massive waiting list, it is given a great deal of slack.  When the problem is fixed, the Government involved should also be given credit.  One must count the numbers involved before one can fix the problem and I hope we will do this.<\/p><p>  Much of the discussion on the Bill has related to the cost of health insurance.  This is a matter which must be addressed.  The effect of the cost of health insurance on the cost structure and governance of health care delivery is of major concern to many of us.  Just over 4.5 million people live in this country and we spend over &#8364;14 billion on health.  In addition, more than 2 million people have health insurance.  They are obliged to pay massive amounts for such insurance and it is amazing that they can meet the cost involved.  Most people believe, rightly or wrongly, that they need private health insurance in order to ensure that they can obtain access to health care.  We must, therefore, change the system.  Universal health insurance will eventually become compulsory and this will hopefully lead to a decrease in costs.  What it will certainly do is bring down the overall cost.  Both the public and private spend and health service reform should bring down this cost and people should be in a position to enjoy the benefit of this.<\/p><p>  The Minister indicated that part of his work will be to reduce costs where possible.  An example in this regard would be the VHI.  The Minister expects the latter to undergo many changes in order that its costs will be brought down.  In the event that anyone is of the view that such changes should not be made, I wish to read into the record a letter sent to me by a concerned constituent a number of months ago regarding the VHI and the issue of costs.  The letter states:<blockquote>Dear Deputy English,<br \/><br \/>  I have expressed concern on several occasions regarding value for money in relation to VHI charges incurred by me.  I wish to do so again, relating it to the example case below.  Should you wish to use the actual case cited please feel free to do so.  [I will forward a copy of this letter to the Minister].<br \/><br \/>  As you know, following completion of treatment VHI provides each member with a detailed statement of the benefits it has processed in respect of a claim.  They ask that if I have any concerns with the cost of care that I should contact them.  So I did.<br \/><br \/><i>  I rang the VHI to give them my experience of the cost of Healthcare I received.<\/i><br \/><br \/>  My Treatment involved an injection (to the right eye), the charge being Euro 200.00 with which I have no problem.  I also do not have a problem with the medical staff although there were a lot of them around and they obviously have to be paid.  Where I do have a problem is the charge for a &quot;side room and theatre and equipment etc.&quot; as explained by the VHI person I spoke to.  The problem is that I was not in a side room - I commenced in a waiting room with c. 8-10 people present - I was then prepared in a corridor and in a smaller waiting room and eventually moved to a low tech &quot;theatre&quot; with a no bells and whistles table on which I had the injection administered, apparently by a hand held instrument.  I then had a welcome but unnecessary cup of tea and toast prior to leaving.<br \/><br \/>  The cost of this experience was Euro. 1,465.93.<br \/><br \/>  My attempt to have this cost explained failed miserably and I was met with the mantra that this was the cost negotiated between the Mater Private Hospital and the VHI, full stop, end of story, pleasantly explained, just about.<br \/><br \/>  My [bill] is for three of these treatments (at the time of writing one more to come) with a likely total cost of c. Euro 4,400, excluding the surgeon's fees.  Obviously I am very happy to have benefited from it, however, if the VHI fees continue to increase even less dramatically than currently predicted I will have no option than to join the public patients' queues at a time of my life when I had hoped for better fortune.<br \/><br \/>  I raise this matter as a specific, micro, example of where better accountability and value for money could probably be achieved.  My three quick fix eye injections will exceed the previous cost of my hip replacement.<br \/><br \/>  As a point of interest in discussion [with the hospital] on the day of my initial diagnosis, when costs were being discussed, it was mentioned by a person qualified to comment that in the USA such treatments were normally carried out in a GP's surgery.<\/blockquote>  I am of the view that this letter summarises the concerns which exist.  In fairness, the Minister and others have long been critical of the way the VHI and other companies administer their affairs.  I refer to the fact that they do not follow up on matters of this nature in order to discover why patients are charged so much for hospital procedures.  In other words, they do not ask the questions.  There is a need for people's hospital bills to be audited and also for health insurers to seek reforms in order to drive down costs.  Having a procedure should not cost that much.  The Government plans to have procedures carried out elsewhere in order to bring down the cost of health care in Ireland.<\/p><p>The combining of public and private moneys will result in a saving to the Exchequer and a better and more cost-effective system.  We are not getting value for money for a range of reasons and this is the reason the system must be reformed.  However, the many stakeholders will all need to be involved in the reform process, including VHI and the other health insurers.  They will have to work with us to drive down costs.  It is to be hoped the concepts of the money following the patient and universal health insurance will contribute to a changing of the health system.<\/p><p> There are significant plans for the reform of the health service.  Some of the changes will involve a mixture of good and bad news for hospitals around the country.  The range of services currently available in all hospitals will not continue to be available in all of them.  The Minister will publish in the coming months a framework document on small hospitals which will set out the plans for many small hospitals.  Many of us will disagree with the proposals to be mde and we will fight for the retention of hospitals or certain services in our individual areas.  The Minister has given a commitment that we will all be consulted on the proposals to be made in the document when published.  The medical experts on both sides of the argument will have an opportunity to air their concerns.  Any reform of the health service must be accepted by the people, as well as by the professional staff.  The people will have to believe the reform will benefit them as patients.  I know this will be the case, but we need to inform and convince people.  It is a case of building trust.  People have lost trust in a range of organisations, including politics and the decision-making process.  Any change which could affect the accident and emergency services in many hospitals will need to have the support of the people.  This will take some time to achieve.  We need to convince people that the change is good, that it is the right option for them and their families. That is the work that lies ahead of us.  If we do not succeed in convincing them that it is the right thing to do, perhaps we are wrong and should review the proposed changes.  However, any proposed change to any service needs to be teased out with all those involved in delivering the service.  There will be a need for honesty in the debate, rather than just political argument and point-scoring.  It will be difficult for some of us to accept some of the proposed changes because politically they will be difficult.  However, if they are right for the health and well-being of the people, we will support them, even if it will be tough.  It will mean that honest contributions will be required in the debate.  When the framework document is published, I expect general practitioners, consultants and hospital staff who tell us one thing behind closed doors to tell us the same in public in order that we can tease out the arguments.  As we might not be right in everything, it is important to listen to those who may be opposed to what we want to do.  We will need to arrive at solutions acceptable to everyone.  The reform agenda is not for the benefit of politicians or the Minister's trophy table; rather, it is for individuals and their families who want and deserve a better health service because of the amount of money expended on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500020#S00400","speaker":"1078","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352986200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>The Bill is part of a compendium of initiatives for reform.  We should all join the Minister and the Government in their efforts to have a single tier health system and a universal health insurance system.  It will take some time to implement these reforms.  It takes longer than 18 months to become a concert pianist or an inter-county hurler.  Therefore, this reform may take some time to achieve, but it will happen.  Commentators on health issues should move away from commenting on personalities and instead examine the substantive work involved.  The programme for the reform of the health service is essential and will be delivered.  As Deputy Damien English and the Minister said, it will take at least one or two terms to achieve.  Deputy Twomey referred to the dark clouds in the private health insurance sector which people in droves.  They are voting with the money in their pockets, which is having an impact on the delivery of public health services.  I appeal to the private health insurers not to look on the private health insurance market solely in profit terms but to make an effort to persuade younger people to sign up to take out private health insurance, the cost of which has escalated.  As the Minister said yesterday, the challenge is to make the market viable and relevant.  <\/p><p>  I suggest the Minister and his Ministers of State should use the consultative forum as the vehicle to drive and advocate change to ensure the ultimate goal of having a universal health insurance system is attained.  I refer to the American presidential election which was dominated by the issue of Obama health care.  A universal health insurance system must provide a health care model that is fair, equitable and accessible to all citizens.  That is what we must aim to achieve.  The three principles are community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover.  They form the basis of regulation of the health insurance market and ensure a person's age or state of health is not a determinant factor in the level of premium charged.  The insurer cannot calculate for risk status, age or gender when deciding on a person's insurance premium.  <\/p><p>  I am not clear on section 3 of the Bill which amends section 2 of the principal Act of 1994.  Is discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation allowed?  I ask the Minister of State to clarify the matter for me.  Irrespective of age, risk status or previous history, all consumers and customers of private health insurance companies must have the right to review their policies.  The time has come when we need to take control of the management of operations in the health insurance sector in order that we can reform it for the betterment of the consumer - the patient.  In the absence of regulation, there will be cherry-picking of customers.  Young people will be targeted because they are a profitable segment of the market as they are low risk.  Older customers will be charged higher rates because they suffer more health problems.  We must regulate and review the operations of health insurers.<\/p><p>  The opening up of the health insurance market has caused its segmentation.  Insurers now offer cheaper and tailored packages to young people which have been designed to be unattractive to older people.  However, more young people are falling off the private health insurance ladder.  Despite the safeguards, there are concerns about the operation of the market.  VHI has stated the levy and age-related tax relief system is only 55% effective.<\/p><p>I accept that addressing these issues requires a delicate and difficult balancing act but we must maintain competition and avoid exploitation of the markets for excessive profit.  We must ensure insurance is available at a fair and reasonable price.  I say this as a long-time customer of VHI.  It is essential to have fair and reasonable prices.  Constituents in all our clinics are talking about this.<\/p><p> The decline in the number of people with health insurance cover since 2008 is in the order of 170,000.  In the three months to August 2012, 16,000 people cancelled or did not renew their health insurance policies.  This is an extraordinary number.  The HIA figures show some very interesting characteristics in the market.  VHI remains the dominant player, with a 57% market share.  Laya Healthcare has a market share of 20.9% and Aviva Health Insurance Ireland has a share of 17.7%.<\/p><p>  Distortion based on age is very noticeable.  Laya Healthcare and Aviva Health Insurance Ireland combined currently insure 44% of customers between zero and 49 years but only 10% of those over 80 years.  This is in contrast with the figure for VHI, which insures 83% of those over the age of 70 years who are insured with an open insurer, increasing to 90% of those over 80 years.<\/p><p> For a small country, we have a number of insurers but a large number of policy options.  There are approximately 200 price plans available.  At the last committee meeting on this topic, Deputies who asked about this, particularly Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, were told to shop around.  My problem is that, when shopping around, people do not necessarily understand the small print.  It behoves the HIA and the insurers to make it clear to customers what they are actually signing up for.<\/p><p> Instead of announcing across-the-board price increases, insurance companies have been announcing smaller price increases regarding particular plans.  The HIA website shows that, over the past two months, there have been ten announcements of price increases by insurance companies.  These increases in the prices of individual policies have been compounded by the general price increases across the board.  In the past 18 months, each of the major insurers has announced at least three across-the-board price increases, and we are told there may be more in the new year.  I will not refer to companies individually; suffice it to say that every one of them has announced price increases.  This is a source of worry for everybody.<\/p><p> The prices make it difficult for families to continue to be insured.  They must make a choice, in some cases to opt out of paying for health insurance.  Opting out has an impact on the public health system.  It is incumbent on us to make it easier for people to retain health insurance cover.  It is easy to understand why people are struggling to make payments.  At a time of inordinate and unacceptable salaries and pensions for bankers, what is happening is morally wrong.  We are forcing people to make a choice between paying for health insurance cover and opting out.  If the Government does nothing else, it should recognise that people deserve to be able to choose health insurance at a reasonable and fair price.  This is why, at the committee meeting some weeks ago, we had a very strong debate with the HIA and health insurance companies on the market and pricing.  In the new year, we will move towards universal health insurance.<\/p><p> At the meeting with the health insurers, they said they wanted to be able to offer cheaper premiums to those with healthier lifestyles, while also rewarding people for taking out health insurance at an earlier stage in their lives.  In saying this, they were referring to lifetime equalisation.  The companies claim such moves could stop large numbers of young people leaving private health care or entice them to return.  I hope we can achieve this as part of our move, in the medium to short-term, to attract more young people back.<\/p><p> At the meeting, the HIA encouraged customers to shop around.  It stated openly that there were significant differences in prices and better value for many if they shopped around.  In this regard, I refer to Mary Harney's adage, &quot;We must shop around.&quot;  This is fine but if people are to have the potential to save thousands of euro, they must be able to understand what is being offered and how to avail of offers.  Sometimes what is said on the tin is not what is offered.<\/p><p> Even with the underlying principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover, it remains very profitable for individual insurance companies to attract younger, healthier consumers and avoid older and less-healthy people.  We must consider this.<\/p><p> The Bill proposes to implement a permanent risk equalisation scheme to replace the current interim scheme.  The current system works to ensure the young and old pay the same sum for insurance, and it works using a combination of a levy and tax credits.  I very much welcome that the aim of the Bill is to ensure that access to health insurance will be available without differentiation reflecting the cost of health services based on risk, age, gender or utilisation.<\/p><p> It is hoped the Bill will reduce market segmentation by making it more difficult for companies to implement new policies and to change prices.  When implemented, an insurer will have to give the HIA 90 days\u2019 notice of new contracts.  Insurers will also have to give notice of changes to existing policies.  Where price changes are concerned, the notification required will increase from 31 to 90 days, an increase of 200%.  I hope this will go some way towards preventing the practice of imposing small price increases on individual policies.<\/p><p> I thank the Minister of state, Deputy Alex White, for his indulgence.<\/p><p> There are many challenges facing the health insurance market and the consumer.  As the price increases, more consumers relinquish their policies and, in turn, the cost to the insurer increases.  Thus, the spiral of price increases continues, with a profound impact on the public health system.  For private health insurance to meet its social objectives, we must make it attractive for people to retain it or to purchase it for the first time.  We must not allow a continuation of the circumstances in which customers are forced out of the market because of the price.<\/p><p> I hope the Bill and subsequent amendments tabled by the Minister on cost subsidisation and the discouragement of market segmentation will help to achieve the desired outcome of having a sustainable market characterised by fair and open competition.  Is it not extraordinary that, although we are dealing with one of the most important Bills on the health market, the Opposition is absent yet again, thereby demonstrating its commitment to universal health insurance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500021#T00200","speaker":"989","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352986800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister, I express my gratitude for the wide-ranging support from all sides of the House for this Bill, which clearly acknowledges the necessity for the introduction of a permanent risk equalisation scheme.<\/p><p>  Let me address Deputy Jerry Buttimer's specific point on section 3 of the Bill and his concerns regarding paragraph (iv), which proposes an amendment to the principal Act.  I reassure him that the intent is the opposite to what might be suggested on first reading.  The legislation lists a number of circumstances that are to be identified as a basis upon which one cannot discriminate, rather than a basis on which one can do so.  It refers to:<blockquote>(<i>a<\/i>) the present use of, or likely future use of, hospital services by the person,<br \/><br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) the sexual orientation of the person, and<br \/><br \/>(<i>c<\/i>) the suffering or prospective suffering of the person from a chronic illness &#8230;<\/blockquote>I noted the contributions of a number of Deputies on universal health insurance, hospital charges and health care costs, and I will address some of these in the course of my contribution.<\/p><p>  The main objective of the Bill is to provide for a permanent, robust system of risk equalisation.  Its purpose is to ensure the burden of the cost of health services will be shared by all insured persons by providing for a cost subsidy between the more healthy and less healthy and between the young and old.  This reflects the principle of social solidarity.<\/p><p> The Bill seeks to strengthen and maintain stability in the private health insurance market and the new risk equalisation scheme, RES, will allow for a greater number of risk factors than the existing interim scheme, including a measure of health status.  One criticism of the interim scheme, which has been in place since 2009 and will finish on 31 December next, was that younger people taking out products that provided benefits below the standard level were potentially cross-subsidising standard level benefits taken out by older people.<\/p><p> The new scheme, RES 2013, will provide for differentiated levels of stamp duty and health credits between higher level or advanced cover, and lower level or non-advanced cover, with a view to addressing this point.  The improved clarity arising from this development has been broadly supported by insurers.<\/p><p> The aim of reforming the health area across the board is to deliver a single tier health service which will ensure equal access to care based on a person's need and not on their income.  That is at the heart of the commitments this Government has given and that are reflected in the programme for Government.  This permanent risk equalisation scheme for the private health insurance market is an essential element or critical stepping stone to achieving the programme for Government commitment to universal health insurance.<\/p><p> The Government is embarking on a major reform programme for the health service, the aim of which is to deliver a single-tier health system supported by universal health insurance.  The system will be based on a multi-payer model and will be underpinned by the principles of social solidarity with access based on need and not on ability to pay.  Under universal health insurance, everyone will be insured for a standard package of curative services.  A new insurance fund will subsidise or pay insurance premia for those who qualify for a subsidy.<\/p><p> The risk equalisation scheme now proposed by the Minister is in keeping with the Government's commitment to move to a system of universal health insurance, particularly in the context of its approach to payments and disbursements.  In designing the UHI model, there is a need to ensure it meets the needs of Irish citizens and that it achieves the best outcomes for patients in a manner that is cost efficient and financially sustainable.  To inform policy development in this regard, the Department of Health is looking at other countries that have developed health insurance-based funding models, including the Netherlands and Germany, and examining international best practice.  Ultimately, the Government is committed to introducing an Irish model of universal health insurance that best fits the Irish system.<\/p><p> An important document concerning the reform programme for the health service entitled, Future Health: A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012 - 2015, is being published by the Minister this afternoon.  It sets out the main health care reforms that will be introduced in the coming years, as key building blocks for the introduction of universal health insurance.<\/p><p> Under the current legal framework, private inpatients who occupy public beds in public hospitals are not levied the daily maintenance charge, which ranges from \u20ac586 to \u20ac1,046 in most public hospitals.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported in 2010 that 45% of inpatients treated privately by their consultants were not charged for their maintenance costs because they were not occupying designated private beds in public hospitals.<\/p><p> As part of budget 2012, the Minister announced his intention to bring forward legislation to provide for the charging of all private patients in public hospitals, irrespective of whether they occupied a public or a private bed.  However, conscious of the significant potential cost implications for private health insurers, the Minister indicated that he would be prepared to postpone implementation of the legislation until 2013 provided that the funds targeted in budget 2012 for the current year could be raised through a system of improved cash flow.  Such a system has been agreed in principle, with the legal agreements being finalised with health insurers at present.<\/p><p> With regard to progressing the legislation in 2013, the Minister is considering a number of policy issues and implications in advance of bringing the matter to Government.  Legislative proposals will be developed on foot of a Government decision at that stage.<\/p><p> The question of charges is a budgetary matter on which no decisions have been taken yet.  With regard to an assertion made previously during the debate that charging the full economic cost is akin to an overdraft, it is worth noting that an equitable regime of charges based on the cost of services delivered will be required in the context of introducing Money Follows the Patient and, ultimately, moving to universal health insurance.  The Minister shares Deputies' concerns about rising public health care costs, as I do, and would like to assure the House of the way reform of hospital funding will help to address that.  The following items will be of interest to the House.<\/p><p> The programme for Government commits to introducing a prospective based money follows the patient, MFTP, funding system whereby each patient would be funded on an individual basis.  Under the MFTP system, hospitals will be paid for the actual care they deliver rather than being in receipt of a historical block grant.  A number of initiatives are already in place in the acute hospital system in preparation for a prospective MFTP model.  These include a patient level costing project in the Health Service Executive which tracks resources actually used by individual patients from the time of admission to hospital until time of discharge.  In addition, the HSE has implemented a prospective funding pilot project for certain elective orthopaedic procedures at selected sites.<\/p><p> A hospital financing subgroup, established under the auspices of the UHI implementation group, has prepared draft policy and implementation proposals, and these are currently being considered by the UHI implementation group.  These proposals represent an important first step in the process to transform the health care funding system.  Therefore, it is truly patient-centred, value-focused and thus supportive of wider health care objectives.<\/p><p> Without a robust risk equalisation scheme there are potentially serious consequences for the stability of the market and the sustainability of registered undertakings.  Registered undertakings with the worst risk profiles either charge higher premiums or incur heavy losses.  The problem can then be exacerbated as younger customers switch to other registered undertakings where they may find more attractive plans.<\/p><p> An outcome of this imbalance would be that an insurer with a significantly riskier portfolio becomes unsustainable.  This is likely to result in the destabilisation of the market, challenging the long-term sustainability of all registered undertakings with serious potential consequences for consumers as the next insurer with the disadvantageous risk profile then becomes vulnerable.  The introduction of a permanent RES will, therefore, assist in maintaining a stable and sustainable health insurance market.<\/p><p> Developments in the private health insurance market will continue to be kept under review by the Department of Health.  In addition, the Health Insurance Authority monitors the health insurance market and advises the Minister, either at his direct request or on its own initiative, on matters relating to health insurance.<\/p><p> I am very aware, as is the Minister, that health insurance is becoming harder to afford, in particular for older people, as insurers increasingly tailor their insurance plans towards younger, healthier customers.  That point was made repeatedly in the course of the debate.  However, the Government is committed to keeping down the cost of health insurance so that it is affordable for as many people as possible.<\/p><p> The issue of addressing costs has been raised with insurers at a number of levels.  The Minister raised the issue with health insurers individually.  The Department continues to focus on the need for VHI, for example, to address its costs both in terms of the underlying cost of procedures and treatments for which it pays and also in terms of volume.  VHI has commissioned consultants Milliman to carry out an external review of its claims.  The review is nearing completion and will look at the opportunities and costs involved in possible reductions in utilisation that can be achieved by implementing appropriate utilisation management approaches.<\/p><p> The Minister has no role to play in the day to day activities of VHI.  As he told the House last evening, he has raised the issue of costs with all insurers on a number of occasions and is very focused on maintaining pressure on the system to drive down costs wherever possible.  A number of initiatives have been taken in that regard.  VHI, for example, is focused on cost management as a priority for the organisation and is engaged in many cost management initiatives including hospital audits, utilisation reviews and its special investigations unit.<\/p><p> VHI has recently agreed new contracts with private hospitals which provide for savings in specific areas, with a particular emphasis on productivity.  Its new contract with consultants, which commenced on 1 July and will run for two years, aims to increase the speed of patients through hospitals and ultimately to reduce length of stay by paying a declining rate of reimbursement for delays in consultations.  The target set by VHI is an average two days reduction in length of stay for medical patients.  In addition, VHI will adopt the new reporting arrangements on radiology and pathology to be applied in the public system currently being developed by the national quality assurance programme.<\/p><p> Deputy Jerry Buttimer made the point that it is appropriate and correct that people should be advised to, as it were, shop around and do the best they can to get the best value they can achieve for the health insurance plan that best suits their end but it is not always as straightforward as that simple statement might suggest.  I agree with the Deputy in that regard, but it should be recalled that consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.<\/p><p> The Health Insurance Authority is the statutory regulator of the private health insurance market and it provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA plays an important role for customers, both in ensuring that they have accurate information and in enforcing the implementation of the law protecting consumers in regard to health insurance.  The HIA's website has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.<\/p><p> A number of Deputies, Deputy SEan Fleming in particular, raised issues regarding the Health Insurance Authority.  It was established on 1 February 2001 under the Health Insurance Act 1994.  It is a statutory independent regulator of the private health insurance market in Ireland and also provides information for consumers on health insurance plans and benefits and on their rights, as I have indicated.  The authority's role within the health insurance market has changed considerably in recent years, with an increased workload since its establishment due to the changing nature of the private health insurance market.<\/p><p> It has been suggested in the past that the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, should be absorbed by the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank.  More recently, under the Government's agency rationalisation programme, the future of the authority is being considered in the context of the proposed move to a system of universal health care.  The future regulatory environment in that regard will be extremely important.  Under the programme for Government, it is proposed to establish a hospital insurance fund which will, among other functions, oversee a strong and reformed system of community rating and risk equalisation.  As these functions are fulfilled by the HIA, it appears the fund would absorb them.  Based on the programme for Government, it would seem logical for the HIA to be subsumed into a future health insurance fund, given its valuable experience of risk equalisation and community rating.  This will be considered as part of the implementation of a universal health insurance system.<\/p><p> A query was raised by Deputy Twomey on the rationale for a hospital bed utilisation charge.  This risk equalisation scheme will increase the factors to be risk adjusted to include a measure of health status.  Where available, pharmaceutical or diagnostic cost groups are used internationally as an indicator of chronic illness and attract risk equalisation payments accordingly.  While these data are not currently available in Ireland to the level of detail required, the Minister is committed to developing proposals to risk adjust based on a measure of chronic illness when the necessary data are to hand.  This is an area in which it is considered that the market operators can be of particular assistance.  Once the required data are gathered, it is intended to progress work on developing a usable risk adjustment measure for health status.  In the meantime, the Bill provides for resource usage to be used as a proxy for health status as a risk factor.  Resource usage data are readily available and easy to verify and used in other countries to risk adjust.<\/p><p> An amendment will be brought forward on Committee Stage which will provide that, in respect of policies effected from 31 March 2013, a hospital bed utilisation credit will be payable from the risk equalisation fund in respect of each overnight stay in a hospital bed in private hospital accommodation by an insured person where the health insurance cover of his or her contract covers that hospital stay.  The rate which will be proposed on Committee Stage will be set at a level so as not to encourage inefficiencies in any way.<\/p><p> I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate.  This important legislation deals with the specific issue of the requirement to have a permanent risk equalisation scheme effective from 1 January 2013 to replace the existing interim scheme.  It is essential, in the interests of both the common good and societal and intergenerational solidarity, that the permanent scheme is fully operational and functioning soundly from 1 January next.  Without a robust risk equalisation scheme, there are clear negative implications for older or less healthy consumers.  In addition, there are potentially serious consequences for the stability of the market and the sustainability of insurers.  The Government is fully satisfied of the requirement to provide for a permanent risk equalisation scheme along the proposed lines.  The introduction of the Bill fulfils the commitment made in the programme for Government to introduce a system of risk equalisation for the private health insurance market, as we move to develop a new system of universal health insurance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500022#U00200","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1352988000,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2012: Referral to Select Sub-Committee","time":1352988000,"counter":171,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500024#W00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1352988000,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote>That the Bill be referred to the Select Sub-Committee on Health pursuant to Standing Order 82A(3)(<i>a<\/i>) and (6)(<i>a<\/i>)<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500024#W00400","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1352988000,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Personal Explanation by Minister of State","time":1352988000,"counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500024#W00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1352988000,"counter":175,"content":"<p>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, wishes to make a personal explanation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500024#W00700","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1352988000,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I sought permission from the Ceann Comhairle's office to correct the record relating to information I gave on 8 November in responding to a Topical Issue matter rasied by Deputy Ryan regarding coastal erosion at Portrane, County Dublin.

An obsession with residential property as an investment class rather than as a place of shelter, a home, was driven by the failed pro-cyclical policies of the past decade.  Homeownership, a noble aspiration, was mutated into a speculative mania and a whole generation was forced, or encouraged, to chase an out of control housing bubble.  When the music stopped, the damage to individual households and the wider economy was clear to see.  Spuriously inflated property prices, lax lending policies and weak central oversight have bequeathed large-scale negative equity and the spectre of repossessions to a large segment of society.<\/p><p>  Many people are struggling to pay their mortgages or at risk of losing their homes.  What should be viewed as a place of comfort and shelter is now, for too many, a millstone, a cause for constant concern.  In my first year as Minister of State with responsibility for housing, I have become acutely aware of the real difficulties people are experiencing.  There is no question that we face a difficult path in finding a solution to the housing crisis.  It will not be solved overnight.  There are no magic bullets.  What is needed is sound and humane decision-making, imaginative policies that produce the greatest possible housing yield for the widest range of people at the best return to the taxpayer and, critically, an understanding of and a learning from the mistakes of the past.<\/p><p>  We must not return to the unsustainable, unprecedented growth that represented the boom years.  The greater the boom, the worse the bust.  We must seek to provide a moderating structure that allows for sustainable and long-term growth again.  If we can do this, the suffering and hardship being experienced will not be in vain.  For all these reasons, I am absolutely committed to the development of a genuinely sustainable approach to housing policy which will have the interests of communities at its heart, be based on choice, fairness and equity across tenure.  It will be a policy that will enable all households access to good quality housing appropriate to their household circumstances and in their community of choice.  I am committed to a vision of housing where people once again view their house as a place for hearth and home, not as a failed investment.<\/p><p>  We must approach housing differently now.  The Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, marked a profound change in the State's approach to housing policy.  This short statement was based on several fundamental principles and goals that will form the basis for reform.  It is a framework document that does not claim to contain all the answers to the issues it raises.  It takes account of the dramatic cycle of growth and collapse in the residential property market.  In that context, it charts a way forward for housing policy by placing explicit emphasis on choice, equity across all housing tenures and delivering quality outcomes for the resources invested.  This will serve as the framework for a sequence of legislative and policy initiatives in the short to medium term.  Key to these aims will be the move from a focus on the promotion of homeownership to a more equitable treatment of tenures.  If there is one lesson this crisis has taught us, it is that homeownership need not be the ultimate goal.  This does not mean the Government is turning its back on homeownership or that we are seeking to impede people from realising their valid homeownership aspirations.  Far from it.  The reality is that, for the majority of households, homeownership will continue to be the tenure of choice, a fact recognised and welcomed by the Government.  However, there are other households that may not want, or may not be in a position, to own their own home.  Our goal for such households is to provide for choice based on household circumstances and needs rather than the expectation of house price growth.  <\/p><p>  The current crisis has given us an opportunity to reassess our attitudes to housing and homeownership.  The emergence of rented housing as a real viable housing option is part of this reassessment.<\/p><p>A well balanced housing sector requires a strong, vibrant and well-regulated rented sector and the rented sector is an integral part of our housing policy for the future.  Naturally, important steps have already been taken to bolster the status and stability of the rented sector and this Bill is another important step on that journey.<\/p><p> The Residential Tenancies Act was passed in 2004 and represented the most significant legislative reform in the private rented sector in more than a century.  Prior to 2004, the rental market operated in a crude and fragmented manner.  There was little or no security of tenure for tenants and recovery of possession presented a nightmare scenario of long and expensive court proceedings for landlords.  Even minor disputes arising during the course of a tenancy had no avenue of resolution other than the courts.  Standards in rental accommodation were notoriously low and while minimum standards regulations had been in place since 1993 they were already out of date and characterised by low levels of enforcement.  The combination of these factors resulted in the absence of a secure, regulated rental market that could offer a real, attractive longer-term housing solution to people searching for a home.  Rented housing represented a tenure choice of last resort.  It was perceived as being only for student housing, bed-sits, a short-term solution or the only solution for the most marginalised and vulnerable in our society who could not afford anything better.<\/p><p> Thankfully, this is not the private rented market of today.  More people are renting now than ever before.  Figures from the 2011 census show an increase of almost 64% in the number of people renting from private or approved housing body landlords since the previous census in 2006.  Since the proportion of overall home ownership has declined by 5% the rental market now accounts for 29% of the total housing market.  In the eight years since the passing of the Residential Tenancies Act and the establishment of the Private Rental Tenancies Board, PRTB, we have seen significant strides in the development of the private rental market and it is largely unrecognisable from what it was at the turn of the millennium.<\/p><p> The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 introduced real security of tenure for tenants in the private rented residential sector for the first time.  It set out minimum obligations for landlords and tenants and provided access for tenants and landlords to a cheap, informal and independent dispute resolution service.  The Act laid out conditions for rent reviews and prohibited the charging of rents in excess of market levels.  It set out fair procedures for the termination of tenancies and provided for notice periods linked to the duration of a tenancy.  Since a portion of the tenancy registration fees collected was set aside by ministerial order it has provided for the funding for an exponential increase in rental standards inspections by local authorities.  In 2003 only 2,000 inspections of rented dwellings were carried out by local authorities, but by 2011 the corresponding figure was almost 20,000.  This has contributed to a significant improvement in the standard of rental accommodation available to tenants today and the final implementation of the 2008 Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations in February next year will continue that work.  Most important, the Residential Tenancies Act created the conditions for the growth and development of a sustainable, well-regulated rental market.  This development has meant that rented housing today is no longer viewed as a tenure of last resort but as a tenure of choice.<\/p><p> The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 builds on what has been achieved by the Residential Tenancies Act and the Private Residential Tenancies Board and provides for the further development of the rental sector in future.  The Residential Tenancies Act and PRTB have achieved considerable success since 2004 and the Bill will build on that success.  While it contains several significant policy developments it is evolutionary rather than revolutionary legislation.  The Bill is set out in five Parts with 43 sections.  I will refer to the main provisions in some detail.<\/p><p> Perhaps the most significant achievement of the Bill, if enacted, would be the extension of the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act to approved housing body dwellings.  Approved housing bodies generally provide rental accommodation for families and persons with specific categories of need who are on the social housing list.  However, the relationship between these tenants and their approved housing body landlords is not generally provided for in either the Housing Acts or the Residential Tenancies Acts and they operate on the basis of lease agreements, the various Landlord and Tenant Acts and common law.  Formal regulation of the tenant landlord relationship in the sector lags behind the private rented sector considerably and there is an urgent need for a modern legislative basis for approved housing body tenancies.  The Bill will afford the same rights and obligations afforded to landlords and tenants in the private rented sector to those in the approved housing body sector.  This is a logical follow-on from the June 2011 housing policy statement, which set out the key role envisaged for the approved housing body sector in the delivery of social housing.  In view of the ongoing development of the approved housing body sector and its greater role in social housing provision, the Government is committed to improving governance and formal accountability generally in the activities of the sector.<\/p><p> Approved housing bodies are at the heart of the Government's vision for housing provision.  As part of this process, it is critical that assurance is given to stakeholders in respect of the stability, viability and capability of the sector.  Governing bodies, tenants and potential investors must have reassurance that the sector is well-managed and stable and is a good long-term investment.  To this end, my Department is committed to the development of a regulatory framework for the sector that will support its long-term growth.  The extension of a formalised structure for mediating the tenant landlord relationship is a logical corollary to this project.<\/p><p> Part 2 amends the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and provides for the application of the Act to dwellings let by approved housing bodies to tenants who have been assessed under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 as having a housing need.  Section 3 as published provides for the exemption from the provisions of the Act of tenancies in which care and support services are provided to the tenant as part of the tenancy agreement.  The decision to exempt these types of tenancies was made after extensive consultation with the sector and on the basis that the services provided could be more effectively delivered outside the confines of the Act.  However, as a result of further consultation with the approved housing body sector following the publication of the Bill, I have decided that it will be possible to extend the remit of the Act to even more of the approved housing body sector than originally envisaged, and I propose to amend the Bill on Committee Stage to provide that there will be no additional exemptions for approved housing body tenancies, save those provided for in the 2004 Act.  The result of this amendment would be to extend the rights under the Residential Tenancies Act to an ever greater number of approved housing body tenancies, in the order of 20,000.  It should also simplify the wording by which extension of the Act to the sector will be achieved.<\/p><p> Section 3 ensures the 2004 Act will apply to dwellings let by local authorities to approved housing bodies when they are sublet to social housing tenants, notwithstanding the fact that local authority dwellings are exempt.  Sections 4 and 6 place restrictions on approved housing body tenancies to certain entitlements under the 2004 Act.  Specifically, section 4 provides that tenants in approved housing body dwellings may not assign or sublet their tenancies and section 6 provides for a similar restriction in respect of succession rights.  On foot of this initiative to bring the approved housing body sector within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act, and in recognition of that fact that the legal framework no longer applies solely to the private rented sector, the Private Residential Tenancies Board will be renamed as the Residential Tenancies Board.<\/p><p> Extending the 2004 Act to approved housing body tenancies will create a unified legislative base for the private rented and approved housing body sectors, assisting movement between tenures and making more efficient use of rental stock throughout the public and private sector.  Creating a unified legislative basis will assist in the objective of affording equal treatment to households in similar economic circumstances and is consistent with my belief that broadly similar rights and responsibilities should apply to all forms of rented accommodation.  I am seeking to accommodate households on waiting lists in all tenures using excess private housing under leasing schemes and other such initiatives.  Movement between tenures for such households is greatly facilitated through a common legislative base.  Naturally, this progression raises the inevitable question of how best to deal in the long term with local authority tenancies.  While the Bill will not address this issue, it is clear that further specific action will be required in this area and that a great deal of further thought, research and consultation will be required before proposals are produced in this regard.<\/p><p> The PRTB was established as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancies Act on 1 September 2004.  The principal activities of the PRTB include the registration of private residential tenancies and the resolution of disputes between tenants and landlords as well as the provision of information, assistance and advice to the Minister on the private residential rented sector.<\/p><p> The PRTB has achieved much since it was established, but more remains to be done.  It is recognised that it can take a considerable time before cases are heard by the PRTB and it is essential that we supply the board with the necessary tools to reduce delays as much as possible.  However, it must also be acknowledged that the number of dispute cases referred to the PRTB has grown by 25% since 2008.  At the same time, staff numbers have decreased by 53% from their peak as a result of the relentless downward pressure on public service numbers.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding these challenges, the PRTB is actively pursuing a range of modernisation initiatives such as outsourcing of work and shared services, and it is hoped that in the longer term this will enable the PRTB continue to do more with less and significantly reduce delays.  The PRTB's investment in ICT is a key element in its corporate plan and modernisation agenda under the Croke Park agreement.  A new tenancy management system came on stream in mid-2012 and will considerably reduce processing times in 2013.  This Bill will also contribute to reducing delays by streamlining procedures wherever possible.  However, it must be recognised that there will be considerable challenges for the PRTB in the years ahead in dealing with an increasing workload as well as the addition of some 20,000 approved housing body tenancies to its remit.  These are challenges that the Government is committed to helping the PRTB to meet.<\/p><p> Part 3 of the Bill provides for the separation of the quasi-judicial and administrative functions of the board and for a reduction in the maximum number of board members from 15 to 12.  The purpose of this amendment is to allow the board to focus exclusively on the corporate governance, financial management and wider policy issues affecting the PRTB.  The 2004 Act provides that the PRTB may offer a mediation service to landlords and tenants who wish to resolve disputes.  Part 3 of the Bill includes amendments to sections 95 and 96 of the 2004 Act, the aim of which are to encourage the use of mediation.  The amendments simplify and streamline the mediation process by removing unnecessary procedural steps and it is hoped that as the rented sector continues to mature and landlord and tenants work together to sustain long-term tenancies, there will be an increasing interest in the less confrontational mediation stream of the board's dispute resolution processes.<\/p><p> Part 4 of the Bill provides for the merger of the rent tribunal with the residential tenancies board.  The rent tribunal was established under the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) (Amendment) Act 1983.  The role of the tribunal is to determine the terms of the tenancies, including the rent, of dwellings formerly controlled under the Rent Restrictions Acts.  The merger of the rent tribunal and the PRTB was announced in 2009 on foot of the Government decision on the rationalisation of State agencies.  The merger of these two bodies has been in place on an administrative basis since 1 October 2009; administrative support services to the rent tribunal are provided by the PRTB, and the chairperson of the PRTB is the chairperson of the rent tribunal.  The Bill gives legislative effect to that administrative arrangement and provides for the dissolution of the rent tribunal.<\/p><p> While the Bill addresses a wide range of issues, there are some other aspects still under development which I hope to bring forward for consideration during the Bill's passage through the Oireachtas.  In particular, I am keen to progress a number of key ongoing concerns within the private rented sector, such as the illegal retention of tenants' deposits by landlords and the over-holding of rented property by tenants.  We have made significant progress in dealing with the complex legal and policy issues arising on these and other topics but it was not possible to finalise the necessary provisions in time for inclusion in the published Bill.  I look forward, however, to tabling detailed amendments on these topics later in the legislative process.<\/p><p> I look forward in particular to making progress on the programme for Government commitment to establish a tenancy deposit protection scheme.  Only this week I received a detailed research report on this topic that was commissioned by the PRTB and I expect that this will guide my thinking on how best to offer the greatest protection to tenants in this area at the least cost to the Exchequer.  The report flags a range of complex issues on which decisions will be required but, with careful planning, a sustainable scheme can be developed to further boost the operation of the Irish rental market.  I am hopeful that I will be in a position to make specific proposals on this matter in the context of the current Bill.  I have arranged for the report to be published on the Department's website today, if anybody wishes to read it.<\/p><p> The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 represents a significant evolutionary step in the development of the residential tenant-landlord regulatory environment.  The extension of the Residential Tenancies Act to approved housing bodies is an important step towards achieving a wider regulatory framework for the voluntary and co-operative housing sector in the coming years.  This will bring greater transparency and accountability to this important sector, which is playing an increasingly active role in social housing provision.  The extension of the regulatory framework to cover the tenant-landlord relationship in the local authority rented sector is a logical further step, though one for another day.<\/p><p> This is a forward-looking Bill that recognises the need for additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of its functions and the broadening of its remit in order to ensure the good working of the private rented sector.  Most of all, it will contribute to the continued development of the rental sector as an attractive long-term housing option and a crucial factor in the development of a sustainable housing policy as we continue on the road to economic recovery.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500024#W01400","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352989200,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her presentation of this Bill for Second Reading.  I acknowledge her praise and appreciation of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, which was initiated by Fianna F\u00e1il.  I also acknowledge her appreciation of the will expressed in the setting up of the PRTB.  I appreciate the willingness she mentioned during the course of her speech to consider amendments on Committee Stage and I hope that will allow for agreement and support by consensus among all parties here in supporting the Bill.  My party acknowledges that the aim of the Bill is to build on what was initiated in 2004.  It also takes cognisance of the 2009 review of the workings of that Act with a view to introducing more up-to-date legislation that is more in tune with the position on the ground.<\/p><p>  The rental market in Ireland, as the Minster correctly stated, has changed dramatically in recent years.  This is hardly surprising in the context of the housing bubble and its subsequent collapse.  Some of the statistics that have been published since then only highlight the need for this legislation.  The number of households in rented accommodation has increased by 47% since 2006.  Across Ireland, 29% of all people now rent, with 63% of these renting in the private sector; the number of people renting in the private sector has increased by a whopping 86% since 2006.<\/p><p>  When one contrasts the statistics of the PRTB with those of the recent census, one finds a 30% discrepancy between the number of those who stated on the census form that they were renting and the corresponding figure from the PRTB.  That is worrying.  It tells us there is a need to beef up the regulation, and it may tell us there is some fear of the existing regulation or intended future regulation.  It tells us there are obvious problems with the regulation of the sector.  This is something we must take note of and react to in order to ensure it is not the case come the next census.  Whether these discrepancies are a result of poor regulation or a hands-off approach by the Government, or whatever may be the case, that reality needs to change.<\/p><p>  Regulation that provides empowerment will strengthen the market.<\/p><p>An effective regulatory regime should protect tenants and give greater certainty to landlords, which in turn leads to a stronger market, benefiting landlords and tenants and obviously benefiting the State and the providers of housing accommodation.  <\/p><p> There are obvious strains on the PRTB dispute resolution process caused by sheer volume and increased demand, to which the Minister of State alluded.  Demand for the board's services increased by 20% in 2010 and by a further 25% in 2011.  Analysis of the process highlights the deficiencies in the existing legislation and regulation.  Outcomes to disputes are too slow and too laboured and that diminishes trust in the procedures.  Rules, for example, for the termination of tenancies are a legal minefield and resolution procedures are thought to be multi-layered.  The most common complaints must be identified and reacted to in this Bill.  The refusal of landlords to refund deposits was the reason 72% of tenants sought resolution.  Rent arrears and breaches of tenancy obligations amounted to 68% of submissions on the part of landlords.  <\/p><p> It is our duty to highlight deficiencies and to seek to improve the Bill, by consensus.  The addition of voluntary housing associations may stretch the scarce resources of the board.  I hope, with that being the case, adequate resources, training and efficiencies will be built into the board to deal with its heightened role.  It is estimated that there are 700 voluntary and co-operative bodies that have approved housing-body status.  A total of 443 of these have completed one or more housing projects and it is estimated that they contribute 25,000 housing units to the existing stock.  Their tenants are taken from local authority waiting lists.  When such people take up a tenancy under these agencies, the reality is that many of them are short term, either weekly, monthly or periodic and can be terminated with 28 days notice.  Tenants cannot, as we know, ever buy out the unit and if and when they vacate, in certain instances they will never be considered for local authority housing again.  <\/p><p> A number of days ago we spoke about the budget within the Department for social housing, for which the Minister of State is responsible.  I recognise that local authorities cannot, in the current economic circumstances, provide capital construction programmes as they did in the past.  I acknowledge that housing provision must be carried out in a more innovative way and part of that can be, and is in many cases, by means of rental accommodation schemes, RAS and by local authorities rather than the HSE managing the rent allowance scheme.  However, part of that should be also by means of the State deriving, as was intended, a social dividend from NAMA.   Part of that can be also by means of the State, in conjunction with local authorities, auditing the land bank, releasing land to the market and using funds derived from that release to obtain value from the market.  <\/p><p> I admit that I am straying somewhat from the content of the Bill but I caution the Minister of State against blindly, if not intentionally, allowing the voluntary housing sector to increase its stake to a dangerously high level and to become, in effect, the housing authority.  Unless there is proper legislation attached to that in its own right, it will undoubtedly alienate local authorities and by doing so, alienate local authority members throughout the country.  It would undermine their representational role in this area and diminish local democracy, taking powers from them and contradicting the myth that documents such as <i>Putting People First<\/i>empower local authorities.  That is my fear in that regard and perhaps the Minister of State can satisfy me that it is not the case.  I suspect it is not the intention but I would also hope it is not the result of pursuing that policy to the nth degree.  <\/p><p> The streamlining efforts of the Bill focus on changing names, the removal of the &#8364;25 mediation fee and tinkering around with the number of days given to the dispute resolution process.  This does not necessarily constitute decisive action in reforming the work of the board and accelerating the process.  There is nothing in the published Bill dealing with tenants who are in rent arrears, although I acknowledge the indication that this will be dealt with on Committee Stage.  In that context, I will hold my fire for now but I expect to see proposals which will satisfy us all in that regard.  The Bill does not attempt to simplify the intricate rules governing the content of notices of termination.  Nor does it attempt to set any statutory timeframe within which a determination order should be issued following an application to the PRTB for dispute resolution.  No changes are proposed to the controversial provisions on anti-social behaviour.  Apart from the proposed amendments to the rules on mediation, there are no plans to streamline the dispute resolution process more generally or to address the significant problems, in practice, of enforcing of PRTB orders.  I ask the Minister of State to be cognisant of the fact that many people who wish to make a complaint regarding anti-social behaviour do not want to be named and do not want to be victimised as a result of making such a complaint.  In that context, there should be some mechanism within the Bill to allow a third party to act on their behalf, whether it be local garda\u00ed, local representatives or others.  <\/p><p> Revision is needed together with adequately resourced supporting measures to promote an awareness of rights and obligations among landlords and tenants to reduce the scope for disputes.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on that area in particular.  A greater understanding, appreciation and knowledge of the whole system on the part of both parties would alleviate, to some degree, the potential for disputes to arise.  <\/p><p> There is a real need for a deposit retention scheme as a vital component of any fully functioning, vibrant rental market.  Given the high volume of complaints brought by tenants because of the withholding of deposits, an effective scheme would have a far greater impact on speeding up the work of the PRTB than any name changing or other tinkering mentioned earlier.  A new scheme would further stabilise the rental market and bring greater certainty to both tenants and landlords, thus creating a stronger overall housing market.  <\/p><p> The Bill must be amended to adjust to the changed reality of the rental market in Ireland and to the experience of the operation of the board for the past eight years.  As the Minister of State said, the rental market will become increasingly important in the coming years, particularly due to a young, urban demographic and it must be adjusted to encourage a balanced menu of accommodation options.<\/p><p>We acknowledge that the Bill is necessary to take account of the changing circumstances in the market as a result of the relatively youthful demographic of the population.  We wholeheartedly agree with parts of it and I hope there is scope for agreement on other facets.  The Bill is an evolutionary development of what went before it, but certain parts need to be amended and we need further clarity on the deposit retention scheme.  If there is engagement on Committee Stage and a will to reach consensus, I have no doubt the Minister of State will have our support in addressing the issues she has identified.  By doing our job in a correct and proper manner we can address the difficulties that people face.<\/p><p> I have received numerous representations from landlords as well as tenants expressing their frustration with the multi-layered PRTB resolution system.  The Bill offers us an ideal opportunity to address these frustrations.  If we get this right we will resolve the discrepancies between recent census surveys and the PRTB's figures in respect of tenure patterns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500026#Y00200","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352990400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>This is a timely and important Bill.  While there are several missed opportunities in the legislation as it stands, I hope that reasonable changes can be made in order to improve the conditions enjoyed by people seeking to rent their homes.  It is important to remember that when a tenant rents a home it is not simply a place to sleep but also a place to live in comfort and security.  For too long renting a home has been seen as a short-term practice engaged in by younger single people or low earners, with the result that policy has not focused on creating a rental market that provides sufficiently for the everyday needs of working people.  This has become particularly challenging for many people because of the collapse of the property market and the difficulty in obtaining loans.  People who would otherwise be leaving the rental market to buy homes are instead staying on as tenants, which drives up demand while supply remains constant.  Tenants are now paying more and, in many cases, receiving less for their rent but they have limited choice to go elsewhere.<\/p><p>  This problem was created by the policies of successive governments which sought to remove the role of the State in providing housing.  Government policies subsidised private landlords at the expense of the public and local authorities, which put little effort into ascertaining the quality of the homes for which they were paying.  People were told they were foolish if they did not purchase homes and governments made every attempt to encourage home ownership, to the extent of depleting the social housing stock and giving developers free rein to build what and where they pleased.<\/p><p>  It is with this in mind that I welcome these developments on the legislative protection of rights in the tenant-landlord relationship.  It is welcome that some tenants of approved housing bodies will come under the legislation.  The 10,000 NAMA properties to which Threshold referred should also be taken into account.  I understand that certain local authorities have a role where properties are provided on leasing schemes but we should pay careful attention to this area.  Over the past decade housing bodies have become a crucial part of the Irish housing system, partly because of their dedication in providing tailored housing to those in need but also due to the abject failure of the State to provide adequate housing.  I commend Focus, Respond, Cl\u00faid, Sonas and others for doing fine work with limited resources and for their constant advocacy of people's rights to housing.  Housing bodies have also welcomed the move to bring them under the residential tenancies legislation.  These bodies want to have the mechanism of the new residential tenancies board to help them work with their tenants and clients to resolve issues and ensure just resolutions.  No tenant should have fewer rights than another simply because his or her landlord is generally accepted to be a good landlord, which is essentially the idea behind the exclusion of approved housing bodies from the board's remit.<\/p><p>  Focus Ireland stated in a recent submission that while approved housing bodies generally operate as good landlords, offering secure homes and fair and transparent terms to their tenants, the argument for tenants' rights derives not from the weaknesses or strengths of their landlords but from their rights as citizens requiring security in their homes and access to impartial dispute resolution where necessary.  While the Bill starts strongly in this regard, unfortunately it fails to go far enough.  It makes two important exclusions which should not be permitted.  The first is the exclusion of very broadly defined receivers of care services.  This definition is unlikely to cover everyone in receipt of HSE-funded care, but that is implied in the Bill.  Regardless of intent, this provision needs to be redrafted to ensure that people in housing supplied by approved housing bodies are included in the Bill.  The provision as it stands draws an arbitrary line in the sand and excludes vulnerable tenants who need and would greatly benefit from the support of the PRTB.  It is also discriminatory in that it refuses the rights afforded to others to tenants with physical or mental health issues.  This oversight could affect a large number of people and as such render the Bill much less valuable to tenants than originally envisaged.  The issue could be addressed very simply by stating exactly what groups are excluded from the remit of the board.  These could include those in short term emergency or hostel accommodation and high-support residential care, having due regard to legislation on mental capacity.<\/p><p>  The other exclusion in the Bill is for local authority tenants.  I do not understand the reason for this exclusion.  It is obvious that the Department wants to provide the services of the residential tenancies board to as many tenants as possible, and local authority tenants should be in that cohort.  Every Deputy could speak at length on the many housing issues that residents raise about their local authorities, including rent arrears and landlord services.  The inclusion of local authority tenants in the Bill would assist in the resolution of issues that arise regularly.  All tenants should have the same rights.  To leave out a large portion of the Irish renting population is a missed opportunity.  If I were more suspicious I would say the Government feared the repercussions of giving such a tool to a group of people who have often been poorly treated by the State and local authorities.  Perhaps it feared that it would shine a light on the great inadequacies of the State's half-hearted attempts to house the most vulnerable in our society.  It may also fear that providing this service for so many people would be expensive.<\/p><p>If the Government is good at one thing, it is at talking up people's rights but without being willing to fund them.  Right now people in need of help, advice and advocacy struggle to get through to someone on the PRTB telephone lines.  I can only imagine what it would be like if local authority residents were included among these and if the Government's cut and slash policies continue.  Housing bodies and local authorities are struggling, but the Government has no desire to spend money where it is needed.  As a result, here we are with a Bill that is positive but far less so than was possible.<\/p><p> The Government needs to be willing to make the sacrifices necessary to improve the rental market for tenants and to make it easier to deal with bad landlords who disregard their duties to their tenants and the law.  A big part of the problem is that tenants are confused by the laws protecting them.  They are complicated and the landlord generally is able to convince them that they are in the wrong.  Tenants need better, more accessible information on their rights and the ability to report unscrupulous and law-breaking landlords with confidentiality and ease.<\/p><p> The most glaring absence from the Bill is the lack of any deposit retention powers for the PRTB.  As we heard earlier today, deposits are being unfairly held by landlords and this is the single biggest reason people contact many of the bodies which offer advice on housing to tenants.  Threshold today reiterated this point in its annual report.  In 2011, Threshold dealt with 3,259 cases of unreturned deposits.  People cannot afford to leave a place of residence for another with an extra month's rent taken from their pockets because of the intransigence of an unscrupulous landlord.  The PRTB estimated there is one dispute for every 100 tenancies.<\/p><p> There has been much talk with regard to awaiting research on the issue of how a deposit retention scheme would work and whether it would work in Ireland.  The PRTB recommended this research three years ago.  Where is it?  When will we have the research to allow us to implement something we already know we need?  Ireland is not that wildly different a jurisdiction from others and could operate a similar scheme to that operated in other countries.  The only question is whether such a scheme would reduce the number of disputes.  Given the fact that many disputes are probably not reported by tenants, who simply accept their mistreatment and move on in ignorance of their rights, I doubt that the scheme would reduce the number of cases we know about, but it would certainly provide a framework for resolving issues and give tenants the ability or chance to get their rights vindicated.<\/p><p> I welcome the Bill but hope that when it is finally passed through the House, it will be a more robust and have made an important move for tenants rights and the tenant-landlord relationship.  One of the main issues highlighted today concerned the topping-up of rents by people availing of rent supplements.  We need a robust mechanism in place to prevent this.  This practice is quite widespread.  People are topping up rents and driving themselves into poverty and creating a new poor.  In many cases, due to the constant cuts in rental supplement, people are being driven into homelessness.  This is a new problem for us.<\/p><p> We need greater enforcement with regard to registration with the PRTB as many people still do not register.  Whether it can be provided for in this Bill, we need to find a means to oblige people to register.  Penalties or something else must be imposed in order to persuade people to sign up to the system.  It is unfair to others if they do not.  Registration would also help improve standards on the condition of rental properties.  If they do not meet a certain standard, they should be blacklisted or we should have some other mechanism to deal with them.<\/p><p> I support the Bill, despite some inadequacies in it.  In general, it is a good one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500028#AA00200","speaker":"1022","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352991000,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill as this debate gives us a great opportunity to deal with the issues of homelessness, tenants' rights, rents and dispute resolution services.

The subject of the debate was that the Government's policy on homelessness seems to be all talk and no action.  Last night's debate is relevant to this legislation.  I welcome the fact that a group of students got together to organise a debate on an issue such as homelessness and housing, because, sadly, this issue seems to have slipped down the political agenda.  I accept there is an economic crisis and we face banking, EU and ECB issues.

I have not heard much discussion of the issue recently.  The political system needs to wake up to the fact it is an issue and to take account of the reality for many people.<\/p><p>  While the figures produced recently by the Minister of State, who has responsibility for housing, are very accurate, they Minister and the Government must wake up and deal with them.  We need action.  A recent special Consensus report on homeless persons in Ireland indicated that some 3,308 people are sleeping rough or in accommodation designated for the homeless.  Of these, some 2,539 were male and 1,269 were female.  The Minister of State spoke about choice, equity across all housing tenures and delivering quality outcomes for resource investment.  Part of dealing with that means the Government must dig deeper into the causes of the problems for the homeless and people seeking housing.  <\/p><p>  When we examine the facts in the report we see that more than one in four of homeless people aged between 15 and 59 did not have a qualification higher than primary level, as compared with 8% of the general population of the same age.  Some 1,439 homeless people did not have an education qualification beyond lower second level, representing 48.5% of the homeless population aged 15 to 29, as compared with one in four in the general population of this age.  <\/p><p>  Another issue that is never heard about or discussed in this debate is the issue of health and disability among the homeless.  Almost one third of the homeless population indicated its general health was fair, bad or very bad, as compared with 10% of the general population.  A total of 1,581 homeless persons had a disability, representing 42% of the total, in sharp contrast to the general population where the rate is 13%.  In dealing with and attempting to resolve the issue of homelessness, we must face up to the reality that some 42% of the homeless population has some disability.  This is something that has been ignored.  The rate of disability among the general population is approximately 12.9% or 13%.  The most common type of disability among the homeless population is a psychological or emotional condition, with almost one in five indicating he or she had a disability in that category.  It is important to consider this in the context of this legislation and to prioritise it. <\/p><p>I am pleased the Minister of State is present for my contribution and I would strongly like to receive her support.<\/p><p> I refer to a health issue that has emerged in the past couple of weeks, particularly in Dublin.  I do not know about Limerick or Cork.  The rate of TB among homeless persons has increased to such an extent that it is a potential epidemic.  A group of GPs who work with homeless persons have suggested this issue can be resolved at a cost of \u20ac50,000.  The provision of two tranches of \u20ac25,0000 - one now and one six months from now - would allow them to eradicate TB among the homeless population.  If we do not take such action, there will be serious trouble among homeless persons and a public health issue will arise.  I am making this point from a compassionate humanitarian perspective, but I am also making an economic argument.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree that early intervention saves more money for the State and citizens in the long term.  If \u20ac50,000 was made available now to tackle the incidence of TB among homeless persons, it would prevent many people from ending up in accident and emergency units and a crisis 13 months from now.  That is important.<\/p><p> The Simon Communities of Ireland has stated 4,090 people who access its services have been homeless for over five years.  Therefore, this problem has been ongoing for five years.  Before the last general election, the Government signed the Simon pledge on homelessness.  I hope it is not a broken promise like the promise made with regard to education services.  Perhaps the Minister of State might confirm who signed it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500029#BB00600","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352991600,"counter":196,"content":"<p>It was signed by individual Deputies at a time when we were not in government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500030#CC00200","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1352991600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>They signed the Simon pledge when they were in opposition.  We all signed it.  I remember signing it, but I did not know how many were involved.  The Minister of State now has a chance to take action and it is up to her to take that opportunity.  From what I have heard, no major attempt is being made to slash the budget in this area, which I hope is true.  I wish the Minister of State well in this regard.<\/p><p>  Certain issues should be treated as priorities in an economic downturn.  Homelessness and the housing of poorer families and the 97,000 receiving this form of welfare assistance are of particular relevance in this regard.  We need less talk and more action to deal with these matters.  I have already made the economic argument, which is that if we do not take action now, it will cost more to do so in the future.  A very good recent survey in the United States which tracked a homeless person found that the failure to take action in that case ultimately cost the US taxpayer $100,000.  If the man in question had been placed in an apartment, with a small level of support, it would have cost the taxpayer just $25,000.  There is an argument that not intervening to help homeless persons will ultimately cost the taxpayer more because the State will have to spend money to provide other services.<\/p><p>  When we talk about this legislation, it is important to refer to tenancies and persons in rented accommodation.  It is all very well to complain about these matters when one is in opposition, but it is important to make suggestions, too.  I ask the Minister of State to consider three or four proposals to deal with the housing and homelessness issues.  I will refer to some other issues after I have focused on these recommendations.  First, I urge her to consider the provision of 24 hour accommodation with on-site staffing support for those in emergency accommodation.  Second, I would like the resources allocated for visiting supports, to help people moving from homelessness into their own homes, to be increased on the basis of the SLI initiative in the Dublin region.  Third, I am calling for long-term supported housing to be provided to support those who are unable to live on their own and require ongoing support.  Fourth, I would like homeless action teams to be allowed to develop a case management process, providing for move-on options for persons who are homeless, on a pilot basis.  I ask the Minister of State to consider my proposals.<\/p><p>  The Bill seeks to amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  Its objective is to streamline and simplify these Acts and reduce delays in the disputes resolution service of the PRTB.  It also provides for the inclusion in the remit of the Residential Tenancies Acts of tenancies in the voluntary and co-operative housing sector, to which I will refer.  The Minister of State has said the issues of rent arrears and deposit retention are not addressed in this legislation, but she intends to deal with them at a later stage in the legislative process.  If that is true, I welcome it.  I stress that we need to stick to the plan, as we need action rather than words.  The Irish are a great nation to talk.  The Government is great to talk, as Deputy Paschal Donohoe would tell anyone in Dublin Central, but we need more action on the ground.  We must deliver on these issues.<\/p><p>  We have to look at the debate about rents, tenants and allowances.  We should talk about it, rather than run away from it.  I believe strongly that cuts and changes in the payment of rent allowance to the poorest tenants in the private rented sector have been very bad for many of the people in question.  In recent years average cuts of 28% in the maximum rent a person on rent allowance can pay have created real difficulty and hardship, including homelessness, across the State.  I ask the Government to keep an eye on this issue.  Focus Ireland and the Simon Communities of Ireland are very concerned about it.  They are worried that rent supplement has been cut by too much in the past couple of years.  As the Minister of State knows, this payment is made to 97,000 people on social welfare who are living in the private rented sector.  It costs the State approximately &#8364;500 million per annum.  I refer to the reported comments of a former general secretary of the Minister of State's party:<blockquote>Mike Allen, head of advocacy with Focus Ireland, said rents had not come down and in some areas had gone up, forcing significant numbers of tenants into housing that did not meet legal standards and others into homelessness.  The cuts were also preventing homeless people finding accommodation.<\/blockquote>The people working on the ground are telling us the real story about the scale of the problem.<\/p><p>  I would like to focus on some aspects of the legislation.  Section 3 amends section 3(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide that dwellings let by approved housing bodies will be exempt from the provisions of the Act where the dwelling is occupied by a household that has been assessed as having a housing need, and a member of that household is in receipt of care support services.  Under the current legislation, all dwellings let by approved housing bodies to households assessed as having a housing need are exempt from the provisions of the Act.  A definition of &quot;care support services&quot;&#8217; is also set out for the purposes of the exemption.  When we talk about &quot;care support services&quot;, it is important that we focus on efficient services.  When I talk about care support agencies, I always emphasise that we can have all the legislation and wonderful policies in the world, but we must also have the right people doing the right jobs to serve the people.  The right people of the appropriate quality are needed to work as teachers, garda\u00ed, care support workers and special needs assistants in order to prevent the cock-ups, hiccups and problems for which politicians are often blamed.  The point I am making about section 3 is that the care support agencies have a responsibility and a duty to ensure the right people are working in the right places.<\/p><p>  It is important for us to adopt a common sense approach when we talk about what the PRTB has done since it was established in September 2004.  One of its main functions is to mediate where there is disagreement between landlords and tenants.  When a landlord takes on a new tenant, he or she is legally required to register the tenancy with the PRTB and include the names and details of the tenants in that documentation.  The landlord pays the PRTB a fee per tenancy.  It is important for us to focus on the fact that the most common complaint made by tenants relates to the refusal of landlords to refund deposits.  Such complaints accounted for 72% of all cases taken by tenants in 2010.  The most common complaints made by landlords relate to rent arrears or breaches of tenancy obligations.  Such complaints accounted for 68% of all cases taken by landlords.  Orders made by the PRTB are legally binding.  If a landlord or tenant is dissatisfied with a decision of the board, legal recourse to the High Court is permitted on a point of law only.  The costs involved in taking such a court action may be prohibitive for many landlords and tenants.  I mentioned the issues involved in 72% of cases taken by tenants and 68% of cases taken by landlords.  I suggest something is being ducked and dodged.  There are major problems in this regard.  Last week I dealt with the horrific case of a mother of three children who had been thrown out by her landlord without proper notice.  They had to go to Threshold and the PRTB to complain about the way the matter had been dealt with.  I had to deal in my clinic with a major child abuse issue in addition to a housing need.  This should not be allowed to happen.  They ended up going to the homeless section of Dublin City Council and were placed in bed and breakfast accommodation with people who were dysfunctional.<\/p><p>It just did not work.  The poor mother of three just walked out and is currently living with a family member, although I am currently trying to push for housing to be found for her.  The landlord knew the situation and the person was paying her rent, yet he acted in this cold-blooded manner.  That is one example from the landlord perspective.  Equally, I know of a tenant who was violently threatening a female landlord on the north side of Dublin.  In that situation, he did not even bother paying his rent although he was getting the rent from the State.  That is also going on out there.<\/p><p> I make the point that there is no simple cure.  The Minister said there is no magic bullet and she is right.  It is a complex issue and difficult situations arise.  There is a lot of bullying and intimidation happening in the private rental sector, which is why we need policing and regulation.  God knows, we all know about regulation and this country has suffered from the lack of it in recent years.  People might call it regulation but I see a need for good old-fashioned public servants, people who are doing their jobs effectively.  We need to watch this issue, and it is not just a matter for the Government or for the Minister but for all of us.  Tenants who are getting money from the State through rent supplement or landlords receiving rent need to act with respect and in a dignified manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500030#CC00300","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352992200,"counter":199,"content":"<p>\"Magic bullets do not exist\" is the exact quote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500031#DD00200","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1352992200,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for that intervention.  With regard to the resolution issues dealt with in the Bill, in 2010, 59% of applications for dispute resolution were from tenants and 37% from landlords, with only 4% from third parties.  Therefore, a substantial number from both sides are not happy with what is happening on the ground.  I assume the third-party applicants who represent 4% of the total are there because of anti-social issues, which is not acceptable.  People who are getting rent from the State should respect the fact they are getting money, and they should use it wisely and try to do their best to get on with their lives.  From 2000 to 2010 there was a 93% increase in tribunal hearings and, despite the increase, waiting times for tribunal hearings decreased from six to eight months in 2007 to two to three months in 2009 and 2010.  It is clear many cases are being dealt with under the legislation.<\/p><p>  It is important to note the intention of the Bill, which has five main sections.  Those tenancies in the voluntary and co-operative housing sector that most closely parallel private rented tenancies are being regulated under the Act.  This will give tenants in the voluntary and co-operative sector the same rights as tenants in the private sector, which is a positive aspect of the legislation that I strongly welcome.  We need to give all tenants in the voluntary and co-operative sector these same rights.<\/p><p>  The agency responsible for regulation of the tenant-landlord relationship, the PRTB, is being renamed the residential tenancies board, or RTB, which makes it shorter and sweeter.  Formal effect will be given to the merger of the rent tribunal with the residential tenancies board.  I note there is a reduction in the size of the board from 15 to 12 members.  Measures to increase the take-up of mediation as a key dispute resolution mechanism are proposed; this is also important.  When issues can be resolved through mediation, this must be welcomed.  We need to stop the spending of money on crazy situations so I welcome these measures to increase the take-up of mediation.<\/p><p>  There are several main themes running through the legislation, including dispute resolution services and statutory regulation of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.  Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 enables housing authorities to provide assistance to approved housing bodies, limited companies and trusts incorporated under the Charities Acts.  Under section 6 of that Act, a housing body must have as primary objects the relief of housing needs, poverty, hardship or the welfare of Travellers, and the provision and management of housing.<\/p><p>  This brings me to the issue of poverty and Travellers, and we must face up to the reality of this.  It is not acceptable for a Minister or Deputy to be involved in any situation that damages the prospect of accommodation for Travellers who genuinely need housing.  I do not play the blame game, as many others do.  If some Travellers are involved in anti-social behaviour and crime, that is their problem, but one cannot label the whole community because of the actions of a minority.  Some members of the settled community are involved in drug gangs and crimes in Dublin city, as I know well, but we do not blame the whole community on the north side of Dublin.  I was extremely disappointed to see the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, and other Ministers taking a very anti-Traveller line.  This is not acceptable from a Minister responsible for the environment and for housing itself.  People have rights and deserve to be respected.  By all means, if somebody is involved in anti-social behaviour or crime, he or she should be hammered as in any similar situation and the law should apply equally.  However, the minorities within this State have to be protected and I would challenge any prejudice against them, although it might not necessarily be politically correct to stand up for the vast majority of Travellers in Irish society who are trying to be fair and decent.  I commend groups such as Pavee Point, which have done much in the area of education for Travellers as well as in the area of housing, and which work closely with different bodies.  Politicians should be dealing with racism and prejudice and should be trying to help people move away from these attitudes.  We should also focus on education.  Pavee Point has done fantastic work with groups of women and some fantastic people have passed through the centre in Dublin due to the old-fashioned idea that education leads to the liberation of such people.  We should be encouraging this, not cutting back on it.<\/p><p>  Much similar work on tenancy legislation was undertaken in New Zealand, where the law requires that a landlord who takes a deposit, sometimes called a bond, from a tenant, must lodge it with the Tenancy Services Centre within 23 working days of receiving it.  When the tenant wants the bond back, both the tenant and the landlord must complete a bond transfer, which is sent to the Tenancy Services Centre.  Tenant and landlord must state on the form the amount they agree to be refunded to each party.  Many disputes between tenants and landlords in New Zealand are resolved by mediation, which is organised by the Tenancy Services Centre to help landlords and tenants talk about and solve their problems.  A mediator helps tenants and landlords discuss the problem, identify the issues and reach a workable solution.  If agreement is not reached, the next step is to go to the Tenancy Tribunal for a court hearing.<\/p><p>  The PRTB report of 2009, which is independently authored, cites the successes of the New Zealand scheme and states that it supports the effective operation of the residential housing market, supports tenants and landlords in making well-informed decisions and operating with confidence in the rental housing market, and resolves disputes.  Online applications to the dispute service and an online registration system are currently being developed.  Some 72% of applications for dispute resolution were resolved out of court, which is a fantastic achievement.  The increasing use of telephone mediation services results in the resolution of disputes without the need for landlords and tenants to physically attend appointments.  The majority of bonds, some 82%, were refunded, and speedy resolution of disputes was achieved.  What has happened in New Zealand is important for us to consider.<\/p><p>  I referred earlier to Focus Ireland and Simon Ireland, as it is now called, but there are also many smaller groups that do great work on homelessness.  One voluntary group I encountered recently is Stepping Stone, which has been providing homes to people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. Perhaps the Minister of State knows of the group.  I suggest it would be a good idea to work closely with it.<\/p><p>We must face the reality that 2,366 adults accessed homeless services.  The Minister referred to the low number of people sleeping rough.  On 7 November I asked the Minister in the House about the number of homeless people.  The response was that on 6 September 2012 the Central Statistics Office published its special census report, Homeless Persons in Ireland, which indicated that 3,808 persons were either sleeping rough or in accommodation designated for the homeless on the night of 10 April 2011.  The rough sleeper count was 64, with 59 of those people located in Dublin.  The Minister said that it is not tolerable that anyone should sleep on the streets but that it is important that homeless figures released are not confused with the number of people sleeping rough.  The vast majority classified in the Central Statistics Office\u2019s report as homeless are in long-term emergency accommodation.  In a previous life I was a full-time worker with the Simon Community, now called Simon Ireland.  I was also a soup-runner in Dublin for a couple of years in my youth.  Three of us used to go around in a car and make calls.  We would get between seven and ten calls a night.  We used to do it on Thursdays.  Sometimes one would come across nine or ten other cases.  When I hear that the number for people sleeping rough in Dublin is 59, I know for a fact that the figure is higher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500031#DD00300","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352992800,"counter":202,"content":"<p>It was very carefully counted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500032#EE00200","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1352992800,"counter":203,"content":"<p>From my experience we always came across extra homeless people.

I welcome the debate on the Bill which was brought to the House by the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O' Sullivan this summer.  The debate on residential tenancies is timely.  The Bill provides for significant reform of residential tenant-landlord agreements and will also bring the voluntary and co-operative housing sector under the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.<\/p><p>  Most, if not all, of us are familiar with the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, and the work it does in assisting tenants who are in dispute with landlords for a variety of reasons.  The principal causes of disputes are the refusal by landlords to return deposits and the failure of tenants to pay rent on time.  The PRTB has helped many people on both side of rental agreements since it was first established in 2004.  The Bill is the first step towards the statutory regulation of tenancies in the voluntary and co\u00adoperative housing sector under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.<\/p><p>  Tenancies in the voluntary and co-operative housing sector will have to be registered in the PRTB, and the PRTB will then be responsible for the regulation of the tenant-landlord relationship in those properties.  It is a two-way track and tenants must adhere to the rental accommodation rules.  Likewise, landlords must treat residents as human beings, and look after their welfare and care.  The change will bring greater transparency and accountability to the rental sector, which is badly needed.  However, it is important to note that the addition of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector will further stretch the PRTB's scarce resources.  In 2010, the PRTB received 2,230 applications for dispute resolution, and I can only imagine that including tenancies from the voluntary and co-operative housing sector will put significant pressure on the service when its staff numbers are being reduced.  As a public representative I am familiar with people coming to my clinics who have problems with landlords and vice versa.  The legislation we introduce will allow for more transparency and accountability for both landlords and tenants.<\/p><p>  Voluntary housing associations are non-profit organisations.  I am familiar with the work they do in Dublin.  They play an increasingly active role in social housing provision right across the country.  There are 700 voluntary and co-operative bodies in this country with approved status as housing bodies, but the ones with which I am most familiar in my area are the Iveagh Trust; Cl\u00faid Housing; Circle Housing; Oaklee Housing; Sophia Housing; Habitat for Humanity, which recently refurbished two beautiful houses in my constituency; and Fold Housing, which recently opened lovely apartments in Terenure.  They all provide a high standard of accommodation and have a good relationship with their tenants.  However, at present, those tenants do not have the same rights as private tenants, which is why the Bill is so important.<\/p><p>  I have encountered a number of issues concerning tenants of voluntary housing associations, which are important to mention.  If the Minister of State is not aware of the issues I encourage her to examine them.  There must be clarification on how voluntary housing organisations assess tenants for rent if they are participating in community employment schemes.  Some tenants are encountering problems with their rent being increased as their income from CE schemes is being taken into account.  That does not happen in Dublin City Council because it does not take income from CE schemes into account.  The practice is unfair as income from CE schemes is low and it is hard enough for people to get by without voluntary housing associations adding an extra burden on them.<\/p><p>  Unfortunately, there is no provision in the Bill relating to rent arrears.  I might have missed what the Minister of State said on the matter in her introduction.  I believe she will address the issue on Committee Stage.  Rent arrears are a problem for many housing agencies and landlords.  A total of 31% of all disputes at the PRTB concern rent arrears, which is consuming a huge portion of PRTB resources.  Furthermore, once a formal dispute is registered with the PRTB, tenants can remain in their rented property until the dispute is resolved, and are likely not to pay any rent during this period, which presents a major problem for the landlord.  This anomaly must be addressed.<\/p><p>  One further issue which is omitted from the Bill, and which must also be addressed is the lack of a deposit protection scheme.  That would help to alleviate the frequent occurrence of landlords withholding deposits.  I understand the PRTB was commissioned to carry out research on such a scheme and report back to the Minister of State with responsibility for housing.  I sincerely hope she will act on the findings.<\/p><p>I note the Bill does not deal with the issue of anti-social behaviour problems in rented properties.  This is a very serious matter and I have encountered it on many occasions.  When people come to me, their public representative, with a complaint about a city council tenant living next door we always seem to be able to contact the city council and deal with the issue.  Most times the problem is resolved.  However, if there is a private tenant living next door who causes trouble it is very difficult to find anybody who will take responsibility.  I know the Minister of State will consider that point.  In private tenancies, there are no guidelines or provisions to deal with such problems and this can cause great upset for every neighbour on the road.  Recently I met a lady who had such tenants living beside her.  She told me she was considering selling her house because of what was happening.  She had been trying for a number of weeks to contact the landlord and was still having difficulty.  When people have lived in an area for a long time this is most disheartening.  The problem was that the people in question were not city council tenants and therefore it was very difficult to deal with the situation.<\/p><p> I fully support the establishment of a voluntary housing organisation, especially as the city council and local authorities no longer have the same housing stock to give out as they had in the past.  There are good reasons for that - people are now able to buy homes at reduced rates and families can stay in the community where they were born, thereby becoming extended families.  Most public representatives will find significant problems in the area of housing because there is not enough social housing stock.  I welcome organisations such as Cl\u00faid Housing and Circle Housing and all the others I mentioned because they are an alternative and offer people an opportunity to get good accommodation and decent living quarters with, for the most part, fair management.  There are some problems here and there.<\/p><p> I welcome the Bill and hope that all the little problems that speakers have highlighted will be taken on board when the Bill is examined on Committee Stage.  I thank the Minister of State for her honesty and her earlier words.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500032#EE02100","speaker":"1029","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352993400,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I join Deputy Byrne in welcoming the Bill and I thank the Minister of State for attending.  I approve of everything the Bill contains and hope it will make a contribution to the proper and efficient regulation of the sector.<\/p><p>  The issue I wish to raise was touched upon by Deputy Byrne, namely, anti-social behaviour within the private rental sector and the broader issue of maintenance of private rental properties and the standards they are meant to attain.  I acknowledge a point made by the Minister of State, namely, the exponential improvement in the regulation of the private rental sector in recent years.  Her Department publishes a spreadsheet on a regular basis which details the number of inspections of private rented property and the consequent number of prosecutions or actions that take place, breaking these figures down by local authority areas across the country.  This allows us to see that the number of inspections has greatly increased in recent years, as the Minister of State noted, and also that the number of actions taken in consequence is also increasing.  In the same period regulations in respect of the quality of private rental property have been modernised and updated.  I very much welcome the two developments and can see the impact they are having on the ground.<\/p><p>  Given all of that, nonetheless anything between one fifth and one third of all my constituency work, particularly in respect of anti-social behaviour and standard of living, relates to the private rented sector.  Week after week, when I go to community meetings in Dublin Central - I am sure it is the same for Deputy Byrne - I repeatedly hear about the difficulties residents and tenants face in regard to the quality of private rental property and the behaviour that goes on inside such property.  People report considerable difficulty in doing anything about it.<\/p><p>  I stress that the percentage of properties involved, whether they are reported for tenant behaviour or for appearance and upkeep, is small but not as small as I would like it to be.  It is enough that it causes gigantic issues for people who live near or alongside these properties.  I offer as illustration two examples I have been involved in in recent months.  The first is a property in my constituency at which there was sustained and regular anti-social and criminal behaviour.  This required a considerable effort on the part of the city council and the Garda.  They could identify quickly enough who the landlord was but they could not discover how to contact him.  They had an address and a telephone number but although they wrote and called repeatedly they got no response.  Garda\u00ed put in a considerable number of man hours before they could communicate directly with the landlord to tell him that his tenants were causing havoc in the local community and that he would have to take action and responsibility for what was happening.  This took a gigantic amount of time on the part of the local Garda inspector.  What people had to deal with was not only the sustained anti-social behaviour coming from the property but also its appearance, which was diabolical.  They had to try to ensure that the tenants would act on the complaint and that the landlord would care enough about what was going on to hold the tenants accountable for what they were doing.  It was enormously difficult to achieve this.  Deputy Byrne mentioned a constituent who told her she was seeking to move from the area because of difficulties relating to a property.  I encounter that complaint on at least a monthly basis from residents in any given area.  I can offer a second illustration.  On the North Circular Road in Dublin, which is part of my constituency, there are absolutely beautiful homes and houses.  However, over time, a steady number have been degraded and allowed to descend into terrible condition because a small number of landlords have completely abdicated their responsibility towards their property.<\/p><p>  I can bookend those negative examples with another, which shows how local authorities are seeking to respond to this problem.  I cannot praise enough the recent action taken by Dublin City Council and the Garda who have gone from door to door in an intensive attempt to try to identify how many tenants are in a property and the conditions within it.  They ask if there is tax compliance and whether the social welfare payments that go into a property are going into places that are fit for accommodation and meet proper rental standards.  However, the amount of activity that has to go into doing this work is unsustainable.  As much as I would like the city council to continue doing this kind of work, it is too much to ask of either the council or the Garda.  We need to look at the regulations and laws that relate to these two areas of the rental sector and I ask the Minister of State to act on this.  I believe she is considering the first, namely, the appearance of residential property and where responsibility for the waste management of a property lies.  Time was when, if one wanted to find out if a large house was being rented out, one would look at the number of doorbells on the front door.<\/p><p>One can now establish this by counting the number of bins outside a property and seeing how regularly they are filled to overflowing.<\/p><p> These matters may appear inconsequential but they have a colossal impact on the way people feel about the communities in which they live and on how those communities present themselves to the outside world.  The number one issue with which so many of the communities I represent in Dublin Central regularly deal relates to their inability to ensure that a small number of private rented accommodation units - either apartments or houses - are maintained in the way they should be.  I am only referring to a small number of landlords in this instance.  However, as stated earlier, that number is not as small as we would wish and it is big enough that it is having an utterly disproportionate effect on the quality of life of people who live in all areas of the city centre, particularly those located in the constituency I represent.  Deputy Catherine Byrne also referred to this matter.<\/p><p> The second issue to which consideration must be given is antisocial behaviour on the part of tenants.  There are two particular difficulties which arise in this regard.  The first is the difficulty in contacting landlords when issues emerge.  Ultimately, landlords must take an interest in what is happening on their properties and they must be willing to respond to any antisocial behaviour.  I deal with a certain Garda inspector who does Trojan work in this area and I am aware that members of the force are obliged to spend hours or days trying to make contact with landlords.  In my experience, landlords do two things in cases of this nature.  They either ignore repeated efforts to contact them or, if contact is made, they inform the officers involved that the amount of effort being made to contact them is tantamount to harassment.<\/p><p> In some parts of our city, tenants are living in slum conditions and this is having a desperate effect on the people who live nearby.  I want to ensure that more will be done in the future to protect the quality of life of those in private rented accommodation and other residents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500033#FF00200","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1352994000,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Debate","time":1352994000,"counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500034#GG00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes","time":1352994000,"counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500034#GG00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1352994000,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming before the House in order to clarify some issues that have arisen in respect of the eligibility criteria for existing participants on community employment schemes, which, I am informed, changed on 8 October last.  I have been contacted by a number of schemes with regard to this matter and I am informed that in order to qualify for more than one year on a community employment scheme, participants over the ages of 35 and 55 are now required to have been signing on and in receipt of social welfare payments for three years or more prior to joining a scheme.  These individuals could previously remain on schemes for three and six years, respectively.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position in this regard.<\/p><p>  Extended access to employment on these schemes for those over the age 55 was facilitated as a result of the difficulties which those in this cohort faced in the context of trying to secure alternative employment.  It has been acknowledged that during the Celtic tiger era, those over 55 years of age experienced difficulties in securing employment.  Surely it should be recognised that there are even fewer employment opportunities for them at present.  There are major problems with regard to isolation in rural areas and there are very few job opportunities outside of agriculture for those in this age group.  Community employment schemes are filling the void by providing meaningful employment that makes a real difference within communities.  It makes no sense, therefore, to pull the plug - if that is actually what is happening - on some of these schemes in the middle of a recession.<\/p><p>  I wish to refer to two schemes in particular, namely, the Kilrush youth services scheme and the St. John the Baptist community and development scheme in Ballyea, County Clare.  However, I accept that there are other schemes which have either similar or other concerns.  The schemes to which I refer were renewed last year on the understanding that the <i>status quo<\/i> would be maintained.  The sponsors of the Kilrush scheme are debating whether it is feasible for the scheme to continue in light of the changes.  I am informed that the scheme stands to lose 15 participants this year as opposed to five.  This is in an area in which very few job opportunities exist.  I have a constituency office in Kilrush and I am aware that the youth services scheme provides a lifeline for people in the town.  Those on the scheme support the local community hospital and work to maintain the local graveyards, the parish hall and the church grounds.  In conjunction with the tidy towns committee, they also see to the upkeep of Kilrush and Kilkee.  Furthermore, they provide assistance to the west Clare cancer group.<\/p><p>  The position with the St. John the Baptist development scheme in Ballyea is similar.  I met representatives from the scheme on Monday last and was informed that out of a current complement of 22 workers, only five will remain in place at the end of January 2013.  The majority of the workers on this scheme are over 55 and they are making an invaluable contribution to the local community.  These individuals provide support to my parish, Ballynacally, and to the community in Ballyea.  They also work with local amenity projects in maintaining the abbey and the graveyard in Killone.  Those on the scheme support the community in Lissycasey.  They played a pivotal role in the development of the Lissycasey Cascades Loop, a 3.7 km walk through a local area.<\/p><p>  I am informed that if the schemes in question are wound down, a number of full-time employees who have given great services to the communities in the past will be affected.  These people deserve recognition for their efforts.  I am aware that the Minister is a great supporter of schemes of this type.<\/p><p>  While I understand that changes to the eligibility criteria are driven by the desire to increase the number of opportunities for people to participate in community employment schemes, I am of the view that, if they proceed, people will be obliged to return to the live register at a time when few other employment opportunities exist.<\/p><p>The future of these schemes is threatened as the sponsor will find it difficult to replace existing workers.  Time spent on community employment schemes no longer counts as eligibility for social welfare payments.  A person who decides to accept a place on a community employment scheme may not have sufficient stamps at the end of a year to qualify for social welfare payment.  In my view, this would be a disincentive to working on a community employment scheme.  I ask the Minister to clarify the regulations governing these schemes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500034#GG00400","speaker":"974","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352994600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Breen for raising this issue.  The underlying eligibility criteria for entry to community employment has not changed.  Eligibility for entry to community employment is based on applicants being in receipt of welfare payments for a defined length of time, notably jobseeker's allowance, jobseeker's benefit, one-parent family payment and persons in receipt of disability-related welfare payments.  Persons in receipt of jobseeker's and lone-parent type payments can qualify for one year on community employment under the one-year part-time integration, PTI, option if in receipt of a payment for 12 months or more.  Being in receipt of the same payments for three years or more qualifies a person for the part-time job option which can last up to three years, subject to annually renewable contracts.  However, the practice of using the duration on a community employment scheme under the one-year part-time integration option, PTI, to build up eligibility to participate in the three-year part-time job option, was amended in a recent updating of community employment operating guidelines, published on 8 October 2012 and issued to CE sponsors and departmental staff.<\/p><p>  The reason for this amendment was to reserve the longer time duration on CE for participants who are very distant from the labour market and most in need of the longer duration part-time job option.  Some minor amendments were made to the CE operating guidelines based on feedback from staff and supervisors and this document will be updated as and when required.<\/p><p>  I wish to clarify that this amendment will apply to new entrants only.  This amendment is in line with the pathways to work policy where one third of the places on community employment schemes are focused on shorter, more intensive, active labour market interventions.  The effect of this change will be to increase the number of vacancies available on CE schemes.  The number of people able to avail of a CE placement will increase as more vacancies become available due to a greater number of exits from the programme.  This still maintains the overall number of places on community employment schemes.  The number of places on employment programmes in general, including CE, rural social scheme, T\u00fas etc., is under continual review to ensure that it is adequate for the needs of the labour market.  Since 3 April 2000, all community employment scheme participation is subject to the maximum participation limit of three years overall for those under 55 years of age and six years overall for those aged 55 to 65 years.  Participants who were or are in receipt of a CE-qualifying disability-linked social welfare payment can avail of one additional year on top of these maxima.  Department officials are actively liaising with sponsors to facilitate recruitment and to ensure continuity of service for projects and for the local communities.<\/p><p>  I will refer to the schemes referred to by Deputy Breen.  Kilrush youth centre services has 21 participants and one CE supervisor.  It is due to roll over on 28 January 2013.  It has eight vacancies to be filled under the current rules.  A further six would have had to finish if the amended rule were applied to all CE participants and not just to new entrants.  Exit interviews for these participants will be conducted as part of the individual learner plan process, along with a referral to the employment services.  St. John the Baptist Association Limited, has 20 participants and rolled over on 29 October 2012.<\/p><p>  The main objective of community employment is to enable long-term unemployed people to re-enter the labour market through the provision of training and work experience on a fixed term basis.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and I wish to assure him that the Department of Social Protection will continue to liaise with the sponsors to fill vacancies on community employment schemes on an ongoing basis.  I value community employment schemes.  I have emphasised the retention of opportunities and placements for people who are so anxious to get back to work and to contribute to their community.  However, as the Deputy is aware, we have offered an additional 11,000 places in T\u00fas and in the JobBridge scheme.  I hope to be able to continue to expand opportunities for people who are anxious to participate in community-type employment in their localities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500035#HH00200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1352994600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply.

These are people who have given a lifetime of work to their community and they are now unemployed.  They do great work in the CE schemes: they often do the work that was formerly carried out by local authority workers.  Their opportunities for work are very limited when they leave the CE schemes.  It is difficult to find a job when one is 55 years of age, particularly in rural areas.  I appreciate their work, as do most Members.

The family income supplement is paid to workers whose income from employment leaves the family below the poverty line.  In 2011 the numbers qualifying for family income supplement rose by 10%.  I presume the same increase will occur this year.  Applications have increased this year.  Since this Government came to power, the number of workers classified as under-employed has increased by 120,000 to 150,000.<\/p><p>Under-employed workers are those who would work more hours if they were available.  My statistics are taken from the quarterly national household survey.  A report in May by the retail sector trade union Mandate found that 39% of its members had reported a fall in take-home pay, with an average decrease of over \u20ac105 per week.  I believe the average was \u20ac109.  Average retail workers' hours have declined by 4.3% in the past year alone.  This represents a substantial income change.<\/p><p> As the unemployment grows and wages fall, the number depending on FIS to keep their heads above water will continue to increase.  However, owing to a failure of the Government to resource properly the Department of Social Protection, application processing times have become inexcusably long across a range of social welfare schemes, some of which we have discussed.  The delays under the FIS scheme leave families in desperate circumstances.  They are forced into arrears in respect of many household bills and left at risk of energy disconnection and eviction and at the mercy of moneylenders.  Some families are left hungry, as is evident from the rise in the incidence of food poverty.<\/p><p> The FIS scheme has been subject to a growing backlog of applicants, particularly in the past six months.  The processing times are a source of embarrassment to the Government.  I suspect this embarrassment, coupled with a desire to defer as many of the back payments as possible until the next budgetary cycle, or early next year, has prompted the Minister and her officials to make a cynical decision that the FIS section of the Department should process only those applications received on or after 5 November.  The effect is that new applications for family income supplement will be processed before those submitted five or six months ago.  The new applications may be processed immediately, while those applicants who are unfortunate enough to have submitted applications earlier this year will be left waiting.  The existing applications backlog is being withdrawn from the FIS section and transferred to Letterkenny, but it is not clear what additional resources, if any, are being deployed to deal with the additional applications.<\/p><p> The Minister hopes to kid the public by kicking these applications to touch.  She is attempting to pull a fast one at the expense of vulnerable families.  I have been given to understand most of the families who applied before 5 November will not receive any payment before Christmas.  Over 7,000 families, with almost 16,000 children, are affected by the delay in clearing the backlog.  What are they to do for Christmas and about the growing arrears in their household bills?<\/p><p> Will the Minister confirm that there has been a decision to instruct the FIS section to send all applications not processed prior to 5 November to Letterkenny?  Have additional resources been given to the relevant office in Letterkenny?  If so, from where were those resources drawn?

The family income supplement scheme provides income support for employees on low earnings with families and is designed to preserve the incentive to take up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might be only marginally better off than if he or she was claiming other social welfare payments.  The average waiting time for new FIS claims at the end of October was 18 weeks and for renewal applications, 19 weeks.  At the end of October, there were 7,000 new FIS applications and 7,800 renewal applications awaiting a decision.  The volume of FIS claims in hand and the delays in processing are, as the Deputy acknowledged, a consequence of the continuing strong claim intake.  This is also the case in the other areas to which the Deputy referred.  There are substantial increases in the number applying for social welfare benefits across the board, particularly family income supplement, carer's allowance, domiciliary care allowance, etc.  I am happy that, despite the current economic difficulties, we have been able to deal with the higher volume of claims, pay out more to qualifying applicants and do so in higher numbers.<\/p><p>  I have told the Deputy before that an in-depth business process improvement project has recently been completed for the FIS scheme.  This project focused on optimising output and customer service and the elimination of backlogs.  Part of the project was a detailed examination of workloads and a full assessment of existing capacity within the area and what capacity was needed to process the volume of claims, both new and renewed, received on a weekly basis.  A plan has now been devised and implementation commenced on 5 November.  This plan sees the normal weekly new claim and renewal intake processed without delay, while the backlog has been ring-fenced.  There is a focused team assigned to this work and a clear plan for the elimination of the backlog.  The first step taken to eliminate permanently the build-up of backlogs of FIS claims is to have sufficient capacity and suitable structures and processes in place to deal with the weekly intake.  This has been done in the case of the FIS scheme and the first week of operation has been very successful, with target output achieved.<\/p><p>  I congratulate the staff in my Department who have transferred to new and improved business processes with a view to offering a better service to our many customers.  That is not to say the backlog of claims awaiting decision is being ignored or that work has ceased thereon.  On the contrary, as the Deputy has been advised, a separate team, with additional temporary resources, has been identified and is already assigned to and working on the claims in question.  I am sure the Deputy welcomes this, even if he is a little down over social welfare staff working in Donegal.  The work being done in Donegal is highly welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500036#JJ00200","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1352995200,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I have no problem with the work being done in Donegal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500036#JJ00300","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speech","time":1352995200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>The Letterkenny office and staff are to be highly commended.

The problem is that the backlog will not be dealt with before Christmas, yet applicants who apply from this week will have their claims dealt with and be in receipt of payment in many cases by the end of this month or before Christmas.

It is appropriate to focus on it because it gives us an indication of what is wrong with our health service from a medical and financial perspective.  Patients in Dublin currently wait approximately two years to see an orthopaedic surgeon but a patient in the south east can be waiting up to four years for a routine appointment to attend an orthopaedic surgeon.  If a general practitioner marks a patient's case as urgent it will often be a year before that urgent case is seen by an orthopaedic consultant.  This problem has been ongoing for years and it is no longer acceptable.  Patients and their general practitioners have no idea how long they will be waiting to see an orthopaedic consultant.  This appears to be a problem across all specialties, and part of my question to the Minister is whether he will publish data from the special delivery unit on the number of people waiting for consultant appointments in all specialties in the south east.  It might help doctors referring patients if they knew how long people would have to wait because a hospital or a consultant with a shorter waiting time could be identified and the patient referred directly to that hospital or consultant.<\/p><p>  I am also concerned about what we are hearing about the reorganisation of the service in the south east, as it will not tackle the major problem.  The retention of catchment areas will continue to support the inequality and inefficiencies in our health services.  That inequality sees patients in one part of the country waiting two years to see an orthopaedic consultant while patients in another part wait four years.  The problem was supposed to have been ironed out with the establishment of the HSE, yet there has been no significant change to the <i>status quo<\/i>.  The stated policy of our Government that money should follow the patient would help to reduce that inequality, but I would like to know whether that forms part of the remit of Professor John Higgins in reorganising the health services not just in the south east but across the country.  Will we see money following the patient, and will it have an impact on waiting times?  If that was the case it would at least reduce the inequality and we would see people being treated equally across the country in the future.  I ask the Minister of State to address those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500037#KK01900","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speech","time":1352995800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I apologise for the non-attendance of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and his two Ministers of State, who are detained at a press conference.  They thought they would be here to take this Topical Issue matter, but I have been given that job.<\/p><p>  I thank the Deputy for raising what I understand is a huge issue in the south east.  Immediately following his appointment, the Minister for Health set about establishing the special delivery unit, SDU, whose aim is to unblock access to acute services, both emergency and elective, by improving the flow of patients through the system.  The SDU's scheduled care team addressed access to elective care and initially focused on waiting times for inpatient and day case elective surgery.  So far this year, overall waiting list numbers have fallen from 56,020 to 49,601, a decrease of 11%; the number of adults having to wait more than 12 months is down from 2,435 to 118, a decrease of 95%; the number of adults having to wait more than nine months is down from 5,676 to 415, a decrease of 93%; and the number of children having to wait 20 weeks is down from 1,712 to 276, a decrease of 84%.<\/p><p>  The SDU is now beginning to focus on outpatient waiting times, building on work already undertaken by the HSE.  A priority action for the HSE has been the development and implementation of standardised reporting for outpatient access through the HSE outpatient data quality programme, which has enabled reporting of outpatient waiting lists from January 2012.  Waiting times have been published on <i>www.hse.ie<\/i> each month as part of the HSE performance reports.  The latest HSE performance report for September 2012 shows that 25,643 patients are waiting for a consultant outpatient appointment in Waterford across all specialties, underlining the critical need to address outpatient waiting times.<\/p><p>  Together with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, the SDU is building on the work already done regarding outpatient waiting lists.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiting times across all hospitals.  In the first instance, this will allow the SDU and the NTPF to target their resources towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.<\/p><p>  Over the course of 2013 to 2015, the HSE, together with the SDU and the HSE clinical programmes, intends to radically reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time.  Key elements of this large programme of reform will include ongoing validation of waiting lists, the systematic and standardised management of referrals from primary care, a reduction in unacceptably high did-not-attend rates, and discharging from outpatient services when clinically appropriate.  Maximum waiting time targets of 12 months for a first-time outpatient appointment by 30 November 2013, 26 weeks by 30 November 2014 and 13 weeks by November 2015 are the goals for the HSE and the SDU.<\/p><p>In regard to orthopaedic outpatient waiting lists in Waterford, several initiatives are under way to address the issue.  Up to 2,000 of the longest waiting patients from the south east have been transferred to Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital.  The national musculoskeletal national clinical programme has commenced and aims to reduce the outpatient department, OPD, waiting list for both orthopaedics and rheumatology through physio-led clinics which will run alongside the consultant clinic.<\/p><p><i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/i><\/p><p>An arthoplasty clinical nurse specialist-led initiative relating to the care of patients after their surgery will result in an increased number of new patient slots in consultant clinics.  Waiting lists are continually being validated and a programme of validating the longest waiters is currently under way.  Waterford Regional Hospital continues to receive approximately 400 new referrals each month to the orthopaedic service.  The initiatives I have outlined, along with the national outpatient improvement programme, are designed to ensure that those patients are seen in a timely manner and receive the care they need, when they need it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500037#KK02000","speaker":"1098","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352996400,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I want to reiterate the need for us to get the information the special delivery unit is receiving about waiting times for each consultant in all hospitals in the south east.

The National Maternity Hospital has been located on Holles Street since 1894 and has provided 118 years of service.  However, the site is unsuitable for future expansion and there have been a series of recommendations for it, the latest being the 2008 KPMG independent review of maternity and services in the greater Dublin area.  It recommended the hospital should be co-located alongside adult acute services at St. Vincent\u2019s.  Holles Street is Ireland's busiest maternity hospital with nearly 10,000 babies born there in 2010.  The baby boom is stretching the fabric of its outdated building to the limit.<\/p><p>  As a former member of the board, I am aware there were concrete plans to relocate to Elm Park.  Unfortunately, this was not carried out by previous Administrations when funds were available.  The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, has informed me two buildings are available in the Elm Park development with 19,230 sq. m. of gross internal floor area and another with 10,869 sq. m.  The building could be retrofitted to accommodate a maternity hospital which would provide the modern facilities and co-location all experts agree is required.  I understand discussions took place between the Minister for Health and NAMA which have now concluded.  When will the Minister seek sanction for a move from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for this move?<\/p><p>  Maternity services in Dublin are at breaking point.  With the recent announcement of the location of the national children's hospital, it is important we recognise the new-born and mothers are provided with a building fit for purpose and are co-located with adult services.  The HSE has spent over \u20ac16 million on capital investment at Holles Street in the past ten years, over \u20ac2 million alone in 2011, to adapt a building over a century old.  Tacking on space is not an answer.  The announcement of the site for the national children\u2019s hospital was very much welcomed.  For well over two decades, it has been identified that the current site of the National Maternity Hospital is not fit for purpose.  The building is shoehorned into a very tight space.  The space and facilities for a new hospital site are just down the road beside an acute hospital, St. Vincent\u2019s.  Now is the time to make the commitment and start planning to make this move.  The National Maternity Hospital services not just the greater Dublin area but the eastern region.  It is important to make those decisions now to ensure the delivery of maternity services the country deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500038#LL00400","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1352996400,"counter":269,"content":"<p>In 2008, KPMG reviewed maternity and gynaecology services in the greater Dublin area and recommended that Dublin maternity hospitals should be located alongside adult acute services.  This is the optimal solution for hospital-based maternity services, as it gives access to the full range of medical and surgical specialties and clinical support services, in sufficient volume and complexity.  This is particularly important for high-risk mothers and babies.  In this context, it is proposed the National Maternity Hospital be relocated to St. Vincent's hospital.<\/p><p>  There is a real opportunity for the maternity service providers to formalise their relationship with their partner adult hospital at the earliest opportunity to realise clinical and financial benefits as well as efficiencies well in advance of physical co-location.  The National Maternity Hospital has been working with St. Vincent's University Hospital to progress this from a service perspective and working with the HSE in the development of the business case for relocation.<\/p><p>  Management and delivery of health infrastructure programmes, including financing, is the responsibility of the HSE.  However, as this project cannot be dealt with in isolation, it must be considered in the context of the HSE multi-annual capital programme.

The proposed relocation of the hospital to the St. Vincent's University Hospital site is still being given high priority.  The Minister's concern with this issue, as with all health issues, is with patient benefit and patient outcomes.

We should put this in motion in order that we could move the hospital as soon as possible.

If the volume of work reported in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>is correct it would suggest the work is well down the path but we need to bring it to a speedy conclusion.

The original building was excellent.  It served the city well and it is in the heart of my community.

Real GDP growth for 2013 is now estimated at 1.5%.  This represents a one quarter of a percentage point downward revision on the previous forecast for 2013 as set out in the stability programme update in April.  However, it is not simply a matter of suggesting that if growth forecasts are lowered, additional consolidation will be required to meet a deficit target; it is more complex than that.  The achievement of fiscal targets is driven by a range of factors, including overall economic performance as well as specific developments that affect revenue and expenditure patterns in a given year.  Positive base effects from a more positive outturn than was targeted for this year should also assist the position next year.<\/p><p>  Broadly speaking, it is nominal rather than real GDP developments that drive revenue growth.  Nominal GDP growth has been slightly above expectations this year.  Although the nominal GDP growth estimate for 2013 has also been revised down by half a percentage point compared to the previous forecast from April, I believe the 7.5% of GDP deficit target for 2013 is still achievable based on the level of adjustment set out by the Government in late 2011 and reiterated in the MTFS yesterday.<\/p><p>  The Government is firmly committed to meeting fiscal targets.  We should remember that despite likely lower real GDP growth this year than was originally estimated in budget 2012 last December, we are on track to meet our fiscal targets this year.  This is consistent with the outturn for last year when we also met fiscal targets despite GDP growth being somewhat lower than was originally estimated in budget 2011 in December 2010.  It is worth bearing in mind that the European Commission's most recent forecasts, which were published last week, also predict our achieving the 7.5% of GDP deficit target next year.

This will be done through the implementation of further budgetary consolidation as well as policies which foster employment and economic growth.  The updated Medium-Term Fiscal Statement, published yesterday, forecasts that the debt-to-GDP ratio will peak next year at 121% and will begin to decline in the following years.  This is a result of a combination of factors, including the strengthening of nominal GDP as a result of the implementation of further growth-enhancing policy measures; the achievement of a general Government primary surplus, that is, an excess of revenue over expenditure excluding interest expenditure, by 2014; and a run-down of cash balances in future years, meaning part of the annual Exchequer borrowing requirement is funded without need for additional borrowing but is instead funded through resources to hand.<\/p><p>  It is also worth taking into account the State&#8217;s net debt position when looking at debt sustainability.  General Government debt is a gross measure that does not allow for the offsetting of cash balances and other related assets.  Netting off the estimated &#8364;18.5 billion in cash and deposits held by the Exchequer at the end of 2012 would result in a net Government debt of the order of 106% of GDP at the end of 2012.  This is still an elevated level but one which is significantly below the gross debt ratio.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/i><\/p><p>  One indicator of debt sustainability that is worth noting is the proportion of revenues that are directed to servicing the interest on the debt.  Based on the MTFS projections, it is estimated that 11.4% of general Government revenue will be required to service the debt this year.  This ratio is forecast to increase further next year before stabilising at around 16%.  While this is clearly a significant level, it is worth bearing in mind that this is well below the ratio experienced during the mid-1980s, where interest expenditure accounted for over 20% of revenues.<\/p><p>  My view is that our debt, though elevated, is sustainable.  The Government is strongly committed to stabilising and reducing the debt ratio over time. An important part of that strategy is of course the banking related debt and technical work is ongoing in that regard.  There is a widespread recognition of the impact banking debt has had on the sovereign, which has been acknowledged in the commitment that the&quot;situation of the Irish financial sector would be examined with the view of further improving the sustainability of the well performing adjustment Programme.  I can assure the Deputy, as I have said many times, that the Government will continue to be ambitious in the negotiations and seek to agree the best possible outcome for the Irish taxpayer.<\/p><p>  General Government debt was &#8364;144 billion in 2010 and &#8364;169 billion in 2011.

It is projected to be &#8364;6.4 billion this year before rising to &#8364;9.4 billion in 2013 and to &#8364;9.7 billion in 2014.

A good example to prove it is sustainable is that in the 1980s, in the last debt crisis we had, 20% of our tax revenue was being spent on servicing the debt and at the peak now projected, that will be down to 16%.

It is shared in equal measure by the Government.  However, the Deputy will readily appreciate from the time his party was in office that the Government&#8217;s scope for action to claw back or reduce such pre-existing contractual entitlements is limited due to constitutional and legal reasons.  These issues are well known to all members of the House.  Indeed, some of the pay and pension entitlements he refers to were authorised by the Government which he supported.  The Government shares the abhorrence of the public at these extravagant pensions but its scope for action to claw back or reduce such entitlements is limited due to constitutional and legal reasons.  Pensions are generally taken to be deferred income and any action to reduce a pension in payment needs to be comprehensively founded lest it run the risk of being considered an unjust attack by the State on the property rights of individuals affected by the proposed legislation.  The Government will seek to explore all avenues and options to address this issue subject to the necessary legal constraints.<\/p><p>  The Deputy infers in his question that the Government has not taken steps to address this issue.  This Government has introduced stringent controls on remuneration levels under the conditionality imposed arising from the round of State investment in the banks in summer 2011.  We went much further than the previous Administration by including all elements of the pay package, bar pension contributions, under the &#8364;500,000 cap.  This is being honoured, as proven in the case of new CEO appointments at AIB and PermanentTSB respectively.

In the latest memorandum of understanding between the Government and the troika, a commitment was given to introducing the tax in the forthcoming budget.  The introduction of a property tax has been a condition of the programme since it was first negotiated in November 2010 under the previous Government and has remained a condition following subsequent reviews agreed by all programme partners.  The memorandum provides for substitution of measures in certain circumstances.  It states that &quot;without prejudice to the minimum consolidation amount referred to in the previous paragraph and to the requirements to achieve the agreed fiscal targets, the Government may, in consultation with the staff of the European Commission, the IMF and the ECB, substitute one or more of the above measures with others of equally good quality based on the options identified in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.&quot;  Therefore any proposal to alter the proposed composition of tax or expenditure measures would need to be substituted with measures of equal value.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that the arguments in favour of a property tax go beyond the memorandum.  The introduction of a property tax is part of a broader approach to the taxation of property.  The aim is to replace some of the revenue from transaction based taxes, which have proven to be an unstable source of Government revenue, with an annual recurring property tax which international experience has shown to be a stable source of funding.  The taxation of property through a recurring annual tax is less economically distortional than the imposition of tax on either income or capital.  This is supported by economic literature and recent OECD analysis.  The OECD has highlighted that annual taxes on land and buildings have a relatively small adverse impact on economic performance.<\/p><p>  It is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the budget on any tax matters that might be the subject of budget decisions.  The property tax forms part of a long-term policy to broaden the tax base, provide a stable funding base for local government and assist the strengthening of democracy at local level.  Due consideration will be given to a wide range of issues, including fairness, equity and ability to pay, in any measures that may be announced.<\/p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/i><\/p><p>  Regarding mortgage arrears and negative equity, the Government is conscious of the difficulty some home owners are experiencing in meeting their mortgage obligations.

However, we are approaching a figure of 400,000 homes in negative equity, including those in mortgage arrears.  In addition, there are approximately 450,000 people unemployed, meaning about 150,000 households are affected by unemployment.  On top of this, a further 150,000 households are in the names of pensioners.

He said he did not think it was a good idea based on current economic circumstances and that he believed there was nothing a property tax could achieve that could not be achieved by adjusting income tax rates.  The argument being made is that a property tax would broaden the tax base, but it would not.  It is a residential property tax that would be paid from the incomes of home owners or occupiers; therefore, it would be paid for from their incomes and land on PAYE employees and the self-employed.<\/p><p> Also, the Minister should realise that Ireland is probably the only country in Europe where significant numbers have paid stamp duty on their primary residence, a practice unheard of throughout Europe.  For example, anyone who paid \u20ac200,000 for a house, paid stamp duty at a rate of 6% or \u20ac12,000 on his or her property.

I remind the Minister that in January 2011 Fine Gael stated it would raise revenue from property, but not by way of a household tax as proposed by Fianna F\u00e1il, on the grounds that such a tax would be difficult to collect from asset rich but income poor households, particularly the elderly and the unemployed, and also that it would be deeply unfair for a young generation who had paid exorbitant amounts in stamp duty and VAT on the purchase of overvalued houses, many of whom now find themselves in negative equity.

One of these building blocks is an integrated financial framework or banking union, which comprises three elements: an integrated system for the supervision of cross-border banks, a European deposit insurance scheme and a European resolution scheme.  The euro area summit on 29 June last called on the Commission to quickly present proposals for the establishment of a single supervisory mechanism which would be considered by the Council as a matter of urgency.  Significantly, it was made clear in the statement following the euro area summit that when such a mechanism is in place for banks in the euro area, the ESM could following a regular decision have the possibility to recapitalise banks directly.<b><\/b> The statement also committed the euro group to examining the situation of the Irish financial sector with a view to further improving the sustainability of our well-performing adjustment programme.<\/p><p>  The Commission presented legislative proposals in September for a single supervisory mechanism conferring powers on the European Central Bank for the supervision of all banks in the euro area, with a mechanism for non-euro countries to join on a voluntary basis.  An <i>ad hoc<\/i> working group of senior officials has met regularly since the proposal was published and good progress has been made.  The European Council discussed the single supervisory mechanism at its October meeting in the context of a report from President Van Rompuy on the work being carried out on the future of economic and monetary union.  The timetable that was set in the October Council conclusions envisages that agreement on the legislative framework for the single supervisory mechanism will be reached by end of the year.  At this week&#8217;s ECOFIN meeting, the Presidency gave ministers an update on progress on the single supervisory mechanism.  The intention of the Presidency is that agreement on the regulation will be reached at the December meeting of ECOFIN.<\/p><p>  Ireland supports in principle the development of a banking union for Europe.  We view the single supervisory mechanism as an important element of the integrated financial framework which will break the link between the sovereign and the banking sector.  We are seeking to ensure shared supervision is progressed as part of a package which will also address shared risk and mutualisation of debt.  The question of the retrospective application of the European Stability Mechanism remains firmly on the table as far as Ireland is concerned.  We expect to see more detail on how this can be addressed over the coming months.  Any move to a banking union must respect the integrity of the Single Market and be consistent with the principle of free movement of capital throughout the European Union.  The establishment of the single supervisory mechanism is a crucial and significant first step to completing the banking union.  The banking union will also require further work to develop a common system for deposit guarantees and an integrated crisis management framework.  Negotiations on the bank capital requirements under the fourth capital requirements directive should be also concluded, as called for by the Heads of State and Government at the October meeting of the European Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500044#RR00400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1353000000,"counter":339,"content":"<p>The establishment of a banking union is an important development in itself.

The Minister recently had a bilateral meeting in Dublin with the German Minister for Finance, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble.  Mr. Sch\u00e4uble indicated that the necessary conditions in which the direct recapitalisation of banks could take place would not be met before 2014.

Mr. Sch\u00e4uble's own Chancellor, Angela Merkel, has said it will happen in the last six months of 2013.  I am not criticising anybody for having different views.  Negotiations on the nature of common supervision are in progress.  There is a very strong drive to put it in place from 1 January next.  It will have to be implemented to see whether it is successful.  The legal competence for supervision will be located at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.  Some of the supervisory functions will be decentralised to local regulators and local central banks.  Common codes of practice are needed to ensure there is a high standard of regulation that is at least as good as what is in place already and preferably better.  A rule book must be developed, followed by manuals to allow local regulators to implement the rules.  Various protocols will be put in place.  All of that work is taking place at present.

That was then reinforced by the Taoiseach's meeting with Chancellor Merkel and subsequently with President Hollande in Paris, when both of them said more or less the same thing, namely, that Ireland is a special case in this respect because instruments were not in place at the time which are now available for the recapitalisation of banks and Ireland had to take it on its own shoulders.

However, it is the case that income tax has weakened somewhat since the mid-year point, particularly over the third quarter.  Of course, there can be significant variation in receipts in different months but the key point is that, on a cumulative basis, income tax is ahead of profile at end-October.  As income tax returns from the self-employed are concentrated in the month of the November, the outturn for this month will be vital in determining the overall position for income tax come year-end.  November is the most significant month of the year for income tax, with \u20ac2.5 billion or 16% of total income tax revenues profiled for collection in this month.<\/p><p>  Similar to the situation with income tax, corporation tax is also ahead of profile on a cumulative basis at end-October.  Receipts in the first ten months of the year were \u20ac26 million or 1% better than expected.  As with income tax, corporation tax receipts have disappointed a little in recent months, which was almost exclusively due to a significant shortfall of \u20ac225 million last month.

I also appointed Mercer last June to examine pay levels right across the banking institutions.  I did so precisely because of the outcry.  My officials are in regular contact with the banks.  The new chief executive of AIB, David Duffy, has taken on board the views expressed and has imposed, by agreement, pay cuts on staff at many levels.  He is also proceeding with a large redundancy package.  Those who work in banks are not beneficiaries of public service pensions; therefore, laws designed to cut or place levies on public service pensions are not applicable to banks.  For residual reasons, everyone is aware, as I am sure the Deputy is, that the Constitution has strong property rights enshrined in it.  The legal advice, which has been tested in court, is that a pension is a property right and taking someone\u2019s pension or a disproportionate amount of it away is akin to taking someone\u2019s land or part of it away.

Week after week, people right across the public service are yielding up parts of their emoluments to the State.  I know this because I have to sign the acceptance order when the money is given to the Exchequer.  On the initiative of Mr. Duffy, who wrote to all of his high-profile pensioners and asked them to make a contribution, at least one positive reply was received and a significant contribution has been made.  I would like the message to go out from this House that such remuneration is not acceptable as far as we are concerned, but it was a different country when the payments were negotiated.  Now there are families struggling to survive on very little and it is an obscenity that people who participated in the destruction of the economy are beneficiaries of huge pensions.  It is not good enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012111500046#TT00700","speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353001200,"counter":365,"content":"<p>Written Answers follow Adjournment.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1353001200,"counter":366,"content":"<p>The D\u00e1il adjourned at 5.46 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 20 November 2012.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
