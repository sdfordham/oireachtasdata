My colleague in the D\u00e1il, Deputy Niall Collins, and Councillor Jim O'Callaghan have prepared a Bill that would establish an independent sentencing committee to which cases such as this could be referred.  Guidelines have been set down in many areas and judges have guidelines for sentencing.  In cases such as this, however, in which it is patently obvious that the sentence or judgment handed down was not correct or in which people are questioning a sentence, an independent sentencing commission could be established.

The merits or otherwise of the scheme must be debated in the Seanad, particularly given that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, wants to expand it into other areas such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200004#C00800","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358865600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome colleagues back for the new year and I express my sincere sympathies to Senator Deirdre Clune on the loss of her mother, the wife of the late Peter Barry, who achieved great things for this country, particularly in his work in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>I refer to the inauguration this week of the US President, Barack Obama.  I was struck by the number of things we have in common with elements mentioned in the President's speech.  He pointed with great confidence to the green shoots of economic recovery in the United States.  I was also struck, on the same day, by the comments of IBEC, which noted that Ireland, too, was seeing signs of recovery in the domestic economy.  Today we had news that house prices have stabilised, which is good news for the economy, as well as word from both the Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste in regard to moves to extend the term of maturity of our loans, which will also help the economy.  <\/p><p>What was very inspiring about what President Obama said was his words to the effect of &quot;A lot done; more to do&quot;.  He highlighted the issue of equality in American society and I was struck by some of the issues he raised.  This brought home the fact that on the same day the Irish Cancer Society stated that poor people in this country are twice as likely to die from cancer as people brought up in middle-class areas, which is down to nothing but their poverty and social inequality.  What we do not need to have in the coming year, when we see signs of economic recovery, is business as usual.  The reality is that during the Celtic tiger years these levels of society had almost the same amount of unemployment as they do today.  We have a lot to do to change inequality in Irish society.<\/p><p>Another group in society specifically mentioned by President Obama was gay and lesbian people.  He also highlighted the position of women.  Again, we cannot stand up with any distinguished record when it comes to matters of equality for certain groups in our society.  I would like to think that in the coming session, which we commence today, this Seanad will make significant strides to improve the position of those in society who face inequality, whether that be social and economic or based on their gender or sexual preferences.  As a start to that agenda,  will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to attend the House, not in the context of his brief on justice but of that on equality, in order that we may have a serious debate on inequality in our society?  We face very trying times in regard to our own survival.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200005#D00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1358865600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Like Senator Darragh O'Brien, I wish to be very careful in how I make my point in regard to yesterday's sentencing, being very conscious of the separation of powers.  Will the Leader arrange a debate in the House on sentencing policy, to involve the Minister for Justice and Equality, and with a particular focus on how we can maintain and ensure the confidence of all of our citizens in sentencing matters?  I would be the last person to call for a hang-'em-and-flog-'em approach to criminal justice and I realise judges have many factors to take into account when they are considering whether and for how long to suspend sentences and issues in regard to leave to appeal and the granting of bail.<\/p> <p>I am very conscious that women in particular take note of sentences such as that which was handed down in the past day or so.  I mean no disrespect to the judge but women wonder when a sentence such as this is passed whether it is connected with the existence of a largely male Judiciary and whether there is a full understanding in our society of the gravity of offences, particularly the offence of rape.  Therefore, I think it is appropriate that in this House we draw very serious attention to what was decided.  We respect the role of the judge and we respect his integrity in the way he does his job, but the fact remains that something very serious and disturbing was decided.  I am referring in particular to the granting of bail in a case such as this, guilt having been established.  I request the Leader to make time available in early course for a debate on this matter.<\/p><p>We are all supporting the Government's initiative on The Gathering but I do not think the it foresaw the gathering that took place in Merrion Square last Saturday when 25,000 people - representing what Mr. Mickey Harte described as the middle ground of Irish society - expressed their serious concerns specifically with the Government's proposal to legislate for direct abortion on the grounds of suicide threat.  It was made very clear at that event that people on the pro-life side of the argument find it deeply offensive when it is suggested that they are not concerned with saving every woman's life.  Everybody agrees that women are entitled to all necessary medical interventions.  We heard at the recent hearings that took place in this very Chamber that this happens in this country every day, even when it is foreseeable that the child's life will be lost, but to legislate for abortion on the basis of a threat of suicide is to legislate for something for which there is no medical evidence.  It is to legislate for the direct targeting of an innocent human life.  I think we should have a debate in this House because, as good as the hearings were, priority was given to members of the health committee.  They did a very good job in so far as it goes in ventilating some of the issues, but it was very clear from those hearings that there is no medical basis for abortion on the grounds of threatened suicide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200005#D00300","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358865900,"counter":20,"content":"<p>That is the Senator's opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200006#E00108","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1358865900,"counter":21,"content":"<p>That is the Senator's opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200006#E00123","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1358865900,"counter":22,"content":"<p>That is why we need a debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200006#E00142","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1358865900,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I advise Senators who disagree to read the transcript of the health committee meetings.

In general, however, for less serious crimes than the one we are talking about, the principle of restorative justice needs to be considered.  In this country restorative justice has been piloted in two areas - south County Dublin and Nenagh - and it is now being established in North Tipperary.  The results have been quite interesting: 63% to 64% of people who participate in a restorative justice programme do not go on to re-offend.  Our prisons are completely overcrowded.  We have seen articles in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> in the past few days stating that prison is not a solution for all crimes.  There are ways in which the victims of crime can engage with the perpetrators, particularly for petty crimes.  In some cases, it may be the first time a perpetrator has offended, and engaging in a restorative justice process with the victim of his or her crime may allow the perpetrator to achieve an understanding of the offence and of the stress and trauma his or her actions have caused.  I would like to see the roll-out of the pilot programme nationally.  I call on the Leader to have a debate this term on restorative justice, because it is a principle developing internationally.  There is best practice in places such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada.  We face economic challenges and I believe this is a way of providing a cost-effective penal system that respects the dignity of all people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200006#E00200","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1358865900,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I agree very much with the sentiments expressed by previous speakers.

The Food Safety Authority of Ireland was quick to point out initially that there was no safety risk but, as a food technologist, I found that to be contrary to the best intentions of the agency because we do not know where the horse meat has come from, despite the fact that the Minister and Department were very quick to blame other European countries.  It now transpires that the horse meat did not come from those countries.  We do not know where it came from or how it entered the food chain.  This escalating crisis is damaging to Ireland's \u20ac24 billion agrifood industry.  There is a lack of urgency being shown by the Minister and a lack of transparency.  Consumer protection rights are being infringed.  We need an urgent debate in the House on the matter.<\/p><p>I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to the House to have a specific debate on septic tank registration.

The Minister should extend the deadline.

I asked his coach the question, \"What is going wrong with young Johnny?,\" to which he replied the shift work was killing him.  I asked him what he meant by \"shift work\" and he said that Johnny was a doctor.  I thought it would be appropriate for me to highlight the plight of junior doctors working in the most difficult conditions owing to cutbacks.  At a time when the Irish Medical Organisation is about to pay out on a pension deal worth in excess of \u20ac9 million to its CEO, junior doctors are routinely asked to work 60 hours a week and some shifts lasting up to 36 hours.  They are finding it very difficult to retrieve their overtime pay.  An EU directive in 2004 dictated that EU workers should not work more than 48 hours a week.  Obviously, this instruction is not heeded in Ireland.  Some surgical doctors are required to work from a Saturday morning through to the Monday evening - a 60 hour shift.  Surely this cannot be safe.  It is only a matter of time before an exhausted junior doctor makes a major mistake, perhaps resulting in the loss of a life.  Junior doctors are normally allocated a break, but some of them do not even have enough time to eat or drink.  At times they have to choose between eating or going to the bathroom.<\/p> <p> One of the reasons for the shortage of staff is that most of our graduates emigrate to countries where they find better work conditions.

It is quite clear that HMV has taken unfair advantage of thousands of its customers in Ireland by allowing their stores to continue to sell gift vouchers and cards when it well knew that there was very little or no prospect of those vouchers or gift cards ever being redeemed by their customers.  In effect that made millions of euros worth of vouchers in Ireland worthless overnight.  Now it seems to be applying different rules to its UK customers.  While the writing was on the wall for the company, directors and management must have known that it was at real risk of failure yet it continued to sell these gift cards and vouchers throughout the Christmas period until the day it went into receivership.  That raises serious questions about the management and the directors of the company who must have been aware of the real risk of receivership given that it is my understanding that they had been in talks with their banks since early December.<\/p><p>We must be mindful that obtaining money by deception is a criminal offence and by allowing the stores to continue to sell vouchers and gift cards when the company knew there was no prospect of their ever being redeemed this could arguably be a grounds for a criminal action.  In the circumstances I call on the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, who has responsibility for consumer affairs, Deputy Richard Bruton, to come into the House to discuss and debate the legality of what this unscrupulous business has done and foisted upon many thousands of unsuspecting customers, and to discuss the necessary steps which must be taken to strengthen our legislative armour in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200013#M00200","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1358868600,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Aonta\u00edm leis an Seanad\u00f3ir \u00d3 Clochartaigh maidir le 2013 - Bliain na Gaeilge.

Not all of the country was to blame but the Government and everyone else had a role.  I was part of another party at the time, Fianna F\u00e1il.  The \u20ac85 billion bailout is being corrected by this Government.  Only because it is being corrected could this positive decision be taken at EU level.  It is only because of the commitments signed up to by the previous Government on the EU-IMF programme and being carried forward by this Government that we will now make savings.  One economist put the figure at \u20ac400 million per year and \u20ac4 billion over the ten years.

I would like a debate on the issue of medical card reviews that are taking place around the country and particularly in an area of Donegal.  I have been contacted by several doctors who maintain that the medical card reviews are mitigating against people over 70 who may not have the resources or ability or someone to help them to fill in the complicated forms.  The reason this is happening, in their opinion - and I agree with them - is that community welfare officers have been taken out of the loop.  Their view is that people entitled to medical cards will lose them, not because they are over the income limit but because they have not sent back the forms.  Another reason is that many of them have cards that state they are eligible until the end of 2015, or in some cases up to 2035, but they are now being told that if the forms are not returned by the end of January they will be cut off in February.  I have spoken to two general practitioners in different practices and some other people who have come directly to my office.  It is an urgent issue in certain areas of Donegal and in other rural parts of the country.  Donegal has already been designated a high-poverty area.<\/p><p>In certain areas there has been much emigration, which has left behind many people over 70 and under 15 years of age.  It is the over-70s in need of medical attention who will forego the medical card.

The first concerns the agreement in principle, reached last night, that the repayment schedule of our debt to the EFSF and the ECB will be extended.  This is very good news and has the potential to save \u20ac400 million a year, as Senator C\u00e1it Keane said.  Also last week it was announced that the Government was successful in offloading \u20ac1 billion worth of so-called \"cocos\" or contingent convertibles.  There was some criticism of the Government's position at the time, namely, that it was attracting a rate of 10% and might be turning away \u20ac60 million per annum.  In response to the critics I say the Government did not wish to take the position of speculator because the 10% coupon reflects the high level of risk involved.

After his election to the other House he served the people of his constituency very well, and he did likewise in the areas for which he was responsible as Minister of State.  I would like to join Members in expressing our sincere sympathies to his family.  Senator Barrett referred specifically to Shane McEntee's performances in this House.  Not so long ago, he came to the Seanad to speak about ash dieback disease, in which he certainly had a great fountain of knowledge.  He carried out his duties in that respect in an excellent manner.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett also commended the T\u00e1naiste and the Secretary of State on their work in Northern Ireland.

It is possible that legislation is required to deal with this issue.  Senator Burke made a point about separate accounts in that context.

As I got a few vouchers for Christmas, I am in the same position as a number of people in this regard.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane called for a debate on equality for women, a matter that was raised by Senator Hayden previously.<\/p> <p>Again, we will try to bring the Minister to the House.<\/p><p>Likewise, Senator Moloney raised the issue of cyberbullying and urged parents to be cautious in that regard.  We have discussed this in the House previously and I am sure it is a subject we will come back to again in early course.<\/p><p>Senator \u00d3 Domhnaill spoke about the discovery of equine DNA in burgers.  It is only fair to state that our food safety and traceability system is recognised as one of the best in the world.  This is reflected in the fact that the issue was discovered using advanced testing methods which are not used in other jurisdictions at this point in time.  It is a very serious issue none the less.<\/p><p>Senator \u00d3 Domhnaill also referred to septic tanks.

It is alarmingly low and it is certainly a matter that should be researched and investigated.

While I cannot comment on the individual case, I agree with his sentiments that we should not be driven by tabloid headlines on any particular issue.<\/p><p>Senator Eamonn Coghlan outlined the plight of junior doctors and urged that we improve their conditions.  Certainly, the working time directives that are in place will improve their conditions and I know the Minister is working on this issue currently.<\/p><p>Senator Walsh called for respectful and truthful debate at all times, and I am sure we would all agree with the sentiment that this is what we should have in the House.  Debate should be respectful to everybody, be it the Chair or anybody else, and we should always be respectful and truthful.<\/p><p>Senator Kelly raised the issue of abuse of the free legal aid system, particularly with regard to the use of the system by habitual offenders, and Senator Brennan also referred to this point.  It is a matter we can raise with the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh reminded us that this year is Bliain na Gaeilge.  I am sure everybody will use the bit of Irish he or she has.  We are blessed to have so many excellent speakers of the language in the House.  We had a debate on one Bill in the House which was totally in the Irish language, which possibly had not happened in either House of the Oireachtas for a long time.  Members of the House are to be commended on that.<\/p><p>Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh also raised the question of the invitations to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister.  As I have outlined on several occasions, there are protocols that must be gone through.  We have initiated those protocols but we have not had a positive response from the people involved.  Invitations have gone out but I understand that both of them must come here together and I would like to have both of them here together.  It is not my fault the people in question are not here.  It would be good to have them.  With regard to a plebiscite, we will have to wait.  I note Senator D'Arcy's point on the research undertaken by Queen's University on the matter but I am sure Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh would have a different view on that.<\/p><p>Senators D'Arcy and \u00d3 Murch\u00fa referred to Showcase 2013, the excellent exhibition organised by the Crafts Council of Ireland that is currently under way, which highlights that we have so much positivity to offer in this country.<\/p> <p>Senator D'Arcy asked about the extension of the JobBridge programme.  We will certainly ask the Minister to comment on that.  Senator \u00d3 Murch\u00fa also outlined the positive aspects not only of Showcase 2013 in the RDS but also The Gathering and many other areas.  The Senator should bring his side of the House together and outline to it that it should be expressing the good news that is available more often.<\/p><p>Senator Keane spoke about the extension of the maturities on Irish bonds and EFSF loans.  Senator Gilroy also raised this issue.  The finance Ministers agreed to examine extension of the maturities for Portugal and Ireland.  Finance Ministers representing the 27 EU member states agreed at ECOFIN this morning that the duration of the loans drawn down under the European financial stabilisation mechanism will also be examined.  This decision is only possible because we are delivering on our commitments and building support behind the scenes with our EU partners, which is very important.  An extension of the maturities has the potential to further enhance Ireland's debt sustainability and improve our prospects of making a full return to the markets at competitive interest rates.  All of these issues will, hopefully, be put to bed by the end of March and we can have a debate on that subject then.  <\/p><p>Senator Harte spoke about medical cards.  He argued that the role of community welfare officers in this matter should be highlighted and that they have disappeared from the scene although at one time many of them helped people to fill in medical card application forms.  Citizens' information offices around the country can help and I am sure many Members of the Oireachtas and local representatives help applicants with this on a daily basis.

It is appropriate, almost 12 months from the date of our last exchange on the issue, that Members wish to revisit the subject and I am pleased to have the opportunity to update the House on developments and progress.  Senators will recall that on the previous occasion we covered a good deal of ground.  At that point the objective of my contribution was to frame the context of the reform debate by setting out some of the fundamentals of the local government system, the rationale for its existence, the principles we were following in implementing change, the main strands of reform and what our vision for local government might look like.  I also sought and received robust and insightful views from Members on a range of issues and look forward to an equally constructive discussion today.<\/p><p>Since that debate it is fair to say a significant milestone was reached with the publication, on 16 October, following Government approval, of the action programme for effective local government.  I take the opportunity to brief the House on some of the principal elements of the document and the implementation work being undertaken.  The action programme sets out Government policy on reform across all the main areas of local government.  In particular, it addresses some fundamental issues in local government structures that have been problematic for a number of years and the fact that the functions of local government in Ireland are much narrower than in most democratic states.  It draws on the constitutional status local government enjoys as the second tier of government in the State and also recognises the uniqueness of local government, compared with other elements of the public service, in terms of its engagement with the public, both as citizens and consumers.<\/p><p>The programme is not solely concerned with correcting faults in the local government system.  It is even more important to ensure local government can play as effective a role as possible in the national recovery effort and enhancing the quality of life of local communities.  The programme is based on a strong rationale and purpose for local government which is expressed in a vision for the sector which states, &quot;Local government will be the main vehicle of governance in public service at local level, leading economic, social and community development, delivering efficient and good quality services and representing citizens and communities as effectively and accountably as possible&quot;. <\/p><p>In keeping with that vision, the document contains a firm commitment that local government will not in the future be bypassed by the establishment of other structures of local administration outside the local government system, unless there is a compelling reason to do so.  While the qualities and achievements are acknowledged in the programme, the shortcomings of the system and issues that need to be addressed are clearly and frankly identified.  The system is often seen - correctly - as outdated, with anomalies, inconsistencies and other deficiencies.<\/p> <p>For example, there is a disparate array of authorities, many lacking the scale or resources to support significant functions.  Some small towns have their own council while larger towns have no municipal status.  Elected bodies have limited revenue-raising powers and as a result restricted accountability, responsibility and self-reliance.  Operating arrangements are often fragmented, with duplication and diseconomies; and systems of governance, performance measurement and public engagement have lagged behind modern best practice.<\/p><p>The programme identifies the need to address these and other weaknesses, enhance capacity and improve performance across the entire system.  This involves reform of all of its key elements - structures, functions, resources, operational arrangements and governance.  Local government structures are a key focus of the reform programme, with the emphasis on strengthening, modernising and streamlining them.  We confirm that the city or county will continue to be the core element of local government.  However, the system will be strengthened by unification of authorities in some areas, while fully maintaining county identities.  As Senators are aware, this process is well under way in counties Limerick and Tipperary.  Reports by the implementation groups in those areas have been published.  As I commented when the report of the Limerick group was published at the end of 2012, it sets a standard for local government reform, for example, in terms of organisational and management streamlining and that action being taken in the context of unification to achieve economic transformation, which my Department has strongly supported financially and otherwise.<\/p><p>The Government has also decided that Waterford city and county councils should be combined to form a single strong local authority and an implementation group has been appointed to oversee and guide the reorganisation process in that county with a mid year completion target.  I look forward to the positive results from local government unification in Waterford - to which Senator Cullinane does not look forward - not least in terms of economic and social revitalisation of the area as is happening in Limerick.  At regional level the Government has decided to retain a regional dimension in the local government system with significant structural consolidation, including a reduction in the number of authorities and assemblies from ten to three and in membership from 290 to 62.  Functions will be revised and updated, regional bodies in future will perform an enhanced function in the formulation of regional, spatial and economic strategies.<\/p><p>All relevant agencies will be required by legislation to participate in this process and to adhere to the adopted strategies in performance of their own functions.  Many of the existing regional functions, including the role of regional assemblies on EU programmes, will be retained but updated as appropriate in light of experience to date.  The new regional structures will also be used for the adoption of strategies in sectors other than the spatial-economic area and there are already indications that the new regions will be used as the basis for the development of strategies in relation to sectors such as waste and river basin management.  Overall therefore, the new system of regional governance will bring a greater coherence and continuity to development in and between regions.  <\/p><p>The aspect of the programme that has generated most attention in the media and in council chambers is the new system of municipal governance at sub-county level.  There has been some predictably strong reaction to the loss of double representation in towns although I have been equally criticised by some commentators for not going far enough.  Perhaps these contrasting reactions indicate that we might have got the balance right.  This element of the reform programme is not about abolition, as some commentators seek to portray it.  Yes, the isolated tier of town council local government, as we know it, will no longer exist.  It will be replaced, however by a new model of municipal governance which will address current weaknesses and anomalies.  Municipal districts will cover the entire territory of each county, providing equality of representation to all citizens, which reflects European norms, uniting towns with their hinterlands, removing outdated boundaries and ending the anomaly I referred to earlier of small towns with municipal status while much larger centres have none.<\/p><p>Elected members will perform more important community focused reserved functions at district level on a fully devolved basis and very importantly without duplication at county level.  Municipal districts will have significantly greater powers than the current area committees.  The latter are consultative or advisory arrangements.  They do not have statutory or decision making powers, whereas municipal districts will have such powers.  The member will decide a range of important matters at district level and will have full powers in this regard.  They will generally decide matters without reference to the county council, subject to consistency with overall policy, for example, the development plan.<\/p> <p>Examples of matters to be dealt with at a district level also include policy and regulatory functions in areas such as planning, including local area plans; housing, for example, housing service plans; the annual programme for local roads; and traffic by-laws, for example, parking charges.  In the environment, recreation and amenity areas matters such as litter management plans, by-laws and action to promote the interests of the community will be decided on at municipal level.  With regard to relevant finance and governance matters, decisions on policy at district level will be the order of the day, requiring the manager and chief executive to act and levy certain charges.  There will be representational oversight functions at district level, civic and ceremonial roles and citizen and community engagement and leadership.  The action programme makes it clear that the initial reference point in determining functions for district level will be existing town council functions.  Unless a function requires to be decided on the basis of county-wide implications, it should, in principle, be considered as suitable for decision within the municipal district jurisdiction.  At the same time, administrative and operational aspects of the executive will be integrated at county level.  The primary objective is to create a modern, effective, accountable and cohesive system of local government in which a range of important decisions will be made by elected members at sub-county level in structures that will apply across the entire territory of a county.  The effect of this innovative approach which has received scant attention amidst all the noise about abolition will be to enhance significantly both democratic leadership and accountability, on the one hand, and operational efficiency, on the other, within a far more cohesive and integrated system that will reflect the realities of the 21st century rather than the 19th.<\/p><p>In support of sub-county restructuring, I established an independent statutory committee on 15 November 2012 to carry out a local electoral review, on which the new municipal districts will be based.  Criteria and parameters for the new sub-county system are set out in the action programme and reflected also in the committee's terms of reference.  The electoral review will also have a specific goal of achieving a better balance and consistency in representational ratios, while taking particular account of factors such as the location of towns and local identities in the new municipal governance arrangement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200020#T00200","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358872200,"counter":126,"content":"<p>On a point of order, unfortunately, the speech the Minister is reading is not the one that was circulated to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200022#V00200","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1358872200,"counter":127,"content":"<p>That is not a point of order, but we will try to get to the bottom of the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200022#V00300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1358872200,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I apologise if I am mistaken.

These will take account of the significant population changes that have taken place since the current numbers were decided, while at the same time ensuring adequate numbers for effective representation and governance in lower population counties.  It is worth noting, in particular, that the terms of reference include a system of weighting to provide additional members in counties with borough and town councils; that local electoral areas will be designed, as far as possible, around existing municipal towns and that local electoral areas will also generally be named accordingly.  Therefore, the town will retain a prominent position within the new system of local governance.<\/p><p>Strengthening the role of local government is a fundamental aim of reform.  The action programme provides for the assignment of some significant additional functions, some of which I have mentioned.  It also includes the operation of the micro-enterprise support service; alignment of local and community development with local government; and an enhanced role for local government in economic development.  A number of specific functions are identified for devolution from central government agencies to local government in areas such as tourism, rural transport, ports and the management of State property.  In addition, local authorities will be given greater responsibility in a range of matters in which they are already involved but where there is scope to reduce the degree of central control.<\/p><p>Local government funding, accountability and governance will be strengthened in a number of ways.  The action programme recognises the role of an equitable property tax.  Government decisions were announced in the context of budget 2013 in relation to the introduction of a local property tax.  While it will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners, it is a local property tax.  Receipts will be going to local authorities and there will be discretion for them to increase or decrease the rate of tax, with effect from 1 January 2015 onwards.  This element of local financial discretion is fundamental to the future development of a more independent, self-reliant and responsible local government system, an objective highlighted in the action programme.<\/p><p>A new system of local government oversight will be introduced, involving the establishment of a national oversight and audit commission, and aspects of the local government audit system will be strengthened.<\/p> <p> An important aspect of the oversight process is that it will operate on an independent basis.  There is, therefore, no question of it adding to control by Departments over local government, something we are keen to minimise as far as possible.  The role and functions of the elected council will be increased and policy making structures reviewed.  The local government ethics code will be strengthened and merged into a single national system and important changes will be made to the directive powers of councillors arising from certain recommendations of the Mahon tribunal.  This involves excluding the use of powers under section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001 and decisions involving financial or other benefits for an individual or a specific organisation.  It is absolutely appropriate, in a proper system of governance, that elected members should remain aloof from such individual decisions, while at the same time their leadership and policy making roles are being strengthened.<\/p><p>The programme incorporates a major efficiency agenda, based particularly on implementation of measures arising from the Local Government efficiency review.  Significant savings will be achieved through efficiency measures and workforce planning in local authorities.  There will be a more robust system of performance monitoring, with a focus on key indicators, outcomes rather than outputs, value for money and the comparative performance of authorities.  Customer service arrangements in local authorities will be further enhanced, while ways of promoting greater community and citizen engagement with local government will be explored and local authorities required to provide better quality public information.  All told, it is broadly estimated that the measures outlined in the programme will involve savings of more than \u20ac400 million per annum when all the reforms are in place.  These will be enduring savings in the budgets of local authorities.<\/p><p>Concern has been expressed from some quarters that the proposed new arrangements will have implications for commercial rates income as a result of the differences between the annual rate of valuation in towns and counties.  Town rates are lower than the relevant county level in around two thirds of cases.  We have to ensure the harmonisation of rates does not lead to a significant net loss of revenue for authorities, while at the same time safeguarding against an increase in rates that would impact negatively on businesses and employment.  Harmonisation of rate levels will be equalised gradually over a number of years.  It is envisaged that the overall savings to be accrued from the reform agenda, coupled with the strengthening of the funding base for local authorities, through the introduction of the local property tax, will further reduce the burden of commercial rates on local business.<\/p><p>In relation to change in Dublin, the Government has decided that the introduction of an office of directly elected mayor, as has been suggested, should not take place without a more fundamental review of local governance generally in the area.  The programme indicates, therefore, that a forum on local governance in Dublin should be convened and, based on these deliberations, proposals will be put in a plebiscite to be held in conjunction with the 2014 elections.<\/p><p>Implementation of the local government reform agenda will be challenging at local and national level.  I have mentioned a number of specific structures that are in place to advance elements of the reform process, including electoral review, the merger in Waterford, local-community development alignment with local government, shared services and the local property tax.  In line with proposals in the action programme, specific implementation advisory arrangements have also been established also relation to the reform of structures, functions and related matters, with a particular focus on reorganisation of sub-county local government, including detailed examination of specific technical aspects of reform.<\/p><p>Some local elected members view the reform programme with suspicion and cynicism.  This perhaps is to be expected with any major programme of change.  However, it is important to note that the views of elected members, as expressed in consultations with and submissions by the representative associations of local authority members, were taken into account in the preparation of the action programme for effective local government.  I want to make it clear that I am willing to continue that consultation and constructive engagement with the representative associations in the implementation of these reforms.  <\/p><p>An essential component of the action programme will be the development and enactment of legislation.  Wide-ranging and detailed provisions will be necessary to provide for a range of measures, including mergers, new arrangements at sub-county and regional level, consequential amendments across a number of other legislative codes, and to allow for implementation of a number of new policy undertakings under the programme.  The programme sets out more clearly than any previous Government policy document the rationale for strong local government and the logic for using it as the main vehicle of government and public service at local level.  <\/p><p>As well as implementing significant changes from 2014 - sooner in some respects such as the enterprise function - the programme has a longer term objective of positioning the local government sector to continue to develop.  By putting in place stronger structures, functions, resources, governance and operational arrangements, the reforms should enable the local government sector to play a much wider and more effective role, with the possibility of taking on a broader range of functions of the sort local authorities perform in other European countries.<\/p> <p>All of this will not happen overnight, but the measures in the reform programme, including the implementation of a secure and sustainable system of local funding, will greatly increase public interest, engagement, confidence and credibility in local government, setting out a realistic and progressive pathway to the more far-reaching development of local government, and building on the enhancement of the local government role in the shorter term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200022#V01300","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358873400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber to discuss a topic that is generally under-discussed in the Houses of the Oireachtas, namely, the roles of local government, councillors and councils.  Local authorities certainly comprise the point of democracy closest to the citizen.  While local government was funded from a central resource for many years, it was such that the functions of local authority members might have been under-utilised.  The powers given to local authority members under legislation were not what they should have been.  Therefore, everyone was waiting for the reform of local government, which was promised prior to the last general election.  It was much anticipated by all local authority members, including town council members.  Town councillors constitute the point of democracy closest to the citizen.  Unfortunately, my reading of the local government reforms is not entirely in keeping with that outlined by the Minister.  Powers are being removed from local authorities and their members.  There is a cost-cutting exercise, and the point of democracy closest to the citizen is being moved away from him or her.  This cannot be welcomed.<\/p><p>Let us consider the disempowerment of citizens in towns over the past 18 months during the Minister's watch.  The Minister outlined that he is giving local authorities the autonomy to collect money locally and make their own decisions on spending it, but he did not say that he has actually removed the local government fund since he became Minister.  The local government fund is a central taxpayer fund for local government.  The Minister has asked local authorities to collect septic tank registration charges, household charges and property taxes, which are about to be introduced.  He is in the process of further removing power from local authorities by setting up a new quango called Irish Water and removing the water services function from the closest points of contact to the water user, namely, local authorities.<\/p><p>The removal of town councils must not be and is not being welcomed throughout the country.  In Letterkenny in County Donegal yesterday, I noticed a number of people on the streets.  Citizens are really only becoming aware of what is happening in regard to the removal of town councils.  Town councils are the most efficient, and arguably the most effective, government structure in the country.  They constitute the decision-making point closest to the people.  Town councillors are not working for vast sums of money but for very minimal sums, and they are working very long hours.  We all know town councillors, of all political parties and none, who are effectively giving of their time voluntarily.  Eighty town councils and over 700 town councillors are being removed from the equation.  Existing town councillors may not run for election again or may not be re-elected.  The people will lose the opportunity to elect a town council after the next election.<\/p><p>Local authorities have been disenfranchised further through major cuts, including the removal of the local improvement scheme grant.  The latter was available down through the years, during good times and bad, to help elderly people and farming communities to fix the roads leading to their houses.<\/p> <p>That scheme is gone.  Local authorities have cut funding for housing grants for elderly and disabled people.  Local authorities, including my own in Donegal, are not in a position to let local authority housing.  They cannot comply with BER certification requirements and upgrade the houses because they are not getting the funding.  There are at least 100,000 people waiting on local authority housing.  Many local authority houses are lying empty and cannot be let.  I know of one estate in my constituency where the windows of nine local authority houses are boarded up.  It is turning into a ghetto because the local authority cannot undertake the work required for BER certification.  It has applied to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government but no funding is forthcoming.  That is not renewing or incentivising local government.  <\/p><p>We must be frank here.  The energy and the money are being removed from local government.  We are coming up with a new plan, which is really a cost cutting exercise, but we are supposed to be putting the people first.  How the hell are we putting the people first if we are removing democracy from the closest point of contact?  The Minister is providing additional county councillors but he is removing the people who deliver democracy at the closest point to the citizen.  He is depriving towns with rateable functions from keeping rates to develop them.  If we look at the western seaboard, Sligo and Letterkenny are two of the main towns in the north west, but they will suffer.  Letterkenny will suffer greatly from the removal of the town council which has served it well down through the years.  It was in a position to borrow money to develop the Aura leisure centre and so on.  That will all be lost under the proposals being brought forward by the Minister.<\/p><p>This is disguised as giving additional powers to local authorities.  The Minister said the county enterprise board function will be subsumed into the local authority structure.  That is true and it is in the document but it is not the right thing to do because local authority members, including county managers in most counties, already sit on the boards of the county enterprise boards.  Funding for county enterprise boards is stand-alone - in other words, projects can make applications and obtain funding.  We will now amalgamate them with local authorities.  <\/p><p>Leader funding, which is available through the Minister's Department to community groups and businesses, has been under-utilised because the conditions are too stringent and the grants cannot be drawn down.  The Minister proposes to bring all the local partnership companies under the auspices of the local authorities.  Again, local authority members sit on those boards.  There has been a total of lack of discussion with the partnership companies, which are doing excellent work, and that needs to be clarified.  Why is the Department refusing to talk to workers or to SIPTU in regard to the alignment with the local authorities?  Do these workers, who have provided a service over the past 20 years under the Leader programme, not deserve to be consulted with?  They have no pay scale and their money has been cut year on year.  Why are they being brought under auspices of the local authorities?  Instead of funding local authorities properly, the Minister is using the Leader programme to bolster local authorities.  If we are serious about providing local democracy and decentralising power, we have to fund local authorities properly.  <\/p><p>I refer to another local authority function, namely, the septic tank registration system.  The telephone lines in Donegal County Council have been hopping over the past couple of weeks.  Officials are unable to answer a basic question.  If people register, what are the standards?  The Minister has not published the standards and \u20ac50 is being requested.  Will he consider extending the deadline for two or three months and publishing the standards in the meantime?

That is part of the reform programme the Government is to undertake, which the Minister outlined.  That will address weaknesses associated with inconsistencies of structure, inequality of representation and fragmentation and duplication throughout the county between town and county councils.  One only has to see the duplication that has happened in any town and county.  Where there is more than one principal town in a district how will the name of the district be chosen?  That might be too detailed a question but it will probably be up to the local district.  If the Minister has any further information on that it would be welcome but the functions that will be devolved from the council, and the Senator should check them out, will bring local democracy closer to the people.<\/p> <p>In the system in Ireland some voters in a county have votes in towns.  I sat on a council in Dublin which has a huge population but no urban council.  This is now being corrected and the Minister is looking at the issue.  He has mentioned the reduction in the number of councillors which must be seen in the context of dual participation.  The ratios in representation have varied from one councillor for 1,400 constituents to one councillor for 8,398 on the council on which I sat in Dublin.  This is dividing it out, looking at the whole country at district level.  In Dublin, however, there is not going to be a district level.  This is a special case because of the review that took place.  It will be an issue decided locally in the Dublin area.  Ireland is unique in Europe where town councils are very much the exception and municipal level districts are the norm.  I understand from the report that cities will remain.  I read in the report - the Minister might respond on this point - that mayoral status at municipal district level and in towns with a population over 20,000 will remain.  This may mean too many mayors and not enough chairpersons in a county.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on the issue of mayors versus chairpersons.<\/p><p> The Minister has mentioned - this is welcome - that there is scope for further extension of reserved functions of elected members.  He has asked each Department to come up with proposals in this regard, to which I look forward.  He is serious about the devolution of functions, as he has stated regarding local delivery, local responsibility and local democracy.  He has answered a question I was going to ask on directly elected mayors.  <\/p><p> I note the ACC and AMAI amalgamation.  It is important that they are represented on any body which represents local authorities and that their input is maintained at every level.<\/p><p> The burden on councillors is much greater than it was 20 years ago when I was first elected.  I ask the Minister if anyone has conducted a review of the hours spent on local authority work.  I am all for local democracy and participatory budgeting, but they take time for councillors.  While we all welcome the concept of voluntarism, we must consider that someone may have to pay for child care to sit on a council.  Men have to pay for child care as well as women.  It is not only a woman's issue.  One does not want to have a situation where everyone does it voluntarily.  It is no longer a voluntary job.  People put a great deal of time into it.  The report states the incentive to have high quality representation is important.  I agree.<\/p><p> I refer to the community alignment plan for SECs in each county and joint participation by the community and voluntary sector.  Senator Darragh O'Brien missed totally the extra powers being provided for the local and community voluntary sector in the SEC context.  They will be there with local councillors to discuss local issues and their input is valuable.  I recommend that SECs and the five-year city and county local development plans have local and community input.  I hope this is included in the report.  A national policy on the issue of devolution with local and community involvement is to be launched before the 2014 elections.  I ask the Minister if it is on track.<\/p><p> The primacy and policy responsibility of local councillors are being strengthened <i>vis-\u00e0-vis<\/i>chief executives and county managers.  The Minister said there would be some support to ensure councillors could devise policy with chief executives and county managers.  I will put specific questions to him later on that issue.  <\/p><p> The report indicates that the national oversight and audit committee is to be integrated at some stage with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Given that the committee is overseen by local authority members, it is important that it include some representatives of their national representative bodies.<\/p> <p>I cannot sit down without complimenting the Minister on the major reform that he has made in the anti-corruption measures, the political funding process, and the gender quotas, all of which are changing politics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200026#Z02400","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358874900,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  While the document concentrates on economies on the side of elected representatives, I am mindful of the McLoughlin report and the efficiencies that are needed in the permanent government of the local authorities which it was judged would make possible savings of \u20ac511 million.  On the last page of the Minister's report he cites \u20ac400 million.  Is that \u20ac400 million in addition to the \u20ac511 million and can we look forward to a saving of \u20ac900 million or, at the most pessimistic interpretation, did approximately 20% of McLoughlin's recommendation disappear and did \u20ac511 million become \u20ac400 million?  It is important that we do both if we can.  The permanent government, that is, the senior civil service, has not borne its share of responsibility for what happened to this country between 2008 and 2010.  The elected Government did and in the Lower House was reduced from 85 seats to 19 but they were not the only people responsible for what happened to the country.  I worry sometimes that the same senior civil servants are advising this Government as advised the last.  We must face up to the problems of the permanent government.  It was not fit for purpose or adequate to its task.<\/p><p>Progress reports on the McLoughlin report should be submitted to this House.  Reducing the D\u00e1il by eight seats and doing away with some small local authorities does not tackle the problem that the whole edifice of government collapsed between 2008 and 2010 and a major task of this Government is to restore its credibility.  The Watson criticism of the Department of Finance in particular, asks whether there were people there with enough qualifications.  Do we have a modern government structure at the permanent level?  One hears criticisms up and down the country that there are too many directors of services.  McLoughlin said that there are ten surplus county managers, 50 surplus directors of services, that 170 should go from corporate joint administrative units, 50 from the other corporate sector, 225 middle management and senior replacement, 62 from the HR payroll and 15% of senior managers in Dublin and Cork.  It is important that the House knows what the impact of those reductions would be and what progress we are making.<\/p><p>At the Kenmare conference a couple of years ago the county manager for D\u00fan Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Owen Keegan, estimated that 1,778 management positions should go.  He may have left out a category so that it could have been approximately 2,000.  These are extremely highly paid posts.  One of the criticisms made by the troika is that administrators at the top level in Ireland earn more than their opposite numbers in the countries with which we are trying to compete and indeed in the countries which we are trying to get to rescue us.  Is there a need for a reverse benchmarking exercise?<\/p><p>We should implement the reform also on the administrative side because that is the permanent pensionable burden that remains.  Does getting rid of some councillors, reducing the number from some hundreds to 62, apart from some travel expenses for going to meetings, really get the Minister the kind of reductions that implementing big reductions in corporate service staff and directors of services and getting rid of ten county managers would achieve?  There is a belief outside the Houses that the reforms in the permanent government at local and national levels must take place if we ever leave the rescue plans and try to develop this economy.  The permanent bureaucracy has to contribute to that.<\/p> <p> The health sector, which grew out of local government, was very heavily criticised in the last EU review, published ten days ago, for its high cost base.  Sheltered services sectors such as government and the professional services detract from our ability to operate internationally and to generate jobs and get unemployment down from 14% to the level of 4.8% which we had before.  It is important that we see what is happening in permanent government but we should also consider local government level as well.  What savings will there be from the transfer of many functions from local authorities to other agencies?  There must be genuine savings.  As the Minister is aware, fears have also been expressed that with early retirement programmes, which have been mooted again, what one gains on the swings one loses on the roundabouts.  This has come up in discussion on the much-enhanced pensions Bill.  Is local government being slimmed down at managerial level?  One effect of the moratorium was that the numbers of outdoor staff went down far more rapidly than the number of people in management offices and this was not a welcome development.  The number of outdoor staff went down by 13%, the number of directors went down by 7%, the number of clerical and administrative staff went down by 4% and the number of professional and technical staff went down by 3.7%.  I have seen an illustration depicting a number of managers looking at a man digging a hole.  They say they need to cut back and decide to sack the man who is actually doing some work and digging the hole.  There is concern that there has been too much managerialism and too much growth of bureaucracy at local government level.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister in his reply on the progress his is making in this area, because it may be more important than getting rid of small numbers of local councillors throughout the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200028#BB00200","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358875200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Generally speaking and as a norm I fundamentally disagree with Senator Barrett, but today I find myself in agreement with most of what he has said.  I welcome the Minister to House and I welcome the update he has given us on local government reform.  I also acknowledge the presence of the president of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, AMAI, Councillor Willie Callaghan, and his colleague, Councillor Mark Dalton, in the Visitors Gallery today.<\/p><p>After much deliberation and consultation with members of the AMAI and local politicians throughout the country since 16 October 2012 I have come to the conclusion that the Putting People First document is based more on reductions in the number of councillors and less on the radical reform that we were promised.  We all know that strong local government should play a vital part in a functioning democracy, a democracy that strives to represent the public interest at all times.  The proposed reduction in the number of elected representatives throughout the country and the abolition of town councils needs reassessment.  What we need, and what councillors throughout the country are calling for, is a re-balancing to ensure that this once in a lifetime opportunity to reform local government is not wasted and that this does not amount to reductionism sold as the upgrading of local government.<\/p><p>I have been contacted by town councillors across the political spectrum since the launch of the document in October 2012.  They have all said the same thing, that it will be impossible for many small towns throughout the country to elect any councillor or for any small party to fly its party's flag if the current proposals go ahead in the present format.  I have stated in the past that if we really wish to reform local government then we should curb the powers of county managers, who merely use councillors as rubber stamps.<\/p><p>The current system needs to be reformed.  I acknowledge and support reform but it should not be another opportunity for reductionism.  I have stated previously on the record of the House that I believe the Minister has at heart the desire to reform local government.  However, currently there is not enough clarification in the Putting People First document on the amount of new powers that will be provided to councils.  I have received telephone calls from local representatives asking what new powers will be transferred to them and the issue needs clarity.<\/p><p>Departments need to be prepared to let go of powers and to enhance and embrace the concept of local government reform that the Minister is putting forward.  There is also a serious deficit of information with regard to whether the new municipal councils will indeed have the their own financial autonomy.  Will they simply be looking to another paymaster, that is to say, instead of central government the county council, from which they will be provided with money to provide local services?<\/p> <p>The cost of running town councils and local government generally has been greatly exaggerated in many quarters in order to build public support for slashing and burning local democracy.  As far as I can see, this has not worked.  The people I have been talking to from all walks of life in my own constituency appreciate the service town councillors provide for the small remuneration they receive, considering their responsibilities.  In Killarney, for example, a town councillor receives a representational payment of \u20ac85 per week and is responsible and accountable for a budget of more than \u20ac13 million annually.  To date there has not been any constructive engagement between the Department's mainstream staff and staff in local development companies.  The Department has refused to talk with staff or their unions regarding the new policy of the alignment of the development companies with the local authorities.  This issue must be addressed as a matter of urgency, as has already been alluded to by Senator Brian \u00d3 Domhnaill.  <\/p><p>All of these issues need clarity and trying to rush this legislation through in 100 days is not in the best interests of the country.  This is certainly not the package of local government reforms for which we have waited 100 years.  The Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, AMAI, as the overarching body for town and borough councils, celebrated its 100th anniversary last year.  During that time, the association has overseen many changes in life in general in Ireland.  I have been involved with the AMAI for over 20 years and have seen the importance of the organisation in working with its membership to ensure the best result is achieved in local government reform.  I welcome the comments of the Minister on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; last week when he spoke of his willingness to work with the AMAI and the Association of County and City Councils, ACCC, to move this issue forward and of the need for unity within councils and between councillors.  I note and welcome the Minister's reference again today to engagement with these organisations.<\/p><p>The Minister has proved to be a pragmatic politician throughout his career.  He has taken concerns expressed by people in rural Ireland very seriously and for that I commend him.  He reduced the charges for septic tank registration and made provision for a grant system for upgrades where they are required.  A proposal to reduce the provision of senior citizen alarms was reversed by the Minister last week.  On both issues the Minister acted pragmatically and with conviction.  I am now calling on him to show the same concern and pragmatism on this issue and to allow this process to run at a workable pace.  To expect submissions to be made to the local boundary committee by 25 January, to proceed to a full report by May and then, on foot of this, to draft legislation to change a century of local government before the summer recess is both impractical and unachievable.  The consequence of trying to adhere to this tight deadline will be that councillors and candidates across the country will see their electoral areas change by up to 40 miles in any direction but they will still be expected to contest an election with, at best, a run in of only seven or eight months.  <\/p><p>On foot of all I have outlined, I ask the Minister to ensure that any legislation passed will not affect the boundaries for the next local elections.  This will allow sitting councillors and potential candidates to have an adequate adjustment period, in line with that provided to D\u00e1il candidates contesting general elections.  I ask the Minister to consider this proposal so that we get it right from day one and reform local government without diminishing its role, particularly at the lowest practicable level and we remain in line with the European Charter of Local Self-Government which we signed in 1997.  I would argue that the establishment of the boundary committee and the proposed abolition of town councils disregards Article 5 of the aforementioned charter.  I ask the Minister to address my concerns and those of councillors across the country.  The spirit of togetherness that exists within local councils and the desire to get the right outcome for democracy is real.  I urge the Minister to engage with the councils in order to achieve a satisfactory outcome for all democrats on this island.<\/p> <p>It is real and I urge the Minister to engage with it in order to achieve a satisfactory outcome for all democrats on this island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200029#CC00200","speaker":"1162","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358876100,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and share the view that he is a reformer who, as someone who came from the local authority system, knows the various structures intimately.  However, even a cursory reading of the excellent briefing document prepared by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service would give pause for thought and, I am sure, some concern on the part of the Minister.  It conducted a detailed analysis of the reform proposals of this and previous Governments and found:<blockquote><br \/>Irish local government is considered to be weak on all variables in spite of reforms implemented in the 1990s.  Irish local government is characterised by unequal representation and inconsistent structures that reduce its democratic legitimacy.  Further, it is dominated by central government, has few financial resources, a limited range of functions, and elected councillors dominated by the non-elected manager.<\/blockquote>The Minister has indicated that he intends to appoint chief executive officers without outlining the duties such a role would comprise or, more important, the balance of power between elected representatives and CEOs.  On the question of whether local government will become more democratic, the document states: <blockquote>When the new municipal districts are taken as the unit of local government, the level of representation compares poorly to other countries.  While Ireland would appear to compare favourably with Denmark, greater numbers of councillors means that the ratio of population to councillor is 1:1,200 in Denmark compared with 1:4,212 at best in Ireland.  Further, the 98 Danish municipal councils are powerful in terms of functions and financial autonomy.<\/blockquote>These figures speak for themselves.  The document continues:<blockquote>With the exception of the expansion of its role in economic and community development, its remit will remain broadly the same.  Given the Government&#8217;s recent establishment of <i>Water Ireland<\/i>, it is possible to argue that the pattern of centralisation is continuing.<\/blockquote>In this context I wish to reflect the serious and legitimate concerns of those who represent the local development companies, LDCs.  The Minister noted that the sub-county structure has gone under the radar, but this issue has done likewise.  He will be aware that the storm clouds are gathering in this regard and the representative groups will be coming here to lobby on the issue tomorrow.  The representative groups argue that without guaranteed core funding from Leader and the local and community development programme, it is likely that many LDCs will be forced to close, with the result that the State will lose a national infrastructure that can deliver a range of labour market and enterprise programmes at a low cost.  LDCs have more than 20 years of experience in addressing disadvantage, poverty and social exclusion.  The expertise built up in local development programme design and delivery, as well as the considerable time and effort invested by voluntary chairpersons, will be lost.  The groups propose that the new socio-economic committees should co-ordinate local development but should not be involved in programme management or delivery.  This is not a question of local councillors getting more power.  As Senator Landy pointed out, councillors already sit on local development companies.  With due respect, I suggest this is going to result in a takeover by the permanent government to which Senator Barrett referred.  It is only waiting to get its hands on the Leader money.

The Minister knows, when a town mayor goes abroad, of the amount of status placed on that by the countries being visited.  Given the amount of tourism Killarney Town Council has generated by twinning and by visiting countries abroad to promote the town, the cost laid out has been returned tenfold.  Moreover, while I am only speaking about Killarney, I am sure this happens all over the country with all town councils.<\/p><p>Despite the publicity it got today, more than one thing happened at yesterday's meeting of Kerry County Council.

The Minister in his speech said, &quot;I want to make it clear that I am willing to continue that consultation and constructive engagement with the representative associations in the implementation of these reforms.&quot;  That does not explain why the Department is refusing to meet with the union officials who represent staff in the partnerships.

I am talking about the Leader company that messed up.  If the Minister decides to continue with the process of merging Leader into the councils, he needs to bear in mind that such a big change cannot be delivered unless the Department engages with the workers on the ground.  According to the most recent feedback I have received, the Department is refusing to talk to workers about the alignment with the local authorities.  I put it to the Minister that this is what is happening on the ground.  I know he will fix it.  I am just telling him about the feedback I have received in the last two days.  I think it is a valid point.  We do not want a new middle management layer in the councils.  That is what we got in the HSE and it led to public waste.  We can do very little about it now.<\/p><p>As someone who used to run a small business with six employees, I am deeply concerned about the possibility that the councils will be responsible for enterprise.  I have genuine fears in that regard because of the culture in the councils.  Everybody knows that when one rings a council office, much of the time the officials there do not pay any heed to the public.  One has to go through one's public representative to get rubbish picked up or potholes filled.  That is wrong.  If we are going to put enterprise into the councils, we have to change the culture in the councils completely.  The first thing we must do is ensure the councils are responsive.  We can ask Senator Quinn, who is not here, about how customers should be treated.  It is certainly different.  I accept that the councils are under incredible pressure as they try to do all the tasks they are charged with doing.  My fears are based on a combination of the huge strain on councils and their lack of responsiveness.<\/p><p>My final point is that government, at every level, is too fat and too big.  Even with the changes that are being made, the D\u00e1il is too big - probably by 60 Deputies, the Seanad is too big and local government is too big.  I know it might not be popular to say that.  The truth is that as long as our system of government is so big, we will continue to compete with each other instead of serving the public.  I was very impressed by the abortion hearings that were held in this Chamber.  We heard from people with expertise who are doing the job.  It was not politicised.  I know I am in the business of politics.  Ultimately, I came into politics to serve the public.  If we want better local government reform, we should streamline it in a way that will serve the public better.  That applies to the development companies, to enterprise and to democracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200032#FF02600","speaker":"1131"},{"type":"speech","time":1358876400,"counter":233,"content":"<p>On a point of order, I want to inform the House that incorrect information has been given.

Many people have a fundamentally different view from that of the Minister on how things should be fixed.  Perhaps Senator Healy Eames should listen for a change.  The first thing we need to do is establish the principles that should underpin local government and guide us as we consider how we can reform local government.  I suggest that local government should be underpinned by the principles of accountability, transparency, relevancy, democracy and subsidiarity.  Crucially, local government is about the provision of services.  We need to make sure services are delivered to citizens as closely as possible to them.  We must secure the best value and provide the best quality when we are organising the delivery of services.<\/p><p>Senator Keane made a factual statement when she said previous Governments tinkered around the edges when they tried to reform local government.  I have to agree with that.  However, the Senator cannot say with any clear conscience that the Minister's proposals constitute any more than tinkering around the edges.  That is exactly what is happening.  I do not believe any real or substantial changes are proposed.  I agree with Senator Landy that this is all about subtraction.  It is really about reducing numbers.  The numbers of councils, councillors and Deputies are all being reduced.  The abolition of the Seanad is to be proposed.  That is the core of the Minister's reform agenda.  He does not intend to give power to local government or to local councillors.

The Minister knows, when a town mayor goes abroad, of the amount of status placed on that by the countries being visited.  Given the amount of tourism Killarney Town Council has generated by twinning and by visiting countries abroad to promote the town, the cost laid out has been returned tenfold.

The Minister in his speech said, &quot;I want to make it clear that I am willing to continue that consultation and constructive engagement with the representative associations in the implementation of these reforms.&quot;  That does not explain why the Department is refusing to meet with the union officials who represent staff in the partnerships.

After 22 years as a town councillor, I never thought I would be in Leinster House singing the requiem for town councils.  It is regrettable and very sad.  Pining for town councils is in no way backward looking.  They gave fantastic service and what I liked most about them - I was also a county councillor - was the manner in which the urban communities related to, associated with and were interested in the work of town councils.  I can give one example of that, of which I am sure the Minister is aware.  No election was of more interest to a town dweller than that for his or her own town council.  Everybody wondered whether Mikey or Johnny got in and how many votes such and such got.  I found there was no such interest or excitement about general, European or even county council elections.  My supporters did not give two hoots what I got in county council elections once I topped the poll in town council elections and beat Fine Gael.  That was the craic of it.<\/p><p>I have a few questions for the Minister to which I hope he might be able to come back.  Before I leave the topic of town councils, I must mention that the best representative organisation in this country was the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland which gave service over 100 years.  I compliment it and recognise the fact that its president, Willie O'Callaghan, is here along with Mark Dalton who is also very involved.  My questions are simple.  Will the county council still be the premier, overarching local authority in the county?  Will its position be in any way diminished by the creation of a new tier of municipals?  If the answer is &quot;No&quot;, what powers will a municipal authority or council have that the town council does not already have in the town areas?  <\/p><p>There has been a Civil Service plot in respect of this going back years and the Minister inherited it.  I think the former Minister for the environment, Noel Dempsey, was involved in that plot but he did not see it through.  At least the Minister is seeing it through.  The Civil Service had this up its sleeve for a long time.  When I was first elected, I was elected to an urban district council.  Do Members remember those?  For no apparent reason, the Civil Service changed the names of them to town councils.  This in a way diminished them and did what the Minister says he is trying to get rid of, namely, isolating the town and putting it inside town walls.  Now we are going back to municipal district councils.  Municipal and urban mean the same thing.  There has been a little scheme going on for quite a while and I suspected it and said so at the time.<\/p><p>The Minister referred to the rating position in his speech.  He spoke about the harmonisation of rates.  Everybody knows that in most town councils, the rating is low.  I was in business for a long time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200034#HH00300","speaker":"1142"},{"type":"speech","time":1358877600,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I ask the Senator to conclude as we are under time pressure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200034#HH00400","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1358877600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>All my neighbours are in business and are very concerned that the advantageous rating position they had <i>vis-\u00e0-vis<\/i> the county will change.

We had an extra layer of bureaucracy where hundreds of people in local authorities were given a salary of over \u20ac100,000.  That was its form of better local government.  This harks back to the point raised by Senator Barrett.  There are people within local authorities on inflated salaries while the general worker seems to be suffering and has suffered over the past ten years.<\/p><p>This Minister is introducing radical reforms.

It has only been introduced and given by managers to councillors when they have a very short period of time in which to submit their proposals, which is unfair.

We have had this discussion before and to a degree I agree with the Minister that while councillors have the power they are waiting for the next lollipop from the county manager.  That is a fact of life.  In local government at present the executive is running the councils, not the county councillors.  The same situation is replicated at Government level.  Civil servants run the country, as has been noted in the Chamber.  From interaction with various Ministers, I have noted they cannot do anything because they are hamstrung by civil servants.  I was interested to hear the debate on whether we should tax people earning more than \u20ac100,000 an extra 3%.  The media reported that Fine Gael would not agree to this unless the Labour Party agreed to cut social welfare.  In my view the civil servants were telling the Government what they were and were not willing to take, and they were not willing to take that pain.  That is where the real story lies.  I often wonder if there is any need for politicians because the executive runs the council and the civil servants run the country.   <\/p><p>On a more parochial issue in regard to local government reform I am concerned, and point out to my counterpart in County Leitrim, Senator Mooney, that this county, with a population of 27,000, will retain 18 county councillors while a population in County Roscommon of 63,000 will have the same number.  Perhaps this submission to the Boundary Commission should be looked at again.  I would appreciate if the Minister would look at it.  <\/p><p>There are more rural than urban areas in County Roscommon.

I am disappointed.  Local government has been crying out for real and meaningful reform going back many decades.  An attempt was made in 2001 but unfortunately some of the initiatives in the 2001 Act were subsequently reversed.  These current proposals are not reform but rather rationalisation of councils, which is the corollary of embracing the principle of subsidiarity.  We should be empowering councillors at local level.  We should be transferring a number of the executive functions from the manager and making them reserved functions of councils.  I see no reason in the current climate to have any executive functions.  Councillors should be empowered to make decisions.  The process should be transparent to ensure they are held accountable for their decisions and also the manner in which they make them.  There is nothing in the Minister's statement about the devolution of powers to councils.  Other countries have a variety of public services which are administered and controlled by local government, but that is not the case in this country.  The only initiative in the past ten years was from the Department of Justice and Equality.  Why do local government members not have a greater role in our dysfunctional health services?  It has been found that the centralisation of health services has been a significant mistake.

I value the sincerity with which many speakers have raised these issues.  I assure the House that once the legislation is published and is brought to the House I will look very carefully at any amendments or changes Members wish to propose.  I will be as open as possible in that regard.<\/p><p>  We are operating within a situation of financial restrictions.  Members of this House should not be immune to this fact and I cannot be immune to it as a member of the Government.  It is a very difficult situation.  This is not the reason for the meaningful reform programme we propose.  People who read the document in its entirety will have found answers to many of the questions raised by Senators today.  It is evident that not everyone who spoke has read the document.  I suggest it should be read in full to understand the types of function we are seeking to introduce and to devolve as much as possible to local level.  Many contributors want structures but not power or responsibility.  They cannot have it every way.  My starting point is to decide what are the types of service that can be delivered by local government.  The principal position is set out in the document.  If a service can be delivered as close as possible to the citizen, the vehicle by which that service can be delivered is local government.  The structures and services are already <i>in situ<\/i>, as is the provision of opportunities.  Therefore, this is the first matter to consider in the delivery of any new or existing service which is currently being delivered by a State agency.  This gives us all an opportunity to see how agreement can be achieved between Departments, agencies and all of us.  For example, once this reform goes through, councillors will have to adopt all programmes and service delivery across the range of local authority services; they will have to adopt all service level agreements between national bodies and local bodies; and they will have to adopt all economic strategies and community strategies, something they are unable to do at the moment.  The difficult aspect is that they will have to avail of revenue-raising opportunities in order to ensure that the priorities they have outlined in their strategies and budgets can be delivered.<\/p><p>  My late father was a councillor from 1955 to 1982.  Up to his untimely death, as a councillor he had more power to deliver local services in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s than I had as a councillor subsequent to 1982.  That is my background with regard to local government.  I say to the people in this House who have a close relationship with councillors that I will not be found wanting with regard to devolution of responsibility from national to local.  Revenue-raising opportunities or powers to implement those programmes at local level are what we should be aiming for in legislation.  We cannot have it every way.  It was a great mistake to centralise local government over the years, as mentioned by Senator Walsh.  The final nail in the coffin was in 1977 when rates were abolished across the board.  That really removed and centralised into national agencies and bodies any opportunities for people to deliver their priorities at local level.  I want to change that.  I say in a very open way to Members of the House that I will be delighted to hear their views about amendments they may wish to table.<\/p><p>  I remind Senator \u00d3 Domhnaill that we can have our little scraps about local level.  He had a good run in his contribution today, but it also contained a lot of misinformation about reductions in services.  If people in Donegal or anywhere else pay for their local services, more services will be delivered.  However, if people do not pay for them the budgets will not be met.<\/p> <p>Therefore, the local management must decide to cut their cloth to suit its measure.  If people advocate not paying then they should not expect the same level of service.  It is a responsibility - and I am not saying that personally to the Senator - but we must all take responsibility.  If one wants a service then one must pay for it so the funds can come from central government or local government.  The more discretion one has, the more opportunities there will be to raise revenue at local level.  <\/p><p>I would say to Senators \u00d3 Clochartaigh and Cullinane from the Sinn F\u00e9in Party that I have examined the Northern Ireland situation which adopted a position of responsibility.  Revenue raising opportunities have been provided for local people and it is called a property tax.  I have examined that property tax as a possible model for this State in the future.  In the North Sinn F\u00e9in places a charge of \u20ac1,000 on an average household for a particular range of services.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200036#KK01600","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358879400,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Yes, we are getting service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200037#LL00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1358879400,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Sorry?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200037#LL00300","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1358879400,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to outline the services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200037#LL00400","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1358879400,"counter":346,"content":"<p>People cannot have it every way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200037#LL00500","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1358879400,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Please outline the services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200037#LL00600","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1358879400,"counter":348,"content":"<p>The Senator's party has proposed reducing the number of local authorities to 11.

The same people who will be concerned about the way money is distributed will have a say because they will be members of the plenary council at town, county and city levels which is not what happens at the moment.  A town councillor cannot attend a county council meeting or seek money anywhere else.  A municipal membership will mean that one can attend, advise and influence the outcome when it comes to the distribution of finances for the provision of services, which may be based on the population or whatever criteria is approved by the plenary body at county and city level.

Municipal districts will consist of between six and ten seats.  If somebody secures 8% of the vote on the first count he or she will have a good chance of being elected.  If a person cannot secure that proportion of the vote then he or she will have to take a serious look at themselves and will not be able to blame the system.  People will vote for whomever they want and that is democracy.  A quota of 8% is a modest requirement for people who have secured the genuine warmth of his or her electorate rather than the cold winds which all of us feel from time to time.

I welcome the president of the AMAI, Councillor Willie Callaghan.  I assure him and his colleagues that over the coming months I shall work closely with his organisation on the legislation.  I expect that the legislation will be published before the summer recess but it will not be passed before then.  People will have plenty of opportunities over the summer months and into the autumn session to study the legislation and to improve it, where possible.  Senator Landy and other Members sought more time to peruse the legislation.  Between now and the end of the year should be sufficient time to pass the legislation. <\/p><p>Senator Keane raised another key matter, namely, the relationship between a manager and a local authority member.  At the moment it is a relationship.  Often councillors do not realise the extent of the influence that they can bring to bear on the outcome of a process, not just budgets and development plans but for many other issues.  We want to make it a lot more explicit as to who has the power and responsibility to deliver each of the service plans.  I want to ensure that the manager is the chief executive officer on the board of directors of the democratically elected local councillors and that the councillors will have the final say in the outcome, in as much as we possibly can outside of the normal doctor-client relationship, of issues such as the allocation of housing or whatever the appropriate mechanism is established to ensure there is no corruption or bias in the system, which would also be against the best wishes of the citizen.  The councillors, as far as possible, will be the locally elected people who, in turn, will hold the position of a board of directors in order to facilitate the chief executive carrying out his or her wishes, not the other way around like at present.  Several Senators had raised the matter.  <\/p><p>I know that Senator Barrett has had a lot of experience of a State body because of the many matters that arose when merging the health system.  I am sure that he had an interesting experience when the health authorities merged into one.  I am also sure that he would be aware of the difficulties that would arise if we tried to reverse the merger and grant greater devolved responsibility at local level.  It was a fundamental mistake to centralise the health system into a major bureaucracy.  Unfortunately we can all see how difficult it would be to reverse its role and try to create a better delivery of services.  The health service was established for the wrong reason, to put a structure in place rather than how best to deliver services to the citizen.  <\/p><p>I want to assure Senator Barrett about the efficiencies that I mentioned in the McLoughlin report which consisted of 106 recommendations.  I will implement 105 of the recommendations.  I shall not implement the recommendation to retain the manager.  The McLoughlin report recommended 21 local authorities, not 34.  I shall not put a manager in charge of several other counties or regional managers because people are entitled to know who is in charge of each local authority.  We can co-ordinate many services regionally and nationally and that is essential.  We identified \u20ac511 million of savings under the McLoughlin report and \u20ac420 million will be in addition to that sum due to better procurement and delivery of services and fewer people at senior management level.  In the policy statement we have provided for a merger of directors of service, fire officers, librarians and people at senior level.  In my view there is no need to have a county librarian in every county and one can leave a sufficiently qualified person in charge on a regional basis or group a couple of counties together.  For better local government we do not need such a high level of senior management that has built up.    <\/p> <p>We are going to reverse what is occurring and have middle and lower management to protect front-line services.  I agree with the Senator totally that it is not acceptable to have very little change at senior level and considerable change affecting front-line services delivered by outdoor staff.  I am trying to redress this through the workforce planning process.  There is provision for 500 voluntary retirements at senior management level as part of our policy proposals.<\/p><p>Senator Sean D. Barrett should note that many private entities that were regarded as pillars of society also got things wrong, including the boards of banks, for example.  We should not ignore these either.  The individuals concerned put themselves forward as candidates for State boards.  I am sure Governments came under pressure from many of these wonderful people who were not exactly doing much in the best interests of the country or the private entities they were representing.  We must acknowledge that people are paid a lot of money in the private sector also.  An example is the payment of a salary of \u20ac1 million, on top of share options, to an individual in the food sector.  This is one area we could consider also.  The staff are doing a great job, but I am sure they are not worth \u20ac1 million, in addition to share options.  The private and public sectors could get together a little more often and talk about what is a realistic return on their investment in terms of human capital.  Those at the lower levels in society and those working hard to make senior management positions available are often driven to despair over the extent to which senior managers are paid.<\/p><p>I assure Senator Sean D. Barrett that 8,500 people have left the local government service in the past four years.  This represents the highest rate of departure in any area of the public service.  There was a reduction in staff from 37,000 in mid-2008 to 28,500 today.  This represents a substantial contribution to dealing with the fiscal problems we face.  Despite the reductions, however, local authorities are expected to deliver a quality service.<\/p><p>Senator David Cullinane mentioned Waterford, as he does regularly.  I would expect him to do so, but I assure him the actions taken in Waterford were to improve its status, as Senator Maurice Cummins stated.  What did the gateway status the city had for so long achieve for it?  There is no point in having status if one does not have resources or implementable development plans.  Everywhere has status such as hub or gateway status, but such status is meaningless if one does not have the resources to implement the plans associated therewith.  I am sorry the Senator did not acknowledge that I had kept the councils in Galway city and county apart.  Obviously, those concerned do not get on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200037#LL02200","speaker":"967","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358880000,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I do not remember mentioning that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200038#MM00200","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1358880000,"counter":366,"content":"<p>The recommendations for Waterford are part of a process to bring together an entity that will represent 114,000 people and provide strength for the county and city.

I have a very close working relationship with the sector.  From a recent visit to Brussels to meet Members of the European Parliament and the Commission, the representatives will know from the budgetary discussions taking place on the Common Agricultural Policy that there will be a massive reduction in funding under the rural development programme.  This has been well signalled by the officials the representatives met in Brussels.  One will not need the same structures to administer a budget that will probably be 50% lower.<\/p><p>The local and community development programme and all such programmes are part of a wider package of services to be delivered for the areas in question.  When I refer to the alignment of community and local authorities, I envisage them working closely together.  The 1,968 people who work in the community and partnership sector are an enormous expense.  Do we need to provide for synergies to ensure savings in administration such that the money left over will be available to provide front-line services?  This is the challenge for everybody.  One is either interested in oneself or services for the community.  The structures we have in place will not be the kind we will be able to afford from 2014.  We must examine what savings we can achieve in local government to continue meeting some of the costs of administration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200038#MM00300","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1358880000,"counter":367,"content":"<p>Who will be in charge?

The stage 2 public exhibition day is scheduled for 11 April 2013 but it has already been rescheduled from October, when it was originally supposed to take place.  Over the past two years, these consultation days and exhibition days have been pushed out by between nine and 12 months, which is causing much concern.<\/p><p>In the past six weeks, we have had four flood weather warnings from Met \u00c9ireann and Cork County Council.  In addition, there were three floods on the Mill Road on 18-19 and 21-22 December and on 18 January.  On most of these occasions, the water was within millimetres of flooding private houses and businesses in the Skibbereen area.  Needless to say that on some of these occasions, the road to the local hospital was blocked off because of the flood warnings.<\/p><p>I put on record my sincere thanks to the voluntary local flood committee.  It sometimes comes in for much criticism because it is not delivering.  I have met some of the members of the committee and during the dates on which there were flood warnings, they were up until 3 a.m., 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. watching the water rise and waiting until it receded before they went to bed.  <\/p><p>In the previous debate on local government reform, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, spoke about the voluntary sector which should be given credit.  This is a group of amazing people who have done trojan work.

Whether it is a two or a three-year job to implement what is proposed for the Skibbereen flood relief scheme, the community, the elderly people living in the estates, the ratepayers and so on should not have to wait and suffer further consequences as a result of inaction and pushing the evil day further out.

A flood risk assessment and management study for the town of Skibbereen is being advanced by Cork County Council in partnership with the Office of Public Works, OPW, which is providing the funding.  Consultants were appointed in 2011 and the project is currently at feasibility study and environmental assessment stage.  There have been two information days where an initial preferred scheme was presented to the public, with the main proposals, including new walls and embankments, some localised channel widening, localised regrading of the channel and some improvements to the local drainage system.<\/p><p>While it was intended to place the preferred scheme on formal public exhibition towards the end of 2012, some delay was incurred due to the need to assess further information from the existing river gauges at Ballyhilty and the need to undertake further surveys.  The delay is regrettable but it is vital that all available information is fully and thoroughly assessed before formalisation of the preferred scheme so that the most effective and appropriate scheme can be put forward for consideration by the people of Skibbereen and other stakeholders.  <\/p><p>A date for the exhibition launch has now been set and I am pleased to say the process will commence on 11 April 2013.  The proposals will be on display for one month with members of the design team attending on specified days to deal with queries from the public.

However, as I have indicated before, it was considered best that the full feasibility study consider the efficiency of a flood warning system for the town rather than undertake another study.  It is my hope that the scheme to be placed before the public in April will be received positively and that, subject to no significant delays occurring with the programme for the detailed design stage and procurement of a civil works contractor, it may be possible to commence construction works for the scheme in mid-2014.

If 2012 is anything to go by, he will certainly make a significant difference in terms of creating jobs, which is a passion close to his heart.  This matter relates to job retention as well as job creation.  The announcement in the last budget that a rebate structure would be put in place for the road hauliers was great news because fuel costs for them were significant.  There were challenges with the North and internationally in terms of the cost of fuel and the Government responded appropriately with a scheme.  There was a significant amount of representation by the Irish Road Haulage Association dating back 14 months which led to this very important development.<\/p><p>That said, I would like to see it rolled out to the bus and coach industry which is a significant player in terms of economic development, tourism development and ensuring The Gathering is a success and people get from A to B safely, comfortably and easily.

Therefore, it makes eminent sense that the scheme that is applicable to the road hauliers, and appropriately and correctly so, should also be mirrored among the coach and bus hire operators.  It is a significant industry because thousands of jobs rely on the sector directly and indirectly.  These operators have found themselves significantly and economically challenged when tendering for State jobs.  For example, school bus runs have been cut to the bone and service providers barely make a living.  Recently I spoke to a bus operator who would have earned \u20ac40 per week if he had won a contract.  The sector poses significant challenges but it is an open and shut case.  The finance Bill gives us an opportunity to grant equity to the haulage and bus hire industry.  I hope that the Minister of State will have good news in this regard.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200039#NN00500","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358881200,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Conway for raising the important issue of the role of business and the survival of small companies.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Minister for Finance on the motion to introduce an excise rebate on diesel for passenger transport companies in the Finance Bill 2013.<\/p><p>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, announced in his budget address the introduction of a rebate on diesel for tax-compliant hauliers with effect from 1 July 2013.  It is intended as a support to small businesses in all sectors of the economy as virtually all businesses rely on cost-effective transport for their inputs and outputs.  Such transport is provided by hauliers, the majority of whom are themselves small businesses.  The rebate was introduced to assist the competitiveness of this key industry.<\/p><p>The Minister, in providing for this support, did so in recognition of the high cost of fuel and the effect this was having on transport costs for small business.  Ireland, as with other countries, has experienced an increase in the cost of petrol and auto-diesel.  The increase in fuel prices is an international phenomenon.  There seems to be a belief that the increased fuel prices in recent years is a result of high levels of taxation, but this is not the case.  Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs.  The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as the geopolitical uncertainty in northern Africa and the Middle East with potential supply disruptions.<\/p><p>The excise rates, including the carbon charge, in Ireland on motor fuels are 58.7 cent on a litre of petrol and 47.9 cent on a litre of auto-diesel.  Ireland's excise rates are the ninth and fourth highest in the EU27 for petrol and auto-diesel, respectively.  However, our rates remain lower than many of our main trading partners.  Members will be aware that the Minister did not increase excise rates on fuels in the recent budget. The Minister has received a number of calls for a reduction in excise duty and there is a general belief that the increase in fuel prices was in some way a bonanza for the Exchequer.  This is not the case.  It should also be noted that the Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase.  On the other hand, the yield from VAT per litre of fuel, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  It is important t note that businesses that are registered for VAT are entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on auto-diesel.  Accordingly, there is little or no gain to the Exchequer because it is a VAT reclaim and a lot of the businesses are VAT registered.  <\/p><p>Members will be aware that in the past the Energy Tax Directive 2003 incorporated a special derogation for an excise duty relief on fuel used for local public passenger transport vehicles in Ireland.  The derogation expired on 31 December 2006.  The energy tax directive allowed for the relief derogation to be extended with the approval of the Commission.  At the time, together with several other member states, including France, Belgium, the UK, Greece, Sweden, Malta, Italy, Portugal, Denmark and Finland, Ireland applied to have the derogations extended.  However, all of the requests were refused by the Commission.  The Irish derogations were officially turned down in March 2007.  Consequently, the Finance Act 2008 provided the legislative changes to withdraw the relief in respect of fuel used for public passenger transport vehicles - the point raised by Senator Conway - with effect from 1 November 2008 and the appropriate full excise rates applied from that date.  In the circumstances the reintroduction of such an excise relief does not arise.<\/p><p>The Minister acknowledges that the energy tax directive permits the application of a lower rate of mineral oil tax to diesel used for certain commercial purposes, provided that the minimum rate of taxation specified by the directive for that fuel is respected.  Commercial use includes the carriage of passengers by road in vehicles with eight seats or more and to road haulage by larger vehicles with a maximum permissible gross laden weight of not less than 7.5 tonnes.  The current EU minimum rate is 33 cent per litre.  The maximum difference that may be allowed is the difference between the current Irish rate of 47.9 cent per litre and the EU minimum providing for a rebate of up to approximately 15 cent per litre.<\/p><p>The cost of a relief for all eligible commercial vehicles at the maximum permissible rate would be in the region of \u20ac200 million in a full year.  In addition, the administrative difficulties for Revenue would be significant.  A register of all users would need to be established including the details of the companies and individuals involved, identifying the type of vehicle that would qualify for relief, establishing that the fuel was used in the vehicles concerned, and the diversion of resources from other areas of tax control and compliance that this would involve.  In addition, the rebate cannot be restricted to indigenous industry, foreign based hauliers and coach operators would also have to be included.  This would present particular difficulties as they could not be subject to the same audit, tax clearance controls as Irish based operators.  Any such scheme of repayment would potentially be open to serious abuse. <\/p><p>For all of these reasons the Minister for Finance decided that the commercial diesel rebate, announced in his budget speech, would be confined to licensed, tax-compliant road hauliers.  It is worth noting that one of key arguments for the introduction of a rebate for the haulage industry is the fact that a large quantity of fuel purchased by the industry is purchased abroad thus generating no tax revenue for the State.  A rebate should encourage hauliers to start purchasing their fuel in Ireland thus offsetting some of the costs involved.

This stretch of road represents a major hazard to all local road users and has been the scene of a number of fatal collisions in recent years.  One of the main issues is that there is no white line on a portion of the road.  This presents a significant safety risk as road users are unable to identify the central demarcation line.  <\/p><p>The people of Kilreekill and surrounding areas should not have to put their lives at risk on a daily basis by having to drive on a clearly dangerous and substandard stretch of road.  The 300 signatures which I will furnish to the Minister's office are further evidence of the strong depth of feeling locally concerning the issue.  The Minister's intervention is urgently required to ensure this safety issue is addressed and that there is none or at least a much reduced number of fatal road collisions on this road and others throughout the country.  It would be remiss of me not to put this issue to the Minister and ask him to set out a policy programme through the National Roads Authority to ensure the adequate lining of all secondary and regional routes in the interests of road safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200040#OO00800","speaker":"1173","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358881800,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to address it in the House.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in regard to the national roads programme.  The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads are statutory matters for the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  The NRA arranges for the lining of national primary and secondary routes by contractors under a multi-annual programme.<\/p><p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads are the statutory responsibility of each local authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants paid by my Department.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded are also matters for the local authority.<\/p><p>A total of \u20ac346.5 million is available this year under the regional and local roads investment programme.  However, it is a matter for local authorities to decide on their road programmes and how best to utilise the resources available to them.<\/p><p>The signage and delineation on Irish roads are provided for in accordance with the Department's traffic signs manual, the current standard for signing and road marking.  The most recent edition of the manual was issued in January 2011.  The manual was produced by my Department, together with the technical assistance of the NRA, the County and City Managers Association and Roughan &amp; O'Donovan - AECOM Consulting Engineers and supersedes the previously published 1996 traffic signs manual.<\/p><p>There are various factors to be taken into account, including road width and sight distance, when deciding on the appropriate road markings to be used on any given road.  The traffic signs manual provides the guidelines for all local authorities regarding road markings which may be used on roads in Ireland, including their layout and dimensions, the circumstances in which markings may be used and guidance on positioning them.  This ensures consistency across the country.<\/p><p>The traffic signs manual also provides comprehensive advice on all aspects of signing and lining and emphasises the need for maintenance and the renewal of signs and road markings.  Using the guidance detailed in the manual, it is a matter for local authorities to provide adequate road marking and signage where it is required.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that the guidelines outlined in the traffic signs manual are sufficient to ensure consistency on road markings across the country.  I have no plans for a policy programme on the lining of secondary and regional routes.<\/p><p>As regards the illumination of bus stops, the NRA has regard to the need for bus stops on national routes where higher speeds apply to be located appropriately, taking safety factors into account.  Where possible, bus stops are located where they can benefit from existing high quality street lighting.  In keeping with this approach, Bus \u00c9ireann's policy on the illumination of its bus shelters is that, where possible, lighting should be provided at shelters on a 24 hour basis or from dusk to dawn.  While it does not have a policy of illumination of bus poles, in the vast majority of cases these bus poles are located in urban settings where on-street illumination is provided.  This is also the case where bus shelters are not illuminated.<\/p><p>I do not know the road in detail about which the Senator spoke, but I will ensure her correspondence is made available.  I will take a personal interest in the matter and ask the local authority or the NRA, as appropriate, to respond directly on the issues raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200041#PP00200","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1358881800,"counter":402,"content":"<p>While I accept that local authorities and various State agencies have responsibility for road safety under statute, I acknowledge that the Minister is being incredibly helpful.

My Adjournment matter relates to Shannon Airport and the measures announced by the Government in the budget, as well as indications given throughout last year.  My concern is that the State is unfairly promoting a policy to ensure the survival and growth of one airport potentially at the direct expense of another.  I want to make it clear, as I have got some stick from a particular county yesterday and today, that I am for Shannon Airport, pro the south-west region and would not seek to scupper investment to help that region and Shannon Airport to perform to its potential.  Ireland requires the airport to perform to its potential.<\/p><p>  The Minister may or may not be aware that I have lodged a complaint with the European Commission Directorate General for Competition raising concerns about the measures announced some time ago indicating that they are anti-competitive on the basis that I understand Shannon Airport's business plan will specifically target 250,000 passengers at Ireland West Airport Knock and that, effectively, it now has the benefit of the apparatus of State agencies in seeking to do this following the announcement of what I estimate to be a &#8364;100 million debt write-off, the stripping of certain assets to be sold to IDA Ireland, the proceeds of which will go back to Shannon Airport, among other issues.  I estimate that up to &#8364;300 million is the value of the investment to Ireland West Airport Knock and that region.  This equips Shannon Airport unfairly and undermines the potential of Ireland West Airport Knock to continue to grow its business.<\/p><p>  The Minister has said that in some ways he admires the performance of Ireland West Airport Knock in terms of what it has achieved in growing its business by 350% - to use his words - in the past ten years at a time when Shannon Airport had lost 63% of its business.  In that period &#8364;160 million was provided for Shannon Airport, while just &#8364;15 million was provided for Ireland West Airport Knock.  The Minister stated: <blockquote>... if nothing was done for Shannon the airport stood in danger of being passed out by Knock airport in passenger numbers, despite a current gap of over 900,000 passengers.<br \/><br \/>  I think if the trends continue as they are it will happen because Shannon&#8217;s numbers are already down 20 per cent this year and Knock is still growing.  It is only a matter of time without a change in policy.<\/blockquote>We have changed the policy through the actions of the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, as announced by the Government, and other measures, as indicated by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, in his Budget Statement to enhance the potential of Shannon Airport to grow and specifically target passenger numbers at Ireland West Airport Knock.<\/p><p>  I am not against Shannon Airport, but the Booz report warned that supporting Shannon and Cork airports in isolation would jeopardise the viability of other airports.  That is what will happen.  We must take a strategic approach to our airports, acknowledge that they can all be economic drivers for their respective regions and maximise the potential of the regions in contributing to the national effort and, ultimately, national recovery.<\/p><p>  I ask the Minister to acknowledge the strategic importance of Ireland West Airport Knock to the north-west region and its potential to contribute to the national effort and future national recovery.  Second, I ask him to make available proportionate supports to Ireland West Airport Knock to help it to perform to its potential.  I am not talking about &quot;capex&quot; and &quot;opex&quot; but rather take a strategic view.  I am aware that members of the board and management have met the Minister and other Government representatives some 50 times since he took office to highlight the contribution that can be made in the context of some 900 jobs being created and in terms of the airport being an economic driver for that region.<\/p> <p>Rather than Shannon being enhanced in its role to try to rob Peter to pay Paul, all of us can be equipped to focus on the international market to get more people into the respective regions and those regions to contribute to the national effort.  The Minister knows where I am coming from.  I am aware that people in Clare are extremely annoyed at this disruptive Sligo Senator from the north west potentially querying why Shannon should be supported.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200041#PP00400","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1358882400,"counter":406,"content":"<p>So is Deputy Timmy Dooley.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200042#QQ00200","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1358882400,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I am simply using the complaint to the European Commission to raise awareness and highlight the fact that we must have proportionate support for Ireland West Airport Knock in the interests of that region performing to its potential and making a positive contribution to the national effort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200042#QQ00300","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1358882400,"counter":408,"content":"<p>As the Senator will be aware, the Government decided in November to proceed with the separation of Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and to merge the airport with a restructured Shannon Development to form a new integrated Shannon entity in public ownership, \"NewCo\".  This will grant Shannon Airport the freedom to determine its own future in the best interests of the airport itself and of the Shannon region.  It will free the board and management of Shannon Airport, together with the employees, to bring a fresh approach to the future development of the airport.<\/p><p>In line with this Government decision, the assets and business of Shannon Airport were transferred from the DAA to the Shannon Airport Authority, SAA, on 31 December 2012, following the approval of the relevant order by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Shannon Development and Shannon Airport Authority are both owned by the State and the State, on behalf of its citizens and taxpayers, has been faced with these two ailing companies that have not been realising their potential to make a contribution to the economy of the wider region.  The State is, therefore, restructuring its assets to make better use of them as a catalyst for the development of sectoral opportunities, and the creation of jobs, particularly within the aviation sector.  This restructuring involves no more than a re-ordering of assets which are already in State ownership.  It is the DAA, not Shannon Airport, that borrowed money over the years and it is for the DAA to pay that money back.  The State is neither writing down nor writing off any debt as these borrowings will be paid back in full by the DAA.  It will be for Shannon now to chart its own future as a separated State-owned company.<\/p><p>There appears to be some confusion in recent debate about the difference between a State airport and a regional airport.  Please allow me to clarify that issue.  There are two types of airport in the State, the State airports and the regional airports.  The State airports, Dublin, Cork and Shannon, are owned by the State and the Government appoints their chairman and boards.  They receive no Government grants or Exchequer subsidies.  They are expected to fund their own capital development from their profits or borrowings against their own assets which are not guaranteed by the State.  They should turn a profit, pay corporation profit tax and a dividend to the State and have done so in the past.<\/p><p>The regional airports - Ireland West Airport Knock, Kerry, Waterford and Donegal - are not owned by the State and we do not appoint their boards.  They exist for reasons of regional and social policy to provide essential air access to relatively remote regions that do not have a major airport or State airport nearby.  As a result, they can receive Government subsidies, subject to certain EU rules.  Generally, these subsides are provided to allow them to break even and remain operational.  They are not expected to pay a dividend and the Government does not guarantee their debts or financial obligations.<\/p><p>I have consistently said that all Irish airports should operate to a commercial mandate and have stressed on numerous occasions that regional airports, including Ireland West Airport Knock, must work towards achieving operational viability over the near term, particularly given the downward trajectory of Exchequer funding.  In this regard, apart from the consideration of restructuring the State-owned airports, I have also endeavoured to rationalise the system of State support for the regional airports not owned or controlled by the State, including those in the ownership of private companies and private trusts, and the Government now has a settled policy in relation to those airports.<\/p><p>In line with the recommendations of the value for money review on the regional airports programme published in 2011, the Government has decided that funding under that programme for the period 2012-2014 is being consolidated on the four regional airports of Ireland West Airport Knock, Donegal, Kerry and Waterford since the start of 2012.  Funding for Galway and Sligo airports ceased in 2012.  Subject to funding availability, the other four airports, including Knock, will continue to be eligible for funding up to the end of 2014 when the current EU-approved scheme expires.<\/p><p>While it might be possible to put a scheme in place to fund the regional airports beyond 2014, any such scheme would, due to new EU guidelines, be subject to more stringent eligibility criteria and to prior approval by the European Commission.  Of course this would also require the allocation of scarce Exchequer resources rather than to other competing demands such as public transport, road maintenance, hospitals and schools.<\/p><p>Since 1993, Ireland West Airport Knock has had the benefit of around \u20ac40 million in support under the regional airports programme.  This includes funding for PSO air services, which although paid directly to the airlines, also benefits the airport through revenue paid by those airlines to the relevant airport.   Approximately \u20ac1.3 million was provided in 2012 to the airport, \u20ac700,000 in capital expenditure funding for capital projects and \u20ac600,000 in operational subvention under the &quot;opex&quot; programme.  In addition, in 2012 alone the tourism agencies, Tourism Ireland and F\u00e1ilte Ireland, provided a total of over \u20ac1 million for overseas marketing related to Ireland West Airport Knock and the surrounding region.  Shannon, Cork and Dublin have not received such Exchequer support.  While some may argue that Shannon and Cork have been cross-subsidised by Dublin, it could equally be argued that had these two airports, Cork and Shannon, the same status as Ireland West Airport Knock, a regional airport, they would have been eligible for the same Government grants for the past few decades.<\/p><p>I believe that the measures the Government has initiated in relation to Shannon will give rise to some degree of increased competition not only between the State airports but also between them and the regional airports, including Ireland West Airport Knock and Kerry, which is a good thing.  These measures are focused on increasing the overall number of passengers to and from Ireland through increased efficiencies and attracting new aviation business that would otherwise not be based in Ireland which will have a beneficial national impact.<\/p><p>I am confident that there is a role for all remaining airports in providing scheduled air access for Ireland including Knock, Donegal, Kerry and Waterford.  It is also obvious that visitors arriving at Shannon Airport are more likely to visit western regions than tourists arriving at Dublin Airport.  I know the Senator will be aware of the importance of transatlantic connections and access to Heathrow through Shannon and that he will want to see the airport's decline halted. <\/p><p>I regret that some have attempted to suggest that the development of Shannon Airport must come at the expense of Knock.  I believe that both airports can have a bright future, particularly as the economy recovers and tourism initiatives such as The Gathering help to bring more people into the country.  It will be for the airport boards and managements to bring this about.<\/p><p>In the context of overall aviation policy, the Senator may wish to be aware that I launched a consultancy process on the development of an aviation policy for Ireland at a major conference in December and that this will be pursued through 2013, leading to the adoption of a new policy in 2014.  In that context Ireland West Airport Knock has been invited to participate actively and this is an opportunity for them to set out its vision for the future of Knock and the regional airport sector.<\/p><p>I reiterate for the benefit of the House that the Department and its agencies stand ready to work with Ireland West Airport Knock but it must be within the existing budget envelopes, within state aid rules and must have regard to the fact that there are other regional airports at Kerry, Donegal and Waterford that also need to be taken into account.  <\/p><p>In regard to the measures announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, in the budget, these will appear in the Finance Bill which has yet to be published.  Any measures will apply equally to all airports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012200042#QQ00400","speaker":"948"},{"type":"speech","time":1358882400,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for taking the time out of his busy schedule to respond.
