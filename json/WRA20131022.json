The effect of the Preservation Order is that any works affecting the site require my consent, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended.  <\/p><p>  On 16 July last I made a determination in relation to a consent application and related Environmental Impact Statement submitted by the owners in relation to proposed works on the monument site.  I believe that, having carefully considered all the relevant factors, my decision on the consent application is the best way to ensure that work can take place at the national monument to develop an appropriate commemorative centre to the events of Easter week 1916, whilst also ensuing that the monument site is fully protected for future generations.  My decision provides for the creation of a 1916 commemorative centre, involving the full repair and conservation of the four buildings.  The order which I signed did not approve the demolition of any structures or the removal of any material from the site which date from or before 1916.  Nor did it approve works for the provision of an underground car park within the boundary of the national monument site, or the demolition of the Moore Lane facades of Nos. 15 and 16.<\/p><p>  The national monument is in private ownership and, accordingly, the advancement of proposals that reflect the terms of the consent I have granted is a matter for the owners.  The consent is, however, conditional on a revised project design being submitted to me for approval within 9 months of the decision date that takes full account of the elements of the proposal for which consent has been refused and the conditions attached to the approved works.  A further condition requires substantive works to commence on site within 3 months of the approval of the revised proposals.  In that regard, I met recently with the owners of the national monument who informed me that they were currently examining proposals for the site which would fit within the confines of my decision, particularly with regard to the retention of all pre-1916 features of the national monument.  <\/p><p>  In terms of the planning requirements which would apply to any further proposal for the site, a planning authority is required under the Planning Acts to notify me as Minister of any application for planning permission where it appears to the authority that the development might affect or be unduly close to a national monument.  The consent processes under the Planning and Development Acts and the National Monuments Acts operate independently of each other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200053#WRA01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commemorative Events","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200053#WRA01150"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[44516\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200053#WRA01200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"his plans to involve the General Post Office on O&rsquo;Connell Street, Dublin in the commemoration of the centenary of 1916; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":17,"qnumday":322,"qnumall":"[44793\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200053#WRA01300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of sites or historical locations in Dublin likely to be recognised in the context of the 1916 Rising; the extent to which it is proposed to protect any threatened sites; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":18,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 322 together.<\/p><p>  The commemoration of the Easter Rising and the Proclamation of the Irish Republic will be the centrepiece of the Decade of Commemorations.

The group from Clara Bog commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June 2012, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have now been accommodated.  Turf cutting for the 2013 season took place on this site in April last.

Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number that had been cutting turf on these sites during the relevant five year period and would qualify for the relocation option available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.<\/p><p>  Relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure\/drainage works required, establishing the number that can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements.

This included a website portal and joint commercial and marketing strategy. Under the Croke Park and Haddington Road reform programme, we have now gone beyond what was contemplated by the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.  Indeed, savings of the order of 20-25% in the Exchequer allocations to the cultural institutions have been made since 2010.  <\/p><p>  In tandem the Government had agreed a range of reforms under the Public Service Reform Plan 2011 for a number of the national cultural institutions under the aegis of my Department.  The focus within my Department and the national cultural institutions has been concentrated on the implementation of the Reform Plan and there has been an intensive engagement by all in that process.  I have previously advised the House of the shared service models that are being developed for the national cultural institutions through my Department in relation to corporate support services and, by formal inter-institutional agreement, in relation to operational services.  For example, the National Museum of Ireland recently agreed a Shared Service Agreement on HR shared services and my Department has set up a HR Shared Services Unit to deliver on that.  <\/p><p>  The Deputies may also wish to note that the National Gallery of Ireland, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Crawford Art Gallery Cork have been working more closely and this has recently been formally codified by way of a Shared Services Agreement.  This commits each institution to working more closely together in a range of areas including human resources, procurement, conservation and photography services, collection management including cataloguing and digitisation, storage, insurance, enterprise and marketing.    <\/p><p>  Preliminary estimates for savings provided to me earlier this year indicate that approximately &euro;100,000 will have been saved over the course of 2012 and 2013 through the shared services agenda at the three Galleries.  As I outlined previously, in overall terms it is expected that operational and support savings in the region of approximately &euro;1 million will be initially realised from the reform programme across the institutions involved, which are funded from my Department's Vote Group, with further savings to be identified as the various cost efficiencies are implemented.

One of the key priorities identified by the Ulster-Scots Agency for 2013 is to develop strategic national and international engagements with Scotland and with North America in order to widen access to and appreciation of Ulster-Scots culture and heritage.  I understand that the Ulster-Scots Agency has already undertaken some activities in regard to promotion of Ulster-Scots in North America. For example, the Agency had a presence at <i>The Brits Off Broadway Festival<\/i> in New York, where it worked with Tourism Ireland to support the <i>Boat Factory<\/i>  play about Belfast shipbuilding.  The Agency also had an attendance at the Milwaukee Irish Fest through the Young Ambassadors programme, in partnership with St. Patrick's Centre, Downpatrick, and this month an Agency team will attend the Stone Mountain Games in Atlanta, Georgia.  <\/p><p>  I understand that the Agency is involved in co-operation with Tourism Ireland, including production of a book on the author CS Lewis and provision of publicity for Ulster-Scots culture in marketing initiatives for the USA and Canada.  At home, the Agency is engaging with local councils and others with relevant heritage assets to fill a key gap identified by Tourism Ireland around the development of the Ulster-Scots\/Scotch-Irish tourism content. In that context, the Agency proposes to develop heritage content in Co. Donegal around the stories of Rev Francis Makemie and President Buchanan.<\/p><p>  The Agency considers that the optimum way to engage the Ulster-Scots\/Scotch-Irish diaspora is through genealogy, heritage and musical connections.  However, as the Deputy will appreciate, direct physical engagement with the USA is limited by resources and therefore the goal is limited to 2-3 outward missions per year.  Accordingly, the Agency proposes to focus more on developing its web-based offerings in order to maximise its reach in the US market.  The website , which is currently being developed by the Agency, will be a key component in this regard and will include information about key heritage sites of relevance to Ulster-Scots in Scotland, Ireland and the USA. <\/p><p>  Finally, I should also refer the Deputy again to the work of Colmcille, the partnership programme between Foras na Gaeilge and Bord na Gaidhlig to promote the use of Irish and Scottish Gaelic within Ireland and Scotland, and also between the two countries.

Already the impending occasion has engendered a considerable degree of enthusiasm among historical groups, community agencies and business interests with connections to the marking of this important point in Irish history. <\/p><p>  Feedback from the wider community, voluntary and not-for-profit institutions, and organisations associated with the planned commemoration has indicated the need to provide co-ordination, technical support and access to existing State services and facilities.  Hence I continue to encourage the co-ordination of the activities of Dublin City Council, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and agencies and bodies associated with my own Department, with a view to developing a commemorative programme that reflects the influence of the Vikings in Ireland and the Battle of Clontarf as a defining event in our history.<\/p><p>  The site of the Battle of Clontarf is known to have been on the banks of the river Tolka in Dublin, closer to Glasnevin than to modern-day Clontarf.  Glasnevin Trust has maps from circa 1800 that suggest that the 'bloody acre' &ndash; the historic centre of the battle &ndash; are within what is now its land.  Cognisant of the potential of these events to be of wide tourist interest, I continue to encourage the co-ordination of organisations in Waterford, Killaloe and Ballina in emphasising their Viking Heritage and links to Brian Bor&uacute;, as well as with Dublin City Council and groups from Clontarf, to maximise the potential benefit to these areas from increased tourism. <\/p><p>  I envisage that the national cultural institutions will play an important role in any commemorative arrangements, especially the National Museum of Ireland.  In that context, I understand that the National Museum intends to hold a major exhibition on Brian Bor&uacute; and the Battle of Clontarf in 2014.  It is expected that the exhibition will have an international focus with loans from institutions across Europe.  The exhibition will not only present Ireland and Europe in the later Viking Age, but also examine the continuing significance of Brian Bor&uacute; and Clontarf in Irish folklore and popular imagination right up to modern times.<\/p><p>  In addition to possible initiatives by the national cultural institutions, my Department will be consulting with local authorities and other interested parties on their intentions with a view to the development of a co-ordinated programme.  A number of issues are under consideration, including the development of a framework of events and the production of a branding pack or emblem. Decisions on these elements will fall to be made in the coming weeks, having regard to available resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200055#WRC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Imeachta&iacute; Com&oacute;raidh","counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200055#WRC01950"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[44226\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200055#WRC02000","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"c&eacute;n dul chun cinn at&aacute; d&eacute;anta maidir le maoini&uacute; a shol&aacute;thar chun ionad oidhreachta a th&oacute;g&aacute;il ag Teach an Phiarsaigh in am do chom&oacute;radh 100 bliain &Eacute;ir&iacute; Amach na C&aacute;sca.","asker":"1008","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":126,"content":"<p>Faoin bpac&aacute;iste spreagtha caipitil de chuid an Rialtais a f&oacute;gra&iacute;odh sa ch&aacute;inaisn&eacute;is, t&aacute; maoini&uacute; de &euro;6m curtha ar f&aacute;il don bhliain 2014 do Chl&aacute;r Cuimhneach&aacute;in 1916.

As the Deputy is aware, primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland, in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions, is a matter for the Irish Film Board (IFB).  The IFB is the statutorily independent agency responsible for the promotion and development of the Irish film industry and I have no responsibility in relation to its day-to-day operational matters, including the allocation of resources to different support programmes and schemes.  The IFB has been allocated &euro;14.037m in 2014 to carry out its functions. <\/p><p>  In regard to the number of films made with support by the IFB, I would direct the Deputy's attention to the annual reports of the IFB, which are lodged periodically in the Oireachtas Library, and also to the publications by the IFB itself on its website .  It is difficult to predict with certainty the number of films that will be made in the future.  However, consultations between my Department, the IFB and the Department of Finance has resulted in a number of changes to Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 (Film Tax Relief Scheme) to ensure that Ireland retains or regains competitiveness in attracting foreign film projects to Ireland. <\/p><p>  The scheme was extended to the end of 2020 in the 2013 Finance Act and further changes were announced last week by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech.  The budget announcement brings forward the new regime for film tax reliefs to 2015, and also extend the definition of 'eligible individual' in the scheme for film relief to include non-EU talent.  This will increase the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for film investment and allow the audiovisual production sector to maintain existing jobs and hopefully create new ones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200055#WRC03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Architectural Heritage","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200055#WRC03350"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[44244\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200055#WRC03400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the current condition of Vernon Mount House in Cork city; the actions that have been taken to ensure its protection as a building of significant heritage value; if he has any plans to ensure that the house can be accessed by the public; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Last week's Budget demonstrated that we have broadly stabilised the funding for overseas development assistance despite the very difficult economic circumstances.  This will enable Ireland to maintain our leading role in contributing to the fight against extreme poverty and hunger in the world, in policy terms and through the achievements on the ground of our internationally recognised aid programme.  For 2014, the Government is providing some &euro;600 million for Official Development Assistance (ODA).  This will represent a small reduction on spending in 2013.  Detailed financial allocations across the aid programme for 2014 will be finalised over the coming months.  I am confident the small reduction on the 2013 allocation can be managed in a way which will not affect our central priorities and core programmes.<\/p><p>  The Government's new policy on International Development, 'One World, One Future', focuses sharply on the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa and on three goals:  reducing hunger, building sustainable growth and good governance.  It provides a clear framework for the prioritisation of activities and the allocation of resources to maximise impact, strengthen accountability and demonstrate value for money over the coming years.

Two countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, are in the pre-accession phase.  Ireland is a strong supporter of EU enlargement and we believe it remains one of the EU's most successful policies, fostering peace, stability and prosperity in our neighbouring regions.  We support the efforts of those who have made applications to join the EU and encourage them to fulfil the necessary conditions for membership, in particular the Copenhagen criteria (democracy, the rule of law, respect for fundamental rights and a functioning market economy) as well as the conditions of the Stabilisation and Association Process.<\/p><p>  In terms of the progress of each country, the European Commission has recently published its annual Enlargement progress reports.  Accession negotiations with Turkey, stalled for some time, were reinvigorated under Ireland's EU Presidency earlier this year and agreement was reached to open a new chapter in the negotiations.  While the handling of the Gezi Park protests raised concerns, it is clear that the EU has a key role to play as an anchor for reform in Turkey through its continued engagement in the accession process. <\/p><p>  Montenegro has seen progress on its path towards EU membership, following the launch of accession negotiations last year.  First steps have been completed and two chapters (science and research; education and culture) have been closed.  The focus is now on opening two key areas in the negotiations: judiciary and fundamental rights, and justice, freedom and security. <\/p><p>  This past year has seen real progress by both Serbia and Kosovo on their respective European paths.  In June, there was agreement to open accession negotiations with Serbia by January of next year at the latest and the agreement to open negotiations with Kosovo on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, aimed at bringing it closer to eventual membership of the EU.<\/p><p>  The European Commission has recently recommended, for the fifth time, that accession negotiations be opened with Macedonia (which has already been granted candidate status) but it remains to be seen if Member States will agree to do so.  The European Commission has also recommended that Albania be granted candidate status, following positive developments, such as cross-party support for key reforms and further steps in the fight against corruption and organised crime.  It will now be for EU Member States to assess if sufficient progress has been made to grant candidate status. <\/p><p>  In Bosnia and Herzegovina, a lack of political will to implement reforms is hampering the country's EU progress.  Bosnia and Herzegovina have negotiated a Stabilisation and Association agreement with the EU, but this has not yet entered into force.  Finally, there has been no recent progress by Iceland following the decision of the Icelandic government to put its accession negotiations with the EU on hold.  Given the varying pace of progress in each country and the conditions-based nature of the EU accession process, it is not possible to predict when each country will accede to the Union. <\/p><p>  The redistribution of seats in the European Parliament in advance of the 2014 elections, which resulted in the loss of a seat for Ireland, was necessary to take account of the recent accession of Croatia and to keep the overall number of MEP seats within the maximum of 751 seats set down in Article 14 of the Treaty.  The decision of the European Council applies for the 2014-2019 term only and will be revised on the basis of an initiative to be presented by the European Parliament before the end of 2016.  Ireland's position is that we would have significant concerns if future seat re-distributions continued to be only at the expense of small and medium-sized Member States, as was the case on this occasion.<\/p><p>  Building on the success of the Irish Presidency of the Council, the Government is committed to maintaining a high level of engagement with the European Parliament, including regular presence by Irish Ministers at plenary sessions in Strasbourg for meetings with a wide range of MEPs and our own MEPs.  This enhanced level of engagement aims to ensure that Ireland's national interests are represented and communicated to the key decision-makers in the Parliament, and this will include promoting our interest in a fair representation for Ireland when current seat allocations are reviewed again following the election of the new Parliament in May 2014 and in the context of any further enlargement of the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200056#WRD02000","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200056#WRD02050"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[44747\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200056#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will provide the full-year effect of all expenditure reductions for his Department as set out in the Expenditure Report 2014, as provided for in the Expenditure Report 2013.

Their &quot;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013)&quot; includes a wide range of measures that are designed to identify and target those engaged in the supply or sale of illicit tobacco products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible.  This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, the use of analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and within the country.<\/p><p>Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.

","asker":"992","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":236,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Form IT 38 is the statutory return on which beneficiaries declare any gifts or inheritances they receive for Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) purposes and it is assumed that this is the tax to which the Deputy is referring.  Chargeable gains for Capital Gains Tax purposes, on the other hand, may be returned on the Form CG1 or Form 11.   Depending on the circumstances of the case, CAT can be a complex tax.  The Commissioners advise me that there is a short form of IT 38 which may be submitted on line or in paper form, and this is used in the simpler straightforward cases for example where no relief\/exemption\/credit is claimed, apart from the small gift exemption or where the property included in the return was taken from only one disponer and is not part of a larger benefit or series of benefits. <\/p><p>  On the other hand where the circumstances of the gift or inheritance taken by a beneficiary are complicated by factors such as them claiming the more complex reliefs from CAT or, where the benefit they are taking is not an absolute interest, taxpayers are obliged to complete the long version of the Form IT 38 that must be filed online through the Revenue Online Service (ROS).  Because of the complexity, it is the Commissioners' experience that these type of cases are generally handled by a solicitor or tax practitioner and in these circumstances filing online should not present any difficulty.<\/p><p>  In line with the Government's policy on e-Government and e-payments, Revenue's stated strategic objective is to establish the use of electronic channels as the normal way of providing services to taxpayers and this, it seems to me, is a reasonable approach.  Filing and paying taxes online is easier, more accurate, more efficient and taxpayers get more time to file.  <\/p><p>A<b><\/b>  taxpayer who is not using an agent such as a solicitor to handle the relevant gifts or inheritances and wishes to file the long form IT Form IT 38 themselves, will, I am advised find it much easier to do so on line than on paper.  The design of ROS ensures that the online form is simpler and quicker to complete. As information is entered, the system progressively customises the screens that have to be completed, thus minimising the number of screens and options presented.  In addition, ROS holds up-to-date rates of tax, indexed group threshold amounts and other key data that ensure the correct tax due is automatically calculated once certain details are input by the taxpayer.  Calculating the CAT liability on paper returns is significantly more difficult for taxpayers than using ROS as they have to enter the figures on the Return form and compute the liability themselves.<\/p><p>  In addition, using the online IT 38 Return results in speedier processing by the Revenue Commissioners which in turn, in the case of inheritances, ensures that the administration of Estates are quicker, more efficient and less costly for the Estate and the ultimate beneficiaries.<\/p><p>  The Deputy refers to people who may not be ROS registered or have no computer access. Registration can be arranged in such cases, and there is a dedicated ROS Helpdesk available at tel:1890201106. In the unlikely circumstances of a more complex case not being handled by a solicitor, the taxpayer can make a case to Revenue to be excluded from their obligation to pay and file electronically if Revenue is satisfied that the taxpayer does not have the capacity to do so.  A person who considers that he\/she may qualify for an exclusion should apply in writing to the local Revenue district.<\/p><p>  For this purpose, &#8220;capacity&#8221; means sufficient access to the Internet and, in the case of an individual, also means not prevented by reason of age, or mental or physical infirmity from making a specified return or paying any specified liabilities by electronic means.  Where Revenue does not approve a request for exclusion, the taxpayer has a right to make a formal appeal to the Appeal Commissioners.<\/p><p>  Finally, while the long form IT 38 must be filed electronically, the Revenue Commissioners confirm that taxpayers can pay their CAT liabilities either electronically through ROS or alternatively directly to the Collector General by cheque, for example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200057#WRE02900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Agreements","counter":237,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200057#WRE02950"},{"type":"question","counter":238,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[44443\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200057#WRE03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position regarding the proposed Ireland-Taiwan Double Taxation Agreement.

AMRFs are part of the Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) regime introduced in 1999.  The ARF regime gives a considerable degree of control, flexibility and personal choice to individuals in Defined Contribution pension arrangements in relation to the drawing down of benefits from their pension plans.  These choices include the options to purchase an annuity, to receive the balance of the pension fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate), to invest in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), subject to certain conditions. <\/p><p>  Under the regime, the options to:<\/p><p>  - invest in an ARF, or<\/p><p>  - receive the balance of the pension fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate)<\/p><p>  are subject to conditions.  The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed level of pension income (specified income) actually in payment for life at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option is exercised. Finance Act 2011 increased the guaranteed level of pension income required from the previous fixed amount of &euro;12,700 introduced in 1999, to a variable amount equal to 1.5 times the maximum annual rate of the State Pension (Contributory) bringing the &ldquo;specified income&rdquo; requirement to &euro;18,000 per annum. In Finance Act 2013, I rescinded this increase and reinstated the original lower specified income requirement of &euro;12,700 on the grounds that the Finance Act 2011 change did not provide for adequate transitional arrangements to allow individuals to adjust to the increased pension income requirement. <\/p><p>  Where the specified income requirement of &euro;12,700 per annum is met by an AMRF owner at any time after retirement and before age 75, the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF with full access to the funds, subject to taxation as appropriate.

Where late or non-compliance occurs, Revenue will always try to resolve the issues through engagement with the business or taxpayer in advance of deploying enforcement sanctions.

Their debt collection activities, including seizure procedures, are generally covered by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, (as amended) and the execution of Revenue warrants by Sheriffs is specifically provided for in Section 962 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, (as amended).

For this reason Revenue does not collate specific data on seizures and is not in a position to provide the tabular data requested by the Deputy.<\/p><p>  However, I am advised that Revenue understands that Sheriffs only undertake seizures in a very small minority of cases and only after the defaulting taxpayer has not engaged with requests for payment.  Finally Revenue has informed me that the Sheriffs operate a Code of Practice in relation to their tax collection enforcement activities.  The Code includes a complaints procedure that assists taxpayers in resolving disputes with Sheriffs without the necessity of initiating Court proceedings.  The Code is not a substitution for a persons legal entitlement and its use does not prevent a person from applying to the Courts should they subsequently feel it is necessary to do so.<\/p><p>  A copy of the Code is attached for the Deputy's information.<\/p><p><b><i>Sheriff's Code of Practice <\/i><\/b><\/p><p>  The following is the Code of Practice operated by the Sheriff's Office in relation to dealings with taxpayers: <\/p><p><b>1. The Sheriff will:<\/b><\/p><p>  - Treat every taxpayer with courtesy;<\/p><p>  - Where practicable, notify the taxpayer in writing of the lodgement of a certificate in the Sheriff's Office;<\/p><p>  - Where requested, explain to the taxpayer the purpose of the visit of the Sheriff, Bailiff or other staff;<\/p><p>  - When goods are seized, issue as soon as possible, a written inventory to the taxpayer;<\/p><p>  - Furnish the taxpayer with a receipt for monies paid;<\/p><p>  - Furnish the taxpayer with an account of the proceeds of the sale of any goods seized.<\/p><p><b>2. In return the Sheriff expects that the Taxpayer will:<\/b><\/p><p>  - Pay liabilities to the Sheriff on demand;<\/p><p>  - Be prompt in his\/her dealings with the Sheriff's office;<\/p><p>  - Treat the Sheriff and his staff with courtesy. <\/p><p><b>3.

The Revenue Commissioners will examine any such complaint and may request that the Sheriff undertake a review.<\/p><p>  - Should the taxpayer remain aggrieved at the outcome of the Sheriff's review, the complaint may at his\/her request be referred to the Joint Standing Committee (JSC) of the Revenue Commissioners and the Sheriffs' Association. The JSC will review the issue(s)by means of an examination of all the relevant correspondence and documentation.

Accordingly, combating the illegal tobacco trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for them.  Revenue&rsquo;s &ldquo;Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013)&rdquo; includes a wide range of measure that are designed to identify and target those engaged in the supply or sale of illicit tobacco products, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible.  This multi-faceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and third country basis, ongoing review of operational policies, the use of analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring the optimum deployment of resources at both point of importation and within the country.<\/p><p>  Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also carry out regular multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to large maritime importations and in checks at inland markets.<\/p><p>  There is extensive cooperation between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade.  In addition, the relevant agencies in the State work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, including Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs and the PSNI, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.<\/p><p>  I am assured by the Revenue Commissioners that they are committed to maintaining their extensive programme of action against all stages of the supply chain for illicit tobacco products, and that they will continue to make every effort to ensure that those involved in the illicit trade are brought to account before the Courts for their criminal activities.  Determining the scale of any illegal activity, and the tax loss that it causes, is problematic, and estimates of such loss need to be approached with caution.  Surveys on the incidence of the consumption of illicit cigarettes carried out in 2011 and 2012, for the Revenue Commissioners and the Health Services Executive, indicate losses of the order of &euro;258 million and &euro;240 million, in Tobacco Products Tax and VAT, in those years.  A similar survey will be undertaken shortly and it is anticipated that the results will be available in the first quarter of next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200058#WRF00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU VAT Rules","counter":262,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200058#WRF00750"},{"type":"question","counter":263,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[44641\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200058#WRF00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a transition period until 2018 will apply for companies that currently pay VAT in the UK and other jurisdictions under EU VAT rules on the cross border supply of services to private individuals and business customers that expire in 2015; the basis for the transition period; and the expected increase in VAT receipts to the Exchequer following the expiry of the EU VAT rules.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":264,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that at present the place of supply of telecommunications services, broadcasting services or electronic services to private individuals is the place where the supplier is established.  From 2015, the supply of these services to private individuals will be taxed by reference to where the customers are located.  The supplier would normally be obliged to register and pay VAT in all the Member States of their customers but, in order to reduce costs for business, a Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) will be introduced that offers an alternative simplified process for charging and remitting VAT to the appropriate Member States.  Under this regime, a supplier who has a place of supply or a fixed establishment in, say, Ireland, may register for VAT in Ireland and use the MOSS system to make a single return setting out his or her supplies to private individuals in other Member States.  There is no transitional period for businesses involved in these supplies; the new legislation will apply from 1st January 2015.  Member States will be allowed to retain a percentage of the VAT payments made through their MOSS system during the period 2015 &ndash; 2018.

It is not possible to estimate the additional VAT revenues that will be collected in the State on the basis of the new regime.  However, as the new regime will eliminate the existing incentive for businesses engaged in these supplies to establish in Member States with lower VAT rates, the effect is likely to be positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200058#WRF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":265,"content":"<p>Question No. 150 answered with Question No. 134.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living City Initiative","counter":266,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200058#WRF01050"},{"type":"question","counter":267,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[44645\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200058#WRF01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"in relation to the Living City Initiative introduced in the Budget 2013 initially covering Limerick and Waterford cities, the uptake of this initiative since it was launched; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Firstly, the NTMA Budget debt service estimate for 2014 is lower than the corresponding April SPU estimate, of the order &euro;0.2bn, due to an improvement in the interest rate environment generally and lower than previously planned bond issuance.  Turning to the Central Bank income, during the summer, the Central Bank provided an estimate of the 2013 surplus income to be paid to the Central Fund in 2014 based on results to that date and projections for the remainder of the year.  The Central Bank revised this estimate upwards by &euro;0.1bn in September, in light of actual results for the first nine months and the consequent revisions or projections for the remaining three months of 2013.  In terms of savings from the Live Register, the numbers in work rose by 33,800 in the year to the second quarter of 2013 and the Live Register at the end of quarter 3 2013 was down by just over 20,000 when compared to the same period last year.  On foot of this recovering labour market, live register savings have exceeded those previously expected or the order &euro;0.15bn.  Finally, the remaining &euro;0.15bn arises from a number of other factors mainly connected with state asset transactions.<\/p><p>Complementing tax and expenditure measures with additional resources and other savings, some of which may be once off, is consistent with the composition of previous adjustments published in the National Recovery Plan \/ Budget 2011 and the contribution of additional dividends outlined in Budget 2013.  All of the &euro;3.1bn adjustment announced in Budget 2014, as set out in the table above, will impact the general government deficit for 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200058#WRF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200058#WRF01850"},{"type":"question","counter":278,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[44691\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200058#WRF01900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide in tabular form the annual increases in the retail price of the most popular price category of 20 filter tipped cigarettes since 2007; to include the pre budget retail price; the budget tax increase; the trade increase and the tax element of the trade increase; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":279,"content":"<p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the annual increases in the retail price of the most popular price category of 20 filter tipped cigarettes since 2007, together with the requested breakdown, are shown in the table.

As I announced in my Budget 2014 speech last week, the changes I am introducing to deliver on the commitment I made in Budget 2013 in the supplementary pensions area involve a reduction from 1 January 2014 in the value of the maximum allowable pension fund at retirement for tax purposes (the Standard Fund Threshold &ndash; SFT) from &euro;2.3 million to &euro;2 million and an increase from the current single factor of 20 used to value Defined Benefit pensions for SFT purposes to a range of higher factors varying with the age at which the pension is drawn down.  This latter change will place a higher capital value for SFT purposes on Defined Benefit pension entitlements accrued after 1 January 2014 and drawn down at retirement.  The use of a range of capitalisation factors will improve the equity of the SFT regime as between Defined Contribution and Defined Benefit pension arrangements and between those retiring at earlier ages and those retiring at older ages.<\/p><p>  The yield from the changes being made to the SFT regime is estimated at &euro;120 million in 2014 and in a full year.  It is not possible to differentiate the estimated yield between the impact of the reduced SFT and the change to the valuation factors.<\/p><p>  In line with legal advices, the changes to the SFT and the use of higher valuation factors will apply prospectively from 1 January 2014.  Members of pension schemes and individuals with pension savings whose pension entitlements or savings have a value on 1 January 2014 above the reduced SFT of &euro;2 million and up to the value of the current SFT of &euro;2.3 million may (as on the occasions when the SFT was first introduced and subsequently reduced) protect the capital value of those rights by submitting a claim for a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) to the Revenue Commissioners.  Revised arrangements for making a PFT notification to Revenue are being provided for in the forthcoming Finance Bill. Pension rights arising under Defined Benefit arrangements have to be valued on 1 January 2014 for PFT purposes using the current standard valuation factor of 20.  In the case of rights arising under Defined Contribution arrangements, the capital value for PFT purposes remains, as before, the value of the assets in the arrangement that represent the member&rsquo;s accumulated rights on that date i.e. the value of the fund on that date.<\/p><p>  The valuation factor to be used for establishing the capital value of an individual&rsquo;s Defined Benefit pension rights at the point of retirement, where this takes place after 1 January 2014, is being changed from the current standard factor of 20 to a higher age&ndash;related factor that will vary with the individual&rsquo;s age at the point at which the pension rights are drawn down.  The age&ndash;related factors are set out in a table on page B.24 of the Budget booklet and range from 37 for Defined Benefit pension rights drawn down at age 50 or under, to a factor of 22 where they are drawn down at age 70 or over.  Full details of the changes being introduced will be included in the Finance Bill which is being published on 24 October.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200058#WRF03000","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":294,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200058#WRF03050"},{"type":"question","counter":295,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[44746\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200058#WRF03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide the full year effect of all expenditure reductions for his Department as set out in the Expenditure Report 2014 as was provided for in the Expenditure Report 2013.","asker":"1008","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":296,"content":"<p>The Department of Finance&rsquo;s budget and staffing allocation reflects ongoing ambitious objectives and goals, across a broad spectrum of economic, fiscal, financial and international policies, set out in its Statement of Strategy.

This includes provision for 10,575 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for allocation in the 2013\/14 school year.  The Deputy will be aware that the previous Government, as part of the Programme for National Recovery, introduced a cap on the number of Special Needs Assistants.  This figure was set at 10,575 posts and has remained in place since the 2011\/12 school year. <\/p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports including Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support, to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  The NCSE has notified schools of their SNA allocation for 2013\/14, based on the number of valid applications received and the extent of the care needs of qualifying children. <\/p><p>  It is important to note that the level of SNAs required to support children with special educational needs changes from year to year in line with the enrolment of different children with different care needs.  The care needs of individual children can also change from year to year.  The NCSE takes these factors into account when allocating SNAs to schools.  To date the NCSE has allocated 10,490 WTE SNA posts to schools.  Every child who meets the criteria for access to SNA support in the current school year is in receipt of this support.  The remaining 85 posts are available for allocation throughout the school year for new assessments of disability, new entrants, or emergency or late applications, in accordance with the terms of the SNA scheme.  Based on discussions with the NCSE, it may be the case that additional SNA posts above the figure of 10,575, may be required to respond to need for the current school year.  This issue will be dealt with if and when it arises.  The NCSE is still processing SNA applications for the current school year.<\/p><p>  Schools can contact the NCSE if they have enrolled children who were not considered at the time that the SNA allocations were made, or where they are seeking a revision to the quantum of SNA support which has been allocated to them for the current school year.  In general, a revision to SNA allocations will only be made in circumstances where schools have enrolled new pupils, or where schools can demonstrate that they do not have sufficient SNA posts to cater for the care needs of all of the qualifying children in their school. <\/p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Provision","counter":313,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRG00750"},{"type":"question","counter":314,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[44896\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 1695, 1696 and 1697 of 18 September 2013 regarding the school transport scheme, the reason for the statement that the scheme operates on a cost recovery basis and Bus &Eacute;ireann does not make a profit in the scheme in any commercial sense; if he is implying that Bus &Eacute;ireann makes non-commercial profits of some kind on the scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

They include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.<\/p><p>  Under the new procedures for schools, it is made clear that the primary aim in investigating and dealing with bullying is to resolve any issues and to restore, as far as is practicable, the relationships of the parties involved rather than an approach based on apportioning  blame.

The procedures provide that in determining whether a bullying case has been adequately and appropriately addressed the relevant teacher must, as part of his\/her professional judgement take the following factors into account::<blockquote>- Whether the bullying behaviour has ceased;<br \/><br \/>- Whether any issues between the parties have been resolved as far as is practicable;<br \/><br \/>- Whether the relationships between the parties have been restored as far as is practicable; and<br \/><br \/>- Any feedback received from the parties involved, their parents or the school Principal or Deputy Principal<\/blockquote>  Importantly, these procedures have been developed with the input and consensus of the relevant education partners and thereby give a real opportunity to reinvigorate and strengthen our approach to preventing and tackling bullying in schools.  Bullying can have a devastating effect on our children and young people and the publication of these procedures is one more step towards putting an end to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRG02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":340,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRG02550"},{"type":"question","counter":341,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[44219\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRG02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to an overcrowding issue in a school (details supplied) in County Tipperary; the steps being taken by his Department to tackle this issue; if he will provide an update on the status of an application for funding for a new building submitted by this school; if he will provide assurance that funding will be provided to assist this school; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1015","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":356,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 183 together.<\/p><p>  Firstly, I would point out that the allocation of SNA resources is not a matter for this Department but is instead an independent function carried out by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), who are responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports including resource teaching and SNA support as well as the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required.  The number of SNAs employed in a school depends on the allocation given to the school by the NCSE, based on its assessment of the special educational needs of pupils in the school.  If you require further information regarding the allocation of SNA resources to schools then your query should more appropriately be directed to the NCSE.<\/p><p>  In relation to your question regarding working hours for SNAs the position regarding the working hours of full-time SNAs is as outlined in the standard SNA contract of employment, which was agreed by this Department, the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) representing SNAs and the Management Bodies in 2005.  In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools.  No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc.  These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. <\/p><p>  In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total.  Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.  These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and\/or the normal school year.  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment.  Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, the issue of appropriate working hours for all public servants was one of the key aspects of the set of proposals for a public service agreement which were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission and which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement).  The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:<\/p><p>&quot;Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant.  Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited.  Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions.<\/p><p>  These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013\/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT\/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers.  This will constitute the liability on Special Needs Assistants in respect of working hours for the purposes of this extension to the Public Service Agreement.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Policy","counter":357,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRH00450"},{"type":"question","counter":358,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[44360\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRH00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a clear definition exists to describe the role and responsibilities of special needs assistants; if this definition is clearly articulated to principals, teachers, parents and SNAs; how SNA support is managed within schools in order to ensure the best possible support and outcomes for students; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

SNAs are allocated to schools in order to provide for the care needs of children with special educational needs attending such schools.  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. <\/p><p>  The policy of my Department in relation to the SNA scheme is set out in Circular 07\/02, which also provides details regarding the role and duties of an SNA.  Circular 071\/2011 provides additional details in respect of the duties of an SNA and makes clear the fact that SNA duties are assigned at the discretion of the Principal.  I can also advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has also published an Information Booklet for Parents in relation to Children with Special Educational Needs, which provides information for parents in relation to the SNA scheme.<\/p><p>  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support each year.  The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <\/p><p>  My Department has also published a Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Analysis Review of the Special Needs Assistant scheme.  This review is available on my Department's website: www.education.gov.ie.  The Review has shown that the SNA Scheme has been successful in supporting schools in meeting the needs of students with disabilities who also have significant care needs.  However, the review also found that the allocation process and the purpose of the scheme is not always fully understood.<\/p><p>  The review recommended that the SNA scheme should be restated to ensure an efficient allocation of SNA resources and to clarify the 'care' nature of the SNA role for parents, schools and professionals.  The National Council for Special Education recently published its report on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools, which also recommended that my Department should clarify the role of the SNA, as recommended in the VFM report.  It is my intention that a new Circular will be issued to schools in the near future which will provide further clarification for schools and parents with regard to the role of the SNA and the purpose of the SNA scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRH00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Education","counter":360,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRH00650"},{"type":"question","counter":361,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[44363\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRH00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the different educational programmes currently operating within the primary and secondary systems which are focused on educating children on the dangers of smoking; if he will provide a breakdown of the number of hours of such training that students receive throughout their educational careers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":362,"content":"<p>Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is currently a compulsory subject in primary schools and at Junior Cycle in post primary schools.  The SPHE curricula aim to foster self-worth, self -confidence and respectful relationships and place a particular emphasis on developing a sense of personal responsibility for one's own behaviour, feelings and actions.<\/p><p>  The issue of smoking is addressed in the 'Personal Safety' strand of SPHE, in the context of equipping students with the skills to recognise and withstand inappropriate peer pressure and to identify the dangers of substance abuse.  For example, SPHE students at Junior Cycle explore the health and social implications of smoking and identify some of the reasons why young people smoke.  Students are also helped to identify ways in which smoking can be avoided. Enabling students to make informed decisions and choices is an inherent aim in the teaching and learning within SPHE.  SPHE is delivered for 30 minutes per week at primary level, and for approximately 66 hours during the three years of junior cycle.  The approach to SPHE is changing at Junior Cycle.  As part of the reform of the Junior Cycle that was announced by the Minister of Education and Skills in October 2012, the key objectives of SPHE are now reflected in a number of 'Principles', 'Statements of Learning', and skills that underpin the new Junior Cycle Framework. <\/p><p>  As part of the new 'Well-being' principle, the student experience will &quot;contribute to their physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing and resilience.

Together the development of these skills will enable pupils to address the challenges they face and adapt their skills to different contexts, leading to their positive well-being.<\/p><p>  As part of the new Junior Cycle Framework, the NCCA is currently developing a new short course in SPHE.

This short course is currently open for public consultation.  The consultation process will close at the end of November.  The new short course will be available to schools from September 2014.

This policy advice is available at www.ncse.ie.  This publication provides details of the disabilities which qualify for low-incidence resource hours and also details the approximate number of number of students for whom low incidence resource teaching hours were allocated to schools for the academic year 2012-13.  This report details the allocation for resource teaching hours by disability category, and shows that there were 1,110 pupils in mainstream education in receipt of low incidence resource hours with a disability categorisation of Deafness\/hearing impairment during the 2012 - 2013 school year.  This includes 693 pupils at primary level and 417 pupils at post primary level.  There are also 16 special classes for children with hearing impairment attached to mainstream schools, with 10 special classes being attached to mainstream primary schools, and 6 special class at post-primary level. <\/p><p>  The pupil teacher ratio for special classes for children who are deaf of hard of hearing is 7-1, which equates to provision for approximately 112 children being supported in special classes in mainstream schools, though the numbers attending special classes may vary throughout the year, as pupils transition between special class and mainstream education.  In addition, the report also indicates that for the 2012\/13 school year, there were approximately 120 children enrolled in the three special schools for the deaf.  <\/p><p>  It is clear, therefore, that the majority of pupils who are deaf or hard of hearing are therefore now being educated in mainstream schools, either in mainstream classes with additional supports, or in special classes attached to mainstream schools.  Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support is provided in these schools and classes, as required.  An enhanced capitation grant is also provided to the special schools and special classes for hearing impaired pupils.  Grant-aid is also provided to schools towards the provision of special equipment for pupils who are hard of hearing, such as sound field systems and radio aids. <\/p><p>  My Department also provides funding for a weekly home tuition service whereby tutors visit the homes of deaf and hard of hearing preschool children and school-going pupils to provide training in Irish Sign Language (ISL) for these children, their siblings and parents.  In addition, the Visiting Teacher Service for Children and Young People with a Hearing Impairment is provided by my Department from the time of referral through to third level education.  The Visiting Teacher service provides advice and support to ensure that the needs of children and young people with hearing impairment are met.  This service is available at preschool, primary and post-primary levels.  Specifically, the service works in partnership with parents of preschool children with hearing impairment, visiting their homes and\/or meeting them in groups to inform, advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to their education and overall development and in helping their children to derive maximum benefit from the educational opportunities available. <\/p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise that my Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA), has established and funds a Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for ISL\/English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies. The course modules deal with issues such as sign linguistics, bilingualism and sociolinguistics of sign language. The course is delivered in seminar sessions\/group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRJ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":408,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[44698\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRJ00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of children with special needs who have been able to avail of their legal right to an individual education plan; the level of collaboration between the Health Service Executive and his Department in ensuring that children with additional needs do not miss vital eduction milestones as a result of delays in the diagnosis process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The advice of my Department's Inspectorate is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special needs.<\/p><p>  I wish to explain also that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are on the Department's website. Where a NEPS psychologist is not assigned to a school, authorities therein may access psychological assessments through SCPA. Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. <\/p><p>  The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including the allocation of resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.<\/p><p>  The responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational resources to be allocated to pupils with special educational needs resides with the NCSE through the SENO.<\/p><p>Assessment reports carried out by relevant professionals are provided by schools to the SENOs as part of the application process for support. The consideration of these reports is an integral part of determining the extent of supports to be provided for pupils with special educational needs. <\/p><p>  The NCSE circular 03\/08 clarifies the respective roles and functions of the NCSE and the HSE and their respective personnel in carrying out assessments and sanctioning resources to support children with special educational needs.  For children under the age of 5, the NCSE, through its network of SENOs, liaises with Assessment Officers in the Health Service Executive (HSE) in respect of the assessment of need process under the 2005 Disability Act, 2005.  The Assessment Officer contacts the relevant SENO when an educational need is identified as part of the assessment process. My Department's Circular 0020\/2011 further clarifies the roles of the NCSE and the HSE in relation to the assessment of need process, as well as the role of the school in this regard. This Circular is available on my Departments website at www.education.ie. <\/p><p>  I wish to advise that my Department will continue to support the co-ordinated delivery of services to families of children with special educational needs and will continue to work with service-providing partners in the health and disability sectors through the interdepartmental Cross-Sectoral Team (comprising of representatives of: the Departments of Education and Skills, Health and Children, the National Council for Special Education and the Health Service Executive), which plans for co-ordinated service delivery across the disability sector.<\/p><p>  Finally, I can advise that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools, which is available on its website www.ncse.ie.  The report recommends that under a new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in the report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  I have, as suggested by the Report, requested the NCSE to establish a Working Group to develop a proposal, for consideration, for a new model for the allocation of teaching supports for children with Special Educational Needs based on the profiled educational needs of children in schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRJ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Provision","counter":411,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRJ00650"},{"type":"question","counter":412,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[44720\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRJ00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the information or annual reports that are made to him relative to the funds allocated to Bus &Eacute;ireann to operate the school transport system; if he will confirm the amounts allocated in each of the past four years; if his Department have ever carried out a value for money audit on the scheme; if he will confirm the sums paid to Bus &Eacute;ireann for management services relative to this scheme; if the Bus &Eacute;ireann auditors have made any comment on the profitability or otherwise of the scheme; if he is satisfied that there is sufficient transparency around the scheme relative to its operation and costs and cross subsidisation of Bus &Eacute;ireann.

In this regard, Minister of State Brian Hayes worked closely with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Senator&rsquo;s private member&rsquo;s Construction Contracts Bill into a robust piece of legislation. I believe that there is considerable support both inside and outside the D&aacute;il for these reforms. The Act which is subject to a Commencement Order, to allow for the development of a comprehensive code of practice, was signed into law on the 29 July 2013.<\/p><p>  The key objective of the Construction Contracts Act is to ensure that cash flows down the supply chain on all construction contracts. This issue is addressed in the Act by providing statutory arrangements in relation to payments under construction contracts, including providing for interim payments. This will reduce the subcontractor&rsquo;s exposure to non-payment. The Bill also provides the means for subcontractors to enforce these rights; by suspending their labour and by introducing a new mechanism for the swift resolution of payment disputes through a process of adjudication. <\/p><p>  The Bill applies to contracts with an overall value &euro;10,000 or more. It is important to understand that the amount that is subject to a payment dispute can be lower than this. Therefore subcontractors will be free to refer payment disputes relating to lesser amounts to adjudication. For example if a contract with an overall value of &euro;11,000 gives rise to a payment dispute for &euro;1,000 this will come within the scope of the legislation. <\/p><p>  This is an important piece of legislation aimed at creating a more level playing field between contractor and subcontractor in the construction sector. This legislation is a priority for Government. In this regard, my officials are current working on the code of practice that will deliver a timely and cost effective adjudication procedure and to give effect to the legislation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":430,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRJ01950"},{"type":"question","counter":431,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[44427\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRJ02000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the steps that have been taken to make the former Garda station on the North Road, Finglas available to the local community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Some sites are open all year, and some are open for part of the year, mainly for the spring and summer seasons. The OPW has a number of visitor sites that have free access but do not have a guided presence and consequently, visitor numbers are not recorded at these sites. An example of such a site would be St. Stephen's Green. Similarly, visitors to some of our guided sites are only recorded if they enter the visitor centre of that site. For example, Glendalough monastic site may be accessed freely, without entering the visitor centre. <\/p><p>  Visitor numbers at guided sites, centrally recorded on the basis of returns submitted from individual heritage sites, are categorised under a number of headings and are then collated on a weekly and monthly basis, culminating in an overall annual figure. A comparison of the provisional 2013 visitor numbers up to the end of September, against the corresponding 2012 figures shows an increase in visitor numbers in the more well known sites such as Kilmainham Gaol, the Rock of Cashel, Kilkenny Castle, Clonmacnoise, Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and the National Botanic Gardens, with some notable increases in some of the OPW's lesser known sites such as Altamount Gardens, Glebe House and Gallery, Maynooth Castle, Ennis Friary, Emo Court, Casino Mario, Loughcrew, Desmond Hall, Roscrea Heritage, Listowel Castle and Scattery Island. These increases come on the back of an increase of almost 11% in visitor numbers between 2011 and 2012 in respect of all of our visitor sites. The monitoring of visitors to the OPW's heritage sites plays, and will continue to play, an important part in the development of policies and strategies relating to the heritage sector. <\/p><p>  Generally speaking, no specific promotion is required in respect of our most notable sites; visitors continue to be attracted in large numbers to such sites. One of the many challenges that faces the OPW is to entice such visitors to travel on to our lesser known sites, and indeed to increase overall visitor numbers at these sites, thereby spreading the benefits of tourism right across the country. In late July\/early August, the OPW undertook a national advertising and flyer distribution campaign to coincide with the roll out of our Facebook Heritage Ireland page; this was complimentary to the ongoing promotion of our sites. The OPW will continue in its efforts to attract more and more visitors to our heritage sites, in line with government policy, that the heritage tourism sector will be one of the main growth areas in the future economic development of this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRJ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Register Office","counter":439,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRJ02550"},{"type":"question","counter":440,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[44362\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRJ02600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding the new location for the general register research facility (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Salaries are the largest component of MFI's annual budget.  In the first full year of operations which encompass all the establishment costs the ratio of loans to administration is 2:1.  This is to be expected in a difficult start up environment and MFI expects to improve on this indicator as awareness and demand increase.  The key ratio MFI is targeting is operating costs per job created\/sustained.  At the end of the first full year this is &euro;3,420 per job.  This measure does not take account of cost avoided by the exchequer or exchequer receipts that may accrue as a result of each job.  MFI expects to drive down this indicator over time as awareness and demand increases.<\/p><p>  On foot of the Programme for Government my Department developed the Microfinance proposal, in close consultation with relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the European Investment Bank, and more detailed discussions with practitioners already in the area of Microfinancing.  A detailed analysis of other alternative delivery mechanisms was undertaken, such as: First Step, Multiple Lending Funds, Enterprise Ireland\/County Enterprise Boards and Credit Unions.  Following this analysis, it was agreed by Government that there was no alternative model which could achieve the scale of lending and containment of credit risk required to fulfil the Commitment in the Programme for Government.  As set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis published in April 2012, a single lender would (i) minimise overall management costs which are traditionally high with microenterprises, (ii) ensure a clear financial and management information reporting structure, (iii) enhance the possibility for EIF assistance and (iv) allow for a clear identification of the costs involved in operating the scheme.<\/p><p>  As of 18<sup>th<\/sup> October 2013 MFI has approved 109 applications to the value of &euro;1.674m supporting 107 microenterprises and 237 jobs.

In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance, today there are almost 400,000, an increase of 24%.  Each year almost 10,000 extra customers become eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients.<\/p><p>  The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephone services were more expensive and fewer people had telephones.

Such rates in respect of younger jobseekers were first introduced in 2009.<\/p><p>  By extending the &euro;100 jobseeker's allowance rate to ages 22, 23 and 24 the changes provide that claimants in this age bracket will be &euro;60 better off if they engage in education or training such as the back to education programme as they will then receive &euro;160 per week.  Persons aged 25, had previously been subject to no financial incentive measure, will now receive &euro;144 per week.  These individuals will generally be &euro;16 better off if they engage in education or training as they will now receive &euro;160 per week. <\/p><p>  Similarly, interns participating on JobBridge receive an allowance of &euro;50 per week on top of their existing social welfare entitlement for the period of their internship.  Arrangements provide that a claim for jobseeker's allowance is linked to any claim made within the previous 12 months, so persons returning to jobseeker's allowance following a 6 or 9 month internship will revert to the appropriate rate applying before their internship.<\/p><p>  It is anticipated that the changes will affect 13,767 persons in 2014, rising to 31,577 persons per annum over time.<\/p><p>  This decision was made on foot of on-going consideration of unemployment and incentives policy by Government. In making such decisions it is standard practice for all appropriate advice to be considered.  The changes are not discriminatory but rather are targeted measures aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.<\/p><p>  In preparation for the forthcoming implementation of the Youth Guarantee, Budget 2014 contained an additional &euro;46 million to support a number of initiatives aimed at young people. These include:- reducing the threshold (in terms of duration of unemployment) for JobsPlus eligibility from 12 months &ndash; to 6 months or less &ndash; in the case of persons aged less than 25 years;- an additional intake of 1,500 young people on to the very successful JobBridge scheme;- ensuring that 1,000 places on the T&uacute;s scheme are targeted at young people;- developing a pilot programme to support young unemployed people to take up opportunities under schemes such as Your First EURES Job; and ring-fencing a minimum of 2,000 training places for under-25s by the Department of Education and Skills, under a follow-up to the successful Momentum programme that operated in 2013, with income support for participants being provided by my Department; and furthermore the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will invest in the region of &euro;2.5m next year in making funds available to young entrepreneurs via Micro finance Ireland and other business start-up schemes.<\/p><p>  These measures are in addition to the significant existing spend of approximately &euro;170m per annum on employment, training and further education programmes for young people.<\/p><p>  I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed from a young age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRN03100","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":651,"content":"<p>Question No. 287 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Household Benefits Scheme","counter":652,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRN03250"},{"type":"question","counter":653,"qnumday":288,"qnumall":"[44651\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRN03300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if those who are currently exempt from paying the television licence fee will also be exempt from paying the public broadcasting charge; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1059","askee":"946"},{"type":"question","counter":654,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[44652\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRN03400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if her Department held discussions with RTE and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources prior to the reduction in the annual transfer to RTE in respect of the TV licence.

The initiative - the <i>Philanthropic Leverage Initiative <\/i>- was designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment of the arts from private sources.  The initiative has provided an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new funding relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts.  The initiative proved very successful with a multiplier of 4.26 in philanthropic donations being leveraged for the arts.  The arts got a boost of over &euro;1 million last year, of which less than one-fifth came from the public purse.  A full list of awards under this scheme can be viewed on my Department's website at .<\/p><p>  This year, &euro;210,000 is available to arts organisations under the Initiative.  The terms are as follows:<\/p><p> - Up to &euro;5,000 of funds can be accessed through the scheme if the organisation can match each &euro;1 from the taxpayer with &euro;2 from private sector sources;<\/p><p> - Up to &euro;10,000 if each &euro;1 from the taxpayer can be matched by &euro;3 from private sector funding;<\/p><p> - Up to &euro;15,000 if each &euro;1 from the taxpayer can be matched by &euro;4 from private sector funding.<\/p><p>  In 2013, priority was given to arts and culture organisations seeking support for projects that include an education component.  This is to support the <i>Arts in Education Charter,<\/i> which I launched in conjunction with Mr Ruairi Quinn, T.D., Minister for Education and Skills.  Accordingly, the Initiative, while continuing to provide an incentive to arts organisations to engage in fundraising, will also encourage arts and culture organisations to engage creatively with children and young people and add to their education.  In doing so, they will be helping to foster the artists and the audiences of the future.<\/p><p>  I should mention also that in October 2012 I hosted and chaired a forum on <i>Philanthropy and the Arts <\/i>in Smock Alley Theatre.  It featured speakers from key philanthropic organisations and the arts in Ireland.  The conference was very well attended and generated very positive feedback.  There is a full report of the conference on my Department's website.<\/p><p>  Parallel to these initiatives, the Arts Council is undertaking an initiative - <i>RAISE: Building Fundraising Capacity <\/i> - which dovetails with the work in my Department.  The initiative consists of a programme which is providing one-to-one professional support to selected arts organisations for two years to assist in planning and implementing a tailored fundraising programme for each organisation.  Eight leading Irish arts organisations are aiming to raise &euro;10 million in private funding over the next five years as part of this Arts Council initiative.  <\/p><p>  My Department has also provided support to Business to Arts (a not-for-profit organisation working to support resilience and transformation in the cultural sector through research, innovation and partnership) for a number of years and, in each of the last three years, this has been allocated to delivery of the New Stream Programme, which builds fundraising skills in the cultural sector in Ireland (The Bank of America Merrill Lynch investment in this project is &euro;400k over three years).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRP02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":737,"content":"<p>Question No. 322 answered with Question No. 65.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme Issues","counter":738,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRP02850"},{"type":"question","counter":739,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[44794\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRP02900","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which final agreement has been reached with traditional turf cutters displaced by EU or national conservation orders throughout the country; the extent to which he expects to be in the position to resolve issues in relation to the outstanding locations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The group from Clara Bog commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June 2012, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have now been accommodated. Turf cutting for the 2013 season took place on this site in April last.  My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from the group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog will be able to commence turf cutting in one of the relocation sites from the 2014 turf cutting season.<\/p><p>  Progress has been made with a view to the relocation of 7 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare to Timahoe North, County Kildare, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na.  My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season, provided that final agreement is reached with them.  Progress has also been made with a view to the relocation of a small group of 3 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynamona Bog and Corkip Lough special area of conservation in County Roscommon to Togher, County Roscommon, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na.  My Department envisages that this group of qualifying turf cutters will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season, provided that final agreement is reached with them.<\/p><p>  I am advised that of the remaining 49 raised bog special areas of conservation, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 32 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites.  Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number that had been cutting turf on these sites during the relevant five year period and would qualify for the relocation option available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.<\/p><p>  Relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure\/drainage works required, establishing the number that can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements.  In that regard, Bord na M&oacute;na has assessed in the region of 70 potential relocation sites at the request of my Department.  Bord na M&oacute;na has also commenced negotiations with landowners in relation to the purchase or long-term lease of sites.<\/p><p>  There are 2 raised bog special areas of conservation in County Kildare affected by the cessation of turf cutting - Ballynafagh Bog and Mouds Bog.  58 applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme have been received and acknowledged by my Department in respect of Ballynafagh Bog and 106 applications have been received and acknowledged by my Department in respect of Mouds Bog.  28 and 40 of these groups of applicants, respectively, have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog.  61 payments and 12 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of the applications received from Ballynafagh Bog and 105 payments and 65 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of the applications received from Mouds Bog.<\/p><p>  Lattins Bog, also known as Mouds North Bog, in County Kildare has been identified as a potential relocation site for turf cutters from Mouds Bog.  Bord na M&oacute;na had produced a preliminary suitability assessment report and stratigraphy assessment report for the relocation site.  It has now undertaken a full suitability assessment for the site and my Department has provided a copy of the assessment report to the Secretary of the Committee of the Kildare Turf Cutters Association.<\/p><p>  There are also 2 natural heritage area raised bogs in County Kildare designated under national law in accordance with the provisions of the Wildlife Acts - Carbury Bog and Hodgestown Bog.  In May 2010, the previous Government decided that turf cutting should come to an end on all raised bog natural heritage areas at the end of 2013.  However, as set out in the Programme for Government, the current Government undertook to review the situation with regard to raised bog natural heritage areas.<\/p><p>  This review is currently underway and the future of turf cutting on such sites is being considered as part of that review.  It is my intention that the review will provide clarity for turf cutters and landowners in advance of the 2014 turf cutting season and my Department will be contacting individual landowners and turf cutters on these sites in due course.<\/p><p>  A payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum is available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to applicants while awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs. <\/p><p>  Following the D&aacute;il motion of 7 March 2012, which called on the Government to &#8220;engage actively with the European Commission to seek a resolution within the terms of the Habitats Directive, and to prepare and submit a National Raised Bog Restoration Plan to the Commission as a matter of urgency&#8221;, I secured the agreement of the European Commissioner for the Environment for the development of a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, in keeping with the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke.  The approach of the national plan may unlock some flexibility, within the terms of the EU Habitats Directive, in regard to the most difficult of sites, where relocation options are limited.<\/p><p>  To progress the preparation of the plan, my Department engaged a team of specialists (RPS) to provide the scientific basis for raised bog conservation in Ireland.  RPS has been working with my Department and the Peatlands Council to prepare a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, a draft of which I hope to make available for consultation before the end of the year.  Further information on the work of RPS can be found at .<\/p><p>  The clear majority of domestic turf-cutters on the raised bog special areas of conservation are now engaging with my Department in finding acceptable solutions within the law.  The door is still open for others to engage in this process with me, my Department and with other stakeholders to address the needs of turf cutters and other interested parties.  Such engagement would, I am sure, help to address the needs of turf cutters more speedily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRP03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":742,"content":"<p>Question No. 324 answered with Question No. 107.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":743,"content":"<p>Question No. 325 answered with Question No. 323.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Funding","counter":745,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRQ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":746,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[44797\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRQ00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which his Department or bodies under his aegis have financially supported directly or indirectly various bodies of an artistic or cultural nature in County Kildare in each of the past four years to date; his expectations in this regard for the current and future years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":747,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[44799\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRQ00300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"in relation to an examination of applications for grant aid from local community based musical or theatrical groups, if the existence of some such groups who have never received such assistance has come to attention; if any evaluation will be done with a view to addressing such issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":748,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[44800\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRQ00400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"on the examination of applications for grant aid from local community based musical or theatrical groups in County Kildare, if the existence of some such groups who have never received such assistance has come to attention; if any evaluation will be done with a view to addressing such issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":749,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 326, 328 and 329 together.<\/p><p>  The Government's policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, to increase access to and participation in the arts, and to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.

I am advised that TDI is a renowned and widely respected professional consultancy company with a global presence. TDI have been commissioned internationally by such clients as the United Nations, the European Union, the World Bank, the World Tourism Organisation, the Irish American Cultural Institute and a range of multinational companies. Government Departments and Agencies from EU Member States and from countries worldwide have also engaged TDI for expert advice and analysis.  In Ireland, TDI has carried out work for the Marine Institute, Failte Ireland, Udaras na Gaeltacht as well as a host of Local Authorities and regional organisations.

I am advised that the results in this report are based on sound economic principles and have been peer reviewed before publication.  IFI have confirmed that the Deputy is correct that 19,899 salmon licenses were sold in 2011. However, it is important to be cognisant of the specific question asked in the published survey, as well as the incidence of targeting multiple species.<\/p><p>  At no point does this study reference a specific monetary value for any individual species. I understand that there has been comment attributed to a UK based website on the published study.  IFI advise that having examined the figures put forward in that comment, it appears that the estimated maximum participation values for one species were erroneously mixed and inappropriately extrapolated with average spend figures for all species which unfortunately underpin a complete misunderstanding of the study&rsquo;s findings.

Direct Exchequer funding for IFI was reduced by &euro;2.582 million in 2010 compared to 2009 which is mainly attributable to savings arising from the restructuring of the inland fisheries sector. It is not possible to fully disaggregate on an item by item basis the savings which have arisen from the merger of the former regional boards; however it is clear that significant administrative savings have been made.<\/p><p>The establishment of IFI has facilitated more efficient and effective management of the inland fisheries resource. In addition, it has brought to bear a national perspective to formulating policy which is more streamlined, coherent and integrated. There is also a single allocation of funding to the organisation on a national basis. IFI are also employing new technologies, such as covert CCTV cameras, use of kayaks to conduct silent patrols along rivers and access areas which previously would have been difficult to get into unnoticed, in order to significantly augment coverage and increase time spent by officers on surveillance techniques which are more resource efficient to assist in the detection of illegal activities.<\/p><p>The Exchequer funding drawn down by IFI from my Department for 2010 (the year of IFI's establishment), 2011 and 2012 is as follows: 2010 - &euro;26.479 million; 2011 &ndash; &euro;24.971 million; 2012 &ndash; &euro;25.448 million.  The funding allocated and available for draw down in 2013 is &euro;28.062 million (including once off capital allocation of &euro;3m).  Overall, as compared with the position prior to the establishment of IFI, Exchequer funding from 2009 to 2013 has reduced by &euro;1.012 million (&euro;4.012 million if the once capital allocation of &euro;3 million in 2013 is excluded). The 2013 once-off additional capital allocation of &euro;3 million was ring-fenced for the procurement of a new Headquarters for IFI as part of a planned property rationalisation as the organisation seeks, in line with Government Policy, to exit from expensive leases. This rationalisation strategy will generate efficiencies and also savings over time in relation to lease costs and in terms of significantly better energy efficiency of the new HQ.<\/p><p>The table below details money spent on research, pay, pension, current activities and capital expenditure.

I am pleased to confirm that my Department's 2014 homeless budget will be maintained at the same level as 2013 - &euro;45 million.  While this amount represents a decrease of 3.32% on the 2012 outturn, homelessness funding from my Department has been substantially protected over the past number of years despite the wide-scale pressure for reductions in Government spending across all Departments. <\/p><p>  Earlier in 2013, I published the Government's <i>Homelessness Policy Statement<\/i> in which I outlined the Government's aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.  When I published the statement, I announced a set of indicators which will be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed.  These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland, and, in quantifying its on-going extent, will support the bringing forward of realistic and practical solutions.  I also established a high-level three-person oversight group for the purpose of reviewing the progress of the approach being advocated in the statement, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions.  The group expects to provide me with its first report shortly.   <\/p><p>  Arrangements have been put in place to provide for the delegation of homelessness funding to the lead housing authority in each of the 9 regions.  The regional approach is considered more appropriate as it helps to bring a more strategic perspective to bear on action to address homelessness, including avoidance of over-concentration of homelessness services in certain centres and promoting appropriate regional availability of services, consistent with need.  These arrangements place an emphasis on increased decision making at local level, in lieu of the existing individual project based arrangements, to improve overall efficiency and value for money, and allow greater local decision making in homeless services.  They also seek to ensure that the measures being pursued by housing authorities reflect the housing-led approach advocated in the policy statement, that actions are in place towards achieving the target of ending long-term homelessness by the end of 2016, and that evidence to support progress will be presented through the reports on the indicators. <\/p><p>  My Department is currently engaging with a number of lead housing authorities and is considering the appropriate allocation of the 2014 homeless budget so as to ensure that Section 10 homeless funding contributes to meeting the needs in the various regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee Report","counter":802,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRR00750"},{"type":"question","counter":803,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[44143\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRR00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will confirm the details of the new local election boundaries affecting a town (details supplied) in County Meath; the practical implications of this in terms of engineering and administration services to these areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":804,"content":"<p>In the Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee Report 2013 it is recommended that County Meath be divided into the six local electoral areas of Kells, Navan, Trim, Ratoath, Ashbourne and Laytown-Bettystown for the election of 40 members to the county council.

As a first step in this process, the Water Services Act 2013 provides for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, conforming to the conditions set out in the Act and registered under the Companies Acts.<\/p><p>  The Act provides that Irish Water will be required to submit an annual report on the performance of its functions each year to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Irish Water will also be required to submit its annual accounts to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government each year.  The 2013 Act also provides that the annual report and accounts will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The extension of the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act to include Irish Water is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.   <\/p><p>  Bord G&aacute;is has put in place appropriate programme management arrangements to establish Irish Water, provide for customer service and billing and the domestic water metering programme in line the overall implementation strategy.  Expenditure on this programme is a matter for Bord G&aacute;is\/Irish Water and these costs are not being funded from the Exchequer.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund has provided a bridging loan facility to Irish Water to meet the costs arising to the end of 2013.  This includes the initial stages of the domestic water metering programme, the full cost of which is &euro;539m excluding VAT. <\/p><p>  A key objective of the reform programme is to rationalise the cost of the current service delivery and ensure more efficient operation of water services by moving from 34 water services authorities to a single body; following enactment of comprehensive legislation later this year, these functions will transfer to Irish Water.  The comprehensive legislation will provide powers to the Commission for Energy Regulation to examine and approve the costs of the services provided by Irish Water.  The Commission is also to be provided with a statutory role to set standards of performance to be met by Irish Water and to, inter alia, promote the continuity, security, quality and sustainability of the services provided by Irish Water.  The Commission will be required to operate in an open and transparent manner and to carry out appropriate consultations with customers and stakeholders where appropriate as part of this process. <\/p><p>  Following transfer of the water services functions to Irish Water from 1 January 2014, a new funding model will be place to meet both capital and operational costs.\u00a0 Irish Water's costs in the coming years will be funded through a mix of revenue from the domestic and non-domestic sector, third party finance (such as\u00a0the\u00a0Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, EIB, bank lending and capital markets facilities) and State support which may be in the form of both equity and subvention.   <\/p><p>  As it has been decided, following the previous review of the Memorandum of Understanding by the European Commission, the IMF and the ECB, that domestic water charges will commence with effect from Quarter 4 2014, it is expected that Irish Water will issue the first bills to customers in Quarter 1 2015.  The Commission will engage in the necessary public consultations commencing in early 2014 on the design and level of domestic tariffs, based on the expected costs of Irish Water from 2015 onwards. <\/p><p>  The Exchequer proposes a direct equity investment of &euro;240m towards the capital funding of Irish Water in 2014.  This will support projects to be included in Irish Water's Capital Investment Plan and will ensure that the entity is in a position to take on the water services investment programmes of the 34 water services authorities, including some 80 projects currently in progress.

My Department and I have worked over the past few months to resolve these difficulties and put in place an alternative means of funding a pyrite remediation scheme.  In this context, I am very pleased, despite the necessary constraints on public expenditure at this time, to have secured Exchequer funding to support the implementation of a pyrite remediation scheme under the auspices of the Pyrite Resolution Board.

In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.<\/p><p>Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases.  In 2010 and 2012 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, reflecting the Central Bank's Codes of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, in consultation with the County and City Managers Association.  These have facilitated local authorities in providing a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty, by means of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which includes a suite of short term and long terms options depending on the circumstances of the borrower.  It is anticipated that this initiative will allow a proportion of distressed mortgagees to restructure their repayment schedules and thereby alleviate the current pressures being felt.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the flexibility shown by local authorities in dealing with borrowers in difficulty, it is inevitable that a proportion of individuals will find themselves with loans which are unsustainable in the long term, and, in these circumstances, a borrower may opt for a voluntary surrender of the property.  In other cases, and increasingly where occupiers have abandoned the property, it may be necessary to regain ownership by means of legal action.

The term \"trafficks\" is broadly defined in the 2008 Act.  For example, the commission of a trafficking offence does not require cross-border - or even internal movement - or illegal entry into the State.  It includes recruitment; taking a person into one's custody, care or charge; and providing the person with accommodation or employment.  However, the term \"forced labour\" was not defined in the 2008 Act.<\/p><p>  In the context of a review of the potential of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) (Amendment) Act 2008 to combat forced labour conducted in my Department last year, the report published on the dedicated anti-human trafficking web site, blueblindfold.gov.ie in January 2013, recommended that, in the interest of clarity, the term \"forced labour\" should be defined in legislation in line with the definition in the ILO Convention No. 29 of 1930 concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour. Subject to certain specified exceptions, the ILO convention defines forced labour as \"all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the person has not offered himself voluntarily\".  <\/p><p>  As the deputy will be aware, I availed of the opportunity afforded by the  Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) (Amendment) Act 2013 to clarify the definition of forced labour in these terms.  The ILO definition is the international standard, and the new legislation now enacted ensures that there can be no doubt as to our fully complying with that standard and our having in place rigorous criminal law sanctions applicable to all of those who engage in human trafficking for forced labour.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that forced labour covers a diverse array of exploitative behaviours ranging from infringement of labour regulations, at one end of the spectrum, to human trafficking, etc., at the other.  Consequently, it is likely that activities constituting forced labour could also be prosecuted under a number of other offences, for example, false imprisonment, blackmail, assault, the coercion offence under the Non-fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, offences under employment law and health and safety legislation, immigration law, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRT01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Districts","counter":913,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRT01350"},{"type":"question","counter":914,"qnumday":387,"qnumall":"[44118\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRT01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"in view of the fact that the Kanturk district is being amalgamated with the Mallow district, if he will confirm that the same number of garda&iacute; will be available in the Kanturk district as there was in December 2012.

The Board, which was established in 2001, makes recommendations to the Minister in relation to the management of offenders serving long sentences.  While it is open to the Parole Board to make any recommendation, the experience with the Parole Board is that life sentenced prisoners are normally reviewed on a number of occasions over a number of years before any substantial concessions are recommended.<\/p><p>It is important to note that a life sentence is indeterminate and there is no guaranteed release date.  However, it does not always mean life in prison.  Persons released into the community continue to serve their sentences, subject to conditions, while on release.  While in the community, life sentence prisoners are required to be under the supervision of the Probation Service.  The Probation Service provide Progress Reports to the Irish Prison Service outlining resettlement and reintegration progress and will report on any risk management concerns a prisoner may present.

By 2019 all farmers must have an entitlement value which is at least 60% of the national average entitlement value.  In addition the new Regulation provides other options which allow for further reductions of high value payments.  These are currently under consideration.<\/p><p>  The CAP agreement reached on 26 June provides a number of options for Member States in terms of how they can tailor the new measures to their specific needs.  In this context I initiated a process of consultation with all stakeholders in July the responses to which are currently being collated.  I will decide on the final shape of the new Direct Payments system in Ireland later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRX01800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":1128,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRX01850"},{"type":"question","counter":1129,"qnumday":462,"qnumall":"[44630\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRX01900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when entitlement payments for the year 2011 will issue in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"994","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1130,"content":"<p>The processing of this case has recently been finalised and payment in respect of the transferred entitlements will issue at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRX02000","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sugar Industry","counter":1131,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRX02050"},{"type":"question","counter":1132,"qnumday":463,"qnumall":"[44677\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRX02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the progress made to date in re-establishing an Irish sugar beet industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":1133,"content":"<p>I know the Deputy will be aware of the background to this issue.  In 2011 I met with two separate groups which had conducted feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing a new sugar\/bioethanol facility in the country.  I understand from figures published by the interested groups who are investigating the possibility of building a new facility, that the overall capital cost costs involved could range from &euro;250 million to &euro;400 million, depending on what type of facility will be constructed. <\/p><p>  I informed both groups at the time and many times since, that any venture to develop a combined sugar\/bioethanol production facility would have to be a viable commercial proposition, and supported by a business case which is sufficiently robust to attract the funding from investors for the very substantial capital investment required.  I also informed both groups that it was my job to look for agreement at EU level to allow for the growing of sugar beet for the manufacture of sugar, at the earliest possible date.<\/p><p>  In this connection, I am pleased to confirm to the Deputy that at the last Council of Agriculture Ministers in June, which I chaired under Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency, I secured agreement as part of the overall CAP reform package, to abolish all sugar quotas by 30 September 2017.  This agreement removes, with effect from 1 October 2017, the quota barrier for operators in Ireland or other Member States, wishing to re-establish a sugar industry.  I am glad to note this agreement has been welcomed by those who are interested in seeking to re-establish a sugar industry here.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRX02200","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Schemes Payments","counter":1134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRX02250"},{"type":"question","counter":1135,"qnumday":464,"qnumall":"[44681\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRX02300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Galway has not received their disadvantaged areas payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

My view is that persons affected by adoption should be provided with a statutory right to as much information as possible within permissible Constitutional boundaries.  I am anxious to bring the Heads of bill before Government at the earliest possible date.  The constitutional and legal context within which the development of these legislative proposals must be undertaken is complex. <\/p><p>  It is intended that the Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to be responsible for providing access to adoption records, in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to establish and maintain a National Index of Adoption Records, the purpose of which is to help an applicant for adoption information identify the location of his or her adoption records.  The intention is that the Bill is to provide that either the Adoption Authority, the HSE or an accredited body may hold adoption records, with the Authority having overall charge of those records. <\/p><p>  It is also intended that the Bill will provide for placing the National Contact Preference Register on a statutory basis.  The purpose of the Register is to allow a person affected by adoption to enter his or her name on the Register with a view to receiving information about another person from whom he or she has been separated as a result of adoption and also to indicate a preference as to whether or not contact is being sought with that person.  <\/p><p>  A National Tracing Service will be established under the provisions of the Bill, the operation of which will be subject to guidelines to be set out in regulations.  It is intended that the Tracing Service is to be made available to an adopted person, a birth parent and a relative of either an adopted person or a birth parent, and that the Adoption Authority is to have overall responsibility for providing the tracing service.<\/p><p>  However I wish to advise that complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen during the course of  preparation of the Heads of Bill  and that detailed on-going consideration of these issues is under way in my Department and in the Office of the Attorney General.  At this stage is it not certain that the problems that have arisen can be overcome by the introduction of legislation and further legal advice has been sought in an effort to see if  legislation that meets my policy objectives can be drafted within constitutional parameters.<\/p><p>  With regard to individual cases, information and tracing inquiries are normally dealt with by the organisation that arranged the original adoption placement.  If the adoption agency has closed, the Health Service Executive Adoption Information and Tracing Service, or the agency that now holds the placement records, will deal with the inquiry.  Queries in relation to the handling of a request for information and tracing should be addressed to the agency dealing with the request or the Adoption Authority as the body with responsibility for regulating accredited bodies who provide adoption services. <\/p><p>  A representative of the Adoption Rights Alliance attended a recent meeting which I held with an individual in relation to adoption information and tracing.  At this meeting I agreed to meet representatives of the Adoption Rights Alliance specifically to discuss the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and I invited them to make a submission in this regard in advance of the meeting. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRX03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Cafes Expenditure","counter":1155,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRY00125"},{"type":"question","counter":1156,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[44566\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRY00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding an application for funding to her Department in respect of an organisation (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":1157,"content":"<p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Funding in the region of &euro;1 million is available in 2013 from my Department for fit-out, refurbishment works or building enhancement projects for the startup of new Youth Caf&eacute;s.

","asker":"1107","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1173,"content":"<p>The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme. This is a necessary feature of the scheme due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person's contribution. <\/p><p>  The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State.  It negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process. This method of negotiation is necessary in order to ensure that the State obtains the best value for each individual in a nursing home and to comply with competition law.  <\/p><p>  In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:<\/p><p>- costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money,<\/p><p>- price(s) previously charged,<\/p><p>- local market price, and<\/p><p>- Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.<\/p><p>  If price negotiations break down, a three stage review process can be invoked. Details of the process are set out on the NTPF website.<\/p><p>  The services which fall within the scope of long-term residential care services, and which are covered by the cost agreed with the NTPF, are:<\/p><p>- nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person,<\/p><p>- basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living,<\/p><p>- bed and board, and<\/p><p>- laundry service. <\/p><p>  In determining the services covered by the NHSS, it was considered very important that nursing home residents and taxpayers would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, goods and services that are already available to individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the goods and services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same items or service.<\/p><p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drugs Payment Scheme, is unaffected by the NHSS. In other words, a person can continue to receive goods and services in accordance with the terms of these other schemes regardless of whether they are in a private nursing home or elsewhere. <\/p><p>  It should be noted that certain items of expenditure, termed allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment of an applicant for the NHSS.  These include certain medical expenses. <\/p><p>  There have been no changes to the goods and services covered by the NHSS since it commenced. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a review. This review will consider the sustainability of the Scheme as well as looking at community based services.  It will also include an examination of the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating\/setting prices. It is envisaged that the review will be completed in early 2014.<\/p><p>  Finally, under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, the registered provider must agree a contract with each resident within one month of their admission. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should not be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.<\/p><p>  The Health Act 2007 gives statutory responsibility to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority, for the independent inspection and registration of public and private nursing homes.  The Chief Inspector has the power to refuse to register, attach conditions to a registration or cancel the registration of a designated centre in the event of non-compliance with the Regulations or the <i>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland<\/i> .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRY01400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Nurses","counter":1174,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRY01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1175,"qnumday":478,"qnumall":"[44093\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRY01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a decision has been made on an application for registration to the nursing board in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1176,"content":"<p>The information regarding Nurse Registration is a matter for The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (formerly An Bord Altranais).

Also in August, I announced the appointment of members to the Children's Hospital Group Board.  This Board will oversee the operational integration of the three existing paediatric hospitals in advance of the move to the new hospital and is also the client for the new hospital, and hence is critically important for the project as a whole.

The procurement process for the new design team was initiated in July.  Following its appointment, the new Board reviewed that procurement process and have decided on a change of approach based on its collective expertise and experience and taking into account changing market conditions.  While this change means that the design team will be selected in Spring 2014, rather than by the end of this year as originally planned, the new Board is confident that there will be no delay to the project overall, as time can now be recovered at contractor tender stage.  In tandem, a review of urgent care centre(s) configuration is almost complete; the number and location of these satellite centres in the Dublin area is a key decision, as the size, activity and infrastructure of these satellite centre(s) has implications for the main hospital brief.

In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004. <\/p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act, inter alia, provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants occasioned by their disability to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.  <\/p><p>  There has been a very significant rise in overall activity around the assessment process in recent years in respect of the children now encompassed by the process.  The number of assessment reports received in 2012 was 3,505 which is over 400 applications more than in 2010.  It is worth noting that in the period 2010-2012 over 8,200 reports were completed.  While the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process given the number and complexity of cases, it is endeavouring to address the issue from available resources. <\/p><p>  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child.  <\/p><p>  In addition, targeted action plans have been put in place since early 2011.  Measures have included: prioritising assessments, holding additional clinics, contracting the private sector to conduct assessments and reconfiguring resources to target areas of greatest need.  These plans are monitored on a monthly basis by the HSE centrally. <\/p><p>  Following the publication of a report commissioned from the National Disability Authority by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring disability services for children into geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme which is underway.  The NDA report indicated that where integrated teams were operating, the assessment of need process ran more smoothly.  It found that there was no one single solution to remove all of the challenges to operating a statutory assessment of need.

The level of health services to be delivered within the available funding has been set out in the HSE National Service Plan, which I approved in January.  <\/p><p>  The Government has decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet its fiscal and budgetary targets.  The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction.  This policy requires the health service to reduce its workforce to 98,938 wholetime equivalent employees by the end of 2013.  However, the HSE can make staff appointments once it remains within its overall employment ceiling and has the financial resources to do so.<\/p><p>  With regard to the HSE's Speech and Language Therapy Service, I understand that each individual that presents to the Service has an initial assessment to determine their individual need for therapy.  The therapist, in conjunction with the parent(s) or carer, will determine the severity of the individual's difficulties and prioritise for therapy accordingly.  The level of intervention is in line with clinic policy, age and severity of the diagnosis.  The waiting period for intervention is dependent on the nature and severity of the disorder following assessment. <\/p><p>  The HSE aims to ensure that the resources available are used to best effect, in order to provide assessment and ongoing therapy to children and adults in line with their prioritised needs.  Along with the significant investment in area of speech and language therapists employed in recent years, a range of new approaches have been developed and used in many Speech and Language Therapy services across the country.

Since the programme commenced in 1995, over 700 patients have received cochlear implants. Beaumont Hospital carried out ninety cochlear implants in 2012 (42 children and 48 adults). The routine practice in Ireland, so far, has been to implant one side only. <\/p><p>  It is now considered best practice worldwide that children should have the option of bilateral implants, and this is reflected in the recommendation of the report of the National Review of Audiology Services which was carried out by the HSE in 2009. The aim of that Review was to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide, and to formulate a national plan for the services.

The standard approach to the treatment of Lyme Disease is to follow the guidance laid out in the <i>Infectious Diseases Society of America<\/i> guidelines on the clinical assessment, treatment and prevention of Lyme Disease.  This is accepted as being the most up to date synthesis of best available evidence on the clinical management of Lyme Disease and treatment of Lyme Disease is based upon this guidance.<\/p><p>  The acute tertiary hospitals in Ireland have the diagnostic and treatment facilities and personnel for the management of Lyme Disease.  In addition, a network of infectious disease specialists is available in all the major centres to provide consultative, expert advice in the management of Lyme borreliosis.  I have been advised by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre that there were eight cases of Lyme Neuroborreliosis notified in 2012.  Lyme Neuroborreliosis is at the more severe end of the spectrum of Lyme borreliosis and as such it is possible that there may be more people with the milder form of the disease.  Given the numbers of cases of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, I am confident that the facilities available for the diagnosis and treatment of the condition are commensurate with the burden which the disease imposes.<\/p><p>  The diagnosis of a case of Lyme Disease can be difficult.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial screening step.  However, screening EIA's can be insufficiently specific and can give other false-positive reactions in the presence of various other infections from syphilis to glandular fever.  In addition, sera from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  Samples giving reactive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second stage immunoblot test.  The use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this two stage approach gives a greater degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme Disease.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRDD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Expenditure","counter":1432,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRDD00600"},{"type":"question","counter":1433,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[44598\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRDD00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the special delivery unit is being cut by 64% in 2014; the expected impact of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure.<\/p><p>  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation. The necessary administrative arrangements will be made during the course of 2014 when the specifics of the legislation are known.<\/p><p>  It became clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition, as outlined initially in the Programme for Government, was likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic. Relatively complex primary legislation and detailed regulations would be required in order to provide a GP service to persons on the basis of their having a particular illness. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. Funding allocated for the extension of a GP service without fees to people with particular medical conditions has been used to mitigate the supplementary budget requirement of the HSE and support existing levels of service.<\/p><p>  Following the recent announcement to commence the roll out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees, I will engage with all relevant stake-holders, as appropriate, in relation to implementation and administrative arrangements.<\/p><p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. A well functioning health system should provide equal access to healthcare for its patients on the basis of health needs, rather than ability to pay. The principles of universality and equity of access mean that all residents in Ireland should be entitled to access a GP services that is free at the point of use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRDD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prescription Charges","counter":1450,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRDD02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1451,"qnumday":569,"qnumall":"[44622\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRDD02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"in relation to the decision announced in budget 2014 to increase the prescription charge by &euro;1 to &euro;2.50, if he considered any study on the effects of such a charge on the behaviour of persons taking medication in accordance with their doctor&rsquo;s instructions; if he will provide details if those studies' standard academic citations will suffice; the actions, he considers necessary to counteract any deterrent effect of such prescription charges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This will be fully extended to HSE West by the end of the year. The objectives of this programme are:<\/p><p>  - To offer a hearing screen to newborn babies using an agreed national protocol;<\/p><p>  - To screen babies using the agreed national protocol for screening within 4 weeks of birth, and by 44 weeks gestational age for babies who have been in a Special Care Baby Unit or Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for more than 48 hours;<\/p><p>  - To ensure timely referral and assessment to integrated audiology services of babies identified as requiring assessment;<\/p><p>  - To ensure that all babies with permanent childhood hearing impairment receive effective and acceptable intervention, care and support that meets their individual needs, including appropriate referral to other services such as ENT and allied health professionals and other statutory bodies\/agencies such as Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>  Additionally, if a baby passes the screening but if the parents have concerns at a later stage, they can highlight these concerns to their Public Health Nurse or Area Medical Officer and be referred into Audiology Services for re-assessment.<\/p><p>  The HSE chairs a Collaborative Working Group which has representation from DeafHear, HSE Audiology Services, HSE Speech and Language Therapy Services, Visiting Teachers for the Deaf and the Beaumont Cochlear Implant Programme.

Once an audiologist diagnoses a child with a hearing impairment, they refer on to the appropriate professionals.<\/p><p>  UNHS has proven high sensitivity and specificity. With this sensitive procedure for hearing screening, a child with a permanent hearing impairment (PCHI) can now be identified much earlier, within 4 to 5 weeks of birth, and the hearing status of each ear determined accurately. This means a child can start receiving appropriate support within the first six months of life. The core objectives of UNHS are described as &quot;1-3-6&quot; goals which are based on international programmes:<\/p><p>  - Babies to be screened by 1 month of age;<\/p><p>  - Audiology assessment completed by 3 months of age;<\/p><p>  - Initiation of appropriate medical and audiological services, and early intervention services, by 6 months of age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRDD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"question","counter":1474,"qnumday":577,"qnumall":"[44701\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRDD04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding community waiting lists for basic hearing tests of children up to 24 months and access to supporting routine hearing services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":1475,"content":"<p>In order to reduce the current audiology waiting lists a number of measures are being taken by the HSE.

The NTA has advised there will be no changes to service levels throughout the restructuring period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRFF03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":1569,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRFF03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1570,"qnumday":613,"qnumall":"[44754\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200059#WRFF03600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide the full year effect of all expenditure reductions for his Department as set out in the expenditure report 2014 as was provided for in the expenditure report 2013.

","asker":"1015","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":1576,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 183 together.<\/p><p>  Firstly, I would point out that the allocation of SNA resources is not a matter for this Department but is instead an independent function carried out by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), who are responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports including resource teaching and SNA support as well as the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required.  The number of SNAs employed in a school depends on the allocation given to the school by the NCSE, based on its assessment of the special educational needs of pupils in the school.  If you require further information regarding the allocation of SNA resources to schools then your query should more appropriately be directed to the NCSE.<\/p><p>  In relation to your question regarding working hours for SNAs the position regarding the working hours of full-time SNAs is as outlined in the standard SNA contract of employment, which was agreed by this Department, the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) representing SNAs and the Management Bodies in 2005.  In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools.  No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc.  These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. <\/p><p>  In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total.  Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.  These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and\/or the normal school year.  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment.  Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours. <\/p><p>  Furthermore, the issue of appropriate working hours for all public servants was one of the key aspects of the set of proposals for a public service agreement which were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission and which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement).  The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:<\/p><p>&quot;Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant.  Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited.  Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions.<\/p><p>  These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013\/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT\/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers.  This will constitute the liability on Special Needs Assistants in respect of working hours for the purposes of this extension to the Public Service Agreement.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200060#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Policy","counter":1577,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200060#WRH00450"},{"type":"question","counter":1578,"qnumday":184,"qnumall":"[44360\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200060#WRH00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a clear definition exists to describe the role and responsibilities of special needs assistants; if this definition is clearly articulated to principals, teachers, parents and SNAs; how SNA support is managed within schools in order to ensure the best possible support and outcomes for students; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

SNAs are allocated to schools in order to provide for the care needs of children with special educational needs attending such schools.  The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department. <\/p><p>  The policy of my Department in relation to the SNA scheme is set out in Circular 07\/02, which also provides details regarding the role and duties of an SNA.  Circular 071\/2011 provides additional details in respect of the duties of an SNA and makes clear the fact that SNA duties are assigned at the discretion of the Principal.  I can also advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has also published an Information Booklet for Parents in relation to Children with Special Educational Needs, which provides information for parents in relation to the SNA scheme.<\/p><p>  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support each year.  The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised. <\/p><p>  My Department has also published a Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Analysis Review of the Special Needs Assistant scheme.  This review is available on my Department's website: www.education.gov.ie.  The Review has shown that the SNA Scheme has been successful in supporting schools in meeting the needs of students with disabilities who also have significant care needs.  However, the review also found that the allocation process and the purpose of the scheme is not always fully understood.<\/p><p>  The review recommended that the SNA scheme should be restated to ensure an efficient allocation of SNA resources and to clarify the 'care' nature of the SNA role for parents, schools and professionals.  The National Council for Special Education recently published its report on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools, which also recommended that my Department should clarify the role of the SNA, as recommended in the VFM report.  It is my intention that a new Circular will be issued to schools in the near future which will provide further clarification for schools and parents with regard to the role of the SNA and the purpose of the SNA scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200060#WRH00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Education","counter":1580,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200060#WRH00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1581,"qnumday":185,"qnumall":"[44363\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200060#WRH00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the different educational programmes currently operating within the primary and secondary systems which are focused on educating children on the dangers of smoking; if he will provide a breakdown of the number of hours of such training that students receive throughout their educational careers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":1582,"content":"<p>Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is currently a compulsory subject in primary schools and at Junior Cycle in post primary schools.  The SPHE curricula aim to foster self-worth, self -confidence and respectful relationships and place a particular emphasis on developing a sense of personal responsibility for one's own behaviour, feelings and actions.<\/p><p>  The issue of smoking is addressed in the 'Personal Safety' strand of SPHE, in the context of equipping students with the skills to recognise and withstand inappropriate peer pressure and to identify the dangers of substance abuse.  For example, SPHE students at Junior Cycle explore the health and social implications of smoking and identify some of the reasons why young people smoke.  Students are also helped to identify ways in which smoking can be avoided. Enabling students to make informed decisions and choices is an inherent aim in the teaching and learning within SPHE.  SPHE is delivered for 30 minutes per week at primary level, and for approximately 66 hours during the three years of junior cycle.  The approach to SPHE is changing at Junior Cycle.  As part of the reform of the Junior Cycle that was announced by the Minister of Education and Skills in October 2012, the key objectives of SPHE are now reflected in a number of 'Principles', 'Statements of Learning', and skills that underpin the new Junior Cycle Framework. <\/p><p>  As part of the new 'Well-being' principle, the student experience will &quot;contribute to their physical, mental, emotional and social wellbeing and resilience.  Learning takes place in a climate focussed on collective well-being of school, community and society&quot;.  Under the new Junior Cycle Framework, pupils will be provided with opportunities to acquire the relevant skills of 'Managing Myself', 'Staying well', and 'Communicating'.  Together the development of these skills will enable pupils to address the challenges they face and adapt their skills to different contexts, leading to their positive well-being.<\/p><p>  As part of the new Junior Cycle Framework, the NCCA is currently developing a new short course in SPHE.  The SPHE short course may be delivered for certification purposes and will involve an increase in the time allocation for SPHE at Junior Cycle  up to 100 hours over the three years.  This short course is currently open for public consultation.  The consultation process will close at the end of November.  The new short course will be available to schools from September 2014.  Schools will then have the option to implement the new SPHE short course, or to continue to use existing courses or to adopt an alternative approach to meeting their requirements in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200060#WRH00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Eligibility","counter":1583,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200060#WRH00850"},{"type":"question","counter":1584,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[44375\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200060#WRH00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a transport grant will be provided to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":1585,"content":"<p>The person referred to by the Deputy, in the details supplied, is approaching his 20th birthday and is attending a facility for adults with disabilities.

This policy advice is available at www.ncse.ie.  This publication provides details of the disabilities which qualify for low-incidence resource hours and also details the approximate number of number of students for whom low incidence resource teaching hours were allocated to schools for the academic year 2012-13.  This report details the allocation for resource teaching hours by disability category, and shows that there were 1,110 pupils in mainstream education in receipt of low incidence resource hours with a disability categorisation of Deafness\/hearing impairment during the 2012 - 2013 school year.  This includes 693 pupils at primary level and 417 pupils at post primary level.  There are also 16 special classes for children with hearing impairment attached to mainstream schools, with 10 special classes being attached to mainstream primary schools, and 6 special class at post-primary level. <\/p><p>  The pupil teacher ratio for special classes for children who are deaf of hard of hearing is 7-1, which equates to provision for approximately 112 children being supported in special classes in mainstream schools, though the numbers attending special classes may vary throughout the year, as pupils transition between special class and mainstream education.  In addition, the report also indicates that for the 2012\/13 school year, there were approximately 120 children enrolled in the three special schools for the deaf.  <\/p><p>  It is clear, therefore, that the majority of pupils who are deaf or hard of hearing are therefore now being educated in mainstream schools, either in mainstream classes with additional supports, or in special classes attached to mainstream schools.  Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support is provided in these schools and classes, as required.  An enhanced capitation grant is also provided to the special schools and special classes for hearing impaired pupils.  Grant-aid is also provided to schools towards the provision of special equipment for pupils who are hard of hearing, such as sound field systems and radio aids. <\/p><p>  My Department also provides funding for a weekly home tuition service whereby tutors visit the homes of deaf and hard of hearing preschool children and school-going pupils to provide training in Irish Sign Language (ISL) for these children, their siblings and parents.  In addition, the Visiting Teacher Service for Children and Young People with a Hearing Impairment is provided by my Department from the time of referral through to third level education.  The Visiting Teacher service provides advice and support to ensure that the needs of children and young people with hearing impairment are met.  This service is available at preschool, primary and post-primary levels.  Specifically, the service works in partnership with parents of preschool children with hearing impairment, visiting their homes and\/or meeting them in groups to inform, advise and offer guidance in matters pertaining to their education and overall development and in helping their children to derive maximum benefit from the educational opportunities available. <\/p><p>  Finally, I wish to advise that my Department, through the Higher Education Authority (HEA), has established and funds a Centre for Deaf Studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for ISL\/English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies. The course modules deal with issues such as sign linguistics, bilingualism and sociolinguistics of sign language. The course is delivered in seminar sessions\/group work and the award of the diploma is based on continued assessment and a project and course design.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200061#WRJ00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"question","counter":1628,"qnumday":201,"qnumall":"[44698\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200061#WRJ00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of children with special needs who have been able to avail of their legal right to an individual education plan; the level of collaboration between the Health Service Executive and his Department in ensuring that children with additional needs do not miss vital eduction milestones as a result of delays in the diagnosis process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

My Department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs in order to ensure that, wherever a child is enrolled, s\/he will have access to an appropriate education.  These supports include an allocation of additional teaching support as well as additional resource teaching and Special Needs Assistant (SNA) care supports which may be allocated to schools by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in respect of qualifying pupils. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum.<\/p><p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools. This policy advice is available at www.ncse.ie.  This publication details that for the 2012\/13 school year, there were approximately 31,202 pupils in mainstream education in receipt of resource teaching allocations. It also notes that for the 2012\/13 school year that there were approximately 3,678 pupils attending special classes attached to mainstream schools, and 7094 pupils attending special schools.  <\/p><p>  While provision of Individual Education Plans (IEPs) is not currently mandatory, they are recognised as an important feature of good educational practice and schools are encouraged to use IEPs through policy guidance, support, training and inspection. A range of guidance has issued on the use of IEPs, including guidelines published by the NCSE, guidance published by the National Educational Psychology Service (NEPS) and training is provided by my Department's Special Education Support Service. The advice of my Department's Inspectorate is that the majority of schools are now using some form of individual education planning for children with special needs.<\/p><p>  I wish to explain also that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are on the Department's website. Where a NEPS psychologist is not assigned to a school, authorities therein may access psychological assessments through SCPA. Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. <\/p><p>  The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports, including the allocation of resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.<\/p><p>  The responsibility for deciding on the quantum of educational resources to be allocated to pupils with special educational needs resides with the NCSE through the SENO.<\/p><p>Assessment reports carried out by relevant professionals are provided by schools to the SENOs as part of the application process for support. The consideration of these reports is an integral part of determining the extent of supports to be provided for pupils with special educational needs. <\/p><p>  The NCSE circular 03\/08 clarifies the respective roles and functions of the NCSE and the HSE and their respective personnel in carrying out assessments and sanctioning resources to support children with special educational needs.  For children under the age of 5, the NCSE, through its network of SENOs, liaises with Assessment Officers in the Health Service Executive (HSE) in respect of the assessment of need process under the 2005 Disability Act, 2005.  The Assessment Officer contacts the relevant SENO when an educational need is identified as part of the assessment process. My Department's Circular 0020\/2011 further clarifies the roles of the NCSE and the HSE in relation to the assessment of need process, as well as the role of the school in this regard. This Circular is available on my Departments website at www.education.ie. <\/p><p>  I wish to advise that my Department will continue to support the co-ordinated delivery of services to families of children with special educational needs and will continue to work with service-providing partners in the health and disability sectors through the interdepartmental Cross-Sectoral Team (comprising of representatives of: the Departments of Education and Skills, Health and Children, the National Council for Special Education and the Health Service Executive), which plans for co-ordinated service delivery across the disability sector.<\/p><p>  Finally, I can advise that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) recently published comprehensive policy advice on Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs in Schools, which is available on its website www.ncse.ie.  The report recommends that under a new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in the report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.  I have, as suggested by the Report, requested the NCSE to establish a Working Group to develop a proposal, for consideration, for a new model for the allocation of teaching supports for children with Special Educational Needs based on the profiled educational needs of children in schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200061#WRJ00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Provision","counter":1631,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200061#WRJ00650"},{"type":"question","counter":1632,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[44720\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200061#WRJ00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the information or annual reports that are made to him relative to the funds allocated to Bus &Eacute;ireann to operate the school transport system; if he will confirm the amounts allocated in each of the past four years; if his Department have ever carried out a value for money audit on the scheme; if he will confirm the sums paid to Bus &Eacute;ireann for management services relative to this scheme; if the Bus &Eacute;ireann auditors have made any comment on the profitability or otherwise of the scheme; if he is satisfied that there is sufficient transparency around the scheme relative to its operation and costs and cross subsidisation of Bus &Eacute;ireann.

In this regard, Minister of State Brian Hayes worked closely with Senator Feargal Quinn to develop the Senator&rsquo;s private member&rsquo;s Construction Contracts Bill into a robust piece of legislation. I believe that there is considerable support both inside and outside the D&aacute;il for these reforms. The Act which is subject to a Commencement Order, to allow for the development of a comprehensive code of practice, was signed into law on the 29 July 2013.<\/p><p>  The key objective of the Construction Contracts Act is to ensure that cash flows down the supply chain on all construction contracts. This issue is addressed in the Act by providing statutory arrangements in relation to payments under construction contracts, including providing for interim payments. This will reduce the subcontractor&rsquo;s exposure to non-payment. The Bill also provides the means for subcontractors to enforce these rights; by suspending their labour and by introducing a new mechanism for the swift resolution of payment disputes through a process of adjudication. <\/p><p>  The Bill applies to contracts with an overall value &euro;10,000 or more. It is important to understand that the amount that is subject to a payment dispute can be lower than this. Therefore subcontractors will be free to refer payment disputes relating to lesser amounts to adjudication. For example if a contract with an overall value of &euro;11,000 gives rise to a payment dispute for &euro;1,000 this will come within the scope of the legislation. <\/p><p>  This is an important piece of legislation aimed at creating a more level playing field between contractor and subcontractor in the construction sector. This legislation is a priority for Government. In this regard, my officials are current working on the code of practice that will deliver a timely and cost effective adjudication procedure and to give effect to the legislation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200061#WRJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1097"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":1650,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200061#WRJ01950"},{"type":"question","counter":1651,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[44427\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200061#WRJ02000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the steps that have been taken to make the former Garda station on the North Road, Finglas available to the local community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Some sites are open all year, and some are open for part of the year, mainly for the spring and summer seasons. The OPW has a number of visitor sites that have free access but do not have a guided presence and consequently, visitor numbers are not recorded at these sites. An example of such a site would be St. Stephen's Green. Similarly, visitors to some of our guided sites are only recorded if they enter the visitor centre of that site. For example, Glendalough monastic site may be accessed freely, without entering the visitor centre. <\/p><p>  Visitor numbers at guided sites, centrally recorded on the basis of returns submitted from individual heritage sites, are categorised under a number of headings and are then collated on a weekly and monthly basis, culminating in an overall annual figure. A comparison of the provisional 2013 visitor numbers up to the end of September, against the corresponding 2012 figures shows an increase in visitor numbers in the more well known sites such as Kilmainham Gaol, the Rock of Cashel, Kilkenny Castle, Clonmacnoise, Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne and the National Botanic Gardens, with some notable increases in some of the OPW's lesser known sites such as Altamount Gardens, Glebe House and Gallery, Maynooth Castle, Ennis Friary, Emo Court, Casino Mario, Loughcrew, Desmond Hall, Roscrea Heritage, Listowel Castle and Scattery Island. These increases come on the back of an increase of almost 11% in visitor numbers between 2011 and 2012 in respect of all of our visitor sites. The monitoring of visitors to the OPW's heritage sites plays, and will continue to play, an important part in the development of policies and strategies relating to the heritage sector. <\/p><p>  Generally speaking, no specific promotion is required in respect of our most notable sites; visitors continue to be attracted in large numbers to such sites. One of the many challenges that faces the OPW is to entice such visitors to travel on to our lesser known sites, and indeed to increase overall visitor numbers at these sites, thereby spreading the benefits of tourism right across the country. In late July\/early August, the OPW undertook a national advertising and flyer distribution campaign to coincide with the roll out of our Facebook Heritage Ireland page; this was complimentary to the ongoing promotion of our sites. The OPW will continue in its efforts to attract more and more visitors to our heritage sites, in line with government policy, that the heritage tourism sector will be one of the main growth areas in the future economic development of this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200061#WRJ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"958"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Register Office","counter":1659,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200061#WRJ02550"},{"type":"question","counter":1660,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[44362\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200061#WRJ02600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the position regarding the new location for the general register research facility (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Salaries are the largest component of MFI's annual budget.  In the first full year of operations which encompass all the establishment costs the ratio of loans to administration is 2:1.  This is to be expected in a difficult start up environment and MFI expects to improve on this indicator as awareness and demand increase.  The key ratio MFI is targeting is operating costs per job created\/sustained.  At the end of the first full year this is &euro;3,420 per job.  This measure does not take account of cost avoided by the exchequer or exchequer receipts that may accrue as a result of each job.  MFI expects to drive down this indicator over time as awareness and demand increases.<\/p><p>  On foot of the Programme for Government my Department developed the Microfinance proposal, in close consultation with relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the European Investment Bank, and more detailed discussions with practitioners already in the area of Microfinancing.  A detailed analysis of other alternative delivery mechanisms was undertaken, such as: First Step, Multiple Lending Funds, Enterprise Ireland\/County Enterprise Boards and Credit Unions.  Following this analysis, it was agreed by Government that there was no alternative model which could achieve the scale of lending and containment of credit risk required to fulfil the Commitment in the Programme for Government.  As set out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis published in April 2012, a single lender would (i) minimise overall management costs which are traditionally high with microenterprises, (ii) ensure a clear financial and management information reporting structure, (iii) enhance the possibility for EIF assistance and (iv) allow for a clear identification of the costs involved in operating the scheme.<\/p><p>  As of 18<sup>th<\/sup> October 2013 MFI has approved 109 applications to the value of &euro;1.674m supporting 107 microenterprises and 237 jobs.

It will also help to ensure that the Government maintains its adherence to the EU\/IMF Consolidation Programme and return the public finances to a sound footing.<\/p><p>  In line with commitments under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, my Department and its Agencies will deliver over &euro;13 million in efficiency savings in respect of 2014.

The decision to reform State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives. <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardising of State pension age for all at 66 years and the cessation of State pension transition.  The State pension age will then increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age.  This applied at a time when longevity was much lower and working patterns were more likely to be physically demanding.  State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension and was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Over time, the age for State pension contributory was reduced to 66 years.<\/p><p>  Public sector workers who are obliged to retire at age 65 will be able to draw their occupational public sector pension at age 65.  The changes regarding State pension will have no impact on such public sector workers who are on modified social insurance.  However, for those public sector workers who are fully insured and in defined benefit pension schemes, their occupational public sector pensions (and contributions) are, like many occupational pension schemes, integrated (or co-ordinated) with social welfare benefits.  This means the occupational pension paid is based on the assumption that the pensioner also receives the State pension.<\/p><p>  Where this does not happen, a discretionary supplementary pension may be payable under the relevant public sector pension scheme to bridge the gap.  In such cases, a supplementary pension is only payable where the individual, through no fault of their own, does not qualify for social welfare benefit or qualifies at less than the maximum personal rate.  It is therefore necessary to claim any available social welfare benefits in order to receive a supplementary pension.  This situation is not new and already applies to public sector workers who have a retirement age below 65.<\/p><p>  For other workers, the main social welfare payments available to those who leave employment before pension age are jobseekers benefit and job seekers allowance.  Persons who qualify for a job seekers payment who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRN00900","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1840,"content":"<p>Question No. 276 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Data","counter":1841,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRN01050"},{"type":"question","counter":1842,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[44539\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRN01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the position regarding community employment schemes and his Department's strategy in relation to the schemes in the long term; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The decision to reform State pension was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives. <\/p><p>  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2011 provides that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the standardising of State pension age for all at 66 years and the cessation of State pension transition.  The State pension age will then increase to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that until the 1970s, the standard age for receipt of State pension was 70 years of age.  This applied at a time when longevity was much lower and working patterns were more likely to be physically demanding.  State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension and was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Overtime, the age for State pension contributory was reduced to 66 years. <\/p><p>  However, the Deputy may wish to note that a significant number of people coming on to State pension (transition) in 2012 did not come from work as many were already on other social welfare schemes.  In December 2012 there were approximately 14,400 State pension (transition) claims in payment and of those, 12.5 per cent came from work with over 50 per cent coming from other social welfare schemes such as illness benefit, jobseekers benefit and assistance, invalidity and carers, indicating that significant numbers of people are leaving the workforce for a variety of reasons well in advance of State pension age. <\/p><p>  In terms of social welfare supports available to those at age 65, all short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.  The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker's benefit.  Persons who qualify for a jobseeker's benefit who are aged between 65 and 66 years are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).  Each application for any social welfare scheme is assessed on its own merit in terms of qualifying criteria and contribution history.  Where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions including a means test.<\/p><p>  Further consideration is being given to the position of those exiting the workforce before pension age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRN01400","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Status","counter":1847,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRN01450"},{"type":"question","counter":1848,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[44546\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRN01500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"when a decision will be made on an appeal in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Mayo; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":1849,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 1<sup>st<\/sup> August 2013.

To allow us to protect these core payments, we have had to look very carefully at other additional payments such as the household benefits package, including the telephone allowance.  While we have cut the telephone allowance, there have been no cuts to the electricity\/gas allowance, free travel, the free television licence, the fuel allowance or the living alone increase. <\/p><p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme has risen each year and the number of eligible customers has increased very significantly.  In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance, today there are almost 400,000, an increase of 24%.  Each year almost 10,000 extra customers become eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients.<\/p><p>  The telephone allowance was introduced at a time when telephone services were more expensive and fewer people had telephones.

Such rates in respect of younger jobseekers were first introduced in 2009.<\/p><p>  By extending the &euro;100 jobseeker's allowance rate to ages 22, 23 and 24 the changes provide that claimants in this age bracket will be &euro;60 better off if they engage in education or training such as the back to education programme as they will then receive &euro;160 per week.  Persons aged 25, had previously been subject to no financial incentive measure, will now receive &euro;144 per week.  These individuals will generally be &euro;16 better off if they engage in education or training as they will now receive &euro;160 per week. <\/p><p>  Similarly, interns participating on JobBridge receive an allowance of &euro;50 per week on top of their existing social welfare entitlement for the period of their internship.  Arrangements provide that a claim for jobseeker's allowance is linked to any claim made within the previous 12 months, so persons returning to jobseeker's allowance following a 6 or 9 month internship will revert to the appropriate rate applying before their internship.<\/p><p>  It is anticipated that the changes will affect 13,767 persons in 2014, rising to 31,577 persons per annum over time.<\/p><p>  This decision was made on foot of on-going consideration of unemployment and incentives policy by Government. In making such decisions it is standard practice for all appropriate advice to be considered.  The changes are not discriminatory but rather are targeted measures aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.<\/p><p>  In preparation for the forthcoming implementation of the Youth Guarantee, Budget 2014 contained an additional &euro;46 million to support a number of initiatives aimed at young people. These include:- reducing the threshold (in terms of duration of unemployment) for JobsPlus eligibility from 12 months &ndash; to 6 months or less &ndash; in the case of persons aged less than 25 years;- an additional intake of 1,500 young people on to the very successful JobBridge scheme;- ensuring that 1,000 places on the T&uacute;s scheme are targeted at young people;- developing a pilot programme to support young unemployed people to take up opportunities under schemes such as Your First EURES Job; and ring-fencing a minimum of 2,000 training places for under-25s by the Department of Education and Skills, under a follow-up to the successful Momentum programme that operated in 2013, with income support for participants being provided by my Department; and furthermore the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will invest in the region of &euro;2.5m next year in making funds available to young entrepreneurs via Micro finance Ireland and other business start-up schemes.<\/p><p>  These measures are in addition to the significant existing spend of approximately &euro;170m per annum on employment, training and further education programmes for young people.<\/p><p>  I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.

Voluntary groups may be locally or nationally organised and may include community groups.<\/p><p>  Details of the Voluntary Work Option arrangements are published on the Department's website and, in order to ensure that the profile is raised, all staff involved in the administration of the Jobseeker schemes were recently reminded of these arrangements and of the operational procedures under which they operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRO03000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1917,"content":"<p>Question No. 307 answered with Question No. 290.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":1920,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRP00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waterways Ireland Projects","counter":1919,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRP00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1920,"qnumday":308,"qnumall":"[44424\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRP00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when it is proposed to reopen the walkway which spans the weir on the River Shannon in Meelick, County Galway; if funding has been provided for this work; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that this is an important local and tourist amenity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The initiative - the <i>Philanthropic Leverage Initiative <\/i>- was designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment of the arts from private sources.  The initiative has provided an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new funding relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts.  The initiative proved very successful with a multiplier of 4.26 in philanthropic donations being leveraged for the arts.  The arts got a boost of over &euro;1 million last year, of which less than one-fifth came from the public purse.  A full list of awards under this scheme can be viewed on my Department's website at .<\/p><p>  This year, &euro;210,000 is available to arts organisations under the Initiative.  The terms are as follows:<\/p><p> - Up to &euro;5,000 of funds can be accessed through the scheme if the organisation can match each &euro;1 from the taxpayer with &euro;2 from private sector sources;<\/p><p> - Up to &euro;10,000 if each &euro;1 from the taxpayer can be matched by &euro;3 from private sector funding;<\/p><p> - Up to &euro;15,000 if each &euro;1 from the taxpayer can be matched by &euro;4 from private sector funding.<\/p><p>  In 2013, priority was given to arts and culture organisations seeking support for projects that include an education component.  This is to support the <i>Arts in Education Charter,<\/i> which I launched in conjunction with Mr Ruairi Quinn, T.D., Minister for Education and Skills.  Accordingly, the Initiative, while continuing to provide an incentive to arts organisations to engage in fundraising, will also encourage arts and culture organisations to engage creatively with children and young people and add to their education.  In doing so, they will be helping to foster the artists and the audiences of the future.<\/p><p>  I should mention also that in October 2012 I hosted and chaired a forum on <i>Philanthropy and the Arts <\/i>in Smock Alley Theatre.  It featured speakers from key philanthropic organisations and the arts in Ireland.  The conference was very well attended and generated very positive feedback.  There is a full report of the conference on my Department's website.<\/p><p>  Parallel to these initiatives, the Arts Council is undertaking an initiative - <i>RAISE: Building Fundraising Capacity <\/i> - which dovetails with the work in my Department.  The initiative consists of a programme which is providing one-to-one professional support to selected arts organisations for two years to assist in planning and implementing a tailored fundraising programme for each organisation.  Eight leading Irish arts organisations are aiming to raise &euro;10 million in private funding over the next five years as part of this Arts Council initiative.  <\/p><p>  My Department has also provided support to Business to Arts (a not-for-profit organisation working to support resilience and transformation in the cultural sector through research, innovation and partnership) for a number of years and, in each of the last three years, this has been allocated to delivery of the New Stream Programme, which builds fundraising skills in the cultural sector in Ireland (The Bank of America Merrill Lynch investment in this project is &euro;400k over three years).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRP02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1957,"content":"<p>Question No. 322 answered with Question No. 65.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme Issues","counter":1958,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRP02850"},{"type":"question","counter":1959,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[44794\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRP02900","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which final agreement has been reached with traditional turf cutters displaced by EU or national conservation orders throughout the country; the extent to which he expects to be in the position to resolve issues in relation to the outstanding locations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The group from Clara Bog commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June 2012, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have now been accommodated. Turf cutting for the 2013 season took place on this site in April last.  My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from the group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog will be able to commence turf cutting in one of the relocation sites from the 2014 turf cutting season.<\/p><p>  Progress has been made with a view to the relocation of 7 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare to Timahoe North, County Kildare, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na.  My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season, provided that final agreement is reached with them.  Progress has also been made with a view to the relocation of a small group of 3 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynamona Bog and Corkip Lough special area of conservation in County Roscommon to Togher, County Roscommon, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na.  My Department envisages that this group of qualifying turf cutters will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season, provided that final agreement is reached with them.<\/p><p>  I am advised that of the remaining 49 raised bog special areas of conservation, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 32 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites.  Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number that had been cutting turf on these sites during the relevant five year period and would qualify for the relocation option available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.<\/p><p>  Relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure\/drainage works required, establishing the number that can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements.  In that regard, Bord na M&oacute;na has assessed in the region of 70 potential relocation sites at the request of my Department.  Bord na M&oacute;na has also commenced negotiations with landowners in relation to the purchase or long-term lease of sites.<\/p><p>  There are 2 raised bog special areas of conservation in County Kildare affected by the cessation of turf cutting - Ballynafagh Bog and Mouds Bog.  58 applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme have been received and acknowledged by my Department in respect of Ballynafagh Bog and 106 applications have been received and acknowledged by my Department in respect of Mouds Bog.  28 and 40 of these groups of applicants, respectively, have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog.  61 payments and 12 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of the applications received from Ballynafagh Bog and 105 payments and 65 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of the applications received from Mouds Bog.<\/p><p>  Lattins Bog, also known as Mouds North Bog, in County Kildare has been identified as a potential relocation site for turf cutters from Mouds Bog.  Bord na M&oacute;na had produced a preliminary suitability assessment report and stratigraphy assessment report for the relocation site.  It has now undertaken a full suitability assessment for the site and my Department has provided a copy of the assessment report to the Secretary of the Committee of the Kildare Turf Cutters Association.<\/p><p>  There are also 2 natural heritage area raised bogs in County Kildare designated under national law in accordance with the provisions of the Wildlife Acts - Carbury Bog and Hodgestown Bog.  In May 2010, the previous Government decided that turf cutting should come to an end on all raised bog natural heritage areas at the end of 2013.  However, as set out in the Programme for Government, the current Government undertook to review the situation with regard to raised bog natural heritage areas.<\/p><p>  This review is currently underway and the future of turf cutting on such sites is being considered as part of that review.  It is my intention that the review will provide clarity for turf cutters and landowners in advance of the 2014 turf cutting season and my Department will be contacting individual landowners and turf cutters on these sites in due course.<\/p><p>  A payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum is available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to applicants while awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs. <\/p><p>  Following the D&aacute;il motion of 7 March 2012, which called on the Government to &#8220;engage actively with the European Commission to seek a resolution within the terms of the Habitats Directive, and to prepare and submit a National Raised Bog Restoration Plan to the Commission as a matter of urgency&#8221;, I secured the agreement of the European Commissioner for the Environment for the development of a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, in keeping with the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke.  The approach of the national plan may unlock some flexibility, within the terms of the EU Habitats Directive, in regard to the most difficult of sites, where relocation options are limited.<\/p><p>  To progress the preparation of the plan, my Department engaged a team of specialists (RPS) to provide the scientific basis for raised bog conservation in Ireland.  RPS has been working with my Department and the Peatlands Council to prepare a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, a draft of which I hope to make available for consultation before the end of the year.  Further information on the work of RPS can be found at .<\/p><p>  The clear majority of domestic turf-cutters on the raised bog special areas of conservation are now engaging with my Department in finding acceptable solutions within the law.  The door is still open for others to engage in this process with me, my Department and with other stakeholders to address the needs of turf cutters and other interested parties.  Such engagement would, I am sure, help to address the needs of turf cutters more speedily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRP03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1962,"content":"<p>Question No. 324 answered with Question No. 107.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1963,"content":"<p>Question No. 325 answered with Question No. 323.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Funding","counter":1965,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRQ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":1966,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[44797\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRQ00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which his Department or bodies under his aegis have financially supported directly or indirectly various bodies of an artistic or cultural nature in County Kildare in each of the past four years to date; his expectations in this regard for the current and future years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":1967,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[44799\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRQ00300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"in relation to an examination of applications for grant aid from local community based musical or theatrical groups, if the existence of some such groups who have never received such assistance has come to attention; if any evaluation will be done with a view to addressing such issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":1968,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[44800\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRQ00400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"on the examination of applications for grant aid from local community based musical or theatrical groups in County Kildare, if the existence of some such groups who have never received such assistance has come to attention; if any evaluation will be done with a view to addressing such issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":1969,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 326, 328 and 329 together.<\/p><p>  The Government's policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, to increase access to and participation in the arts, and to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life. As the Deputy will be aware, primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels, throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council.  The Council is funded by my Department and is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations, including funding decisions. In 2013, the Arts Council will receive an allocation of over &euro;60.6 million in current, capital and EU Presidency funding.  Details of all funding provided by the Arts Council to arts practitioners, arts groups and venues, including arts centres, are available on the Council's website at .  In a wider context, the Arts Council support of a range of arts forms is set out in its strategic overview document entitled <i>Developing the Arts in Ireland: Arts Council Strategic Overview 2011-2013<\/i>.

The Museum Standards Programme of Ireland, which sets out to raise standards of curatorship across Irish museums and galleries, includes, as one of its participants, the Museum of Free Derry.  Many of the museums in the programme also participate in cross border initiatives under their own auspices, such as Donegal County Museum, Cavan County Museum and Monaghan Museum.

Informed by the findings of a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), the OREDP will identify how best to coordinate action across the environmental, energy and economic development policy areas in order to realise Ireland's abundant offshore renewable energy potential, using both offshore wind, and emerging ocean, renewable technologies.<\/p><p>  In addition, my Department is working closely with the United Kingdom Government to pursue the opportunity of harnessing the renewable energy resources for export. Renewable energy export holds the prospect for significant job creation in the future, both in the building and maintenance of generation installations and the manufacture of components in Ireland. All relevant State agencies, particularly in the enterprise area, will have to co-ordinate their activities early in the process to ensure we maximise the employment potential of export projects. This opportunity has already been identified by the Industrial Development Agency and Enterprise Ireland in their clean technology growth strategies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRQ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Angling Sector Issues","counter":1986,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRQ01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1987,"qnumday":334,"qnumall":"[44161\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRQ01700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he has viewed the Inland Fisheries Ireland report compiled by Tourism Development Ireland and launched on 18 July 2013 which states that the salmon and sea trout angling subsector alone accounts for 189,000 anglers in 2012 generating a value to the economy based of IFI's calculated average spend of between &euro;360 and &euro;1,723 per angler of &euro;310 million; if he will confirm that only 19,899 licences for game angling for salmon and sea trout were sold and distributed by the IFI in 2011; the reason for this discrepancy; if he will give assurances that the IFI is not overseeing a situation where 90% of wild salmon and sea trout caught by rod and line are illegal, undocumented or entering the food chain in a traceable fashion.

I am advised that TDI is a renowned and widely respected professional consultancy company with a global presence. TDI have been commissioned internationally by such clients as the United Nations, the European Union, the World Bank, the World Tourism Organisation, the Irish American Cultural Institute and a range of multinational companies. Government Departments and Agencies from EU Member States and from countries worldwide have also engaged TDI for expert advice and analysis.  In Ireland, TDI has carried out work for the Marine Institute, Failte Ireland, Udaras na Gaeltacht as well as a host of Local Authorities and regional organisations. In the Northern Ireland and cross border context its clients include Waterways Ireland, Tourism Ireland, Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the Loughs Agency.<\/p><p>  The principal results of the professional and wide-ranging study of Ireland&rsquo;s recreational angling sector, which was published in July 2013, estimate that recreational angling in Ireland contributes &euro;755 million to the Irish economy and supports in excess of 10,000 jobs in peripheral and rural areas.  I am advised that the results in this report are based on sound economic principles and have been peer reviewed before publication.  IFI have confirmed that the Deputy is correct that 19,899 salmon licenses were sold in 2011. However, it is important to be cognisant of the specific question asked in the published survey, as well as the incidence of targeting multiple species.<\/p><p>  At no point does this study reference a specific monetary value for any individual species. I understand that there has been comment attributed to a UK based website on the published study.  IFI advise that having examined the figures put forward in that comment, it appears that the estimated maximum participation values for one species were erroneously mixed and inappropriately extrapolated with average spend figures for all species which unfortunately underpin a complete misunderstanding of the study&rsquo;s findings.

Direct Exchequer funding for IFI was reduced by &euro;2.582 million in 2010 compared to 2009 which is mainly attributable to savings arising from the restructuring of the inland fisheries sector. It is not possible to fully disaggregate on an item by item basis the savings which have arisen from the merger of the former regional boards; however it is clear that significant administrative savings have been made.<\/p><p>The establishment of IFI has facilitated more efficient and effective management of the inland fisheries resource. In addition, it has brought to bear a national perspective to formulating policy which is more streamlined, coherent and integrated. There is also a single allocation of funding to the organisation on a national basis. IFI are also employing new technologies, such as covert CCTV cameras, use of kayaks to conduct silent patrols along rivers and access areas which previously would have been difficult to get into unnoticed, in order to significantly augment coverage and increase time spent by officers on surveillance techniques which are more resource efficient to assist in the detection of illegal activities.<\/p><p>The Exchequer funding drawn down by IFI from my Department for 2010 (the year of IFI's establishment), 2011 and 2012 is as follows: 2010 - &euro;26.479 million; 2011 &ndash; &euro;24.971 million; 2012 &ndash; &euro;25.448 million.  The funding allocated and available for draw down in 2013 is &euro;28.062 million (including once off capital allocation of &euro;3m).  Overall, as compared with the position prior to the establishment of IFI, Exchequer funding from 2009 to 2013 has reduced by &euro;1.012 million (&euro;4.012 million if the once capital allocation of &euro;3 million in 2013 is excluded). The 2013 once-off additional capital allocation of &euro;3 million was ring-fenced for the procurement of a new Headquarters for IFI as part of a planned property rationalisation as the organisation seeks, in line with Government Policy, to exit from expensive leases. This rationalisation strategy will generate efficiencies and also savings over time in relation to lease costs and in terms of significantly better energy efficiency of the new HQ.<\/p><p>The table below details money spent on research, pay, pension, current activities and capital expenditure.

I am pleased to confirm that my Department's 2014 homeless budget will be maintained at the same level as 2013 - &euro;45 million.  While this amount represents a decrease of 3.32% on the 2012 outturn, homelessness funding from my Department has been substantially protected over the past number of years despite the wide-scale pressure for reductions in Government spending across all Departments. <\/p><p>  Earlier in 2013, I published the Government's <i>Homelessness Policy Statement<\/i> in which I outlined the Government's aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.  When I published the statement, I announced a set of indicators which will be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed.  These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland, and, in quantifying its on-going extent, will support the bringing forward of realistic and practical solutions.  I also established a high-level three-person oversight group for the purpose of reviewing the progress of the approach being advocated in the statement, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions.  The group expects to provide me with its first report shortly.   <\/p><p>  Arrangements have been put in place to provide for the delegation of homelessness funding to the lead housing authority in each of the 9 regions.  The regional approach is considered more appropriate as it helps to bring a more strategic perspective to bear on action to address homelessness, including avoidance of over-concentration of homelessness services in certain centres and promoting appropriate regional availability of services, consistent with need.  These arrangements place an emphasis on increased decision making at local level, in lieu of the existing individual project based arrangements, to improve overall efficiency and value for money, and allow greater local decision making in homeless services.  They also seek to ensure that the measures being pursued by housing authorities reflect the housing-led approach advocated in the policy statement, that actions are in place towards achieving the target of ending long-term homelessness by the end of 2016, and that evidence to support progress will be presented through the reports on the indicators. <\/p><p>  My Department is currently engaging with a number of lead housing authorities and is considering the appropriate allocation of the 2014 homeless budget so as to ensure that Section 10 homeless funding contributes to meeting the needs in the various regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee Report","counter":2022,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRR00750"},{"type":"question","counter":2023,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[44143\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRR00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will confirm the details of the new local election boundaries affecting a town (details supplied) in County Meath; the practical implications of this in terms of engineering and administration services to these areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2024,"content":"<p>In the Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee Report 2013 it is recommended that County Meath be divided into the six local electoral areas of Kells, Navan, Trim, Ratoath, Ashbourne and Laytown-Bettystown for the election of 40 members to the county council.

As a first step in this process, the Water Services Act 2013 provides for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, conforming to the conditions set out in the Act and registered under the Companies Acts.<\/p><p>  The Act provides that Irish Water will be required to submit an annual report on the performance of its functions each year to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Irish Water will also be required to submit its annual accounts to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government each year.  The 2013 Act also provides that the annual report and accounts will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The extension of the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act to include Irish Water is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.   <\/p><p>  Bord G&aacute;is has put in place appropriate programme management arrangements to establish Irish Water, provide for customer service and billing and the domestic water metering programme in line the overall implementation strategy.  Expenditure on this programme is a matter for Bord G&aacute;is\/Irish Water and these costs are not being funded from the Exchequer.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund has provided a bridging loan facility to Irish Water to meet the costs arising to the end of 2013.  This includes the initial stages of the domestic water metering programme, the full cost of which is &euro;539m excluding VAT. <\/p><p>  A key objective of the reform programme is to rationalise the cost of the current service delivery and ensure more efficient operation of water services by moving from 34 water services authorities to a single body; following enactment of comprehensive legislation later this year, these functions will transfer to Irish Water.  The comprehensive legislation will provide powers to the Commission for Energy Regulation to examine and approve the costs of the services provided by Irish Water.  The Commission is also to be provided with a statutory role to set standards of performance to be met by Irish Water and to, inter alia, promote the continuity, security, quality and sustainability of the services provided by Irish Water.  The Commission will be required to operate in an open and transparent manner and to carry out appropriate consultations with customers and stakeholders where appropriate as part of this process. <\/p><p>  Following transfer of the water services functions to Irish Water from 1 January 2014, a new funding model will be place to meet both capital and operational costs.\u00a0 Irish Water's costs in the coming years will be funded through a mix of revenue from the domestic and non-domestic sector, third party finance (such as\u00a0the\u00a0Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, EIB, bank lending and capital markets facilities) and State support which may be in the form of both equity and subvention.   <\/p><p>  As it has been decided, following the previous review of the Memorandum of Understanding by the European Commission, the IMF and the ECB, that domestic water charges will commence with effect from Quarter 4 2014, it is expected that Irish Water will issue the first bills to customers in Quarter 1 2015.  The Commission will engage in the necessary public consultations commencing in early 2014 on the design and level of domestic tariffs, based on the expected costs of Irish Water from 2015 onwards. <\/p><p>  The Exchequer proposes a direct equity investment of &euro;240m towards the capital funding of Irish Water in 2014.  This will support projects to be included in Irish Water's Capital Investment Plan and will ensure that the entity is in a position to take on the water services investment programmes of the 34 water services authorities, including some 80 projects currently in progress.  Irish Water will also finance some of its costs and the liabilities transferred from local authorities through borrowings in 2014.   <\/p><p>  The establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing from 2014.  Work is also underway on the funding model for Irish Water's operational costs, to ensure that Irish Water can fund the Service Level Agreements being put in place with local authorities for the delivery of water services in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRR02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1069"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pyrite Remediation Programme Issues","counter":2048,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRR02550"},{"type":"question","counter":2049,"qnumday":356,"qnumall":"[44432\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRR02600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide an update on the pyrite remediation scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2050,"content":"<p>Following Government approval earlier in 2013 to the imposition of levies on the quarrying and insurance sectors as a means of funding a pyrite remediation scheme preparation of the required legislation commenced.  However, legal difficulties arose during the drafting process and it was not possible to proceed on the basis intended.  My Department and I have worked over the past few months to resolve these difficulties and put in place an alternative means of funding a pyrite remediation scheme.  In this context, I am very pleased, despite the necessary constraints on public expenditure at this time, to have secured Exchequer funding to support the implementation of a pyrite remediation scheme under the auspices of the Pyrite Resolution Board.  In addition, a revised general scheme of a Bill to establish the Pyrite Resolution Board on a statutory basis has also been approved by Government.  Drafting of this legislation is a priority I have to have it published and enacted in this D&aacute;il term. <\/p><p>  The revised funding arrangements which have now been approved by Government will mean that the necessity for the more complex structures for the delivery of the pyrite remediation scheme as envisaged in the previous funding arrangements, which involved the establishment of a not-for-profit company, are no longer required.  The Pyrite Resolution Board, with support from the Housing Agency, will now implement the programme in line with the scheme which has already been outlined on the Board's website <i>.  <\/i>The Board have already made significant progress on developing appropriate systems and procedures.  They will now quickly advance work on the proposed online application and processing system and also finalise work on developing other complementary systems, with appropriate checks and balances, to ensure that effective and efficient programmes of remediation are delivered to affected homeowners.   <\/p><p>  The initial phase of the remediation programme will deal with approximately 1,000 dwellings which, it is estimated, are in need of immediate repair. Initially, &euro;10 million is being made available to my Department and additional funding will be provided over the next two years, in the context of the capital stimulus programme to be announced in early 2014, to deal with all dwellings deemed by the Pyrite Resolution Board to be in need of remediation. <\/p><p>  I continue to attach a high priority to putting in place the necessary structures to deliver a resolution to the pyrite issue for affected homeowners who have been waiting a considerable period of time for solutions.  I would like to assure affected homeowners that there will be no undue delay on my part or on that of my Department and the Pyrite Resolution Board to ensure that the pyrite remediation scheme is delivered in the shortest possible timeframe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRR02700","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Mortgages","counter":2051,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRR02725"},{"type":"question","counter":2052,"qnumday":357,"qnumall":"[44454\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRR02800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide a breakdown by housing body of local authority mortgages issued, the number in arrears, the number in arrears of more than 90 days, more than 180 days, and over a year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.

In addition, my Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes.

The term \"trafficks\" is broadly defined in the 2008 Act.  For example, the commission of a trafficking offence does not require cross-border - or even internal movement - or illegal entry into the State.  It includes recruitment; taking a person into one's custody, care or charge; and providing the person with accommodation or employment.  However, the term \"forced labour\" was not defined in the 2008 Act.<\/p><p>  In the context of a review of the potential of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) (Amendment) Act 2008 to combat forced labour conducted in my Department last year, the report published on the dedicated anti-human trafficking web site, blueblindfold.gov.ie in January 2013, recommended that, in the interest of clarity, the term \"forced labour\" should be defined in legislation in line with the definition in the ILO Convention No. 29 of 1930 concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour.

Consequently, it is likely that activities constituting forced labour could also be prosecuted under a number of other offences, for example, false imprisonment, blackmail, assault, the coercion offence under the Non-fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, offences under employment law and health and safety legislation, immigration law, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRT01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Districts","counter":2133,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRT01350"},{"type":"question","counter":2134,"qnumday":387,"qnumall":"[44118\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRT01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"in view of the fact that the Kanturk district is being amalgamated with the Mallow district, if he will confirm that the same number of garda&iacute; will be available in the Kanturk district as there was in December 2012.

The appointments from this competition have been made and on this occasion did not include any members of the PSNI. The same notifications will be put in place when future promotion competitions are being held in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Board, which was established in 2001, makes recommendations to the Minister in relation to the management of offenders serving long sentences.  While it is open to the Parole Board to make any recommendation, the experience with the Parole Board is that life sentenced prisoners are normally reviewed on a number of occasions over a number of years before any substantial concessions are recommended.<\/p><p>It is important to note that a life sentence is indeterminate and there is no guaranteed release date.  However, it does not always mean life in prison.  Persons released into the community continue to serve their sentences, subject to conditions, while on release.  While in the community, life sentence prisoners are required to be under the supervision of the Probation Service.  The Probation Service provide Progress Reports to the Irish Prison Service outlining resettlement and reintegration progress and will report on any risk management concerns a prisoner may present.  Where it is reported to the Irish Prison Service that a life sentenced prisoner in the community is failing to abide by the conditions of their release, that person may be refused a further period of temporary release and be taken back into custody.  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may return a prisoner to prison where the prisoner is in breach of their temporary release conditions.  The Governor of the prison must conduct a hearing during which the prisoner is afforded due process before a decision is made as to whether the temporary release should be revoked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRU01150","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Charitable Lotteries Scheme","counter":2180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRU01250"},{"type":"question","counter":2181,"qnumday":404,"qnumall":"[44392\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRU01300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he will provide in tabular form for each year since 2005 to date in 2013, the amounts paid to each charity from the charitable lotteries compensation fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":2182,"content":"<p>The Charitable Lotteries Scheme was established in 1997 to provide assistance to the promoters of certain private charitable lotteries that have products similar to products sold by the National Lottery.

My view is that persons affected by adoption should be provided with a statutory right to as much information as possible within permissible Constitutional boundaries.  I am anxious to bring the Heads of bill before Government at the earliest possible date.  The constitutional and legal context within which the development of these legislative proposals must be undertaken is complex. <\/p><p>  It is intended that the Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to be responsible for providing access to adoption records, in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to establish and maintain a National Index of Adoption Records, the purpose of which is to help an applicant for adoption information identify the location of his or her adoption records.  The intention is that the Bill is to provide that either the Adoption Authority, the HSE or an accredited body may hold adoption records, with the Authority having overall charge of those records. <\/p><p>  It is also intended that the Bill will provide for placing the National Contact Preference Register on a statutory basis.  The purpose of the Register is to allow a person affected by adoption to enter his or her name on the Register with a view to receiving information about another person from whom he or she has been separated as a result of adoption and also to indicate a preference as to whether or not contact is being sought with that person.  <\/p><p>  A National Tracing Service will be established under the provisions of the Bill, the operation of which will be subject to guidelines to be set out in regulations.  It is intended that the Tracing Service is to be made available to an adopted person, a birth parent and a relative of either an adopted person or a birth parent, and that the Adoption Authority is to have overall responsibility for providing the tracing service.<\/p><p>  However I wish to advise that complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen during the course of  preparation of the Heads of Bill  and that detailed on-going consideration of these issues is under way in my Department and in the Office of the Attorney General.  At this stage is it not certain that the problems that have arisen can be overcome by the introduction of legislation and further legal advice has been sought in an effort to see if  legislation that meets my policy objectives can be drafted within constitutional parameters.<\/p><p>  With regard to individual cases, information and tracing inquiries are normally dealt with by the organisation that arranged the original adoption placement.  If the adoption agency has closed, the Health Service Executive Adoption Information and Tracing Service, or the agency that now holds the placement records, will deal with the inquiry.  Queries in relation to the handling of a request for information and tracing should be addressed to the agency dealing with the request or the Adoption Authority as the body with responsibility for regulating accredited bodies who provide adoption services. <\/p><p>  A representative of the Adoption Rights Alliance attended a recent meeting which I held with an individual in relation to adoption information and tracing.  At this meeting I agreed to meet representatives of the Adoption Rights Alliance specifically to discuss the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and I invited them to make a submission in this regard in advance of the meeting. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRX03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Cafes Expenditure","counter":2375,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRY00125"},{"type":"question","counter":2376,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[44566\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRY00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding an application for funding to her Department in respect of an organisation (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":2377,"content":"<p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Funding in the region of &euro;1 million is available in 2013 from my Department for fit-out, refurbishment works or building enhancement projects for the startup of new Youth Caf&eacute;s.

","asker":"1107","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2393,"content":"<p>The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme. This is a necessary feature of the scheme due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person's contribution. <\/p><p>  The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State.  It negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process. This method of negotiation is necessary in order to ensure that the State obtains the best value for each individual in a nursing home and to comply with competition law.  <\/p><p>  In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:<\/p><p>- costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money,<\/p><p>- price(s) previously charged,<\/p><p>- local market price, and<\/p><p>- Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.<\/p><p>  If price negotiations break down, a three stage review process can be invoked. Details of the process are set out on the NTPF website.<\/p><p>  The services which fall within the scope of long-term residential care services, and which are covered by the cost agreed with the NTPF, are:<\/p><p>- nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person,<\/p><p>- basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living,<\/p><p>- bed and board, and<\/p><p>- laundry service. <\/p><p>  In determining the services covered by the NHSS, it was considered very important that nursing home residents and taxpayers would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, goods and services that are already available to individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the goods and services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same items or service.<\/p><p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drugs Payment Scheme, is unaffected by the NHSS. In other words, a person can continue to receive goods and services in accordance with the terms of these other schemes regardless of whether they are in a private nursing home or elsewhere. <\/p><p>  It should be noted that certain items of expenditure, termed allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment of an applicant for the NHSS.  These include certain medical expenses. <\/p><p>  There have been no changes to the goods and services covered by the NHSS since it commenced. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a review. This review will consider the sustainability of the Scheme as well as looking at community based services.  It will also include an examination of the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating\/setting prices. It is envisaged that the review will be completed in early 2014.<\/p><p>  Finally, under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, the registered provider must agree a contract with each resident within one month of their admission. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should not be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.<\/p><p>  The Health Act 2007 gives statutory responsibility to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority, for the independent inspection and registration of public and private nursing homes.  The Chief Inspector has the power to refuse to register, attach conditions to a registration or cancel the registration of a designated centre in the event of non-compliance with the Regulations or the <i>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland<\/i> .<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRY01400","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Nurses","counter":2394,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRY01450"},{"type":"question","counter":2395,"qnumday":478,"qnumall":"[44093\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRY01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a decision has been made on an application for registration to the nursing board in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1051","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2396,"content":"<p>The information regarding Nurse Registration is a matter for The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland (formerly An Bord Altranais).

In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004. <\/p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act, inter alia, provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants occasioned by their disability to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.  <\/p><p>  There has been a very significant rise in overall activity around the assessment process in recent years in respect of the children now encompassed by the process.  The number of assessment reports received in 2012 was 3,505 which is over 400 applications more than in 2010.  It is worth noting that in the period 2010-2012 over 8,200 reports were completed.  While the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process given the number and complexity of cases, it is endeavouring to address the issue from available resources. <\/p><p>  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child.  <\/p><p>  In addition, targeted action plans have been put in place since early 2011.  Measures have included: prioritising assessments, holding additional clinics, contracting the private sector to conduct assessments and reconfiguring resources to target areas of greatest need.  These plans are monitored on a monthly basis by the HSE centrally. <\/p><p>  Following the publication of a report commissioned from the National Disability Authority by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring disability services for children into geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme which is underway.  The NDA report indicated that where integrated teams were operating, the assessment of need process ran more smoothly.  It found that there was no one single solution to remove all of the challenges to operating a statutory assessment of need.  Officials from my Department are currently engaging with the HSE and the NDA to further consider the findings contained in this Report.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRBB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Issues","counter":2581,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRBB03150"},{"type":"question","counter":2582,"qnumday":539,"qnumall":"[44447\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRBB03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason front-line staff are not being replaced while waiting lists for services are growing, with 34,617 persons, mostly young children, waiting for speech and language therapy, of whom 6,500 are waiting longer than a year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The level of health services to be delivered within the available funding has been set out in the HSE National Service Plan, which I approved in January.  <\/p><p>  The Government has decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet its fiscal and budgetary targets.  The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction.  This policy requires the health service to reduce its workforce to 98,938 wholetime equivalent employees by the end of 2013.  However, the HSE can make staff appointments once it remains within its overall employment ceiling and has the financial resources to do so.<\/p><p>  With regard to the HSE's Speech and Language Therapy Service, I understand that each individual that presents to the Service has an initial assessment to determine their individual need for therapy.  The therapist, in conjunction with the parent(s) or carer, will determine the severity of the individual's difficulties and prioritise for therapy accordingly.  The level of intervention is in line with clinic policy, age and severity of the diagnosis.  The waiting period for intervention is dependent on the nature and severity of the disorder following assessment. <\/p><p>  The HSE aims to ensure that the resources available are used to best effect, in order to provide assessment and ongoing therapy to children and adults in line with their prioritised needs.  Along with the significant investment in area of speech and language therapists employed in recent years, a range of new approaches have been developed and used in many Speech and Language Therapy services across the country.  These include providing structures, training and support to parents \/carers so that they can work to help improve the individual's speech and language.  In addition, therapy is delivered in group settings where appropriate.  The HSE has stated that it is committed to working in partnership with other service providers to achieve maximum benefits for children and adults with speech and language therapy requirements, and aims to ensure that, the speech and language therapy resources available are used in the most effective manner possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRBB03300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alcohol Pricing","counter":2584,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRBB03350"},{"type":"question","counter":2585,"qnumday":540,"qnumall":"[44451\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRBB03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he expects to introduce minimum pricing legislation for alcohol products; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Since the programme commenced in 1995, over 700 patients have received cochlear implants. Beaumont Hospital carried out ninety cochlear implants in 2012 (42 children and 48 adults). The routine practice in Ireland, so far, has been to implant one side only. <\/p><p>  It is now considered best practice worldwide that children should have the option of bilateral implants, and this is reflected in the recommendation of the report of the National Review of Audiology Services which was carried out by the HSE in 2009. The aim of that Review was to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide, and to formulate a national plan for the services. Its report was published by the HSE in 2011 and provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services. The Report recommended continued ring-fenced support for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children. <\/p><p>  The HSE has developed a proposal, in liaison with Beaumont Hospital, to introduce a bilateral cochlear implant programme in Ireland. In doing so, the HSE has engaged with many stakeholders. Introduction of bilateral cochlear implantation is expected to involve additional staff, equipment and capital works. The resources required will be considered in the context of the Health Estimate for 2014, announced on 15 October last, and the development of the HSE's National Service Plan 2014. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRCC03900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Data","counter":2644,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRCC03950"},{"type":"question","counter":2645,"qnumday":559,"qnumall":"[44586\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRCC04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number, according to the latest data available to him, of children aged five or under who are currently holders of a medical card or of a general practitioner-only medical card; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The standard approach to the treatment of Lyme Disease is to follow the guidance laid out in the <i>Infectious Diseases Society of America<\/i> guidelines on the clinical assessment, treatment and prevention of Lyme Disease.  This is accepted as being the most up to date synthesis of best available evidence on the clinical management of Lyme Disease and treatment of Lyme Disease is based upon this guidance.<\/p><p>  The acute tertiary hospitals in Ireland have the diagnostic and treatment facilities and personnel for the management of Lyme Disease.  In addition, a network of infectious disease specialists is available in all the major centres to provide consultative, expert advice in the management of Lyme borreliosis.  I have been advised by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre that there were eight cases of Lyme Neuroborreliosis notified in 2012.  Lyme Neuroborreliosis is at the more severe end of the spectrum of Lyme borreliosis and as such it is possible that there may be more people with the milder form of the disease.  Given the numbers of cases of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, I am confident that the facilities available for the diagnosis and treatment of the condition are commensurate with the burden which the disease imposes.<\/p><p>  The diagnosis of a case of Lyme Disease can be difficult.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial screening step.  However, screening EIA's can be insufficiently specific and can give other false-positive reactions in the presence of various other infections from syphilis to glandular fever.  In addition, sera from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  Samples giving reactive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second stage immunoblot test.  The use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this two stage approach gives a greater degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme Disease.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRDD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Expenditure","counter":2652,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRDD00600"},{"type":"question","counter":2653,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[44598\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRDD00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the special delivery unit is being cut by 64% in 2014; the expected impact of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure.<\/p><p>  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation.

Relatively complex primary legislation and detailed regulations would be required in order to provide a GP service to persons on the basis of their having a particular illness. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. Funding allocated for the extension of a GP service without fees to people with particular medical conditions has been used to mitigate the supplementary budget requirement of the HSE and support existing levels of service.<\/p><p>  Following the recent announcement to commence the roll out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees, I will engage with all relevant stake-holders, as appropriate, in relation to implementation and administrative arrangements.<\/p><p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. A well functioning health system should provide equal access to healthcare for its patients on the basis of health needs, rather than ability to pay.

The objectives of this programme are:<\/p><p>  - To offer a hearing screen to newborn babies using an agreed national protocol;<\/p><p>  - To screen babies using the agreed national protocol for screening within 4 weeks of birth, and by 44 weeks gestational age for babies who have been in a Special Care Baby Unit or Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for more than 48 hours;<\/p><p>  - To ensure timely referral and assessment to integrated audiology services of babies identified as requiring assessment;<\/p><p>  - To ensure that all babies with permanent childhood hearing impairment receive effective and acceptable intervention, care and support that meets their individual needs, including appropriate referral to other services such as ENT and allied health professionals and other statutory bodies\/agencies such as Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p>  Additionally, if a baby passes the screening but if the parents have concerns at a later stage, they can highlight these concerns to their Public Health Nurse or Area Medical Officer and be referred into Audiology Services for re-assessment.<\/p><p>  The HSE chairs a Collaborative Working Group which has representation from DeafHear, HSE Audiology Services, HSE Speech and Language Therapy Services, Visiting Teachers for the Deaf and the Beaumont Cochlear Implant Programme.

Once an audiologist diagnoses a child with a hearing impairment, they refer on to the appropriate professionals.<\/p><p>  UNHS has proven high sensitivity and specificity. With this sensitive procedure for hearing screening, a child with a permanent hearing impairment (PCHI) can now be identified much earlier, within 4 to 5 weeks of birth, and the hearing status of each ear determined accurately. This means a child can start receiving appropriate support within the first six months of life. The core objectives of UNHS are described as &quot;1-3-6&quot; goals which are based on international programmes:<\/p><p>  - Babies to be screened by 1 month of age;<\/p><p>  - Audiology assessment completed by 3 months of age;<\/p><p>  - Initiation of appropriate medical and audiological services, and early intervention services, by 6 months of age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRDD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"question","counter":2694,"qnumday":577,"qnumall":"[44701\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200065#WRDD04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding community waiting lists for basic hearing tests of children up to 24 months and access to supporting routine hearing services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":2695,"content":"<p>In order to reduce the current audiology waiting lists a number of measures are being taken by the HSE.

The initiative - the <i>Philanthropic Leverage Initiative <\/i>- was designed to encourage philanthropic sponsorship and endowment of the arts from private sources.  The initiative has provided an incentive to arts organisations to proactively seek new funding relationships with sponsors which deliver private sector financial support, thereby increasing overall funding available to the arts.  The initiative proved very successful with a multiplier of 4.26 in philanthropic donations being leveraged for the arts.  The arts got a boost of over &euro;1 million last year, of which less than one-fifth came from the public purse.  A full list of awards under this scheme can be viewed on my Department's website at .<\/p><p>  This year, &euro;210,000 is available to arts organisations under the Initiative.  The terms are as follows:<\/p><p> - Up to &euro;5,000 of funds can be accessed through the scheme if the organisation can match each &euro;1 from the taxpayer with &euro;2 from private sector sources;<\/p><p> - Up to &euro;10,000 if each &euro;1 from the taxpayer can be matched by &euro;3 from private sector funding;<\/p><p> - Up to &euro;15,000 if each &euro;1 from the taxpayer can be matched by &euro;4 from private sector funding.<\/p><p>  In 2013, priority was given to arts and culture organisations seeking support for projects that include an education component.  This is to support the <i>Arts in Education Charter,<\/i> which I launched in conjunction with Mr Ruairi Quinn, T.D., Minister for Education and Skills.  Accordingly, the Initiative, while continuing to provide an incentive to arts organisations to engage in fundraising, will also encourage arts and culture organisations to engage creatively with children and young people and add to their education.  In doing so, they will be helping to foster the artists and the audiences of the future.<\/p><p>  I should mention also that in October 2012 I hosted and chaired a forum on <i>Philanthropy and the Arts <\/i>in Smock Alley Theatre.  It featured speakers from key philanthropic organisations and the arts in Ireland.  The conference was very well attended and generated very positive feedback.  There is a full report of the conference on my Department's website.<\/p><p>  Parallel to these initiatives, the Arts Council is undertaking an initiative - <i>RAISE: Building Fundraising Capacity <\/i> - which dovetails with the work in my Department.  The initiative consists of a programme which is providing one-to-one professional support to selected arts organisations for two years to assist in planning and implementing a tailored fundraising programme for each organisation.  Eight leading Irish arts organisations are aiming to raise &euro;10 million in private funding over the next five years as part of this Arts Council initiative.  <\/p><p>  My Department has also provided support to Business to Arts (a not-for-profit organisation working to support resilience and transformation in the cultural sector through research, innovation and partnership) for a number of years and, in each of the last three years, this has been allocated to delivery of the New Stream Programme, which builds fundraising skills in the cultural sector in Ireland (The Bank of America Merrill Lynch investment in this project is &euro;400k over three years).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200067#WRP02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2873,"content":"<p>Question No. 322 answered with Question No. 65.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme Issues","counter":2874,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200067#WRP02850"},{"type":"question","counter":2875,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[44794\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200067#WRP02900","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which final agreement has been reached with traditional turf cutters displaced by EU or national conservation orders throughout the country; the extent to which he expects to be in the position to resolve issues in relation to the outstanding locations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The group from Clara Bog commenced turf cutting at the relocation site in Killeranny, County Offaly, in June 2012, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have now been accommodated. Turf cutting for the 2013 season took place on this site in April last.  My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from the group from Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog will be able to commence turf cutting in one of the relocation sites from the 2014 turf cutting season.<\/p><p>  Progress has been made with a view to the relocation of 7 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog special area of conservation in County Kildare to Timahoe North, County Kildare, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na.  My Department envisages that qualifying turf cutters from Ballynafagh Bog will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season, provided that final agreement is reached with them.  Progress has also been made with a view to the relocation of a small group of 3 qualifying turf cutters from Ballynamona Bog and Corkip Lough special area of conservation in County Roscommon to Togher, County Roscommon, which is in the ownership of Bord na M&oacute;na.  My Department envisages that this group of qualifying turf cutters will be able to commence cutting in the relocation site during the 2014 turf cutting season, provided that final agreement is reached with them.<\/p><p>  I am advised that of the remaining 49 raised bog special areas of conservation, potential relocation sites have been identified for a further 32 bogs and work is ongoing on identifying and investigating sites.  Relocation is unlikely to be required, or is likely to be small-scale, for another 16 raised bog special areas of conservation due, for example, to the small number that had been cutting turf on these sites during the relevant five year period and would qualify for the relocation option available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.<\/p><p>  Relocation is a very complex process, in terms of investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity, the infrastructure\/drainage works required, establishing the number that can be accommodated on the site, the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease, and possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements.  In that regard, Bord na M&oacute;na has assessed in the region of 70 potential relocation sites at the request of my Department.  Bord na M&oacute;na has also commenced negotiations with landowners in relation to the purchase or long-term lease of sites.<\/p><p>  There are 2 raised bog special areas of conservation in County Kildare affected by the cessation of turf cutting - Ballynafagh Bog and Mouds Bog.  58 applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme have been received and acknowledged by my Department in respect of Ballynafagh Bog and 106 applications have been received and acknowledged by my Department in respect of Mouds Bog.  28 and 40 of these groups of applicants, respectively, have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog.  61 payments and 12 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of the applications received from Ballynafagh Bog and 105 payments and 65 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of the applications received from Mouds Bog.<\/p><p>  Lattins Bog, also known as Mouds North Bog, in County Kildare has been identified as a potential relocation site for turf cutters from Mouds Bog.  Bord na M&oacute;na had produced a preliminary suitability assessment report and stratigraphy assessment report for the relocation site.  It has now undertaken a full suitability assessment for the site and my Department has provided a copy of the assessment report to the Secretary of the Committee of the Kildare Turf Cutters Association.<\/p><p>  There are also 2 natural heritage area raised bogs in County Kildare designated under national law in accordance with the provisions of the Wildlife Acts - Carbury Bog and Hodgestown Bog.  In May 2010, the previous Government decided that turf cutting should come to an end on all raised bog natural heritage areas at the end of 2013.  However, as set out in the Programme for Government, the current Government undertook to review the situation with regard to raised bog natural heritage areas.<\/p><p>  This review is currently underway and the future of turf cutting on such sites is being considered as part of that review.  It is my intention that the review will provide clarity for turf cutters and landowners in advance of the 2014 turf cutting season and my Department will be contacting individual landowners and turf cutters on these sites in due course.<\/p><p>  A payment of &euro;1,500, index-linked, or a supply of 15 tonnes of cut turf per annum is available under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme to applicants while awaiting relocation to non-designated bogs. <\/p><p>  Following the D&aacute;il motion of 7 March 2012, which called on the Government to &#8220;engage actively with the European Commission to seek a resolution within the terms of the Habitats Directive, and to prepare and submit a National Raised Bog Restoration Plan to the Commission as a matter of urgency&#8221;, I secured the agreement of the European Commissioner for the Environment for the development of a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, in keeping with the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke.  The approach of the national plan may unlock some flexibility, within the terms of the EU Habitats Directive, in regard to the most difficult of sites, where relocation options are limited.<\/p><p>  To progress the preparation of the plan, my Department engaged a team of specialists (RPS) to provide the scientific basis for raised bog conservation in Ireland.  RPS has been working with my Department and the Peatlands Council to prepare a National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, a draft of which I hope to make available for consultation before the end of the year.  Further information on the work of RPS can be found at .<\/p><p>  The clear majority of domestic turf-cutters on the raised bog special areas of conservation are now engaging with my Department in finding acceptable solutions within the law.  The door is still open for others to engage in this process with me, my Department and with other stakeholders to address the needs of turf cutters and other interested parties.  Such engagement would, I am sure, help to address the needs of turf cutters more speedily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200067#WRP03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1046"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2878,"content":"<p>Question No. 324 answered with Question No. 107.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2879,"content":"<p>Question No. 325 answered with Question No. 323.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Funding","counter":2881,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200068#WRQ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":2882,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[44797\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200068#WRQ00200","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the extent to which his Department or bodies under his aegis have financially supported directly or indirectly various bodies of an artistic or cultural nature in County Kildare in each of the past four years to date; his expectations in this regard for the current and future years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":2883,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[44799\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200068#WRQ00300","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"in relation to an examination of applications for grant aid from local community based musical or theatrical groups, if the existence of some such groups who have never received such assistance has come to attention; if any evaluation will be done with a view to addressing such issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"question","counter":2884,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[44800\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200068#WRQ00400","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"on the examination of applications for grant aid from local community based musical or theatrical groups in County Kildare, if the existence of some such groups who have never received such assistance has come to attention; if any evaluation will be done with a view to addressing such issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1046"},{"type":"speech","counter":2885,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 326, 328 and 329 together.<\/p><p>  The Government's policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, to increase access to and participation in the arts, and to make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life. As the Deputy will be aware, primary responsibility for the promotion of the arts at all levels, throughout the country is devolved to the Arts Council.  The Council is funded by my Department and is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations, including funding decisions. In 2013, the Arts Council will receive an allocation of over &euro;60.6 million in current, capital and EU Presidency funding.  Details of all funding provided by the Arts Council to arts practitioners, arts groups and venues, including arts centres, are available on the Council's website at .  In a wider context, the Arts Council support of a range of arts forms is set out in its strategic overview document entitled <i>Developing the Arts in Ireland: Arts Council Strategic Overview 2011-2013<\/i>.

TDI have been commissioned internationally by such clients as the United Nations, the European Union, the World Bank, the World Tourism Organisation, the Irish American Cultural Institute and a range of multinational companies. Government Departments and Agencies from EU Member States and from countries worldwide have also engaged TDI for expert advice and analysis.  In Ireland, TDI has carried out work for the Marine Institute, Failte Ireland, Udaras na Gaeltacht as well as a host of Local Authorities and regional organisations.

I am advised that the results in this report are based on sound economic principles and have been peer reviewed before publication.  IFI have confirmed that the Deputy is correct that 19,899 salmon licenses were sold in 2011. However, it is important to be cognisant of the specific question asked in the published survey, as well as the incidence of targeting multiple species.<\/p><p>  At no point does this study reference a specific monetary value for any individual species. I understand that there has been comment attributed to a UK based website on the published study.  IFI advise that having examined the figures put forward in that comment, it appears that the estimated maximum participation values for one species were erroneously mixed and inappropriately extrapolated with average spend figures for all species which unfortunately underpin a complete misunderstanding of the study&rsquo;s findings.

Direct Exchequer funding for IFI was reduced by &euro;2.582 million in 2010 compared to 2009 which is mainly attributable to savings arising from the restructuring of the inland fisheries sector. It is not possible to fully disaggregate on an item by item basis the savings which have arisen from the merger of the former regional boards; however it is clear that significant administrative savings have been made.<\/p><p>The establishment of IFI has facilitated more efficient and effective management of the inland fisheries resource. In addition, it has brought to bear a national perspective to formulating policy which is more streamlined, coherent and integrated. There is also a single allocation of funding to the organisation on a national basis. IFI are also employing new technologies, such as covert CCTV cameras, use of kayaks to conduct silent patrols along rivers and access areas which previously would have been difficult to get into unnoticed, in order to significantly augment coverage and increase time spent by officers on surveillance techniques which are more resource efficient to assist in the detection of illegal activities.<\/p><p>The Exchequer funding drawn down by IFI from my Department for 2010 (the year of IFI's establishment), 2011 and 2012 is as follows: 2010 - &euro;26.479 million; 2011 &ndash; &euro;24.971 million; 2012 &ndash; &euro;25.448 million.  The funding allocated and available for draw down in 2013 is &euro;28.062 million (including once off capital allocation of &euro;3m).

The 2013 once-off additional capital allocation of &euro;3 million was ring-fenced for the procurement of a new Headquarters for IFI as part of a planned property rationalisation as the organisation seeks, in line with Government Policy, to exit from expensive leases.

Expenditure cuts of &euro;1.6 billion were central to this adjustment and difficult decisions were required across all Departmental budgets. By its very nature, this process involved detailed and ongoing consideration at Departmental and Ministerial level of the range of potential expenditure reductions, some of which were only mooted shortly before settling of the Budget by Government.  As part of this process, a decision was taken by Government on the proposal of the Department of Social Protection to reduce by &euro;5m the amount required to be paid to my Department by the Department of Social Protection for free television licences. This measure will result in RT&Eacute;'s licence fee income being cut by over &euro;4.6m from the start of 2014, as well as a reduction of around &euro;350,000 in the amount available to the independent production sector through the BAI's Sound &amp;amp; Vision Fund.<\/p><p>  The BAI's Five Year Review of the Funding of the Public Service Broadcasters (PSBs) was published in July of this year and made a number of recommendations in relation to the future funding of the PSBs.

RT&Eacute; continues to make considerable efforts to achieve its target of breaking even at the end of this year and I am informed that RT&Eacute; remains on course to achieve this outcome.

I am pleased to confirm that my Department's 2014 homeless budget will be maintained at the same level as 2013 - &euro;45 million.  While this amount represents a decrease of 3.32% on the 2012 outturn, homelessness funding from my Department has been substantially protected over the past number of years despite the wide-scale pressure for reductions in Government spending across all Departments. <\/p><p>  Earlier in 2013, I published the Government's <i>Homelessness Policy Statement<\/i> in which I outlined the Government's aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016.  The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness.  The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.  When I published the statement, I announced a set of indicators which will be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed.  These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland, and, in quantifying its on-going extent, will support the bringing forward of realistic and practical solutions.  I also established a high-level three-person oversight group for the purpose of reviewing the progress of the approach being advocated in the statement, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions.  The group expects to provide me with its first report shortly.   <\/p><p>  Arrangements have been put in place to provide for the delegation of homelessness funding to the lead housing authority in each of the 9 regions.  The regional approach is considered more appropriate as it helps to bring a more strategic perspective to bear on action to address homelessness, including avoidance of over-concentration of homelessness services in certain centres and promoting appropriate regional availability of services, consistent with need.  These arrangements place an emphasis on increased decision making at local level, in lieu of the existing individual project based arrangements, to improve overall efficiency and value for money, and allow greater local decision making in homeless services.  They also seek to ensure that the measures being pursued by housing authorities reflect the housing-led approach advocated in the policy statement, that actions are in place towards achieving the target of ending long-term homelessness by the end of 2016, and that evidence to support progress will be presented through the reports on the indicators. <\/p><p>  My Department is currently engaging with a number of lead housing authorities and is considering the appropriate allocation of the 2014 homeless budget so as to ensure that Section 10 homeless funding contributes to meeting the needs in the various regions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200069#WRR00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee Report","counter":2938,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200069#WRR00750"},{"type":"question","counter":2939,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[44143\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200069#WRR00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will confirm the details of the new local election boundaries affecting a town (details supplied) in County Meath; the practical implications of this in terms of engineering and administration services to these areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2940,"content":"<p>In the Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee Report 2013 it is recommended that County Meath be divided into the six local electoral areas of Kells, Navan, Trim, Ratoath, Ashbourne and Laytown-Bettystown for the election of 40 members to the county council.

As a first step in this process, the Water Services Act 2013 provides for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, conforming to the conditions set out in the Act and registered under the Companies Acts.<\/p><p>  The Act provides that Irish Water will be required to submit an annual report on the performance of its functions each year to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Irish Water will also be required to submit its annual accounts to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government each year.  The 2013 Act also provides that the annual report and accounts will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The extension of the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act to include Irish Water is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.   <\/p><p>  Bord G&aacute;is has put in place appropriate programme management arrangements to establish Irish Water, provide for customer service and billing and the domestic water metering programme in line the overall implementation strategy.  Expenditure on this programme is a matter for Bord G&aacute;is\/Irish Water and these costs are not being funded from the Exchequer.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund has provided a bridging loan facility to Irish Water to meet the costs arising to the end of 2013.  This includes the initial stages of the domestic water metering programme, the full cost of which is &euro;539m excluding VAT. <\/p><p>  A key objective of the reform programme is to rationalise the cost of the current service delivery and ensure more efficient operation of water services by moving from 34 water services authorities to a single body; following enactment of comprehensive legislation later this year, these functions will transfer to Irish Water.  The comprehensive legislation will provide powers to the Commission for Energy Regulation to examine and approve the costs of the services provided by Irish Water.  The Commission is also to be provided with a statutory role to set standards of performance to be met by Irish Water and to, inter alia, promote the continuity, security, quality and sustainability of the services provided by Irish Water.  The Commission will be required to operate in an open and transparent manner and to carry out appropriate consultations with customers and stakeholders where appropriate as part of this process. <\/p><p>  Following transfer of the water services functions to Irish Water from 1 January 2014, a new funding model will be place to meet both capital and operational costs.\u00a0 Irish Water's costs in the coming years will be funded through a mix of revenue from the domestic and non-domestic sector, third party finance (such as\u00a0the\u00a0Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, EIB, bank lending and capital markets facilities) and State support which may be in the form of both equity and subvention.   <\/p><p>  As it has been decided, following the previous review of the Memorandum of Understanding by the European Commission, the IMF and the ECB, that domestic water charges will commence with effect from Quarter 4 2014, it is expected that Irish Water will issue the first bills to customers in Quarter 1 2015.  The Commission will engage in the necessary public consultations commencing in early 2014 on the design and level of domestic tariffs, based on the expected costs of Irish Water from 2015 onwards. <\/p><p>  The Exchequer proposes a direct equity investment of &euro;240m towards the capital funding of Irish Water in 2014.  This will support projects to be included in Irish Water's Capital Investment Plan and will ensure that the entity is in a position to take on the water services investment programmes of the 34 water services authorities, including some 80 projects currently in progress.  Irish Water will also finance some of its costs and the liabilities transferred from local authorities through borrowings in 2014.   <\/p><p>  The establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing from 2014.  Work is also underway on the funding model for Irish Water's operational costs, to ensure that Irish Water can fund the Service Level Agreements being put in place with local authorities for the delivery of water services in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200069#WRR02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1069"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pyrite Remediation Programme Issues","counter":2964,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200069#WRR02550"},{"type":"question","counter":2965,"qnumday":356,"qnumall":"[44432\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200069#WRR02600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide an update on the pyrite remediation scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":2966,"content":"<p>Following Government approval earlier in 2013 to the imposition of levies on the quarrying and insurance sectors as a means of funding a pyrite remediation scheme preparation of the required legislation commenced.  However, legal difficulties arose during the drafting process and it was not possible to proceed on the basis intended.  My Department and I have worked over the past few months to resolve these difficulties and put in place an alternative means of funding a pyrite remediation scheme.  In this context, I am very pleased, despite the necessary constraints on public expenditure at this time, to have secured Exchequer funding to support the implementation of a pyrite remediation scheme under the auspices of the Pyrite Resolution Board.  In addition, a revised general scheme of a Bill to establish the Pyrite Resolution Board on a statutory basis has also been approved by Government.  Drafting of this legislation is a priority I have to have it published and enacted in this D&aacute;il term. <\/p><p>  The revised funding arrangements which have now been approved by Government will mean that the necessity for the more complex structures for the delivery of the pyrite remediation scheme as envisaged in the previous funding arrangements, which involved the establishment of a not-for-profit company, are no longer required.

In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.<\/p><p>Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have demonstrated sensitivity over the years in dealing with such cases.  In 2010 and 2012 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, reflecting the Central Bank's Codes of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, in consultation with the County and City Managers Association.  These have facilitated local authorities in providing a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty, by means of the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which includes a suite of short term and long terms options depending on the circumstances of the borrower.  It is anticipated that this initiative will allow a proportion of distressed mortgagees to restructure their repayment schedules and thereby alleviate the current pressures being felt.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the flexibility shown by local authorities in dealing with borrowers in difficulty, it is inevitable that a proportion of individuals will find themselves with loans which are unsustainable in the long term, and, in these circumstances, a borrower may opt for a voluntary surrender of the property.  In other cases, and increasingly where occupiers have abandoned the property, it may be necessary to regain ownership by means of legal action.

To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing conditions and explore the full range of solutions to address housing needs.  The financial parameters within which we will continue to operate rule out a return to large capital funded construction programmes.  The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.<\/p><p>  In July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing.  I am monitoring expenditure under my Department&rsquo;s housing programme for 2013, together with the level of contractual commitments extending into 2014, with a view to a decision later this year on approving some limited new construction and house purchases over the period to end 2014.  In addition Budget 2014 provides for the allocation of a further &euro;50 million to fund infrastructural investment primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million to recommence a State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants.  When this is taken into account, funding for housing for next year is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.<\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing will also continue to be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing; other funding mechanisms to increase the supply of permanent new social housing will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  In addition, my Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes.  In spite of the current challenging circumstances, I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2013 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units, and it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will be provided for social housing in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200070#WRS01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Provision","counter":3004,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200070#WRS01750"},{"type":"question","counter":3005,"qnumday":371,"qnumall":"[44674\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200070#WRS01800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will provide an update regarding the announcement made on 19 July 2012 that his Department would be allocating &euro;100 million for social housing which would result in the provision of 800 new units across the country; the number of units that have been completed in each local authority area; and his views on the way this will impact on the 500 new units that were announced in budget 2014.

The term \"trafficks\" is broadly defined in the 2008 Act.  For example, the commission of a trafficking offence does not require cross-border - or even internal movement - or illegal entry into the State.  It includes recruitment; taking a person into one's custody, care or charge; and providing the person with accommodation or employment.  However, the term \"forced labour\" was not defined in the 2008 Act.<\/p><p>  In the context of a review of the potential of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) (Amendment) Act 2008 to combat forced labour conducted in my Department last year, the report published on the dedicated anti-human trafficking web site, blueblindfold.gov.ie in January 2013, recommended that, in the interest of clarity, the term \"forced labour\" should be defined in legislation in line with the definition in the ILO Convention No. 29 of 1930 concerning Forced or Compulsory Labour. Subject to certain specified exceptions, the ILO convention defines forced labour as \"all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the person has not offered himself voluntarily\".  <\/p><p>  As the deputy will be aware, I availed of the opportunity afforded by the  Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) (Amendment) Act 2013 to clarify the definition of forced labour in these terms.  The ILO definition is the international standard, and the new legislation now enacted ensures that there can be no doubt as to our fully complying with that standard and our having in place rigorous criminal law sanctions applicable to all of those who engage in human trafficking for forced labour.<\/p><p>  It is important to note that forced labour covers a diverse array of exploitative behaviours ranging from infringement of labour regulations, at one end of the spectrum, to human trafficking, etc., at the other.  Consequently, it is likely that activities constituting forced labour could also be prosecuted under a number of other offences, for example, false imprisonment, blackmail, assault, the coercion offence under the Non-fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, offences under employment law and health and safety legislation, immigration law, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200071#WRT01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Districts","counter":3049,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200071#WRT01350"},{"type":"question","counter":3050,"qnumday":387,"qnumall":"[44118\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200071#WRT01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"in view of the fact that the Kanturk district is being amalgamated with the Mallow district, if he will confirm that the same number of garda&iacute; will be available in the Kanturk district as there was in December 2012.

The Probation Service provide Progress Reports to the Irish Prison Service outlining resettlement and reintegration progress and will report on any risk management concerns a prisoner may present.  Where it is reported to the Irish Prison Service that a life sentenced prisoner in the community is failing to abide by the conditions of their release, that person may be refused a further period of temporary release and be taken back into custody.  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may return a prisoner to prison where the prisoner is in breach of their temporary release conditions.

My view is that persons affected by adoption should be provided with a statutory right to as much information as possible within permissible Constitutional boundaries.  I am anxious to bring the Heads of bill before Government at the earliest possible date.  The constitutional and legal context within which the development of these legislative proposals must be undertaken is complex. <\/p><p>  It is intended that the Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to be responsible for providing access to adoption records, in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to establish and maintain a National Index of Adoption Records, the purpose of which is to help an applicant for adoption information identify the location of his or her adoption records.  The intention is that the Bill is to provide that either the Adoption Authority, the HSE or an accredited body may hold adoption records, with the Authority having overall charge of those records. <\/p><p>  It is also intended that the Bill will provide for placing the National Contact Preference Register on a statutory basis.  The purpose of the Register is to allow a person affected by adoption to enter his or her name on the Register with a view to receiving information about another person from whom he or she has been separated as a result of adoption and also to indicate a preference as to whether or not contact is being sought with that person.  <\/p><p>  A National Tracing Service will be established under the provisions of the Bill, the operation of which will be subject to guidelines to be set out in regulations.  It is intended that the Tracing Service is to be made available to an adopted person, a birth parent and a relative of either an adopted person or a birth parent, and that the Adoption Authority is to have overall responsibility for providing the tracing service.<\/p><p>  However I wish to advise that complex legal and constitutional issues have arisen during the course of  preparation of the Heads of Bill  and that detailed on-going consideration of these issues is under way in my Department and in the Office of the Attorney General.  At this stage is it not certain that the problems that have arisen can be overcome by the introduction of legislation and further legal advice has been sought in an effort to see if  legislation that meets my policy objectives can be drafted within constitutional parameters.<\/p><p>  With regard to individual cases, information and tracing inquiries are normally dealt with by the organisation that arranged the original adoption placement.  If the adoption agency has closed, the Health Service Executive Adoption Information and Tracing Service, or the agency that now holds the placement records, will deal with the inquiry.  Queries in relation to the handling of a request for information and tracing should be addressed to the agency dealing with the request or the Adoption Authority as the body with responsibility for regulating accredited bodies who provide adoption services. <\/p><p>  A representative of the Adoption Rights Alliance attended a recent meeting which I held with an individual in relation to adoption information and tracing.  At this meeting I agreed to meet representatives of the Adoption Rights Alliance specifically to discuss the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and I invited them to make a submission in this regard in advance of the meeting. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200075#WRX03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Cafes Expenditure","counter":3291,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200076#WRY00125"},{"type":"question","counter":3292,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[44566\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200076#WRY00200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the position regarding an application for funding to her Department in respect of an organisation (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":3293,"content":"<p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Funding in the region of &euro;1 million is available in 2013 from my Department for fit-out, refurbishment works or building enhancement projects for the startup of new Youth Caf&eacute;s.

","asker":"1107","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3309,"content":"<p>The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme. This is a necessary feature of the scheme due to the commitment by the State to meet the full balance of the cost of care over and above a person's contribution. <\/p><p>  The NTPF is independent in the performance of this function and, in carrying it out, it must ensure value for money for both the individual and the State.  It negotiates with each nursing home individually and may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process. This method of negotiation is necessary in order to ensure that the State obtains the best value for each individual in a nursing home and to comply with competition law.  <\/p><p>  In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:<\/p><p>- costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money,<\/p><p>- price(s) previously charged,<\/p><p>- local market price, and<\/p><p>- Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.<\/p><p>  If price negotiations break down, a three stage review process can be invoked. Details of the process are set out on the NTPF website.<\/p><p>  The services which fall within the scope of long-term residential care services, and which are covered by the cost agreed with the NTPF, are:<\/p><p>- nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person,<\/p><p>- basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living,<\/p><p>- bed and board, and<\/p><p>- laundry service. <\/p><p>  In determining the services covered by the NHSS, it was considered very important that nursing home residents and taxpayers would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, goods and services that are already available to individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the goods and services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same items or service.<\/p><p>  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the Medical Card Scheme or the Drugs Payment Scheme, is unaffected by the NHSS. In other words, a person can continue to receive goods and services in accordance with the terms of these other schemes regardless of whether they are in a private nursing home or elsewhere. <\/p><p>  It should be noted that certain items of expenditure, termed allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment of an applicant for the NHSS.  These include certain medical expenses. <\/p><p>  There have been no changes to the goods and services covered by the NHSS since it commenced. <\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme is currently the subject of a review. This review will consider the sustainability of the Scheme as well as looking at community based services.  It will also include an examination of the overall cost of long-term residential care in public and private nursing homes and the effectiveness of the current methods of negotiating\/setting prices. It is envisaged that the review will be completed in early 2014.<\/p><p>  Finally, under the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, the registered provider must agree a contract with each resident within one month of their admission. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should not be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.<\/p><p>  The Health Act 2007 gives statutory responsibility to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority, for the independent inspection and registration of public and private nursing homes.

In August I announced appointments to this Board to replace the transitional Board which had been in place since January 2013.  These appointments bring architectural, planning, procurement, engineering and construction expertise and experience to the project.  Also in August, I announced the appointment of members to the Children's Hospital Group Board.  This Board will oversee the operational integration of the three existing paediatric hospitals in advance of the move to the new hospital and is also the client for the new hospital, and hence is critically important for the project as a whole.  Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman was selected as CEO of the Children's Hospital Group in September following an open recruitment process through the Public Appointments Service and is expected to take up post in November. <\/p><p>  Prior to the commencement of construction, key elements of the project include design development, decant works for the site and planning permission.  The procurement process for the new design team was initiated in July.  Following its appointment, the new Board reviewed that procurement process and have decided on a change of approach based on its collective expertise and experience and taking into account changing market conditions.  While this change means that the design team will be selected in Spring 2014, rather than by the end of this year as originally planned, the new Board is confident that there will be no delay to the project overall, as time can now be recovered at contractor tender stage.  In tandem, a review of urgent care centre(s) configuration is almost complete; the number and location of these satellite centres in the Dublin area is a key decision, as the size, activity and infrastructure of these satellite centre(s) has implications for the main hospital brief. Pre-application planning discussions have commenced while St. James's Hospital is working closely with HSE Estates and the National Paediatric Development Board in regard to the decant phase of the project. <\/p><p>  Work by the new Board on developing a detailed project timeline is continuing, which will reflect the urgency and priority of the project and also its scale and complexity.

In 2008, the then Government decided, in the light of financial circumstances, to defer further implementation of the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004. <\/p><p>  Part 2 of the Disability Act, inter alia, provides for an assessment of the needs of eligible applicants occasioned by their disability to be commenced within three months of receipt of an application and completed within a further three months.  <\/p><p>  There has been a very significant rise in overall activity around the assessment process in recent years in respect of the children now encompassed by the process.  The number of assessment reports received in 2012 was 3,505 which is over 400 applications more than in 2010.  It is worth noting that in the period 2010-2012 over 8,200 reports were completed.  While the HSE recognises that it faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process given the number and complexity of cases, it is endeavouring to address the issue from available resources. <\/p><p>  While any delay in assessment or intervention for any child is not desirable, the assessment process under the Disability Act can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff that where there is a delay in the assessment process, this should not affect the delivery of necessary and appropriate interventions identified for a particular child.  <\/p><p>  In addition, targeted action plans have been put in place since early 2011.  Measures have included: prioritising assessments, holding additional clinics, contracting the private sector to conduct assessments and reconfiguring resources to target areas of greatest need.  These plans are monitored on a monthly basis by the HSE centrally. <\/p><p>  Following the publication of a report commissioned from the National Disability Authority by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring disability services for children into geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme which is underway.  The NDA report indicated that where integrated teams were operating, the assessment of need process ran more smoothly.  It found that there was no one single solution to remove all of the challenges to operating a statutory assessment of need.  Officials from my Department are currently engaging with the HSE and the NDA to further consider the findings contained in this Report.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200079#WRBB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Issues","counter":3497,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200079#WRBB03150"},{"type":"question","counter":3498,"qnumday":539,"qnumall":"[44447\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200079#WRBB03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason front-line staff are not being replaced while waiting lists for services are growing, with 34,617 persons, mostly young children, waiting for speech and language therapy, of whom 6,500 are waiting longer than a year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The level of health services to be delivered within the available funding has been set out in the HSE National Service Plan, which I approved in January.  <\/p><p>  The Government has decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet its fiscal and budgetary targets.  The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction.  This policy requires the health service to reduce its workforce to 98,938 wholetime equivalent employees by the end of 2013.  However, the HSE can make staff appointments once it remains within its overall employment ceiling and has the financial resources to do so.<\/p><p>  With regard to the HSE's Speech and Language Therapy Service, I understand that each individual that presents to the Service has an initial assessment to determine their individual need for therapy.  The therapist, in conjunction with the parent(s) or carer, will determine the severity of the individual's difficulties and prioritise for therapy accordingly.  The level of intervention is in line with clinic policy, age and severity of the diagnosis.  The waiting period for intervention is dependent on the nature and severity of the disorder following assessment. <\/p><p>  The HSE aims to ensure that the resources available are used to best effect, in order to provide assessment and ongoing therapy to children and adults in line with their prioritised needs.  Along with the significant investment in area of speech and language therapists employed in recent years, a range of new approaches have been developed and used in many Speech and Language Therapy services across the country.  These include providing structures, training and support to parents \/carers so that they can work to help improve the individual's speech and language.  In addition, therapy is delivered in group settings where appropriate.  The HSE has stated that it is committed to working in partnership with other service providers to achieve maximum benefits for children and adults with speech and language therapy requirements, and aims to ensure that, the speech and language therapy resources available are used in the most effective manner possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200079#WRBB03300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Alcohol Pricing","counter":3500,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200079#WRBB03350"},{"type":"question","counter":3501,"qnumday":540,"qnumall":"[44451\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200079#WRBB03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when he expects to introduce minimum pricing legislation for alcohol products; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Since the programme commenced in 1995, over 700 patients have received cochlear implants. Beaumont Hospital carried out ninety cochlear implants in 2012 (42 children and 48 adults). The routine practice in Ireland, so far, has been to implant one side only. <\/p><p>  It is now considered best practice worldwide that children should have the option of bilateral implants, and this is reflected in the recommendation of the report of the National Review of Audiology Services which was carried out by the HSE in 2009. The aim of that Review was to examine the services provided to children and adults nationwide, and to formulate a national plan for the services. Its report was published by the HSE in 2011 and provides the blueprint for the planning, development and delivery of HSE audiology services. The Report recommended continued ring-fenced support for the cochlear implant programme but at levels which allow for simultaneous bilateral implantation for children. <\/p><p>  The HSE has developed a proposal, in liaison with Beaumont Hospital, to introduce a bilateral cochlear implant programme in Ireland. In doing so, the HSE has engaged with many stakeholders. Introduction of bilateral cochlear implantation is expected to involve additional staff, equipment and capital works. The resources required will be considered in the context of the Health Estimate for 2014, announced on 15 October last, and the development of the HSE's National Service Plan 2014. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200080#WRCC03900","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Data","counter":3560,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200080#WRCC03950"},{"type":"question","counter":3561,"qnumday":559,"qnumall":"[44586\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200080#WRCC04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number, according to the latest data available to him, of children aged five or under who are currently holders of a medical card or of a general practitioner-only medical card; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The standard approach to the treatment of Lyme Disease is to follow the guidance laid out in the <i>Infectious Diseases Society of America<\/i> guidelines on the clinical assessment, treatment and prevention of Lyme Disease.  This is accepted as being the most up to date synthesis of best available evidence on the clinical management of Lyme Disease and treatment of Lyme Disease is based upon this guidance.<\/p><p>  The acute tertiary hospitals in Ireland have the diagnostic and treatment facilities and personnel for the management of Lyme Disease.  In addition, a network of infectious disease specialists is available in all the major centres to provide consultative, expert advice in the management of Lyme borreliosis.  I have been advised by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre that there were eight cases of Lyme Neuroborreliosis notified in 2012.  Lyme Neuroborreliosis is at the more severe end of the spectrum of Lyme borreliosis and as such it is possible that there may be more people with the milder form of the disease.  Given the numbers of cases of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, I am confident that the facilities available for the diagnosis and treatment of the condition are commensurate with the burden which the disease imposes.<\/p><p>  The diagnosis of a case of Lyme Disease can be difficult.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial screening step.  However, screening EIA's can be insufficiently specific and can give other false-positive reactions in the presence of various other infections from syphilis to glandular fever.  In addition, sera from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  Samples giving reactive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second stage immunoblot test.  The use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this two stage approach gives a greater degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme Disease.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200081#WRDD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Expenditure","counter":3568,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200081#WRDD00600"},{"type":"question","counter":3569,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[44598\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200081#WRDD00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the special delivery unit is being cut by 64% in 2014; the expected impact of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

As announced in the Budget, it has been decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees. This will mean that almost half of the population will have access to GP services without fees.  The Government is providing new, additional funding of &euro;37 million to meet the cost of this measure.<\/p><p>  The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation. The necessary administrative arrangements will be made during the course of 2014 when the specifics of the legislation are known.<\/p><p>  It became clear that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition, as outlined initially in the Programme for Government, was likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic. Relatively complex primary legislation and detailed regulations would be required in order to provide a GP service to persons on the basis of their having a particular illness. In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population. Funding allocated for the extension of a GP service without fees to people with particular medical conditions has been used to mitigate the supplementary budget requirement of the HSE and support existing levels of service.<\/p><p>  Following the recent announcement to commence the roll out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 and under with access to a GP service without fees, I will engage with all relevant stake-holders, as appropriate, in relation to implementation and administrative arrangements.<\/p><p>  The introduction of a universal GP service constitutes a fundamental element in the Government's health reform programme. The current Government is the first in the history of the State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population. A well functioning health system should provide equal access to healthcare for its patients on the basis of health needs, rather than ability to pay. The principles of universality and equity of access mean that all residents in Ireland should be entitled to access a GP services that is free at the point of use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200081#WRDD02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prescription Charges","counter":3586,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200081#WRDD02400"},{"type":"question","counter":3587,"qnumday":569,"qnumall":"[44622\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200081#WRDD02500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"in relation to the decision announced in budget 2014 to increase the prescription charge by &euro;1 to &euro;2.50, if he considered any study on the effects of such a charge on the behaviour of persons taking medication in accordance with their doctor&rsquo;s instructions; if he will provide details if those studies' standard academic citations will suffice; the actions, he considers necessary to counteract any deterrent effect of such prescription charges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

With this sensitive procedure for hearing screening, a child with a permanent hearing impairment (PCHI) can now be identified much earlier, within 4 to 5 weeks of birth, and the hearing status of each ear determined accurately. This means a child can start receiving appropriate support within the first six months of life. The core objectives of UNHS are described as &quot;1-3-6&quot; goals which are based on international programmes:<\/p><p>  - Babies to be screened by 1 month of age;<\/p><p>  - Audiology assessment completed by 3 months of age;<\/p><p>  - Initiation of appropriate medical and audiological services, and early intervention services, by 6 months of age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200081#WRDD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"question","counter":3610,"qnumday":577,"qnumall":"[44701\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013102200081#WRDD04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding community waiting lists for basic hearing tests of children up to 24 months and access to supporting routine hearing services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1005","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":3611,"content":"<p>In order to reduce the current audiology waiting lists a number of measures are being taken by the HSE.
