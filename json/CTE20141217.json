I welcome everyone to the first public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  I will begin with an opening statement and then we will proceed to our discussions with Mr. Nyberg.<\/p><p>  The dark cloud of the banking and financial crisis still lingers over every home in Ireland.  It is the task of this inquiry to shed light on how the collapse happened and to ensure that such a dark shadow never falls on our country again.  Today we begin our first public hearings into the banking crisis.  There have been a number of reports into the crisis and much has been written about it but gaps remain in our knowledge of that time.  We do not have a full picture of the events leading up to, during and after the crisis.  Many questions remain unanswered and without the knowledge that answers to these questions will provide we cannot protect ourselves against a repetition of the crisis.  This means that those who can answer those questions must come before this committee to give a first-hand account of their stewardship.  This is the first time that the decisions that visited the financial crisis on the Irish people will be examined in public.  We will hear from experts who will put Ireland's crisis into a world context and we will hear from those who were at the helm when Ireland ran aground, as well as from those who were in the engine room.  The purpose of this inquiry is to identify and learn from previous mistakes and to ensure that, as far as possible, we do not create the circumstances which could lead to a similar disaster in the future.  <\/p><p>  This committee has the power to compel written and oral evidence so there will be witness testimony, oral evidence, transcripts and detailed records all presented in public.  This means that the Irish people will hear, at first hand, from those who were involved in one of the major events in the history of our country.  The public will be able to see and hear from them as they are questioned and give their evidence to this committee.  It is up to us as a committee to put the pieces of the jigsaw in place so that the fullest picture emerges.  This inquiry is not only about looking at the past; it is also about examining the operation of current financial systems.  We must ensure that this country puts in place a financial services infrastructure and an oversight regime that is robust and fit for purpose.  <\/p><p>  Today we are at the beginning of the process.  We recognise that there is a huge volume of work ahead of us but we are ready for the task.  The committee members are just the visible side of this inquiry.  Whatever we achieve by our work in this committee room, no matter how successful we are, we know that we depend on the support, hard work and dedication of those working behind the scenes - the public servants and the support team.  As a committee, we are all working together to deliver to the Irish public an inquiry that is long overdue and which will endeavour to ensure that the financial burden that has laid itself so heavily on the shoulders of the Irish people will not be placed there again.  I have said it before and I will say it again: this inquiry is an opportunity to leave our club jerseys at the committee room door and to do an important job of work on behalf of the Irish people who deserve nothing less.  It is necessary that we all approach this inquiry with open minds.  Nobody has a monopoly on wisdom and nobody should prejudge the outcome of this inquiry.  This is an important opportunity to demonstrate an example of Parliament at its best - thorough and impartial.  <\/p><p>  As Chairman, it is my job to ensure that we take a collaborative and inclusive approach.  Committee members, who have diverse individual backgrounds and political opinions, have proven through their efforts to date that we can work in a collegial spirit in the interests of the Irish people.  As I have said, we are at the start of the process.  We have a big challenge ahead of us and we must be clear about that.  We know the clock is ticking and that the timescale is tight.  Nevertheless, we have accepted the challenge and will meet it.  However, it would be wrong to see this just in terms of a challenge.  It is a privilege to serve on this committee.  It is also an opportunity to shine light on a dark and painful time in our recent past, to piece together the events of that time, to learn from the mistakes that were made and to ensure that those mistakes are never repeated.  <\/p><p>  At this point, I wish to welcome our first witness, Mr. Peter Nyberg, to discuss the report of the Commission of Investigation into the Banking Sector in Ireland, entitled \"Misjuding Risk: Causes of the Systemic Banking Crisis in Ireland\".   Mr. Nyberg retired in 2010 from his position as director general of financial services at the Finnish Ministry of Finance.  Before joining the Ministry in 1998 he worked, since 1972, in various positions at the Bank of Finland and for more than three years at the IMF in Washington, DC.  At the Bank of Finland, Mr. Nyberg and his staff were intimately and fully involved in addressing the Finnish banking crisis between 1991 and 1995.<\/p> <p>Mr. Nyberg also took part in the negotiations leading to the Finnish membership of the euro area.  After his retirement, he assisted the Finnish Ministry of Finance during the euro area preparations and negotiations leading up to the crisis programme in Cyprus.  In September 2010, the Irish Government established a statutory Commission of Investigation into the Banking Sector in Ireland and Mr. Nyberg was the sole member of that commission.  The commission's report, Misjudging Risk: Causes of the Systemic Banking Crisis in Ireland, was published in March 2011.<br\/>Before I invite Mr. Nyberg to make his opening remarks, I wish to advise him that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009 he is protected by absolute privilege in respect of his evidence to this committee.  However, if he is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and he continues to so do, he is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br\/>Once again, I welcome Mr. Nyberg and call on him to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2014121700003#D00100","nonspeaker":"Chairman","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418775000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I am very pleased and honoured to have been invited to assist this committee by clarifying the work and report of the Commission of Investigation into the Banking Sector in Ireland, which finished its work some three and a half years ago.  The commission worked strictly as mandated by the Commission of Investigation Act 2004 and by the Commission of Investigation Order 2010 which contains its terms of reference.  This has some implications for today's hearing.  For instance, I have no other documentation available to me other than the published report to assist me in answering members' questions.  All of the documents used as sources were security deposited, according to the Act, when the commission was dissolved and have not been available to me since.  I will do my best to answer all questions but I hope that the Chairman will keep this constraint in mind, as well as the number of years which have elapsed since my work was completed.<\/p><p>  The terms of reference were quite explicit in specifying the tasks of the commission.  These tasks were to examine the main causes of the serious failures within the covered banks that led to the need for public support; the main causes of the failure of the financial supervisor, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance to properly discharge their duties to prevent problems; and to look at whether external auditors commented on the failures in the banks.  Special attention was to be given to board and senior management implementation of policies and practices leading to financial distress.  The period for the commission to investigate was only from 1 January 2003 to 15 January 2009 - a period of six years which is not a very long time.  <\/p><p>  As an independent outsider, I was, to be frank, struck by the many similarities between the causes of the Irish crisis and earlier crises elsewhere, including in Finland, of which, unfortunately, I had some experience.  Subsequent investigations in the USA, UK and by the IMF on the causes of the crisis tend to confirm such similarities as well.  By that I mean that the Irish crisis was, in all respects, not unique and was similar to many crises elsewhere.<\/p><p>  I understand that not all commentators in Ireland have been or are fully satisfied with the contents of the commission's report.  Nevertheless, it does represent my independent and objective assessment, at that time, of what happened.  Now that I have had reason to review the report once again, this assessment remains unchanged.  The commission's work was, in essence, about the \"Why?\" of the Irish crisis and not about the \"Who?\".  Consistent with its governing legislation and the terms of reference, the commission was not required to name names and decided, from the beginning, not to do so.  There were very simple reasons for that.<\/p> <p>First, useful information and co-operation of witnesses and institutions were much easier to get when reputations were not simultaneously under a threat of being publicised.  Legal challenges were much easier to avoid and the risk of redactions to the final report were minimised.  I know this is not generally accepted but the responsibility for mistakes is already obvious in my mind.  Directors and senior staff, as well as junior staff, are responsible for the decisions they are empowered to make.  The names of such people are quite often listed in the published national annual accounts of banks.  Heads of public institutions and private institutions are responsible for how these institutions fulfil their mandate alone or in co-operation with others.  Each person, including the borrower, is responsible for both what is done and left undone.  In particular, borrowers and lenders are responsible for the debt and risks they voluntarily take on.<\/p><p> This approach speeded up the work appreciably, improved the quality of information, reduced costs and made it possible to stay within the required time limit and budget.  We could also use previous scoping reports and avoid duplication.  The commission's work included dealing with issues which the previous reports were not mandated to do.  First, we had forensic study of individual decisions and events in the institutions mentioned in the terms of reference, particularly those which were known to have caused problems, such as decisions on big real estate loans.  We also tried to explore why all the existing private and public sector mechanisms to mitigate risk failed at roughly the same time in Ireland.  These simultaneous sector-wide failures are a necessary precondition for the systemic crisis which happened not only in Ireland, but everywhere else.  My work required not only access to documentation, but also discussions with representatives of the institutions about the events leading up to the documented decisions.<\/p><p> I was aware that broadly similar reviews had already been carried out and mostly were in progress in several other countries, such as the UK, the US and Iceland, as well as in the International Monetary Fund.  Iceland was of course a very different case from Ireland as it controlled its own currency and the assets of the bank and the balances of the banks relative to the economy were very much larger in Iceland than they ever were in Ireland.  Once the losses materialised, there was no possibility for Iceland to repay them, even if it wanted to.<\/p><p> The banks, external auditors and public sector bodies were requested to provide access for the commission to a large array of possibly relevant internal documents.  Teams of commission investigators visited these institutions to identify relevant documents and, when necessary, they clarified document contents and existing procedures through technical discussions with staff.  The identified documentation was copied to the commission's secure data system for closer inspection at commission premises and used as a source for producing the final report.  With this work approach, I was able to assess and draw conclusions from a very large volume of data.<\/p><p> At the same time, the commission requested formal but confidential interviews with decision makers of the bodies being investigated.  The interviews had two primary aims; they were to broadly verify the preliminary conclusions reached on the basis of the documentation and to understand why risk assessment, broadly defined, had failed and how governing bodies in practice had functioned or malfunctioned in that period.<\/p> <p>Particular attention was given to the extent and quality of deliberations by decision makers, adherence to and control of agreed internal procedures and to any presence of voiced contrary opinions or doubts.<\/p><p> The final report contains the results of these interviews and documentation in a general format to allow the informants and institutions to remain anonymous as promised.  It does not contain easily repetitious examples of, for example, lending processes gone bad for individual loans in various banks.  It includes such observations in the form of more generalised commission conclusions, valid for many or even all the banks which were subject to my report.  Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide are quite often discussed separately because that was the request in the terms of reference.<\/p><p> I will turn to observations that could be particularly relevant to the joint committee investigation.  The commission felt responsibility for the crisis in Ireland, as well as elsewhere, must be very widely allocated and any investigation should thus be wide-ranging.  As I already stated, a systemic crisis can arise only when a large number of risk-mitigating functions in many institutions in society have become impaired.  For instance, it would be wrong to assign blame primarily to lenders and ignore the fact that a bad loan also requires that a borrower would have made a bad risk assessment on the possibility to handle credit.<\/p><p> The Irish crisis was essentially the result of the sudden deflation of a widespread domestic real estate bubble, implying that domestic policies, decisions and processes should remain central in an investigation, as it was for the banking commission.  I repeat and stress that this real estate mania in Ireland was not a unique phenomenon and can be compared to recent developments in the United States and Spain, as well as in Scandinavia in the 1990s.  This time, the triggering factor for the crisis was a tightening of liquidity originating in the US market, which affected Irish banks particularly through dependence on market financing and over-concentration in real estate.  Even in the absence of the US crisis, it is quite unlikely, in the opinion of the commission, that the domestic Irish bubble episode would have ended well.  In other words, it is unlikely that the hoped for \"soft landing\" would have been the ultimate outcome.  That is because at the start of the crisis, there were very few signs that either the banks or the institutions were changing the way they were acting.  The assumption - I stress it is an hypothesis - is the work and behaviour would have continued as before until it became impossible and the crisis would have come for some other reason.<\/p><p> One of the conundrums was the presence of contrarians, of which there were very few, particularly in the public sector but also in the banks.  Despite doubts, some were very insistent, even when they were ignored and at times sanctioned, usually indirectly.  They did not change their minds.  In any case, they were not listened to and their views were not taken seriously.  The question is \"why not?\" and why did this not happen even in the confidential confines of individual institutions?<\/p> <p>This is something on which the commission has hypotheses but no clear evidence.<br\/>Another important point is part of the background to the crisis was a global consensus view that the financial markets were stable and efficient.  This has implications for the Irish private and public decision-makers.  I classify this as groupthink, which is thinking as one's peers does so as not to stick one's head up too far.  It would explain to some extent the fact that everybody was unprepared for the crisis when it came and that everybody was more or less willing to accept the occurrence of risky behaviour on the part of the banks and the public sector.  It is fair to say that it is also possibly one of the reasons that what happened not only in Ireland but in several other countries in the world was not caught, criticised or challenged by international organisations, academics, the media or consultants.  Everybody believed in the same thing and nobody saw that for which they were not looking.<br\/>An aspect which makes it difficult to discuss the crisis is that while the bubble was being blown many people, not only the banks, had concrete benefits from its continuing.  The Government received much tax revenue from continually expanding the real estate market and this income was dealt out to the population through higher public sector wages, better social security and less onerous costs for public sector services.  Many people had concrete joy from the bubble for as long as it lasted.  Once the bubble burst these advantages were no longer available and this has been the case since 2008.  The advantages and pain of the crisis have been widely shared, which is one of the reasons the Commission felt that it is not fully balanced to seek a few critical decisions which started or continued the bubble.  Hundreds and hundreds of individual decisions were made by contributors who never felt they did anything wrong but which made it possible.<br\/>Another hypothesis the Commission has is that it was not a lack of regulation and supervision <i>per se<\/i>which was important for the bubble to continue but a lack of implementation of existing regulation and powers.  The fact we have had many systemic crises in developed countries since the Second World War, indicates that the existence of supervision and regulation is not enough to hinder systemic crises.<\/p> <p>The question is what one should do to make this possibility less if one cannot trust public servants.<\/p><p> There is not very much to say about external auditors except that, contrary to what one might expect, they did not seem to know more or less than anybody else.  Certainly they did not warn their clients about problems to come, although as far as the Commission could tell they did discharge for the most part the checking of historical accounts that they see as their main sort of business.  The question is, of course, is that enough.  That is something for the committee to decide.<\/p><p> When one looks at the guarantee decision, and that is the position of the Commission, one has to look at the decision in its historical context, meaning that it came at the end of a long period during which everybody concerned with judging risk in the country had told each other as well as the Government that the banks were solvent and there were no problems and consequently one did not have to prepare for any problems.  Then all of a sudden the problems were there.  There were efforts in the last minute, particularly in the Department of Finance, to get legislation under way which would have made it possible to resolve the banks in an orderly manner before they closed, but that was no longer possible anymore because it would have taken a long time.  In the end the question was, when one sat there on the evening, much like the committee members are sitting here this morning, what should be done to avoid a collapse and closure of the banking system the following morning.  From previous experiences back home, when decision-makers are faced with that situation, what one tends to do is to make the safe decision, even though afterwards it might not seem so wise.  That is, I think, what the Government did.  That is why the Commission says that it does understand the Government.  It does not necessarily condone it because it is the culmination of a lot of mistakes that were made before, but the mistakes were not really made on that night.  The mistakes were made several years before, and not only by the Government but really by everybody else.<\/p><p> I refer to the paper I have circulated on the issues that are not included but could be looked at.  Most important is that one looks at more than only the covered banks and the institutions that the Commission was constrained to look at.  One looks also at the other banks that were helped by other governments - not the Irish Government but the other governments - and the support from them, as well as the media, academics and consultants, and also the political parties and the Parliament, because they are, of course, the ultimate decision-makers, or were for several years.  There I would hope the joint committee is more knowledgeable than anybody else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2014121700004#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Nyberg","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1418776200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Nyberg, for your opening address.

What was happening after the US crisis was that banks everywhere in the world, but in particular those banks which were seen as doubtful - doubtful in the sense will they be able to repay what was lent to them - were being charged more for their funding or were being denied funding totally.  Of course, in principle, it is possible for banks to have problems with funding even though they are perfectly okay.  This is why we have central banks.  The central banks can then provide funding against security and so forth.  For quite some while, the Government had been told, primarily by their main advisers, that is the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, the institutions, that the banks were fine and that they were solvent and that the only problem was international uncertainty which made it difficult for them to refinance themselves when they had to repay old loans to market participants and so forth.  Several months later, when PwC made a check on the banks, it thought that, in September, they were solvent.  Of course everyone knows that the economy turned out much worse than anyone expected.  This weakness in the situation of the banks and the bubble in the Irish real estate market was more real and larger than anybody expected at the time, particularly, the real estate market collapsed much faster and deeper than anyone foresaw at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2014121700009#K00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Nyberg"},{"type":"speech","time":1418776500,"counter":16,"content":"<p>In layman's terms, a liquidity crisis is when a bank needs cash flow and an insolvency crisis is when the bank cannot meet its liabilities.

He mentioned that even a short window would not have been an idle exercise.  There are questions over when it was that the State brought the liabilities upon itself.  I have a reference here from the former Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, when he spoke in the D&aacute;il on the Act which was passed on 2 October and said:<blockquote><br \/>We have a guarantee of sorts, a moral undertaking given by the Government last Monday evening.

Money returned to the banks from the market.  It was only later that this sort of return changed and the situation went wrong.  It is really a question of what risk one is willing to take.  Even though it is true that further reflection would have been useful, there really was not very much time for that and it had its own very serious risks, if one would have taken the time.

The legal basis for more sophisticated solutions, resolutions and so on was not there.  There was nothing that could be done on that basis.<\/p><p>  I remind Deputy Doherty that during the night, there were several discussions on alternatives, such as giving a shorter guarantee, reducing the scope of the guarantee and so forth.  For various reasons which are not documented but can, no doubt, be outlined by those who were there, these alternatives were not considered realistic.

He has helpfully set out eight bullet points, six of which are conditions that are necessary for a systemic financial crisis to occur.  The first factor is that there must be \"a sufficiently large number of households and investors who, at some point, start making serious mistakes in judging the value and liquidity of their major assets, holdings and projects\".  Mr. Nyberg remarked earlier that the borrower must share the blame with the lender.  The view has been put forward by some in this State that we all partied and all bear guilt for what went on before the financial crisis.  The first bullet point could be seen as giving succour to that view.<\/p><p>  Will Mr. Nyberg elaborate on that point with particular reference to the statement, on page 32 of his document, that the top 20 customers of Anglo Irish Bank had loans in the region of &euro;21 billion, and the value of loans to the top 25 customers of Irish Nationwide represented 51% of that institution's commercial book?  Mr. Brendan McDonagh of the National Asset Management Agency gave evidence to the inquiry that 190 borrowers taken on board by the agency had collective debts of &euro;62 billion.  Given those facts, how can we say that a financial crisis required certain behaviours by a large number of household borrowers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2014121700011#M00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418777100,"counter":29,"content":"<p>As I said, it would have been impossible for banks to provide those amounts of credit to that small number of people unless everybody, directly or indirectly, thought it was okay.  As I also indicated, the fact that the real estate market was supported by banks and, as I understand it, by budgetary means, meant that a lot of people, directly and indirectly, had an interest in that market continuing to go up.<\/p> <p>There was no force to reduce that type of support.<\/p><p> When one looks at banks, it is true that the big losses come from the big loans which we were looking at within the commission of investigation.  However, the main business of banks is to support smaller institutions, regular enterprises, households and so forth.  That is why we want banks to continue to work well.  For banks to be able to work well, they need to be able to access funds from depositors and the market.  That is impossible if they are not seen as solvent.<\/p><p> It might be easier to think about it from the view that banks have balance sheets.  They have assets and liabilities and, by definition, they have to be equal.  If assets go down in some way, it comes from capital and solvency goes down.  The business of banks is to provide loans against security to ordinary people, and they can do so only if those loans are repaid, that is, if those who give funding to the banks believe those loans are okay.  If the banks give a large amount even of small loans that are not really okay, this means their solvency is put into question.  I do not think it is fair to say people partied.

The standard scenario gave the result that the banks were solvent.  The more stressed scenario gave the result that there could be problems with the big real estate loans.  That is the way one does it, because - to be frank - economic forecasts are usually wrong.  To avoid nailing one's flag to the wrong assumptions, one takes different assumptions and shows between which extremes the results come out.  The decision makers at the time decided that the central assumption was correct, or most likely, and assumed then that the banks were solvent.  If one would have taken the worst possible assumption, the banks obviously would not have been solvent, but it is only afterwards now that we know how it turned out.

As soon as something happens, the assets go down, or up as the case may be.  What happened quite early in 2009 was that the assumptions underlying the guarantee decision that all banks were solvent, and that their liquidity problems were temporary, had changed.  The change was partly because Anglo was nationalised.  That was a sign that things were not as good as before.  Also, of course, the economic situation outside Ireland deteriorated, and it deteriorated within Ireland as well.  All that had effects on the banks and the banks' assets.  The effect was immediate, not over some period.  It always happens, so it does not surprise me.

The supervisor of course knew who they were supervising and they respected banks' views much.  They also thought it was not their business to judge banks' business models but rather the ways in which banks were organised to keep that business models' risks under control.  That was the idea.

Would Mr. Nyberg agree that the fact that at a particular period we had 2% money available from the ECB and, on one occasion, 10.5% growth rates here was a recipe for disaster, and that to the extent that the ECB, in assessing how it does its business and how it sets interest rates, focuses more on inflationary concerns than the economic performance of member states means that interest rates would never be and will never be where Ireland, as an economy and as a nation, need them to be?

The ECB adapts its monetary policy to some sort of average of the whole Union.  If it is not suitable for Ireland, or Finland, as it has not been, then one has to adapt domestically.  There are, of course, numerous ways - fiscal policy, supervisory policies, effecting wage agreements and so forth - available to the domestic economy to adapt to a monetary policy or currency policy that is not suitable.  I am not able to say why the ECB followed the kind of policy it did.  However, we do know that neither the ECB, the EU, the IMF, or the OECD, nor a number of other international institutions, foresaw the global crisis that came.  Indeed, in Europe, the strong growth in overseas bank lending was hailed as a victory for integration rather than a sign of increased risk on the banks' balance sheets.  The EU and the ECB were no better or worse than a lot of other official institutions, which is in a way a rather pessimistic message for the future.

Does Mr. Nyberg believe it is democratic that private institutions have such massive power over elected governments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2014121700031#LL00100","speaker":"954"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1418783100,"counter":218,"content":"<p>On the issue of whether markets are stable, that was what was believed, regardless of what one thinks oneself.

Those who take part in the markets have to be sure that, when the government borrows money, it will be able to pay it back.  To that extent, governments are not free to do or be whatever they want.  However, as long as market lenders believe the government will be okay, and as long as they believe they will get their money back, governments, within that constraint, are free to pursue whatever policy it deems wise.

Why were the very obvious things not done?  For instance, in regard to the apparent unwillingness of the Financial Regulator to do things, one thing that was mentioned was the risk of legal challenges.  If the regulator were to have said to the bank do this, the bank could say it would take the regulator to court, as it is not his business to give this advice.  The commission report concludes that it might have been a good thing, then at least it would have been clear what the remit of the supervisor actually was, now it remains unclear.

When it comes to capital imports, it is really difficult because foreign banks can operate in Ireland as well as Irish banks, but there is always the possibility, for instance, of affecting Irish banks through lending constraints provided by the Central Bank or a financial regulator.  For instance, the Financial Regulator has the right - I think they still do - to regulate the capital needed against certain lending.  If more capital is needed, banks will lend less, for instance, which means that at least through the banks that are subject to Irish law, there will be less lending to that sector.  Then, there is the question that it does mean any lending coming in through that sector might come through different sources or different institutions.  There is taxation available.

Finally, he said on page 5 that for a systemic financial crisis to occur, at least the following factors must be present, and he listed seven.

This has been a very informative and valuable meeting in terms of adding to our understanding of the factors which led to the banking crisis in Ireland.  One of the purposes of our meeting with Mr. Nyberg - and those with Mr. Robert Wright, who will be before us tomorrow, and Professor Honohan, who is due to come before us in the new year - was to discuss not just the information and knowledge he gathered during his the work he did examining the period of the crisis but also to see how the committee might add value to that work.  Another was to discover from him areas which the inquiry might be able to examine and which were - as a result of the nature of its terms of reference - either not considered by or accessible to his commission.  I note that, in his submission, Mr. Nyberg highlighted those areas in respect of which the inquiry might add value or carry out additional work.  On behalf of the committee, I thank Mr. Nyberg for his contribution to these proceedings, for the answers he provided to members' questions and for the additional advice and recommendations he provided.<\/p><p>  I propose that the committee go into private session in order to deal with a number of issues.  We will resume at 9.15 a.m. tomorrow, when Mr. Robert Wright will come before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2014121700046#AAA00700","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1418787600,"counter":434,"content":"<p>The joint committee went into private session at 1.25 p.m. and adjourned at 1.30 p.m. until 9.15 a.m. on Thursday, 18 December 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
