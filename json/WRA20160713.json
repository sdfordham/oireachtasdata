I am conscious of the fact that prices have come under pressure over the last year and the difficulties that this is causing for producers.  Having said that, it must be noted that Irish prices have remained broadly in line with EU prices and I note there has been a slight increase recently, reflecting renewed market confidence in Europe and increased demand in China.<\/p>  <p>  Recently, my Department distributed a &euro;1m direct aid package for pig farmers in Ireland.  This support originates from a package of measures proposed by the EU Commission in response to the significant price deterioration experienced by pig farmers in 2015, the impact of which has been exacerbated by the closure of the Russian market.  Under the aid package agreed at EU level in September of last year, &euro;0.5m was allocated for the pig sector for Ireland.  The Government subsequently matched this funding to provide an overall aid package of &euro;1m. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also supports Bord Bia&rsquo;s marketing and promotional activities, and the Pigmeat Quality Assurance scheme helps to consolidate the position of Irish pigmeat on the domestic market and to expand its presence on EU and third country markets.  Bord Bia plans to use additional funds to run a targeted Pork promotional campaign this coming Autumn and further campaigns are planned to promote ham and bacon.  Teagasc is also actively engaged in the provision of technical advice to improve the operational efficiency of pig farmers. <\/p>  <p>  I have also included provision in the RDP for an on-farm capital investment scheme, TAMS II, with an overall budget of &euro;395 million across all sectors, with &euro;35.8 million allocated for 2016. \u00a0Amongst the areas identified for initial funding are investments on pig farms for energy, water meters and medicine dispensers.  Other elements of the RDP, such as targeted on farm animal health and welfare scheme will also be of benefit to the pig sector.   <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I am committed to ensuring that as many alternative markets as possible are open to the Irish Pigmeat sector.  In that regard I will continue to prioritise the opening of new markets such as Vietnam and the Philippines, which serve as valuable alternative markets to Russia for Irish pigmeat exports.  Indeed I will be leading a trade mission to Vietnam and China during the first week in September, during which I will be prioritising the promotion of pigmeat in two of our main export markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300068#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":10,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 29 to 32, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UK Referendum on EU Membership","counter":12,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300069#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":13,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[19350\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300069#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"following on from the European Union leaders' meeting, if he is in a position to disclose the implications of Brexit on Irish imports and exports, especially the effect it will have on the Irish agricultural sector.","asker":"1319","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":14,"content":"<p>The decision of the UK to leave the EU is one that creates considerable challenges for the agrifood sector.  The UK is by far our largest trading partner. \u00a0Last year we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products.  This included more than &euro;1.1 billion in beef products and almost &euro;970 million in dairy products.  Ireland is also the UK&rsquo;s largest destination for its food exports - worth &euro;3.8 billion last year.  This bilateral trade takes place on the basis of harmonised EU rules on animal and public health and labelling, without complex certification, quota limits or customs duties and tariffs.  And it is underpinned by the vital support of the CAP budget, to which the UK is a significant net contributor. <\/p>  <p>  Given these linkages, and as the UK is a net food importer, both countries have a strong interest in maintaining a close agrifood trading relationship. In addition, the resilience of the Irish agrifood sector is well recognised, and this, together with the strong commercial relationships built up over years of trading, will help us to negotiate our way though the challenges ahead. <\/p>  <p>  It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of the referendum outcome will depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the EU and the UK. These negotiations may take up to two years, and perhaps longer, and over that period existing arrangements will continue to apply. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department has engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result, and has published a summary of the key actions we are taking to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision. <\/p>  <p>  The most immediate concerns for exporters centre on Euro-Sterling exchange rates.  It should be noted that the fall in the value of Sterling against the Euro, while significant, is not unprecedented.  Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern. In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result. The Bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions regarding potential risks.  Actions by ECB and other global actors will be monitored closely. <\/p>  <p>  I have also asked the relevant agencies, including Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, to provide practical guidance to SMEs.  Last week Bord Bia announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses. These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness. Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland.   <\/p>  <p>  Aside from currency fluctuations, the main areas in which potential impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector. <\/p>  <p>  However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure is completed.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, and as part of our overall contingency planning, I have taken a number of measures to ensure a sensible, coherent approach is adopted, namely:<\/p>  <p>  -  I have established a dedicated unit in my Department to work on all of the issues that I have mentioned;<\/p>  <p>  -  I have convened a Consultative Committee of stakeholders, which met for the first time last week, to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed;<\/p>  <p>  -  I am also ensuring that the response of the relevant agencies is fully coordinated through a contact group established under the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee, and <\/p>  <p>-  The Department will continue to feed into the central Contingency Framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300069#WRB00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry Development","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300069#WRB00350"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[21265\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300069#WRB00400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on his Department&rsquo;s efforts in terms of the development of the seafood industry and the wider marine sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1261","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":17,"content":"<p>Our seafood industry has been on a sustained growth path in recent years, with sales growing 53% since 2010 to &euro;890 million in 2015.  Current FAO estimates are that growth in world consumption of fish will require an extra 40 million tonnes of seafood by 2030.  Ireland can capture a significant share of this global seafood opportunity with the right strategy and supporting investment.  FoodWise 2025 recognised this opportunity for the growth of our seafood industry and set out a strategy to realise that growth potential by focussing on the key areas of sustainability, added value, processing scale, human capital, increasing raw material supply and developing our markets.<\/p>  <p>  In January this year, a new &euro;240 million development programme for Ireland&rsquo;s seafood sector was launched -   the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme.  That Programme will be the primary tool to address the 6 key areas identified in FoodWise.  I was delighted to announce in June the first tranche of &euro;4.3 million in grants to 51 aquaculture and seafood processing enterprises under the EMFF Programme. <\/p>  <p>  Under that Programme, I am making available &euro;30 million to kick-start growth in our aquaculture sector, which has been stagnant for too long. In December, we published Ireland&rsquo;s first National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development, targeting growth in output of 45,000 tonnes by 2023, aided through 24 specified initiatives.  To complement those efforts, my Department is working to deliver up to 200 licence determinations this year and will initiate a review of aquaculture licensing procedures, as recommended in FoodWise. <\/p>  <p>  All of these efforts focusing on aquaculture, together with efforts to attract landings of fish by foreign vessels, will help increase the supply of raw material to our growing processing industry to convert to added value consumer foods, food ingredients and functional foods.  I will be making available &euro;33 million Government funding through the EMFF Programme to support the further development of our processing sector through enhanced scaling and value adding.  FoodWise recognises that we need to reduce the level of seafood product which is exported in commodity form from its present 70% level to below 50%.  Adding value to seafood products will make a huge difference to the economic activity and levels of employment in our coastal communities.   <\/p>  <p>  These efforts are being supported through &euro;2 million investment in 2016 by Bord Bia in promoting Irish seafood internationally and assisting our producers to find and grow markets.  They are being supported by a commitment within the seafood sector to sustainability, with 32 Irish seafood companies fully verified as members of Origin Green, and a further 16 applications in the pipeline.  Between them, these companies will account for in excess of 80% of total seafood export values. <\/p>  <p>  In these many initiatives to implement the FoodWise strategy and in our financial commitment through the EMFF Programme, Government is clearly stepping up to the challenges and striving to grow our seafood industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300069#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300069#WRB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[21323\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300069#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of animal welfare prosecutions that have arisen on foot of his Department's efforts in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":20,"content":"<p>The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 is a major piece of legislation replacing a wide range of Acts relating to animal health and welfare dating back over a century.  The Act provides for major legislative changes relating to animal welfare, putting it on a more pro-active footing and, in particular, placing specific requirement on animal keepers to care for animals rather than merely avoid cruelty.  In addition, the Act enables authorised officers for the first time to intervene before welfare situations become serious instead of waiting for problems to occur as heretofore.  This policy change is reinforced by a system of Animal Welfare Notices.  This means authorised officers are now in a position to provide positive instruction for the care of animals and they only resort to prosecution in serious situations.  Thus the Act assists in the education of keepers of animals and in making them aware of potential hazards as well as providing for the punishment of those few persons who contravene the Act.  This policy is designed to allow early intervention and to prevent small problems escalating into serious issues.<\/p>  <p>  Since the commencement of the Animal Health and Welfare Act in March 2014, my Department has initiated over fifty prosecutions for breaches of legislation relating to animal welfare, including those taken by my Department, based on field inspections by Department Officers, authorised officers of the ISPCA and DSPCA and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The negotiation of access to new markets historically has been a big driver of economic development, particularly in the agrifood sector.  I believe that this will continue to be the case in the future, and will be crucial to the achievement of the objectives outlined in the Food Wise 2025 strategy.<\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s approach to the negotiation of free trade agreements must therefore be informed by the need to make progress in areas where we have offensive interests, and to strongly defend those areas where threats may arise. <\/p><p>About one-third of all world trade occurs on the EU-US trade corridor, so it is one that is hugely important for Europe and for Ireland.  The US is one of our leading trading partners, and in the agrifood sector we have a large and growing trade surplus with them (exports of &euro;869m last year, compared to imports of &euro;271m). <\/p><p>In relation to TTIP, Ireland has both offensive and defensive interests.  We see worthwhile opportunities in the US for cheese, powdered milks and sports products, and further opportunities for branded packaged butter, if we can remove some regulatory barriers.  Prepared consumer foods and fish could also benefit from trade liberalisation.<\/p><p>Beef is a unique sector in that we have both offensive and defensive interests.  In the long term, any significant increase in beef imports to the EU could have adverse effects on the Irish industry.  That was confirmed by a number of recent studies and is an issue we have raised strongly with the European Commission.  We therefore have legitimate concerns about the size, composition and administration of any beef quota offered to the US. <\/p><p>We should also seek a significant EU quota for beef to the US as part of any TTIP agreement.  Following the re-opening of the market, Irish beef exports now fall under a 65,000-tonne quota for &lsquo;other countries&rsquo; on a first come, first served basis.  This is mainly filled by Latin American countries.

Statistics show that accidents on farms cause more workplace deaths than all other occupations combined.  In the period 2004 to 2013, there were 176 fatal farm accidents which is a shocking statistic.  To date this year there has been 8 fatal farm accidents on Irish farms.  These 8 fatal farm accidents account for over forty percent of all fatal work accidents so far in 2016, while farming accounts for less than 6 percent of the workforce.  While this is a welcome reduction, the rate of accidents on farms remains very high and it is important that the focus on farm safety is maintained.<\/p>  <p>  Injuries and fatalities are caused in a number of ways but the two highest areas of accidents relate to tractors &amp;amp; machinery and livestock.  So far this year tractors and machinery account for 75% of all fatal farm accidents. <\/p>  <p>  The current TAMS grant-aid schemes are focused on capital investment items that have a prolonged life span and are of a high cost.  Most personal protective equipment needs to be replaced on a fairly regular basis to ensure that it remains in a functional condition, and most of it costs less than &euro;50 for any one item.  For example traditional style boiler suits can be purchased for less than &euro;20 and items such as goggles, ear defenders, face masks, hard hats, gloves and high-visibility waistcoats can all be purchased for less than &euro;10 each. <\/p>  <p>  Behavioural change is what is required to prevent many accidents.  It is a case of being aware of the dangers and taking the time to do what is necessary to minimise the risk.  While there are many risks in farming, farming does not have to be a dangerous occupation.  There are plenty of ways to reduce the danger, without spending a lot of money.  Farmers should be encouraged to take time to plan buildings and work.  After all, as farmers, they are the ones who will benefit. <\/p>  <p>  To conclude, it is important for everyone, to continually highlight the need for farmers to think Safety First in all tasks they perform, no matter the pressure.

Current FAO estimates are that growth in world consumption of fish will require an extra 40 million tonnes of seafood by 2030.  Ireland can capture a significant share of this global seafood opportunity with the right strategy and supporting investment.  FoodWise 2025 recognised this opportunity for the growth of our seafood industry and set out a strategy to realise that growth potential by focussing on the key areas of sustainability, added value, processing scale, human capital, increasing raw material supply and developing our markets.   <\/p>  <p>  In January this year, my predecessor Minister Coveney launched Ireland&rsquo;s new &euro;240 million development programme for our seafood sector, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme.  That Programme will be the primary tool to address the 6 key areas identified in Foodwise.  I was delighted to announce in June the first tranche of &euro;4.3 million in grants to 51 aquaculture and seafood processing enterprises under the EMFF Programme. <\/p>  <p>  Under that Programme, I am making available &euro;30 million to kick-start growth in our aquaculture sector, which has been stagnant for too long.  In December, we published Ireland&rsquo;s first National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development, targeting growth in output of 45,000 tonnes by 2023, aided through 24 specified initiatives.  To complement those efforts, my Department is working to deliver up to 200 licence determinations this year and will initiate a review of aquaculture licensing procedures, as recommended in Foodwise. <\/p>  <p>  All of these efforts focusing on aquaculture, together with efforts to attract landings of fish by foreign vessels, will help increase the supply of raw material to our growing processing industry to convert to added value consumer foods, food ingredients and functional foods.  I will be making available &euro;33 million Government funding through the EMFF Programme to support the further development of our processing sector through enhanced scaling and value adding.  FoodWise recognises that we need to reduce the level of seafood product which is exported in commodity form from its present 70% level to below 50%.  Adding value to seafood products will make a huge difference to the economic activity and levels of employment in our coastal communities.   <\/p>  <p>  These efforts are being supported through &euro;2 million investment in 2016 by Bord Bia in promoting Irish seafood internationally and assisting our producers to find and grow markets.

I should point out however that there are numerous sources of information regarding the proper use and management of natural resources and, while I am open to all, when it comes to fisheries management I draw on the expert advice of the Marine Institute.  I also engage in extensive consultations with the fishing industry and other stakeholders, for example the Environmental Pillar, to ensure that I am fully aware of as wide a range of views on our fisheries management arrangements as possible.<\/p><p>It is important to note with regard to fish stocks and their use as natural resource that, in Ireland, fish quotas are a public resource.  The allocation of fish quotas follows regular, detailed consultations. <\/p><p>Ireland has successfully resisted pressure over the years to try and force the privatisation of fish quotas through the imposition of what is known as an Individual Transferable Quota or ITQ system.  As Minister responsible, I am determined that our marine resources will continue to be managed for the overall public good.<\/p><p>I would also like to reference the wider world in which we operate, namely the new European Union Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).  The key objective of the reformed CFP is to ensure that fishing activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term and are managed in a way that continues to deliver economic and social benefits to our coastal communities that are dependent on the sea.<\/p><p>A key tool of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).  This should lead over time to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and result in more sustainable fishing patterns. <\/p><p>The CFP specifically calls for the progressive restoration and maintenance of populations of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing MSY.  The most recent assessment of progress in achieving MSY shows that while challenges remain, there has been steady progress toward the ultimate goal of achieving MSY for all stocks by 2020.  There is no doubt that this objective is challenging.  However, in the Northeast Atlantic area, the move towards sustainability is both widespread and visible.

Food Wise includes more than 400 specific recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness; as well as specific sectorial recommendations.  <\/p>  <p>  Food security is defined by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) as: &ldquo;a situation that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life&rdquo;.  At national level, food security is addressed through a range of Government policies providing social protection and supports for low income, disadvantaged and vulnerable groups.  At international level, Ireland&rsquo;s development aid programme has a strong focus on food and nutrition, including through funding from my own Department to the UN FAO and WFP (World Food Programme). <\/p>  <p>  Food Wise aims to grow the Irish agrifood sector in an economic, environmental and socially sustainable manner, building on our strengths in the production of safe, healthy and nutritious food.  Ireland is already one of the EU&rsquo;s most efficient producers of milk and beef, in terms of carbon footprint per unit of output. But under Food Wise we are implementing measures to drive down the carbon intensity of our food production even further, resulting in both economic returns and environmental sustainability.  In that regard I am satisfied that the strategy reflects food security considerations.   <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s agriculture is largely livestock based and, clearly, if we are to build on our strengths, this must be the focus of our objectives on food security. However we are developing our seafood industry and our tillage sector. <\/p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 promotes the use of DAFM&rsquo;s competitive research funding programmes - FIRM, Stimulus &amp;amp; CoFoRD &ndash; to support research that is heavily focused on sustainability all along the food production and processing chain.  Accordingly, in addition to research to improve the environmental impact of Irish agriculture in terms of climate, water and biodiversity, a number of on-going projects are focused on:<\/p>  <p>  -  improving grass breeding, utilisation and management so as to support Ireland&rsquo;s low input, grass based livestock production system.<\/p>  <p>  -  developing alternative native energy and protein feed sources as substitutes for imported grain<\/p>  <p>-  advancing our understanding of both animal and human digestive processes leading to the development of novel dietary intervention products some of which can be used to assist with hunger alleviation efforts in extreme famine situations. \u00a0\u00a0   <\/p>  <p>  The ambition that Ireland should be a global leader in sustainable food production, building on our natural advantages, is one that I hope is shared by all, and Food Wise is a blueprint for how this ambition can be realised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300071#WRD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agrifood Sector","counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300071#WRD00950"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[21006\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300071#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to assemble a cross-Border forum with all farming stakeholders to discuss the possible consequences for farmers North and South of the Border following the Brexit referendum result; the measures being taken by his Department on this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":75,"content":"<p>The result of the UK referendum has the potential to give rise to significant challenges for the Irish agrifood sector, particularly in a north-south context.

The UK is by far our largest trading partner.\u00a0Last year we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products.  This included more than &euro;1.1 billion in beef products and almost &euro;970 million in dairy products. Ireland is also the UK&rsquo;s largest destination for its food exports - worth &euro;3.8 billion last year. <\/p><p>This bilateral trade takes place on the basis of harmonised EU rules on animal and public health and labelling, without complex certification, quota limits or customs duties and tariffs.

It should be noted that the fall in the value of Sterling against the Euro, while significant, is not unprecedented.  Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern.

I have also called on the Commission to consider the deployment of a further targeted aid package, similar to that provided last September.  This gave considerable flexibility to Member States to adopt responses suited to their national circumstances, and I believe such a measure could play a further important role in 2016.  I have also repeated my call for the Commission to help reduce the cost of farm inputs by temporarily removing customs tariffs and anti-dumping duties on the importation of fertilisers.   <\/p>  <p>  My approach is underpinned by the need to continue to look at all means of assisting farmers, but in doing so to focus on direct and practical measures, and to avoid taking any action that would in any way compromise the ability of farmers to take advantage of the positive long-term prospects on dairy markets. <\/p>  <p>  I have also taken a very inclusive approach to the challenges presented by the UK decision to leave the EU.

And it is underpinned by the vital support of the CAP budget, to which the UK is a significant net contributor. <\/p>  <p>  Given these linkages, and as the UK is a net food importer, both countries have a strong interest in maintaining a close agrifood trading relationship.  In addition, the resilience of the Irish agrifood sector is well recognised, and this, together with the strong commercial relationships built up over years of trading, will help us to negotiate our way though the challenges ahead. <\/p>  <p>  It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of the referendum outcome will depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the EU and the UK.

I note from the Coillte Annual Report for 2015 that the company continues to play a key leadership role in delivering renewable energy solutions to industry by providing long term, secure biomass fuel supply contracts to large energy users thorough regional biomass supply hubs.  The company&rsquo;s biomass sales business thereby contributes to decarbonising the Irish economy by providing a sustainable and natural substitute for fossil fuels.

I should point out that this flexibility does not include the provision of EU funding.  I am working with all the financial institutions, particularly the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), to identify potential solutions to providing working capital finance for farmers with liquidity issues. <\/p>  <p>  I recently met with the CEOs of the main banks and stressed the need for them to be flexible in the context of increased income volatility.  The banks told me that they recognise and are responding to the challenges facing farmers in this regard.  They all offer options such as moving loans to interest-only repayments and extending overdraft facilities.  They all stated that they are committed to the sector for the long term and are aware its cyclical nature.  I also took the opportunity to question the banks on the relatively high interest rates for SMEs in Ireland compared with those across Europe. <\/p>  <p>  Partly in response to these relatively high interest rates, my Department has just published a request for tender to procure an ex-ante assessment to assess any current failures in the access to finance market in Ireland.

The purpose of these offences is to target the demand for prostitution.  The first is a general offence of paying to engage in sexual activity with a prostitute which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, in the context of prostitution, and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and\/or a fine.

Further research and opinions will inevitably be published during the progress of the legislation and I will continue to examine and consider all new evidence.<\/p>  <p>  I remain convinced that to target the exploitation associated with prostitution requires targeting those who demand those services.

Reliable research is also hampered by the involvement of organised crime and other illegal activity around prostitution, in particular where trafficking or sexual exploitation is involved.<\/p>  <p>  Neither is prostitution a uniform activity.  Much of the available research looks at specific aspects of the sex industry, for example street prostitution or indoor prostitution in isolation, and data cannot necessarily be extrapolated to provide a reliable view of the industry as a whole.<\/p>  <p>  That said, there are a range of data and research sources available.   The Anti-Human Trafficking Division of my Department publishes annual statistics on human trafficking, including persons trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation, and the Central Statistics Office's quarterly crime statistics provide data on reported offences related to prostitution.

The appointment by Government of the relevant nominees, for which initial steps have been taken, will be subject to<i><\/i>prior approval by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas and I hope to be in a position to proceed with this shortly. In accordance with the Act, the Government will appoint one of the lay members of the Authority, which will also have a lay majority, to be Chairperson.  Preparations are also being made in support of the public recruitment, by the new Regulatory Authority, of its Chief Executive whose terms and functions are similarly set out in the 2015 Act.

Under section 7 of the 2015 Act, I will also very soon, by order, appoint a day to be the establishment day for the purposes of the Act.<\/p><p>Following establishment of the Authority and appointment of a Chief Executive the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced.  The managed commencement of these functions is planned for the Autumn in order to allow adequate time and preparation to ensure their effectiveness and success as crucial components of the new regulatory framework.  It should be noted that, under the relevant transitional provisions contained in the 2015 Act, complaints already made to the Law Society under the Solicitors Acts will be brought to completion under that framework and existing law.<\/p><p>In support of the planned and managed commencement of the relevant Parts of the 2015 Act proposed, as I have outlined, between now and the end of this year, an allocation of &euro;1 million was made under the Justice Vote for 2016 as set-up support for the new Regulatory Authority.

It was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans were sold by the original lender to an unregulated entity.  The 2015 Act introduced a regulatory regime for a new type of entity called a 'credit servicing firm'.  Credit Servicing Firms are now subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes, such as the Consumer Protection Code, the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises.  The Act means that any purchasers of loans books are required either to become regulated themselves by the Central Bank or use a regulated credit servicing firm to service their loans. <\/p>  <p>  The Act also ensures that a regulated credit servicing firm cannot do something, or fail to do something, which would be a prescribed contravention if performed, or not performed, by a retail credit firm.  It\u00a0also prevents the owner of credit from instructing a regulated credit firm to perform such an action, thereby further enhancing the consumer's protections.<\/p>  <p>  New owners must either become regulated as credit servicing firms themselves or use a regulated credit servicing firm to service their loans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300076#WRJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":212,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300076#WRJ01050"},{"type":"question","counter":213,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[21421\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300076#WRJ01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the effect of adopting the full concession model for the national broadband plan on the State's balance sheet.","asker":"1232","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":214,"content":"<p>The National Broadband Plan is a priority for Government that will be delivered by my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and questions relating to it should be directed to him.<\/p>  <p>  However the Deputy should be aware that the Government does not intend to publish the expected cost of building the network, the likely cost to the State or the expected terminal value of the network, while a major public procurement process is underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300076#WRJ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":215,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300076#WRJ01250"},{"type":"question","counter":216,"qnumday":102,"qnumall":"[21491\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300076#WRJ01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will consider raising the tax-free group B threshold from &euro;30,150 for those inheriting cash or assets from someone outside of their direct family, given that the group A threshold was increased to &euro;280,000 in budget 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Group has, since 2012, been working collaboratively to develop and agree proposals to improve the transition experience of young people moving from second-level to higher education.<\/p>  <p>  Three key underlying and unifying principles of the approach taken by the partners have been identified as follows: <\/p>  <p> - A recognition that good learning outcomes and key competences developed through a high quality student experience at second level provide a firm foundation for successful learning in higher education;<\/p>  <p> - A simplified, coherent and streamlined approach to system architecture and processes helps to build a bridge for students at the interface between different levels of education;<\/p>  <p> - Our national examination and our higher education admissions systems must have reliability, validity, integrity, equity, fairness and transparency as their hallmarks.  It is essential that full public confidence in both systems is maintained.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2015 the Minister for Education and Skills published a report entitled \"Supporting a Better Transition from Second Level to Higher Education &ndash; Implementation and Next Steps\", which set out a package of reforms developed by the stakeholders involved and which are designed to support students in the transition from second level to higher education.  Those reforms are as follows:&ndash; <\/p>  <p> - To introduce a new grading scheme for the Leaving Certificate, which will reduce the number of grade bands from 14 to 8 at each level.  Ireland's use of a high number of grading bands is unique internationally.  The use of narrow grade bands may also put pressure on students to achieve marginal gains in examination performance and, as a consequence, focus excessive attention on the detail of the assessment process rather than on the achievement of broader learning objectives.<\/p>  <p> - Related to the new grading scheme, a revised Common Points Scale is also to be introduced.  Developed by the universities and institutes of technology, the revised scale:&ndash;<\/p>  <p> - preserves the relative value of achievement at Ordinary level in relation to achievement at Higher level that applies in the current common points scale,<\/p>  <p> - minimises the use of random selection that may result from too many students achieving the same points score, particularly at Higher level, and <\/p>  <p> - Encourages the take-up of Higher level subjects at Leaving Certificate by awarding points to the new H7 grade.<\/p>  <p> - To address any perceived problematic predictability in the Leaving Certificate identified by an independent external evaluation of the examination.  This evaluation, while not sustaining the concerns about predictability, did identify a number of issues for consideration.<\/p>  <p> - To broaden undergraduate entry reduce the number of undergraduate entry routes, while maintaining the number of student places, to the minimum number necessary for academically appropriate and efficient allocation of places to applicants.  This had been signalled not only as a means to reduce the complexity of choice for second-level students and the level of competitiveness driving the system, but also as an opportunity to offer a much broader experience for undergraduates with specialisation to follow later in their degree.  These developments align with the modernisation of undergraduate curricula and assessment that is underway in institutions across the higher education system.<\/p>  <p>  Implementation of these reforms: As the Deputy will be aware, a new Grading system and a revised common Points Scale will be introduced for the Leaving Certificate.  These will take effect for entry into higher education from 2017 &ndash; the first overhaul of the points system since 1992.  This new progressive points system is a vital part of the overall Transitions Reform agenda.  The new grading scheme for the Leaving Certificate will reduce the number of grade bands from 14 to 8 at each level will be introduced.<\/p>  <p>  Under the revised scale, the maximum points available in each subject is 100, and the overall maximum points available, excluding Bonus Points for Maths, is 600.  This is the same as the points available under the current scale.<\/p>  <p>  All students applying through the CAO from 2017 will be awarded points under the new scale, no matter when they sat the Leaving Certificate.<\/p>  <p>  Because of the non-linear design and other features of the new points scale, all students regardless of which level they sit, will on average receive slightly less points than under the current system. This means that it is likely that, on average, the points required for entry to particular courses will also be slightly lower from 2017.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is not expected that this change will be out of line with the natural variation of required points which occurs from year to year in any case.<\/p>  <p>  The new points system has been specifically designed to fairly reward scholastic achievement and I can assure you that very extensive and detailed modelling and testing has been conducted by the higher education institutions, with the assistance of both the CAO and other technical experts, to ensure that the revised scale is fair and equitable to all students.<\/p>  <p>  Ongoing research will monitor the implementation of the various elements of the programme of change on a systematic basis, and assess the overall impact of the changes.<\/p>  <p>  Further detailed information on the new Leaving certificate grading system can be found at www.transition.ie.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the issues for consideration identified around the area of perceived problematic predictability in the Leaving Certificate, these are being examined by the State Examinations Commission.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 recommended that a steering and performance based framework for the system governance of higher education in Ireland was to be put in place.  This framework, sets out the areas of responsibility for setting national priorities of Government and related short to medium term objectives for the higher education system.<\/p>  <p>  The second Systems Performance Report is currently being drafted by the HEA and it is expected that it will be ready for publication in the coming weeks.  Following on from this, there will be a review of the Systems Performance Framework during 2016 with a revised framework developed for the period ahead.  It is intended to address the issue of broadening undergraduate entry, as part of this next Systems Performance Framework which will be put in place for Higher Education Institutions later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300077#WRK01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Grant Scheme Eligibility","counter":231,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300077#WRK01200"},{"type":"question","counter":232,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[21401\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300077#WRK01300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the supports available to a person who wishes to complete a nursing degree (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":233,"content":"<p>To satisfy the terms and conditions of the student grant scheme in relation to progression, a student must be moving from year to year within a course, having successfully completed the previous year or be transferring from one course to another, where the award for the subsequent course is of a higher level than the previous course.<\/p>  <p>  The objective of this policy is to help as many students as possible to obtain one qualification at each level of study.

Where any payments required in respect of development contributions are not settled, such payments may be pursued by the planning authority through the courts as a contract debt and until such time as amounts outstanding are discharged in full, the conditions of the relevant planning permission are regarded as not having been met with the development concerned being unauthorised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300079#WRM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Meters Data","counter":284,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300079#WRM01150"},{"type":"question","counter":285,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[21523\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300079#WRM01200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the research he conducted into the environmental cost of the domestic water metering programme prior to that programme commencing.","asker":"1259","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":286,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[21524\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300079#WRM01300","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the research he conducted into the environmental cost of the domestic water metering programme since that programme began.","asker":"1259","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":287,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[21525\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300079#WRM01400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the research he conducted to measure the environmental cost of the domestic water metering programme including the carbon footprint of same against any potential environmental benefits arising from that programme.","asker":"1259","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":288,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 to 130, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.

There are over 56,000 families with more than 123,000 children in receipt of FIS, an increase of over 70 per cent since 2011.  The estimated spend on FIS this year is approximately &euro;410 million, an increase of around &euro;60 million on last year.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.<\/p>  <p>  The &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; eligibility criterion has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme in 1984, from 30 hours per week to 19 hours per week in 1996.  It is not possible to estimate the costs associated with replacing the current thresholds for FIS qualification without specifying a) a new hours threshold and b) the &lsquo;sliding scale&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  Reducing the &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; requirement would have implications for existing working age schemes.  Under jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance a person may, subject to scheme criteria, work for up to three days and continue to receive support under the schemes.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  In this context, even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they may qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.  The scheme does not involve the award of credits.  The 2007 Green Paper on Pensions estimated an annual cost of backdating the Homemaker's scheme, at that time, as &euro;150 million (if to 1973) or &euro;160 million (if to 1953).  However it described those estimates as &ldquo;extremely tentative&rdquo; and the passage of time means that the potential cost now would be significantly higher.<\/p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives may not qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300081#WRO01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":332,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300081#WRO01700"},{"type":"question","counter":333,"qnumday":146,"qnumall":"[21562\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300081#WRO01800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of application by a person (details supplied) under the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":334,"content":"<p>I confirm that my department received an application for carer&rsquo;s allowance from the person concerned on 22 March 2016.

I am also confident that the introduction of the on-line application option should result in significant efficiencies and reduced turnaround times for passport renewals generally, even with the increase in applications expected from Northern Ireland in the years ahead.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300082#WRP00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":357,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300082#WRP00950"},{"type":"question","counter":358,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[21546\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300082#WRP01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"how he will respond to the open letter from Palestinian civil and political society sent to all Oireachtas Members entitled Palestine&rsquo;s Call; and the action he will take to exert pressure on the State of Israel through the use of sanctions and other parliamentary actions, to end its illegal occupation of Palestine and to grant the Palestinian people rights in accordance with United Nation resolutions and international law as requested in the letter.

There are few western countries as consistently engaged on this issue as Ireland. I have worked continuously to try and maintain the problems of Palestine on the EU and international agenda, despite a wave of concurrent crises in the immediate neighbourhood, and have urged stronger international actions. We will continue to do so.<\/p>  <p>  I have myself recently returned from my second extensive visit to the area in just over a year, meeting the parties and trying to urge them to move forward.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is also engaged on the ground in trying to combat the effects of the occupation, both through our own humanitarian work and through our support of local NGOs engaged on justice and human rights work, a number of whom are among the signatories of this letter.<\/p>  <p>  I fully share the frustration of the signatories, of Deputies in the House, and of others, that the process has been completely stalled in recent years, and that there is not a stronger international will to drive it forward.  I have therefore given the Government&rsquo;s full support to the efforts by France in recent weeks to do just that.<\/p>  <p>  The letter, and the Questions posed by Deputies, make particular reference to the call for trade sanctions upon Israel. We have discussed this question on many occasions, with this NGO, here in the House, and elsewhere.  The essential point remains unchanged: I am opposed to sanctions and, in any event, there is no possibility of obtaining any support for such sanctions at EU level, which is where they would have to be implemented.  I have, however, been an advocate of measures which differentiate clearly between Israel and the illegally occupied settlements.  These include the guidelines adopted on research co-operation which exclude entities based in the settlements from benefitting from funding under the EU-Israel research agreement, and on origin of products to ensure that consumers are not misled as to the provenance of any products emanating from the settlements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300082#WRP01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300082#WRP01300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":361,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300082#WRP01250"},{"type":"question","counter":362,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[21548\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300082#WRP01300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the direct supports available to residents in an area that has a history of flooding but for which there is no flood prevention plan to assist them in protecting their houses in the event of another flood; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1335","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":363,"content":"<p>The Office of Public Works (OPW) is currently undertaking the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme throughout the country.

These draft Flood Risk Management Plans are being published from 15th July 2016 for public consultation and should be finalised by the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the CFRAM Programme, the Government announced two pilot Individual Property Protection (IPP) projects on 5th January 2015.  These are community based pilots to inform consideration of a possible mechanism to deliver IPP, as part of a community based approach or scheme and also the potential costs and benefits attached to IPP for areas where a flood defence scheme is not likely to be completed for some time.<\/p>  <p>  These pilots are: <\/p>  <p>-  a feasibility study in Thomastown and Graiguenamanagh, where Kilkenny County Council has procured consultants to carry out the study.

Currently a steering group led by the Health Service Executive Social Care Division has drafted an implementation framework for the National Policy and Strategy for Neuro-rehabilitation services, which will guide and oversee the reconfiguration and development of Neuro-rehabilitation structures and services at national and local level.  Community-based specialist Neuro-rehabilitation Teams will form part of these developments.<\/p>  <p>  The National Policy and Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-rehabilitation Services in Ireland Report made a number of recommendations for services with neuro-rehabilitation needs.  Following the development of the Neuro rehabilitation Policy and Strategy, the Health Service Executive established the Clinical Programme on Rehabilitation Medicine.  The scope of the Rehabilitation Medicine Programme covers the whole of the patient journey from self-management and prevention through primary, secondary and tertiary care and provides a national, strategic and co-ordinated approach to a wide range of clinical services.  The Rehabilitation Medicine Programme has almost completed the Model of Care for the provision of specialist rehabilitation services in Ireland, which will be the basis for the delivery of services.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside these developments, the Government announced a major development of the National Rehabilitation Hospital which will deliver a purpose built hospital on the site with 120 beds and include support therapies, paediatric and acquired brain injury wards, a hydrotherapy unit and a sports hall.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies' questions relate to service matters, I have arranged for the Deputies' questions to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for detailed replies directly to the Deputies.

The new US decision paves the way for industry to undertake the steps necessary for trade to commence.  In relation to market access for the USA, Ireland had initially received a major reputational boost in 2015 as the first EU Member State to gain access to the US market for beef and six plants are currently approved to export.  By the end of December 2015 approximately 1,800 tonnes of beef, with an estimated value of &euro;14 million, had been exported from Ireland to the US.  This represents an exceptionally strong start to this trade considering that the first exports only went in March 2015 and some of the plants were only approved for export in September.  That amount looks likely to be surpassed in 2016, as by the end of June, almost 1,200 tonnes had been exported. <b><\/b><\/p><p>The recent announcement by the US on our enhanced access is a huge endorsement of Irish beef and our production and regulatory systems.  Ultimately the volume and value of trade will depend on a range of factors such as currency exchange rates,relative commodity prices and global supply and demand patterns.  However, this recent extension of our access in the US has the capability to be a significant boost to the sector over a period of time.<\/p><p>US consumption of beef is estimated at 11 million tonnes, approximately 1 million of which is imported.  The potential prize for Irish operators is therefore, subject to the variables already outlined, very significant, particularly in circumstances where grass fed hormone free beef is gaining traction in the market place. <\/p><p>It complements the other market outlets we have secured in the last two years, the development of which is a key element of our Food Wise 2025 strategy.  There has also been significant progress in facilitating trade in other international markets for Irish beef.  My Department continues to push strongly for market access to other Third Countries and we are currently in the process of trying to secure beef access to other third countries, including China, Korea, Israel, Ukraine and Vietnam.  It is my intention to continue to focus on developing as many third country markets as possible in order to provide exporters as many commercial opportunities as possible in a competitive global market place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300089#WRW01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Live Exports","counter":539,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300089#WRW01750"},{"type":"question","counter":540,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[21378\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300089#WRW01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his progress in achieving market access to Turkey for Irish live exports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1268","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":541,"content":"<p>On 13th June 2016 Ireland was added to the list of Countries approved to export live cattle to Turkey.

Current FAO estimates are that growth in world consumption of fish will require an extra 40 million tonnes of seafood by 2030.  Ireland can capture a significant share of this global seafood opportunity with the right strategy and supporting investment.<\/p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 recognised this opportunity for the growth of our seafood industry and set out a strategy to realise that growth potential by focussing on the key areas of sustainability, added value, processing scale, human capital, increasing raw material supply and developing our markets.<\/p>  <p>  In January this year, Ireland&rsquo;s new &euro;240 million development programme for our seafood sector was launched.  The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme will be the primary tool to address the 6 key areas identified in FoodWise.  I was delighted to announce in June the first tranche of &euro;4.3 million in grants to 51 aquaculture and seafood processing enterprises under the EMFF Programme.<\/p>  <p>  Under that Programme, I am making available &euro;30 million to kick-start growth in our aquaculture sector, which has been stagnant for too long.  In December, we published Ireland&rsquo;s first National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development, targeting growth in output of 45,000 tonnes by 2023, aided through 24 specified initiatives.  To complement those efforts, my Department is working to deliver up to 200 licence determinations this year and will initiate a review of aquaculture licensing procedures, as recommended in FoodWise.<\/p>  <p>  All of these efforts focusing on aquaculture, together with efforts to attract landings of fish by foreign vessels, will help increase the supply of raw material to our growing processing industry to convert to added value consumer foods, food ingredients and functional foods.  I will be making available &euro;33 million Government funding through the EMFF Programme to support the further development of our processing sector through enhanced scaling and value adding.  FoodWise recognises that we need to reduce the level of seafood product which is exported in commodity form from its present 70% level to below 50%.  Adding value to seafood products will make a huge difference to the economic activity and levels of employment in our coastal communities.<\/p>  <p>  These efforts are being supported through &euro;2 million investment in 2016 by Bord Bia in promoting Irish seafood internationally and assisting our producers to find and grow markets.  They are being supported by a commitment within the seafood sector to sustainability, with 32 Irish seafood companies fully verified as members of Origin Green, and a further 16 applications in the pipeline.  Between them, these companies will account for in excess of 80% of total seafood export values.<\/p>  <p>  In these many initiatives to implement the FoodWise strategy and in our financial commitment through the EMFF Programme, Government is clearly stepping up to the challenges and striving to grow our seafood industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300090#WRX00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Applications","counter":555,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300090#WRX00950"},{"type":"question","counter":556,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[21383\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300090#WRX01000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 522 of 14 June 2016 to set out the status of an application by a person (details supplied) under the agri-environment options scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1272","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":557,"content":"<p>The person named commenced their AEOS 1 contract on 1 September 2010 and was paid in full for the 2010 &ndash; 2014 Scheme years.<\/p>  <p>  Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, must be completed before any payment can issue.

Recently, my Department distributed a &euro;1m direct aid package for pig farmers in Ireland.  This support originates from a package of measures proposed by the EU Commission in response to the significant price deterioration experienced by pig farmers in 2015, the impact of which has been exacerbated by the closure of the Russian market.

Agri food exports account for 7% of GDP and continue to grow year on year.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation and new EU food information regulations which were adopted by the Council of Health Ministers in December 2011.  However, my Department plays an important role in the enforcement of this legislation under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  Currently my Department is assisting our colleagues in the Department of Health on the drafting of a new Statutory Instrument to bring the labelling of loose pigmeat and poultry into line with the origin labelling rules for packaged meat brought in on April the first 2015.  This will require businesses who sell meat loose in their premises to clearly identify the country of rearing and slaughter of the animal from which the meat is derived.  Once the SI has been finalised my Department will arrange for it to be put on the Technical Regulation Information System for notification to all EU Member States and following on from the obligatory three month stand still period I am confident that the Minister for Health will be in a position to sign the SI, bringing it into force.<\/p><p>Primary responsibility under EU law for the safety and traceability of food placed on the market lies with food business operators.  The role of National Competent Agencies is to verify compliance with this requirement.  This is done via a combination of inspecting establishments and auditing the food safety management systems which operators have in place.  These controls are applied at different stages in the food supply chain.<b><\/b>Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have systems to identify any person who supplies the business with a food, and a system to identify other businesses to which their product has been supplied.  This is referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system.  There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224\/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404\/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.<\/p><p>My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all its approved slaughter plants.  Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment.  An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks for product originating in EU Member States and third countries.  Labelling and documentary checks are routinely conducted by the Department.<\/p><p>The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards.  The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department.  Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Directorate to ensure compliance.

Current FAO estimates are that growth in world consumption of fish will require an extra 40 million tonnes of seafood by 2030.  Ireland can capture a significant share of this global seafood opportunity with the right strategy and supporting investment.  FoodWise 2025 recognised this opportunity for the growth of our seafood industry and set out a strategy to realise that growth potential by focussing on the key areas of sustainability, added value, processing scale, human capital, increasing raw material supply and developing our markets.   <\/p>  <p>In January this year, a new &euro;240 million development programme for Ireland&rsquo;s seafood sector was launched - the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Operational Programme.  That Programme will be the primary tool to address the 6 key areas identified in FoodWise.  I was delighted to announce in June the first tranche of &euro;4.3 million in grants to 51 aquaculture and seafood processing enterprises under the EMFF Programme. <\/p>  <p>  Under that Programme, I am making available &euro;30 million to kick-start growth in our aquaculture sector, which has been stagnant for too long.  In December, we published Ireland&rsquo;s first National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development, targeting growth in output of 45,000 tonnes by 2023, aided through 24 specified initiatives.  To complement those efforts, my Department is working to deliver up to 200 licence determinations this year and will initiate a review of aquaculture licensing procedures, as recommended in FoodWise.<\/p>  <p>  All of these efforts focusing on aquaculture, together with efforts to attract landings of fish by foreign vessels, will help increase the supply of raw material to our growing processing industry to convert to added value consumer foods, food ingredients and functional foods.  I will be making available &euro;33 million Government funding through the EMFF Programme to support the further development of our processing sector through enhanced scaling and value adding.  FoodWise recognises that we need to reduce the level of seafood product which is exported in commodity form from its present 70% level to below 50%.  Adding value to seafood products will make a huge difference to the economic activity and levels of employment in our coastal communities.   <\/p>  <p>  These efforts are being supported through &euro;2 million investment in 2016 by Bord Bia in promoting Irish seafood internationally and assisting our producers to find and grow markets.

The US is one of our leading trading partners, and we have a large and growing agri-food trade surplus with them (exports of &euro;869m last year, compared to imports of &euro;271m).  The drinks industry currently accounts for over 60% of the value of exports. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has significant offensive interests in the TTIP negotiations.  For example, we see worthwhile opportunities in the US for cheese, powdered milks and sports products, and further opportunities for branded packaged butter, if we can remove some regulatory barriers.  Prepared consumer foods and fish could also benefit from trade liberalisation.<\/p>  <p>  Beef is a unique sector in that we have both offensive and defensive interests.  In the long term, any significant increase in beef imports to the EU could have adverse effects on the Irish industry.  That was confirmed by a number of recent studies and is an issue we have raised strongly with the European Commission.  We therefore have legitimate concerns about the size, composition and administration of any beef quota offered to the US. <\/p>  <p>  We should also seek a significant EU quota for beef to the US as part of any TTIP agreement.  Following the re-opening of the market, Irish beef exports now fall under a 65,000-tonne quota for &lsquo;other countries&rsquo; on a first come, first served basis.  This is mainly filled by Latin American countries.  Now that we have access for manufacturing beef we would stand to benefit greatly from a specific EU import quota in the US, and this can only be achieved through TTIP. <\/p>  <p>  A number of key issues in these negotiations arise in relation to hormone treated beef, food standards, GMOs and Geographical indicators.  All of these arose in the Canadian negotiations and were resolved, and should also be capable of being resolved in TTIP. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to ensure that the principle of equivalence will continue to apply, so that even where food production processes in the EU and US are not identical, they will provide equivalent guarantees regarding the standards of production.  This principle is already enshrined under the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Agriculture, and is also recognised by both sides as the basis for a TTIP agreement.  <\/p>  <p>  Equally, it is important that both the EU and United States retain the policy space to restrict certain practices and processes on social and ethical grounds and this is also recognised, in principle, by both sides.  For example, the EU Commission has made it clear that it will not allow the importation of hormone treated meat into the EU and this is well understood by the US side.<\/p>  <p>  Thirteen rounds of negotiations have taken place to date, with the latest taking place in New York at the end of April.  Overall it has been described as a good round, with detailed discussions on all topics, aimed at developing consolidated texts.  The ambition is to see the negotiations finalised this year, but this may not be possible given the pace of negotiations to date, the amount of issues still unresolved, and external factors such as the US Presidential election campaign and the ratification by Congress of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.  The European Commission is also continuing to press for more effective engagement from the US on non-tariff barriers - including sanitary and phytosanitary measures-in the interests of securing a balanced overall deal. <\/p>  <p>  The fourteenth round takes place this week in Brussels, and I hope that further progress can be made in the interests of achieving a timely conclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300091#WRY02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UK Referendum on EU Membership","counter":598,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300091#WRY02900"},{"type":"question","counter":599,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[21575\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300091#WRY03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to combat the impact of a British exit from the European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":600,"content":"<p>The decision of the UK to leave the EU is one that creates considerable challenges for the agri-food sector.  The UK is by far our largest trading partner.\u00a0Last year we exported almost &euro;5.1 billion worth of agricultural products.  This included more than &euro;1.1 billion in beef products and almost &euro;970 million in dairy products. Ireland is also the UK&rsquo;s largest destination for its food exports - worth &euro;3.8 billion last year.  This bilateral trade takes place on the basis of harmonised EU rules on animal and public health and labelling, without complex certification, quota limits or customs duties and tariffs.  And it is underpinned by the vital support of the CAP budget, to which the UK is a significant net contributor. <\/p>  <p>  Given these linkages, and as the UK is a net food importer, both countries have a strong interest in maintaining a close agri-food trading relationship.  In addition, the resilience of the Irish agri-food sector is well recognised, and this, together with the strong commercial relationships built up over years of trading, will help us to negotiate our way though the challenges ahead. <\/p>  <p>  It is important also to bear in mind that the precise implications of the referendum outcome will depend on the trade and other arrangements ultimately negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations may take up to two years, and perhaps longer, and over that period existing arrangements will continue to apply. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, my Department has engaged in detailed contingency planning for the possibility of this result, and has published a summary of the key actions we are taking to address the contingencies arising from the UK&rsquo;s decision. <\/p>  <p>The most immediate concerns for exporters centre on Euro-Sterling exchange rates.  It should be noted that the fall in the value of Sterling against the Euro, while significant, is not unprecedented.  Nevertheless, a sustained period of currency volatility could be of concern.  In that regard, the Central Bank of Ireland has pre-established contingency plans to deal with market volatility surrounding the referendum result.  The Bank will engage with the Department of Finance and individual financial institutions regarding potential risks.   Actions by ECB and other global actors will be monitored closely. <\/p>  <p>I have also asked the relevant agencies, including Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, to provide practical guidance to SMEs.  Last week Bord Bia announced a number of measures to support food and drink businesses.  These measures cover areas such as managing volatility impacts, providing consumer and market insight, deepening customer engagement and extending market reach, with the aim of helping companies maintain their competitiveness.  Similar support is also being provided by Enterprise Ireland.   <\/p>  <p>  Aside from currency fluctuations, the main areas in which potential impacts are foreseen are in relation to tariffs and trade, the EU budget, regulations and standards, and customs controls and certification, while complex issues also arise for the fisheries sector. <\/p>  <p>  However, we must remember that our trading relationship with the UK is not altered in any way until the negotiation process that will dictate the terms and conditions of the UK&rsquo;s departure is completed.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, and as part of our overall contingency planning, I have taken a number of measures to ensure a sensible, coherent approach is adopted, namely:<\/p>  <p>  - I have established a dedicated unit in my Department to work on all of the issues that I have mentioned;<\/p>  <p>  - I have convened a Consultative Committee of stakeholders, which met for the first time last week, to ensure a full exchange of information as the negotiations proceed;<\/p>  <p>  - I am also ensuring that the response of the relevant agencies is fully coordinated through a contact group established under the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee, and The Department will continue to feed into the central Contingency Framework being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300091#WRY03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Household Incomes","counter":602,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300092#WRZ00150"},{"type":"question","counter":603,"qnumday":240,"qnumall":"[21576\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300092#WRZ00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the degree to which he expects to enhance incomes for farm families over the next five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":604,"content":"<p>Food Wise 2025, the new ten year strategy for the agrifood sector published in July last year identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and provides an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper.

Before the meeting I formally launched the Dairy Forum&rsquo;s &rsquo;Financial Management Initiative&rsquo;, a programme of cash flow and financial management training and advice for dairy farmers, which is an appropriate and practical initiative at this time. <\/p><p>Access to finance was also discussed at last month&rsquo;s meeting of the Food Wise 2025 High Level Implementation Committee, which heard from representatives of the SBCI and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF).  Both are now active in the market.

A prolonged period of volatility in dairy markets has been in evidence in recent times.  However it is important to remember that the medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good.  How we mitigate the current volatility is the challenge. \u00a0Volatility in dairy markets is a global problem, an EU problem and an Irish problem for which there is no single silver bullet.  Fixed price and margin contracts, futures markets and access to increasingly flexible forms of credits are all part of the toolkit that will be required.  In this respect we must continue to work with industry and the financial services sector at a national level to ensure resilience is built into the sector in the current period of volatility and going forward, strengthening our position within the global market.<\/p><p><i><\/i>Voluntary supply reduction is one option that has been advocated at EU level by some but I am of the view that this would certainly not be in the best interest of the Irish dairy sector.  Regulating supply in times of price downturns is not an appropriate response because measures taken only within the EU will disadvantage EU farmers and co-ops, will undermine efficient production and will adversely affect the ability of farmers to benefit when the market turns in their favour.  It would be a backward step to consider such measures now<i>.  <\/i>This is also the shared view of the vast majority of the participants at the most recent meeting of the Dairy Forum on 21 June last where we discussed this issue in some detail.  I do not believe that there is demand from the co-operative sector in Ireland for a supply control measure. <\/p><p>I am anxious that we must focus on other support measures that can play a role in supporting the sector and it is vital that we continue to work closely with the Commission and all other key stakeholders in this regard.  Having discussed issues with national stakeholders, I am currently working with Commissioner Hogan and other EU Ministers with a view to finding pragmatic, realistic and workable solutions to these ongoing difficulties.<\/p><p>I believe our focus must remain on providing real, practical and immediate assistance for farmers.  In addition to intervention, I have called for the deployment of other measures that will provide real benefit for farmers in the short-term in particular, the bringing forward of the delivery date for direct payments.  Such a measure will be of immediate assistance to farmers in acting as a source of immediate cash flow and a buffer to ongoing volatility. <\/p><p>I have also asked the Commissioner to consider the deployment of a targeted aid package, similar to that provided last September.  The September package gave considerable flexibility to Member States to adopt responses suited to their national circumstances, and I believe such a measure, with appropriate flexibility could play a further important role in 2016.<\/p><p>A number of other market support measures have been put in place at EU level, including an increase in the ceiling for SMP intervention to 350,000 tonnes, which was sought by Ireland.

Dairy exports in 2015 were valued at over &euro;3.2 billion and the dairy sector is by a number of measures the country&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry. 2015 was also a very successful year for meat exports. According to Bord Bia, overall exports of beef, sheepmeat, pigmeat and poultry increased by &euro;140 million to more than &euro;3.5 billion. Seafood exports also increased in 2015   and are now valued at a further &euro;560 million.<\/p>  <p>  The target in Food Wise 2025 is to increase the overall value of agrifood exports by 85% to &euro;19 billion by 2025. The Department continually monitors trade statistics produced by Bord Bia and the CSO, in order to analyse the destination of exports and, together with industry, to identify new market opportunities. Third Country markets are an increasingly important alternative outlet for the industry. The development of new and alternative markets, given the changing global demographics and emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere, is a crucial component of the Food Wise 2025 Strategy.  As an exporting country, accessing new markets is crucial to the long-term sustainability of our agri sector.<\/p>  <p>  In the medium and long term global demographics will result in strong global demand for meat and dairy products and my role as Minister is to facilitate market access so that Irish exporters can take advantage of business opportunities as they arise. Taken together these factors provide a great opportunity for increasing the exports of high quality, safe and sustainably produced Irish meat, dairy and fish production.<\/p>  <p>  I am acutely aware of the need to develop as many market outlets as possible for Irish meat, seafood and dairy products. I will continue to work with stakeholders to raise the profile of the Irish agri-food sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa, the Gulf States and elsewhere. In this context I intend to lead a Trade Mission to China, Vietnam and Singapore in September to further promote Irish food and drink in the region. My Department has also re-configured its network of agricultural attach&eacute;s abroad, with an enhanced role in relation in agri-food trade and Bord Bia is also presently expanding its network of offices abroad, with a focus on new and emerging markets. This will also enhance our identification of new markets abroad.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300093#WRAA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":648,"content":"<p>Question No. 255 answered with Question No. 238.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":649,"content":"<p>Question No. 256 answered with Question No. 252.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Laboratory Facilities","counter":650,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300093#WRAA02200"},{"type":"question","counter":651,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[21640\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300093#WRAA02300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which the most modern laboratory facilities remain available to the agrifood business at Backweston, Celbridge, County Kildare, or elsewhere; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":652,"content":"<p>The facilities at the central laboratory complex in Backweston and at regional laboratories are capable of meeting the vast majority of my Department&rsquo;s analytical and diagnostic requirements.\u00a0 While DAFM Laboratories have the capability to carry out most of the tests in these areas, for cost efficient reasons, some low volume, highly specialised reference test methods that are periodically required are still outsourced to specialist centres.

This imperative informed the approach to the negotiations in 2012 and 2013, and they continue to inform the process by which the various elements of CAP reform are now being delivered.<\/p>  <p>  Taking the direct payments system as an example, the Deputy may recall that my predecessor proposed an alternative approach to the redistribution of direct payments than that originally advocated by the European Commission, precisely because the direct payments system needed to be made fairer and more equitable while at the same time ensuring that the level of transfer of payments between farmers was not of a scale that might jeopardise our objectives for the development of the sector. <\/p>  <p>  We now have a system which satisfies these two requirements. Last year&rsquo;s payments under the Basic Payment and other schemes represented the start of a process that, by 2019, will see a considerable shift in the balance of payments from those previously receiving very high rates per hectare to those previously receiving much lower rates of payment. I believe that this not only makes the direct payments system fairer, but also ensures that it continues to provide support and income stability that will allow farmers to respond to the demands of the market. As such, it also provides a vital tool to help us achieve the objectives outlined in the Food Wise 2025 strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Significant steps have also been taken to encourage the participation of young farmers in agriculture, which is vital in terms of securing the critical role that farm families play in the development of the sector. In addition to receiving a top-up of direct payments, young farmers are also prioritised in the allocation of payment entitlements from the national reserve. These direct payments measures are further complemented by supports under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme where, for example, enhanced support for capital investment by young farmers has been made available under the TAMS schemes. <\/p>  <p>  More generally under Pillar 2 of the CAP, I am focussed on the socio-economic development of our farms and of our rural areas so that all farm families have an opportunity to realise their potential. Schemes for improving sustainability (such as GLAS and the Beef Data and Genomics Programme) and competitiveness (such as TAMS) are complemented by continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now known as Areas of Natural Constraint). I believe this combination provides a vital range of supports that will allow farm families to continue to benefit from the CAP in an equitable manner while supporting their development over the coming years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300094#WRBB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":658,"content":"<p>Question No. 260 answered with Question No. 235.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Economic Competitiveness","counter":659,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300094#WRBB00550"},{"type":"question","counter":660,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[21644\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300094#WRBB00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which he continues to be satisfied regarding the competitiveness of Irish food exports on the world food market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":661,"content":"<p>As over 80% of Irish food and drink production is exported, managing and maintaining our international competitiveness is fundamental for the future development of the sector.

This legislation requires the proper identification of equine animals as well as the maintenance of traceability and ownership issues.<\/p>  <p>  The current rules regarding the identification of equidae are determined by Commission Regulation 262\/2015, which has been effective since 1st January 2016, and which has been transposed into national legislation via S.I. 62 of 2016 (as amended).<\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of Commission Regulation 262\/2015, all equine animals are required to be identified with an equine passport by 12 months of age. Such passports must contain a unique identifying number (UELN) in respect of the animal, retained for the lifetime of the animal, and must also record details of the number of the transponder implanted into the neck of the equine by a veterinary practitioner, thus ensuring an unequivocal link between the identification document and the animal. Only those equines identified within the time limits set out in Regulation 262\/2015 can be deemed to be eligible to be slaughtered for human consumption. The final decision as to whether an equine can be included in the food chain is determined by an official veterinarian from my Department, present at the factory at the time of slaughter, having examined the data contained in the identification document and on the central database and having undertaken a series of ante and post mortem examinations on the equine. <\/p>  <p>  Article 38(1) of the Regulation 262\/2015 specifies the minimum data to be recorded on the central database of each Member State in respect of each equine identified and each record must be updated by approved Passport Issuing Organisations (PIOs) in that Member State. In addition, the database must be notified, again via an approved PIO, of all studbook equines identified by PIOs outside the country where such animals are ordinarily resident. Similarly, relevant information in respect of all equines introduced into the State must be notified to an appropriate approved PIO in the Member State into which the equine is introduced, for onward notification to the central database.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to this minimum equine identification data, the central database operated and maintained by my Department also records information in relation to Equine Premises Registration (PRN) and equine Transfer of Ownership details. The rules in these regards are determined by national legislation via S.I. No 8 of 2012 and S.I. 189 of 2014 (as amended) respectfully.<\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, national legislation provides that applications for an equine passport must indicate the premises registration number (PRN) of the holding at which the equine will be kept.

This is an increase of &euro;12.5m compared with 2015.  This funding is split between a number of programmes that are designed to encourage energy efficiency activity and assist householders living in energy poverty, along with grants for electric vehicles.  A brief summary of each of the energy efficiency programmes being funded in 2016 is provided below:<\/p>  <p>  - Better Energy Homes: This is the primary elective grant scheme available to homeowners.  Individual homeowners apply for grants that cover a range of energy efficiency improvements, from various types of insulation to heating controls and solar thermal technologies.\u00a0 In 2015, grant levels\u00a0were increased, a bonus payment\u00a0was introduced for homeowners who undertake multiple measures and the minimum grant threshold\u00a0was abolished.  I anticipate that between 14000 - 15000 homeowners will receive grant support under this programme in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  - Better Energy Warmer Homes: The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty.  In 2016 the eligibility criteria for the scheme have been broadened in line with Government policy on deprivation generally.  I expect nearly 9,000 homes to be upgraded under this scheme in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  - Better Energy Communities: The Better Energy Communities scheme aims to encourage community based partnerships to improve the efficiency of homes, community facilities and local businesses.  These partnerships can be between the public and private sectors, domestic and non-domestic sectors, commercial and not-for-profit organisations and energy suppliers.  Grants are awarded through an annual competitive evaluation process and must leverage considerable additional private investment.  I recently awarded &euro;20m in grants for this scheme in 2016.  These grants will support the upgrade of more than 2,600 homes and almost 300 community and commercial facilities.<\/p>  <p>  - Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing Pilot Scheme: This year I have also launched a new scheme to combat energy poverty called Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing.  Its objective is to better understand how we can improve health and wellbeing by making homes warmer and more energy efficient.  The scheme has been developed by my Department in close cooperation with the Department of Health and is being operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and the HSE.  &euro;20m has been ear-marked by my Department for the scheme in the period 2016 to 2018, of which &euro;4m will be spent this year.<\/p>  <p>  The funding available for energy efficiency also supports a number of smaller programmes.  The\u00a0Sustainable Energy Communities scheme seeks to help communities build capacity to undertake energy projects, while the\u00a0Better Energy Finance scheme supports a number of pilot initiatives to help determine how future energy efficiency support schemes should be structured.  Initiatives to encourage energy efficiency in the commercial and public sectors are also funded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300095#WRCC00200","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Inland Fisheries Ireland","counter":681,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300095#WRCC00250"},{"type":"question","counter":682,"qnumday":268,"qnumall":"[21320\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016071300095#WRCC00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will consider a review of the policy of gill-netting carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1308","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":683,"content":"<p>On 4 July,\u00a0Inland Fisheries Ireland published the timetable for the review of the National Pike and Brown Trout Policies.
