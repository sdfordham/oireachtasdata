I remind members and guests to switch off their mobile telephones before we commence.  Session A this morning is a public hearing discussion with Professor Gregory Connor from NUI Maynooth on issues relating to banking policy, systems and practices which may have underpinned the banking crisis in Ireland.  I welcome everyone to the tenth public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Later this morning, we will hear from Professor Eamonn Walsh from UCD.<br\/><br\/>I welcome Professor Gregory Connor, who is professor of finance at NUI Maynooth, having previously been part of the finance faculty at the London School of Economics and director of research at MSCI Europe.  He specialises in portfolio risk analysis, factoring modelling, financial economics and security market pricing.  Professor Connor holds a BA in Economics from Georgetown University and he received his doctorate in economics from Yale University.<br\/><br\/>Before we begin, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  As you have been informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br\/><br\/>I invite Professor Connor to make his opening remarks.<\/p><p>I thank the committee for inviting me.  I have your thoughtful list of suggested topics on bank funding and the Irish banking crisis.  Let me start with a key point.  An enormous uncontrolled flow of foreign debt capital into the Irish domestic banking system is the key cause of the Irish financial crisis.  Obviously, there are other secondary causes, but the basic and most fundamental cause of the Irish economic crisis was a poorly controlled very large inflow of foreign debt capital into the commercial banks of Ireland.<\/p><p> This foreign debt capital flow had two effects.  One, it created unstable debt levels throughout the economy but, two, it acted as a Keynesian stimulus to the economy - it raised incomes, production costs, wages and tax revenues.  That increase in tax revenues then led to an increase in Government spending.   When we think about the fiscal calamity that hit Ireland after the banking bust, it was directly and indirectly caused by this foreign debt capital inflow.  It was directly caused through the big costs of the bank bailout but also indirectly, because one had a sudden stop to the Keynesian stimulus from foreign debt funding and this fed disastrously into private and Government spending, so there was a sudden stop - basically a Keynesian effect.   <\/p><p> From a global perspective, people often say this Irish banking crisis is unprecedented but it is not really unprecedented.  Economists talk about what they call \"a capital bonanza\", which is a large flow of capital, equity or debt, into a national economy.  Often if there is a regulatory policy or business failure or some combination, capital bonanzas lead to financial bubbles, followed by busts.  This is what happened in Ireland.  There were policy, business and regulatory failures and there was an enormous capital bonanza, financial bubble and bust, so it is not really unprecedented.<\/p><p> Where did the capital come from?  In the early years of this century, there was a global tidal wave of liquidity across developed markets.  We were aware of this at the time and people used that phrase \"global tidal wave of liquidity\".  It was a period called the great moderation, which lasted about 20 years.  If one looks across countries in the developed world and through time, there was fairly stable economic growth and people said this is a new paradigm, the business cycle is solved, we have new institutions, we have new technologies and there is going to be stable growth.  It was just a tidal wave of liquidity across markets.<\/p><p> All developed markets were hit by the great recession which followed the US credit liquidity crisis of 2008 but only a handful, including the USA, Greece, Iceland and Ireland, had identifiably distinct credit bubbles and busts.  If one looks at Iceland, its credit bubble and bust has a lot of parallels to Ireland.  It too had excessive foreign debt capital into its banking system as the main cause of its credit bubble and bust.  Another parallel, which I think has been underappreciated, was the very poor prudential oversight of the Icelandic Central Bank during their credit bubble.<\/p><p> If we turn briefly to Greece, their credit bubble and bust was very different.  There, the same global tidal wave of liquidity did not go into the banking system but it went directly into Government borrowing, which was hidden in various ways, including with some complicity by the banking system and the international investment banks, in particular.  It was a different source of capital, but again a credit bubble and bust in Greece.<\/p><p> A key objective of Economic and Monetary Union was to allow free capital flows across member states.  That was considered one of the great advantages of EMU - that we were going to have funds flowing quickly into high funding cost states, like Ireland, from low funding cost states, like France and Germany.  This worked, in fact, one could say one of the big causes of the Irish crisis was that this EMU mechanism worked too well.  That was a deep clear flaw in the EMU system, and the economics profession shares some blame for that.  We underappreciated the instability which would be caused by allowing very free capital flows across member states.  That was an error in the design of EMU by the economics profession.  Partly because of the political enthusiasm, which many of us share for EMU, we overlooked the problems - both in the economics and the policy world.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Gregory Connor:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->JK Galbraith said that one of the advantages of being an economist is that the more one messes up, the more they need one.  There has certainly been a great deal of work to try to correct that EMU flaw but I do not think it has been fully corrected.<\/p><p> Let me turn to funding and capital risk at the Irish banks as the committee requested.  The source of the funding is straightforward.  During this period, German and French banks had more deposits than they could profitably use at home so they moved funds to a growing economy with high rated banks and no exchange rate risk, Ireland in particular, as well as others.  Three main vehicles were used for the funding, namely, the interbank borrowing market, bond issuance by Irish banks and direct deposits by foreign financial institutions and corporations into Irish banks.  In terms of the size of the funding, I said it was massive.  The net foreign liability of the Irish domestic banking sector in early 2003 was &euro;29 billion.  This grew over the next five and a half years by 449% to &euro;158 billion in 2008.  The net foreign borrowing ratio to GDP was 88% in the third quarter of 2008, which was massive.  That was a very large and very risky overhang of foreign debt.  In fact, if one thinks about some of the early macroeconomist discussion and talk about the Irish debt ratio, or Government debt, one has to think about the 88% that the banks owed to foreigners.  It was very unstable, hidden borrowing.  The risk from this was amplified for property development lending which grew from &euro;21 billion in early 2003 by 524% to &euro;133 billion in late 2008.  It was an enormous growth in what is one of the riskiest classes of bank borrowing.  It is much riskier than mortgages and much less diversified than SME lending.  This is a very narrow concentrated lending growing by 524% over five and a quarter years.<\/p><p> The Irish Central Bank and the Financial Regulator should have blocked the enormous debt capital inflow and should have blocked the too fast growth in property development lending.  If they had done either of those things, the Irish banking crisis would not have happened.  They should have done both.  There was a massive failure by the Irish Central Bank and Financial Regulator in not blocking both of these.  I do not blame the crisis entirely on them, however.  Economists were mistaken also.  Globally, there was an overly complacent attitude toward the risk of a banking crisis in developed markets.  We had not had one in 50 years in many countries and were too complacent.  There were also big errors in bank risk and liquidity regulation, in particular the level of bank equity capital was much too low.  The definition relied too much on tier 2 equity, which is only available when a bank is no longer a going concern.  It does not provide a buffer to a going concern bank.  It provides a buffer to a bank which is being restructured.  Relying on that was a big error.  That interacted with a misunderstanding of the big risk of systemic liquidity problems in the banking sector.  That was also missed.  As such, the economists share some blame.<\/p><p> A solvent commercial bank has a backstop in the case of a serious liquidity problem.  It can use its long-term assets as collateral.  Central banks stand ready as lenders of last resort to provide funding to banks.  In the case of the eurozone, this failed because the ECB had very strict rules.  It could only lend for good collateral to solvent banks.  This dichotomy between the lender of last resort function and the problem with insolvent bank restructuring was very problematic.  The ECB's attitude was that it was in its charter that it would only lend to solvent banks for good collateral and that what happened where a bank was distressed was someone else's problem, namely, a national problem.  That was a big issue and a major difficulty.  Another problem of course was that, along with many other European countries, Ireland did not have an effective, quick bank resolution mechanism at that point.<\/p><p> The committee has asked me to address how interbank competition increased risk taking.  Here I want to differentiate between blame and causes.  In terms of risk taking by Irish bank managers, they are to blame for what they knew in many cases was overly risky lending.  Many people in the industry knew that what they were doing was too risky.  However, in terms of causes, there was a rivalrous environment from the maverick banks, particularly Anglo and Irish Nationwide, which increased risk levels and then pulled in the other banks.  Irish shareholders were also leading this.  They were forcing the banks to adopt more aggressive strategies.  As such, the shareholders also contributed to this pulling of the strategies to be too risky.  That is in terms of causation.  In terms of blame, the bank managers who knew they were taking too much risk are to blame.  In terms of causation, that was deeper.  Without the control from the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank, it was very difficult in this environment to avoid the banks being pulled into this ethically wrong strategy.<\/p><p> I turn now to the capital outflows from Irish banks and the liability guarantee.  The problems with refunding in the banks really started in August 2007 with the early stages of the crisis.  Over the whole next year, the ability of various banks to access the three main vehicles became increasingly difficult.  A global credit liquidity freeze hit after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in mid-September 2008.  There also had developed institutional bank runs, particularly in the USA, but spreading to some of the maverick banks in Ireland during October 2008.  There were liquidity problems in the system at this point.  They played a central role in the 2008 US crisis in that month.  The US crisis is correctly termed a credit liquidity crisis.  Ireland did not have a liquidity crisis, it had a bank credit crisis.  It received &euro;136 billion in liquidity support at peak from the ECB and Irish Central Bank.  That was more than enough liquidity support.  Ireland did not suffer a liquidity crisis, it suffered a bank insolvency crisis.  The ECB began providing liquidity funding to the Irish banks in early 2008 and the funding amount rose sharply.  The ECB began to question under its charter whether it was providing liquidity support or risky capital infusion, which it felt it could not do.  In my judgment, in fact, some of the liquidity support provided under ELA was risky capital.  It did not really meet the ECB claim that it was liquidity support only.<\/p><p> With hindsight, the domestic banking system's aggregate balance sheet was actually insolvent in September 2008.  There was a claim at that point of &euro;43 billion tier 1 and tier 2 equity but bank accounting statements even relative to other corporate sectors greatly lagged the reality.  They presented a very lagged picture of reality as Professor Honohan noted earlier.  The Government in fact injected &euro;64 billion into these banks, after which the banks only had tier 1 equity of &euro;13 billion.  That is a minus of &euro;51 billion somewhere.  The banking system aggregate balance sheet was insolvent in September 2008.  In September 2008, the Irish Government provided a blanket liability guarantee to an insolvent banking sector.  It was a very costly error.  There are three caveats to muddy the picture.  First, the lender of last resort function of the ECB was not working properly.  The liability guarantee was partly intended to allow access to this very flawed funding function from the ECB.  Second, the guidance provided to the Government by the Irish Central Bank and Financial Regulator was poor.  Third, the information provided by some of the banks may have been embellished deliberately to disguise their real capital positions.  Those are my comments.  I thank the committee for listening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022500002#A00200","speaker":"990","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424822400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Connor.

That is what banks do.  On the other side - their liabilities and the money they owe - are short-term liabilities such as, for instance, deposit savings accounts where their liability claimant often has very quick access.  If depositors come to the bank and want their cash now against long-term assets, then that is called a liquidity problem.  The bank needs to have cash for its long-term valuable assets.  An insolvency problem is when the value of the long-term assets has fallen.  For instance, many of the property loans may be failed projects and do not have real cash value.  The claims made by the savers and bondholders of the bank are larger than the value of the assets of the bank.  That is insolvency.  It is not that the bank cannot pay cash now as its central bank can always provide.  It can never pay the cash.

So, we need to value the assets of the bank and make sure they are larger than the non-equity liabilities.  There is an equity, which is the residual liability or the buffer of the bank.  That is just a residual claim which has to be positive.  When that is negative, the bank is insolvent.  If one takes the value of the assets and subtracts the value of the liabilities - claims from debt holders, deposits and savers - and gets a negative number, then the bank is insolvent.  That is essentially the exercise.<\/p> <p>  The hard part is valuing the long-term assets of the bank.  It has to look at these projects, which in the case of Ireland were mortgages and property development projects, and decide how many of these are not going to pay the bank back.  That was the problem.  It was difficult.  The banks were also in the year-long habit of overstating their solvency because they had been trying to refund themselves, roll over their funding.

It was delayed to provide an opportunity for borrowers in the property development community to rearrange their affairs in ways that were not optimal for the taxpayer.  I think there was a delay in setting up NAMA.<\/p> <p>  The overpayment goes back to some of the questions about insolvency.  Who knows how to value long-term assets?  That was deliberate, as was stated in the accounts, and a 30% premium was paid which went through the EU's criteria and was allowed.  The US did the same thing.  If one looks at the targeted asset relief programme, another success, it also overpaid for the assets.  The idea of overpaying to market value to allow the banking system to recover worked in the long run.  I do not think I have a problem with that.  They could have paid less, but they deliberately overpaid rather than force all the banks into insolvency and then restructure them.

This worked for several years in a row.  That is common in asset pricing bubbles - that people buy a property not for its intrinsic value but the fact that they can sell it on in what is sometimes called \"the greater fool problem\".  You think you can buy a property, even though it is overvalued, because you can sell it to someone who will pay even more.  There was some of this.  As the debt capital inflow into the Irish banks manifested itself in excessive of mortgage lending, that pushed up prices properties.  The banks then encouraged speculative investors to buy properties in order to flip them.

I now invite Professor Walsh to make his opening statement to the inquiry.<\/p><p>I thank the Chairman for his introduction and the committee for the opportunity to assist the inquiry.  I was asked to consider the role of accounting in bank crises and also external auditors.  I have prepared some brief remarks on these two topics which, in the interests of brevity, I have distilled from my published statement.  I would be happy to elaborate on any of the points I have raised.  I am also happy to discuss other accounting issues of relevance to the banking crisis.<\/p><p> When we think about banking crises, accounting is largely a silent bystander.  A bank crisis generally involves rapid loan growth alongside which we get concentrations of risk.  Often this rapid expansion is funded from volatile sources.  When one is in this expansionary mode, if a regulator or anybody else questions the business model, management will dismiss them because they will be able to point to excellent accounting profits and, as a result, great contributions to capital.  This pattern of behaviour was evident prior to 2008 in Ireland.  Our banks were among the most profitable in Europe.  It was widely believed that in what appeared to be challenging scenarios there were sufficient cushions to withstand risks.  Balance sheets and income statements formed the basis for this analysis so accounting was clearly implicated in the misperception of risk.  By 2009 it was apparent that the capital cushions available to Irish banks were entirely inadequate.  Some financial institutions had liabilities that exceeded their assets; they were insolvent.  <\/p><p> Balance sheets and income statements are prepared using accounting rules or accounting standards.  In general these are known as international financial reporting standards.  They are a large body of rules which indicate how one should measure assets, liabilities and income for an enterprise.  However, during banking expansions these accounting standards may be a little unhelpful and they will serve to over-estimate the profits that are reported to external investors and lenders.  If we start thinking about bank lending which is going to be the principal asset for banks, and the Irish banks in particular, essentially the big problem is estimating loan impairments.  Loan impairments are the amount of the loans that will not be repaid and it is a challenging accounting problem.  Impairment may be understood as something not performing as anticipated.  If we think about it in American terms, one would speak about someone being visually impaired - it means the eyes are not working as originally anticipated.  The notion of impairment means that things are not working as originally anticipated.  <\/p><p> With bank lending, if one knew exactly how much the bank was going to lose the accounting would be straightforward.  For example, if a bank engaged in very risky lending and we knew in advance just how risky that was and the risks entailed, impairment accounting would be very easy, because we would say we expect to lose all the money we lent to a particular customer, therefore, we should buck a loss and decrease profits and decrease capital.  The problem is that this scenario is highly unlikely.  If we lent money to a customer and we knew we were going to lose it all immediately we would not lend in the first place.  Lending is based upon the proposition that we do not expect to lose our money when we lend money to a particular identified customer.  The problem then is that we must engage in some estimates of the defaults that might occur.  Given that there are estimates and judgment calls involved in determining these impairments, it is necessary to have additional guidance.  The accounting standards as they stand require an entity to assess at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.  In other words, one is required if one is preparing financial statements for a bank to sit down and ask at the end of an accounting period whether there is objective evidence that an impairment has occurred.  The rules go on to state that a financial asset is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset.  In other words, one must point to some event that has occurred since we originated the loan that constitutes objective evidence that we have made a loss.  <\/p><p> If we believe that a loss has been made it is necessary to estimate the impact of that loss and one is required to produce a reliable estimate of the amount of that loss.  The most counter-intuitive part of all of this is that the standard explicitly states that losses expected as a result of future events no matter how likely are not recognised.  In other words, if the dogs on the street expect that losses will occur they are ignored by accounting standards.  One is required to have objective evidence that the loss has been incurred rather than a belief that events will occur in the future which will endanger these loans.  Therefore, it is a very conservative definition of impairment since it requires objective evidence that a loss has been incurred.  As a result, impairment accounting is pro-cyclical.  What this means is that in a period of expansion as a bank expands its loan book, the bank will appear far more profitable because as it originates the loans it does not expect to lose money, it has not incurred a loss and so the bank will appear incredibly profitable.  In turn that means it will have additional capital so it will appear that it has additional cushions against future losses.  In a period of contraction the reverse happens.<\/p><p> When the bank expanded it made lots of loans.  When there is contraction it becomes apparent that some of these loans are impaired.  That immediately means a swing from having excessive loss of profits to excessive losses.  That is what we mean by procyclicality.<\/p><p> There are two additional features of accounting policies which lead to even greater procyclicality, one of which is the accrual of interest.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Eamonn Walsh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It means that if one lends money to a customer and agrees that they do not need to repay interest immediately then instead the interest will be rolled up on the loan.  That roll-up of interest will be recognised as a profit even though the cash has not been received from the customer.  <\/p><p> The second thing that can juice up the amount of income that is reported during the expansionary phase is the existence of loan arrangement fees - in other words, some agreement whereby the lender will give money to the bank, at the origination of the loan, as compensation for the origination costs of that loan.  It does mean that accounting rules give rise to excessive reporting of profits when we are expanding credit and it will also lead to substantial declines later in the cycle.  This cycle was quite evident in Ireland.  We had exuberant new lending which gave way to no lending at all because we went from having very high profits to almost no profits at all.    Nevertheless, it is difficult to conceive an outcome that would have been very different.  Even had accounting rules permitted the use of expected losses, as distinct from incurred losses or other alternatives, I believe that profits would have exhibited a similar pattern.  <\/p><p> Impairment accounting is largely diversionary for four reasons.  First, the rules are well understood by informed users of bank financial statements.  In other words, what I have said today is not new and has been known for decades.<\/p><p> Second, individual banks could create additional provisions despite the accounting rules.  There is nothing to prevent a bank from saying \"We believe, to give a true and fair view of our results, that we should book additional provisions this year.\"  <\/p><p> Third, there is nothing to prevent the Financial Regulator from insisting upon additional provisions or enhanced disclosure.  The regulator did exercise such powers.  <\/p><p> Fourth, the expected loan losses during the growth phase in Ireland were likely to have been low anyhow.  No matter how one tries to cut it, during the period 2004 to 2006, inclusive, it is very difficult to conceive of any type of a mechanism that would have resulted in a large decrease in the reported profits of banks.<\/p><p> While these measurement rules are quite different it is important to realise that banks also make disclosures.  This is a key part of financial reporting, and it is not just what is in an income statement and a balance sheet, but also the additional disclosures in the financial statements.  Additional disclosures help one to understand exactly what is going on in terms of reported income.  In my opinion, the disclosures concerning the increased risks within Irish banks were inadequate during the period.  <\/p><p> Through the lens of 2002 balance sheets - which were balance sheets dominated by residential lending - users could have easily concluded that increased profitability was synonymous with increased cushions but a seismic shift occurred during 2002 to 2007.  There was a big change in the composition of loan portfolios for Irish banks.  Rather than residential mortgages dominating property landing, commercial and development lending became almost 50% of property lending.  In other words, the composition of the assets changed very dramatically.  There were concentrations of risky lending that displaced less risky home mortgages.  The distribution of the shift is also significant.  It is clear that these additional risks were not distributed equally across banks in Ireland at the time.  Further, a significant proportion of the loans were concentrated among a relatively small number of borrowers.<\/p><p> In summary, I believe that the real challenge for external users of financial statements was understanding the changing nature of the risks on balance sheets before 2007.  Had users fully understood the increased exposure to commercial and speculative lending, and that it was concentrated amongst a very small group of borrowers, it would have been far easier to realise that the quality of profits had declined and that capital mattresses, rather than cushions, were required.<\/p><p> The second point I was asked to talk about was bank audits.  What do auditors do?  Directors are responsible for preparing and approving the financial statements of a company or a bank and then auditors issue an opinion on the financial statements.  For example, an audit report will state something like the group's financial statements.  It will give a true and fair view, in accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the group's affairs as at 31 December 2015 and of its profits for the year then ended.  The first thing auditors do is express an opinion that the financial statements have been produced in conformity with international financial reporting standards.<\/p><p> Bank auditors have some additional responsibilities to a regulator and are required to bring certain matters to the attention of a regulator.  That means there are some additional responsibilities between an auditor and a financial regulator.<\/p><p> In addition to these responsibilities, a regulator has the power to request information from an auditor.  There is a particular additional set of duties with respect to bank auditors.  For example, bank auditors would have been required to perhaps produce reports of any breaches of prudential sector lending limit guidelines.  As Nyberg concludes, in the majority of cases the auditors did not report regulatory sector lending limit excesses to the Financial Regulator.  Even if all excesses had been reported, it appears unlikely that any action would have been taken by the Financial Regulator who was already aware of, and not concerned about, such excesses.  In other words, there were alternative reporting mechanisms between the banks and the Financial Regulator that are quite independent of annual financial reports prepared for shareholders and lenders.  While I have not had access to the auditors' communication with the Financial Regulator, Nyberg states that the auditors clearly fulfilled this narrow function according to existing rules and regulations.  <\/p><p> The committee might wish to know what else auditors do apart from expressing this opinion.  For say loans and receivables, there would be a general expectation that auditors should go along and look at a sample of some of the lending files within a bank.  As part of their audit they would do the following: Ensure that lending policies are adhered to; review concentration reports and related party loan reports; establish evidence of any collateral assigned to the institution; check the financial condition of co-signatories and guarantors and examine past experience with the enforcement of guarantees, and confirm in terms with the guarantor; compare loan amounts with appraisals; and ensure that construction loans are correctly classified as loans rather than real estate investments.  For significant construction projects, they would ensure that advances are based on progress and that there are offsite-onsite inspections to verify the collateral and the progress with the construction.  <\/p><p> Auditors should also assess management's loan reviews for impairments.  Audit procedures should establish that management has looked beyond the collateral to identify potential borrower weaknesses, to identify if collateral appraisals are adequate and that up to date borrower financial information is available.<\/p><p> Auditors are also expected to review performance against the original loan agreement and be alert to any biases, for example, loans to public figures or personalities.<\/p><p> In summary, when published financial statements are prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards, auditors also play a valuable role in assuring the veracity of the loans and receivables on a bank's balance sheet.  <\/p><p> I shall make some concluding observations.  Between 2002 and 2007 the aggregate loans in Ireland grew rapidly and exhibited significant concentrations of commercial lending, and speculative commercial lending.  However, these concentrations varied across banks and where was also significant individual borrower exposures which gave rise to exponentially greater risks.  Contemporaneous knowledge of these loan portfolio risks would have alerted external users to the sources of bank profits and their sustainability.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Eamonn Walsh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While there was no requirement to report these risks in the published financial statements, especially for financial statements prior to 2007, there were requirements to report capital adequacy, liquidity, impairment, large exposures and sectoral limits to the Financial Regulator.

This is not timely information and is produced four or five months after the year end.  If the bank is quoted on a stock exchange it will, at a minimum, have a preliminary announcement of its results.  This might be a month or two ahead of the publication of its annual financial statements but about two to three months after the end of its financial year.  If a bank is listed on a stock exchange it might also produce a half yearly report.  If the bank is listed in the United States it might also produce quarterly reports for investors.

International accounting standards have been around for a very long time.  They started in the 1970s.  A big change occurred in 2005 when the European Union introduced a requirement that if you issue equity to the public you are a listed enterprise and as such you are required to prepare your financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards or IFRS.  I have a copy here with me and as you can see it is a thick volume of accounting standards.  There is one standard within this called international accounting standard No. 39.  This IAS No. 39 deals with financial instruments.  The principal assets and the principal liabilities a bank is likely to have are its financial instruments.  When one speaks about accounting for banks the principal guidance is IAS No. 39.  These rules apply to all enterprises.  A retailer applies the same rules as a bank or an insurance company.  These rules do not have a specific standard which deals with banks, they have a general standard that deals with financial instruments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022500002#R01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Eamonn Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424822400,"counter":264,"content":"<p>What circumstances, if any, would need to have been in place where the standard would have allowed the value of loan assets to be written down, with losses reflected by the banks?

These financial statements date back to about seven or eight years ago.  Unfortunately, it would be quite difficult for me at this stage to recall specific reporting practices.  If I were to say in general, one of the difficulties is that, in the absence of disclosure, it means that one just reports a number like that for loans and receivables.  We have loans and receivables of &euro;50 billion and that is all of the information one receives in the annual report.  It would clearly be very helpful if one said, \"We have &euro;50 billion of loans and receivables, &euro;48 billion of which is speculative development lending.\"  To an investor, if he or she were to receive that information, he or she would immediately know that this was quite a risky loan book and chances were that the income might not persist in the future for this particular financial institution.<\/p> <p>  Post-2007, disclosures were made.  One of the problems with international financial reporting standards more generally is that they are designed for general purpose use.  It means that the requirements for credit disclosures are not very well specified or articulated; the Senator can imagine, therefore, how disclosure could be quite difficult.  Let us consider examples.  Suppose a bank lends money to a retailer and that retailer is going to use the proceeds of the loan to purchase some development land, seeks rezoning of that land and then extends the retail store onto that land if the rezoning is successful.  The question is: is that a loan to a retailer or is it a loan for speculative property development?  One of the difficulties with the disclosures is that it is possible that somebody might look at this in the cold light of day and make a determination that this was a loan to a retailer rather than a loan for speculative property development.  One of the difficulties with disclosure is that the absence of specific guidance means that it is possible that in that situation,there would be some judgment involved in determining whether it was a retail loan or a speculative development loan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022500002#S01100","nonspeaker":"Professor Eamonn Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424822400,"counter":279,"content":"<p>If I were a bank or if there was a bank that decided to make a very large investment in an institution or a pension fund, would this be reflected in any way such that an auditor would see it?

In other words, let us consider a big loan as a big chunk of salami and find a way to slice the salami so that it might not be apparent when looking at aggregate reports.  Equally, one can think further back the food chain and if I was someone borrowing money from a bank, I might seek to structure a large loan in a way that might make it easier for the bank to slice salami later on.  I am not suggesting that has occurred in an Irish setting but there are other cases, like BCCI, that are very informative if one looks at the auditing processes that went on in banks.

It is quite possible to take international accounting rules and use it to basically insist the rules are applied in a particular way that involves disclosure of cash interest received.

I guess people are quite down on auditors and take the view that companies spend a fortune on audits but don't seem to get anything in return.  One has to consider the counter-factual.

One gets a certain sense about the concentration of risk when one reads the first one.  With the next one, it is a case of \"Oh my goodness, there are 20 large borrowers and there seems to be quite a bit of exposure to development lending in very concentrated areas of north and south Dublin\".  With the third phase, it was \"We'll have a look at the next 50 borrowers and guess what?  It seems they also borrowed money in much the same areas of north and south Dublin\".

The Honohan report states:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>Rules of this kind were actually in effect, but not enforced. Specifically, there was a long-standing ceiling (200 per cent of own funds) which was supposed to be applied to loans to any one economic sector (various classes of property loan were treated as different sectors, so the overall property ceiling was higher). This requirement seems to have become a bit of a dead letter, [Professor Honohan mentioned that in his engagement with us.] with violations being noted but not acted upon.

My feeling is largely that the difficulty is not an audit one <i>per se<\/i>, given the audit communications with the regulator and the regulator potentially knew, rather it is more a case that these prudential limits would have made tremendous sense, had they been adhered to we would be in much better shape today than we are and the question is why those limits were not adhered to by the regulator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015022500002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Eamonn Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424822400,"counter":438,"content":"<p>What is Professor Walsh's view on Professor Patrick Honohan's comment that this guideline or rule was a dead letter?
