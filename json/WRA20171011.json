This regulation provides for consumer protections which may include, depending on the circumstances arising, refund of airfares, re-routing either as soon as possible or at a later date at the passengers convenience, care and assistance and compensation. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) is the independent regulator for the enforcement of air passenger rights for flights out of Ireland, functioning as the national enforcement body for such matters. The CAR has been working directly with\u00a0Ryanair since the announcements were made to ensure that the provisions of the regulation were correctly applied in respect of the passengers affected.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  On Friday 29 September, CAR announced that\u00a0it has secured agreement from Ryanair that it will comply with the regulations and directly provide affected customers with the necessary information on refunds, rerouting, care and assistance and compensation. Ryanair has also\u00a0issued a\u00a0public statement explaining to customers how and when they will be re-accommodated on other Ryanair flights or other airline flights as necessary. It is understood that Ryanair has also committed to provide weekly updates to CAR on the number of passengers entitled to compensation and expenses, the number of claims submitted and the number of claims closed-out.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission for Aviation Regulation is part of a close network of national enforcement bodies across the EU, including the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)\u00a0in UK. It is noted that Ryanair has also recently replied to the UK CAA\u00a0agreeing to meet its requirement for customer clarification on Ryanair&rsquo;s\u00a0obligations under regulation 261, which are in line with those requested by the CAR.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Commission for Aviation Regulation is working to ensure that passengers are dealt with efficiently and effectively to minimise disruption to affected customers and to ensure that their consumer rights are fully protected.<\/p>  <p>  As to the cause of the cancellations, that is a matter for Ryanair to clarify and it would not be appropriate to comment on commercial or operational decisions of a private company. Matters concerning staff relations, recruitment, remuneration and other terms of employment are a matter for the company and its employees.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The cause of a flight cancellation is only subject to investigation by a national enforcement body where compensation is requested by passengers but contested by the air carrier. However where compensation is either non-applicable or the air carrier has agreed to pay same in compliance with its obligations, as is the case in this instance, further investigation is not undertaken by a national enforcement body as there is no legal basis to do so.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100070#WRA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus Services","counter":8,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100070#WRA00700"},{"type":"question","counter":9,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[42028\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100070#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the various industrial disputes in the UK in recent years involving bus workers and a company (details supplied) that has recently been successful in its tender application for 10% of Dublin Bus routes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1432","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 8 (42136\/17), of 11\/10\/17\u00a0it is a statutory function of the National Transport Authority (NTA) to\u00a0conduct the public procurement process relating to the tendering out of 10% of the PSO bus network.

This regulation provides for consumer protections which may include, depending on the circumstances arising, refund of airfares, re-routing either as soon as possible or at a later date at the passengers convenience, care and assistance and compensation. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) is the independent regulator for the enforcement of air passenger rights for flights out of Ireland, functioning as the national enforcement body for such matters. The CAR has been working directly with\u00a0Ryanair since the announcements were made to ensure that the provisions of the regulation were correctly applied in respect of the passengers affected.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  On Friday 29 September, CAR announced that\u00a0it has secured agreement from Ryanair that it will comply with the regulations and directly provide affected customers with the necessary information on refunds, rerouting, care and assistance and compensation. Ryanair has also\u00a0issued a\u00a0public statement explaining to customers how and when they will be re-accommodated on other Ryanair flights or other airline flights as necessary. It is understood that Ryanair has also committed to provide weekly updates to CAR on the number of passengers entitled to compensation and expenses, the number of claims submitted and the number of claims closed-out.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission for Aviation Regulation is part of a close network of national enforcement bodies across the EU, including the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)\u00a0in UK. It is noted that Ryanair has also recently replied to the UK CAA\u00a0agreeing to meet its requirement for customer clarification on Ryanair&rsquo;s\u00a0obligations under regulation 261, which are in line with those requested by the CAR.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Commission for Aviation Regulation is working to ensure that passengers are dealt with efficiently and effectively to minimise disruption to affected customers and to ensure that their consumer rights are fully protected.<\/p>  <p>  As to the cause of the cancellations, that is a matter for Ryanair to clarify and it would not be appropriate to comment on commercial or operational decisions of a private company. Matters concerning staff relations, recruitment, remuneration and other terms of employment are a matter for the company and its employees.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The cause of a flight cancellation is only subject to investigation by a national enforcement body where compensation is requested by passengers but contested by the air carrier. However where compensation is either non-applicable or the air carrier has agreed to pay same in compliance with its obligations, as is the case in this instance, further investigation is not undertaken by a national enforcement body as there is no legal basis to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100071#WRB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100071#WRB00900"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[41985\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100071#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans, proposals and timeframe to provide transport infrastructure to facilitate the development of an SDZ at Clonburris, County Dublin with 8,500 homes supporting an estimated population of approximately 21,000 persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":60,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility\u00a0for the planning and development of public transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA).<\/p><p>The statutory objective of the NTA's\u00a0Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035 is to provide a long-term strategic planning framework for the integrated development of transport infrastructure and services in the GDA.\u00a0 The development of the Strategy\u00a0was informed by a full public consultation and is required by legislation to have regard to national, regional and local planning policies for the GDA.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>I am aware that the NTA has worked\u00a0closely with South Dublin County Council on the transport elements included\u00a0in the draft planning scheme for Clonburris.<\/p><p>Noting the NTA's responsibility\u00a0in the matter, I have referred your question\u00a0to the NTA for a more detailed reply.\u00a0 Please advise my private office if you do not\u00a0receive a reply within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100071#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rail Services","counter":61,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100071#WRB01200"},{"type":"question","counter":62,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[42148\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100071#WRB01300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the NTA's plans to consider rail prices in County Kildare for 2018; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":63,"content":"<p>The issue raised is a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA) and I have forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.\u00a0 Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100071#WRB01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capital Expenditure Programme Review","counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100071#WRB01500"},{"type":"question","counter":65,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[41970\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100071#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he will provide an overview of his submission to the mid term review of the capital plan; and his views on whether the capital budget for transport infrastructure is adequate.","asker":"1250","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":66,"content":"<p>As the deputy may be aware my Department' s submission was published recently on www.per,gov.ie at the launch of the review of the Capital Plan.

Revenue obtains the information relating to the amount of tax that is &lsquo;held under appeal&rsquo; from its IT systems. Outstanding tax liabilities are automatically identified by the presence of an appeal stop marker that is input to suspend the collection of the disputed tax pending the determination of the appeal. This information is contained in Revenue&rsquo;s &lsquo;stop 16&rsquo; database. However, not all appeals involve an outstanding tax liability requiring the input of an appeal stop marker. A second &lsquo;non-stop 16&rsquo; database contains such appeals. The information on this second database must be entered manually by Revenue caseworkers. In addition to the outstanding tax balance obtained from Revenue&rsquo;s IT systems, caseworkers are also required to enter on both databases what they consider to be the amount in dispute in a particular appeal. This may differ from the outstanding tax liability where an appellant has made a &lsquo;protective&rsquo; payment in case he or she loses the appeal. This disputed amount figure may not be an outstanding tax liability as such but could be the amount that Revenue may potentially have to repay or forgo should it lose the appeal. <\/p><p>The information contained in the databases is captured at a particular point in time and is not retrospective or cumulative. It is constantly changing as appeals are finalised either by determination by the Tax Appeals Commission or the Courts or by agreement with\u00a0Revenue, and as new appeals are received.<\/p><p>An appeal against an appealable matter may relate to a number of tax periods in respect of the same issue.\u00a0 Each of these is counted as an individual appeal in the tables below.<\/p><p>In relation to the number and value of tax appeals in each tax district and division, Revenue has provided this information at a divisional level and not the much more detailed tax district level as it was not possible to do so in the limited time available.\u00a0 The following table shows the number of appeals with an outstanding tax liability (&lsquo;stop 16&rsquo; database) and the amount of that tax liability allocated to the relevant Revenue divisions.\u00a0 <table><tr><th>Division<\/th><th>No. of appeals<\/th><th>Amount held under appeal (&euro;)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Border Midlands West<\/td><td>519<\/td><td>64,685,230<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin<\/td><td>829<\/td><td>166,914,457<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>East Southeast<\/td><td>578<\/td><td>38,249,260<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Large Cases Division<\/td><td>900<\/td><td>840,385,025<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Local Property Tax<\/td><td>&amp;lt;10<\/td><td>87<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Southwest<\/td><td>1,211<\/td><td>43,214,713<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Totals<\/td><td>4,040<\/td><td>1,153,448,772<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The following table shows the number of appeals with an outstanding tax liability (&lsquo;stop 16&rsquo; database) and the amount of that tax liability broken down by taxhead. <table><tr><th>Taxhead<\/th><th>No. of appeals  Amount held under appeal (&euro;)<\/th><th>Amount held under appeal (&euro;)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>CGT<\/td><td>182<\/td><td>121,975,064<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CT<\/td><td>239<\/td><td>172,655,822<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>IT<\/td><td>3,130<\/td><td>346,557,489<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>PAYE<\/td><td>188<\/td><td>233,896,324<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>VAT<\/td><td>202<\/td><td>174,165,036<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Other<\/td><td>99<\/td><td>104,199,037<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Totals<\/td><td>4,040<\/td><td>1,153,448,772<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The amount estimated to be in dispute in relation to these 4,040 appeals is &euro;1,179,006,96.<\/p><p>In relation to those appeals not involving an outstanding tax liability (&lsquo;non-stop 16&rsquo; database), there are an additional 520 appeals accounting for a disputed amount of &euro;494,134,885. <\/p><p>The following table contains information relating to all open appeals by taxhead, the year in which an appeal was made and giving the range of tax years for all appeals in that category.

Officials from my Department have recently met with NGOs operating in the Golan, and I will continue to monitor the situation closely. In the occupied Syrian Golan, as in the West Bank, the introduction and settlement of communities of the occupying power, to alter the demography of the area, is illegal under international law.  The process of establishing settlements inevitably involves violations of the rights of the occupied population, through seizure of their land, discriminatory treatment and other restrictions. Tactics including planning laws, zoning, military use, national parks etc. are used by the Israeli authorities to advance this process under a cloak of legality. None of these measures can alter the fact that the whole process is illegal.   The Government has consistently and repeatedly conveyed these concerns to the Israeli authorities, and highlighted them in our interventions at EU, UN and international level. In addition, I raised these concerns directly in the context of my visit to Israel and Palestine in July, which was the first visit I made outside Europe after taking office. I will continue to avail of every appropriate opportunity to pursue these issues. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns over these policies are most acute in relation to the West Bank, where the continued construction of settlements on occupied land is dangerously undermining the prospects for a peace agreement and the establishment of a Palestinian state, and this has been the focus of my international engagement on the settlements issue.  By contrast, it is generally acknowledged that any comprehensive peace between Israel and the Arab states will involve the return of the Golan area to Syria. This does not lessen the obligation on Israel to treat the community there in accordance with international law so long as the occupation remains in being.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100074#WRE04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Justice and Equality","counter":284,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100074#WRE04800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities","counter":283,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100074#WRE04700"},{"type":"question","counter":284,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[43120\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100074#WRE04800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will be ratified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":285,"content":"<p>Ireland signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and since then, successive Governments have emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are met.

It is important to note that these regulations do not in any way change the existing &lsquo;good Samaritan&rsquo; rule, which allows any member of the public to assist a person in distress to administer a medicine which has been prescribed to them. Equally, these regulations in no way diminish the responsibility or the importance of people continuing to carry the medicines that they need to manage their own health needs.<\/p>  <p>  In order for an organisation to avail of an emergency medicine without the need for a prescription, they must first register with the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and undergo a training course accredited by the Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council (PHECC). <\/p>  <p>  This register is publically available through the Emergency Medicines Portal on the HPRA website and can be found at: www.hpra.ie\/homepage\/medicines\/emergency-medicines\/emergency-medicines-search\/results.<\/p>  <p>  There is currently a total of 14 organisations, and 21 accountable persons, listed on the register for Emergency Medicines.  Each organisation may register more than one site and more than one accountable person. <\/p>  <p>  Prescription only medicines (POMs) are so designated because there are safety concerns about these medications. The administration of a POM should not be done lightly and should only occur following appropriate training. A decision to undergo training on the use and administration of an emergency medicine rests with individual organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Schools can obtain additional information on the management of anaphylaxis from organisations such as the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, which has published guidelines for teachers on its website; one section of these guidelines deals specifically with the management of anaphylaxis at school.

The Warmer Homes scheme provides energy efficiency upgrades completely free of charge to people who meet the eligibility criteria. Up until my announcement, the scheme focused on relatively shallow interventions such as attic and cavity wall insulation, low energy lightbulbs, lagging jackets and energy advice.    \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Following my announcement in March, every person who applies to the Warmer Homes scheme has their home surveyed by a professional contractor working on behalf of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI). When those surveyors find an applicant who is living in a home that is in a particularly poor condition they will recommend the person for a deeper set of measures. When assessing a home for deeper measures the surveyors will look at factors such as the primary heating method, the construction method and the age of the home. For example, homes will be assigned deeper measures where there is no central heating, or only an open fire or a G rated boiler. If the boiler is G rated, the home must also have been constructed with solid wall or hollow block and been built pre-1978. <\/p>  <p>  I would like to make these deeper renovations available on a wider basis but deep energy efficiency interventions can cost many times that of shallower interventions so I must attempt to find a balance between the depth of the renovations that the scheme can offer and the number of people the scheme can help each year. By the end of this year, SEAI expect to have completed up to 500 of these deeper renovations. <\/p>  <p>  I also spoke about the Warmth &amp;amp; Wellbeing scheme. The Warmth and Wellbeing scheme is a pilot initiative being delivered under the Government&rsquo;s Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty and the Healthy Ireland Framework. The main aim of the scheme , which began in 2016, is to demonstrate the positive effects that making homes warmer and more energy efficient can have on the health and wellbeing of people in energy poverty who are living with a chronic respiratory condition. An independent research project will assess the impact the scheme is having. At the conclusion of the scheme and with independent evidence on its effectiveness, the potential for a wider rollout will be considered.<\/p>  <p>  In total, 276 homes have been upgraded so far under the scheme and\u00a0surveys and works are underway on another 262 homes.\u00a0Recruitment of participants will continue\u00a0over the winter months and those people will have their upgrades carried out as early as possible in 2018, as this type of work cannot always take place during the winter. <\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0will have\u00a0allocated at least &euro;20m in funding to this\u00a0programme by the end of 2018 to provide for the upgrade of at least 1,500 homes.

The Committee had an advisory and consultative role to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in matters to do with youth work, including the coordination of youth work programmes and services. In line with these provisions, a new National Youth Work Advisory Committee was appointed by the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with a term of office of one year with effect from 28 January 2013.   The Committee had its final meeting on 26 November 2013.  The Committee continued to work with my Department and assisted with the development of the new National Youth Strategy, in particular in identifying in what ways the youth work sector can contribute to shared policy objectives for young people. <\/p>  <p>  The National Youth Strategy 2015-2020 was published in, 2015. The implementation structures established by my Department under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures (BOBF), the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People oversee the roll out of the National Youth Strategy. There is no doubt that the youth work services have a significant contribution to make to realise the goals of the National Youth Strategy as part of a cross sectoral, whole of society approach to supporting young people in their everyday lives.  For this reason, the key youth sector interests are represented on the structures established by my Department to support the implementation of Better Outcomes Brighter Futures. At national level, representatives of the voluntary youth services have been appointed to the Advisory Council of BOBF. At local level, youth sector representatives participate in the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Services Committees. Key Government departments and agencies that have an interest in children and young people and that had served on the National Youth Work Advisory Committee are represented on the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium and on the Sponsors Group that have been established under Better Outcomes Brighter Futures to drive the effective implementation of the policy framework. <\/p>  <p>  There have been other significant policy and legislative developments that are relevant to the provision of youth services and the role of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee since the 2001 Act was passed. These include the introduction of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 which, inter alia, provides for a statutory function for Education and Training Boards in supporting the provision and assessment of youth work services at local level.  The National Strategy on Children and Young People&rsquo;s Participation in Decision-making 2015-2020, which was published by my Department in June, 2015 is particularly relevant. I am deeply committed to ensuring that young people are involved in the preparation, planning and implementation of policies that impact on their lives. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is fully committed to the reform of the many youth funding schemes. The Deputy will be aware that a number of targeted funding schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review in 2014. The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead. Work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the review. The Deputy will also be aware that my Department has commenced a review of the Youth Service Grant Scheme. This review is intended to enhance its accountability, transparency and outcome measurement.  It is also seeking to determine how best to meet the ever evolving needs of young people. <\/p>  <p>  My Department works closely with the youth work sector, the voluntary youth services, the Education and Training Boards, other government departments and agencies and consults with young people themselves in the development and delivery of policies and services for children and young people. <\/p>  <p>  For the above reasons, it is not my intention to reconvene the National Youth Work Advisory Committee while the reform process is ongoing. Given the seismic changes which have occurred over the past sixteen years, my Department will be revisiting the Youth Work Act, 2001 on the conclusion of the reform process, to ensure that it fully articulates the needs of young people in Ireland. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100077#WRH05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Funding","counter":467,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100077#WRH05300"},{"type":"question","counter":468,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[43107\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017101100077#WRH05400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if she will make funding available to an organisation (details supplied) in order that it can build a purpose room to cater appropriately for all the needs of the children that use its service; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":469,"content":"<p>My Department is committed to the development and reform of the Capital programme in respect of the needs of children and providers, with the aim of providing childcare facilities of the highest quality.
