The letter from HSBC states it thinks it could not assist, but I it might be able to do so.  I received a telephone call from one of the members of staff here and was asked to take the second slot after Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins today, which is fine, in putting questions to the Revenue Commissioners and, as I thought, the HSBC representative.  When I rang the secretariat the day before yesterday, I asked if a representative of HSBC was coming to the meeting and was told \"No.\"  The reason given was that it would not be appropriate for them to come and sit in on the meeting.  I then said I would like the representative to be here and asked the secretariat to request that they attend.  I note that HSBC has not refused to come to the committee; the correspondent just states it does not think it can help us.  I believe it could.  I was assured that the staff would get in touch with the Chairman about whether they were to come.

To refer again to the letter of 9 March, HSBC stated that, given the fact that it was not aware of some of the issues involved, it would assist where possible but that specific questions would have to be put in writing.  What Deputy Shane Ross is raising is the fact that last week we agreed to do this in a particular way.  Now, due to not extending an invitation to the representative in London, that will not happen today.

The tenor of the letter we will now send to London should be that we wish to have a representative from London who could actually answer questions and would have the relevant information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015031200002#C00800","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speech","time":1426154400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I do not believe it is appropriate to chastise staff in front of members in the manner that happened a minute ago.

As we have sent a detailed report to the committee in response to questions raised in early February, I will not go into that level of detail.  However, I would like to give an overview of Revenue's offshore investigations, of which the investigation into HSBC's Swiss account holders is part.  I should state my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality, as provided for in section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  <\/p> <p>  By way of context, it is important to be aware that, prior to receiving the information from the French tax administration, Revenue had identified the use of offshore accounts as a serious tax risk to the Exchequer.  A dedicated branch, the offshore assets group, was set up in 2001 and its main purpose was to uncover and confront the use of offshore accounts by Irish resident individuals.  To date, the offshore assets group has secured in excess of &euro;1 billion for the Exchequer.  From 2002 to 2012, we obtained 20 High Court orders against financial institutions in seeking details of transfers to and from offshore accounts in other jurisdictions.  In 2009 specific orders were directed at transfers to and from Switzerland.  In March 2010, when Revenue became aware that the French tax administration had come into possession of information on accounts held with HSBC Swiss, the then Chairman immediately wrote to it, requesting data related to Irish residents.  The French administration provided us with this information on 23 June 2010.  The data contained information on accounts of individuals and corporates, with more than 98% of the total funds identified as being related to the funds industry.  As set out in our report, the maximum value of assets in accounts of Irish individuals was $29 million, which at the time was equivalent to &euro;22 million.  A detailed breakdown of the cases involved is set out in the report.<\/p><p>Each individual and corporate listed was examined and 33 Revenue investigations were initiated following analysis of the data.  Four cases were selected for investigation with a view to criminal prosecution and three cases were successfully prosecuted with one still under way.  Of the 33 investigations, 27 have been completed with the remainder ongoing.  Settlements were made in 19 investigations and &euro;4.6 million was recovered, over 60% of which relates to interest and penalties.<\/p><p> In conclusion, I am satisfied that Revenue fully investigated the data received from the French tax administration.  I can assure the committee that all of the account details provided were risk assessed by the offshore assets group with a view to investigation to recover any tax due together with interest and penalties.  Suitable cases were also prosecuted.<\/p><p> Revenue has a considerable track record in tackling serious tax evasion.  Since 1998 we have conducted a series of special investigations which yielded in excess of &euro;2.7 billion in tax, interest and penalties.  Our approach to tackling offshore tax evasion has been adopted by the OECD as best practice and has been adopted by other tax authorities.  Practical measures are now under way at OECD and EU level to further improve the exchange of information between tax administrations and thereby limit the opportunity to avail of bank secrecy to facilitate tax evasion.  I will be glad to provide any clarification on the details set out in the report, subject to taxpayer confidentiality. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015031200002#C01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426154400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Thank you, Mr. Cody.

After I was appointed to my position, the following Monday week <i>The Irish Times<\/i>covered the story and the ICIJ had a fairly high-profile, really interesting story.  I was given responsibility as accounting officer for Revenue at the start of January  and was appointed chairman on 1 February.<\/p><p>Since my appointment I have carried out a restructuring of responsibilities at senior level within the organisation.  This restructuring included a realignment of responsibility for Revenue's investigation and prosecution division.  When the story broke I asked the newly appointed head of IPD, the investigation and prosecution division, to lead a team to review our handling of the data contained on the HSBC disk and to evaluate the investigation that had been carried out.  This team re-examined the data on the disk to evaluate the investigation and the conduct of the investigation that had been carried out.  This review found that a robust approach had been followed.  I wish to add that I have been in Revenue all my life - at least it seems like all my life - but I was very confident that a rigorous approach had been taken to the data.  This was based on Revenue's track records since 1998 in dealing with special investigations, and in particular, on the records of the offshore assets group and such investigations. The principal officer and his team take their work seriously and the data sources regarding offshore accounts are their bread and butter.  They actively seek out new sources of data regarding offshore accounts as evidenced by the number of High Court orders they have successfully sought over the years.<br\/><br\/>The principal officer in charge of the unit told me a little story about Swiss accounts.  Back in 2009 when we looked for High Court orders directing Irish financial institutions to provide details of transfers to and from Swiss bank accounts, he prepared an affidavit in which he actually incorporated an advertisement that was placed by a Swiss bank in <i>The Irish<\/i><i>Times<\/i>in 2009, in the midst of our pursuit of offshore accounts.  This was an expensive advertisement in which the bank was saying, more or less, &quot;Do you want to lodge your money offshore with us?&quot;.  The bank's advertisement did not mention tax evasion nor any kind of hint that there was anything untoward about it but emphasised the bank's secrecy in Switzerland.  While we were in the midst of pursuing accounts in the Isle of Man and Jersey, one of the Swiss banks - not HSBC - were advertising in one of our newspapers the advantages of bank secrecy in Switzerland.  We included that advertisement in our affidavit for the High Court order which we were granted.  <br\/><br\/>When the story broke that the French tax administration had got access to this data, my predecessor immediately wrote to it.  We reported on this in our 2010 annual report and in the 2012 meeting of the PAC, the then Chairman had a short discussion about the HSBC disk with the members.  I think it was Deputy Murphy at the time.  We are very anxious to get these stories of our activities out there because this is what helps voluntary compliance.  Knowing the principal officer and the team in charge of these offshore assets I know that they take their work seriously.  Last week, the <i>Sunday Business Post<\/i>had an article which stated that a person getting a letter from the Revenue, will look at the top of the envelope to see if it has come from a tax district or if it is the case that it has come from the investigations and prosecution division, that person will get professional and legal advice.  That is the first step that one of the practitioners was recommending a person should do.  The people who are dealing with this are serious about what they do, they are good at what they do and I was fairly confident that they would have followed it through to the end.  I am satisfied but that is not to say that there are not cases currently involved in tax evasion using offshore accounts.  I refer to the work that is happening at OECD level, with the IRS in the US and the Foreign Account Tax Compliant Act, FATCA, and bank secrecy.  Bank secrecy hinders our work.  We are an early adopter of FATCA.  We are very proactive at OECD and EU level in regard to automatic exchange of information.  The work of our offshore assets unit has been the model for most other countries.  We are early movers in this area and countries have followed us. <br\/><br\/>In preparing for today's meeting I have been reading PAC reports going back over the time of three chairmen of the Revenue Commissioners.  The previous three chairmen have attended this committee and have spoken about our special investigations-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015031200002#D02800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426154400,"counter":99,"content":"<p>Mr. Cody must be an insomniac.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015031200002#E00200","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1426154400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I have developed insomnia traits over the past week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015031200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Cody"},{"type":"speech","time":1426154400,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cody and Mr. Gallagher.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2015031200002#E00400","speaker":"988"},{"type":"speech","time":1426154400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Cody and I congratulate him on his appointment.

We have been actively involved in discussions at EU level which have been in train since the 1990s.  Some member states have been more reluctant to sign up to the savings directive.  During our Presidency we were on the point of getting the savings directive finalised with the final two member states.

I am not here to defend HSBC London but its view is that the bank took over a Swiss private bank and claims that the standards that obtained in Switzerland were not the standards the bank upholds.<\/p> <p>  From a tax administration point of view, what is really interesting is that the focus on the facilitation of bank secrecy, in terms of the story and the coverage of it, has helped improve transparency.  The Swiss authorities have signed up for the OECD common reporting standard, CRS, which is the next generation of exchange information about bank secrecy.  Were Revenue to appear before this committee ten years ago and were members to ask Frank Daly, as it was at the time, whether he expected the Swiss would sign up to exchange information about bank secrecy, he would have said this would be a really big challenge.  We now are looking at that opportunity.  This raises something about which my board colleagues and I must think, namely, when the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, FATCA, agreement dealing with exchange of information between the US Internal Revenue Service, IRS, and Revenue comes into place, followed by CRS with effect from 2017, to which more than 90 countries have signed up for the automatic exchange of banking information.  There are people who unquestionably have money offshore that involves tax evasion and that is an absolute fact.

Built into our risk-analysis system are the results of previous investigations and audits and details of prior non-compliance.  It is one of the factors - it is not the only one - and we would continually monitor the same cases.  Obviously, there are individuals who have engaged in tax evasion and whose activities we have not yet uncovered.

Previous behaviour is one of the factors involved.<\/p> <p>  We also have a dedicated re-audit programme.  When I used to perform audits in the 1980s and 1990s, one of the issues about which we were always concerned was that once we secured an audit yield in respect of a case and once our work was done, the business involved immediately tried to recover that yield.  As a result, built into our system is a programme of constant monitoring and re-auditing.  Unfortunately, the re-auditing function shows that, on occasion, those who previously engaged in tax evasion and who made settlements reoffend.  In the context of our code of practice, the penalties we imposed are stepped up in respect of those who are discovered to have deliberately defaulted on a second occasion.

Somewhere on the globe there is a bank and funding ended up in these Swiss accounts.  The bank which claims to be above reproach in this regard - perhaps it is - now apologises for a culture as if it has only discovered it.  I find this amazing.  This is not to do with the work of the Revenue Commissioners.  <\/p> <p>  This emphasises the need to have a representative of HSBC here.  It shows total disrespect to customers in this country and the 450 employees that HSBC representatives have not turned up here and, at least, issued a statement.  I refer to what happened in the earlier part of the meeting when it was mentioned that we had decided to write to HSBC and that it had responded by suggesting it had no information to offer because it was part of the London branch.  A representative of HSBC London is not available, but I do not know, as Deputy Joe Costello mentioned, whether this means a representative is not available permanently or not available right now.  HSBC is headquartered in London.  To go back to an earlier decision of the committee, we should act on it and write directly to HSBC headquarters to request the attendance at the committee of the individuals who attended the committee hearing in the United Kingdom.  If for nothing else, the bank should do this out of respect for its customers in this country.  This must be done and the request must be made to them.  The invitation must be issued immediately to complete the circle.<\/p><p>I say that by way of comment following our earlier conversation, but I think it is clear from the very constructive exchange we had this morning.  It gives us a deeper understanding of Revenue and it adds to our information.  HSBC could have shared in all of this this morning and could have availed of the opportunity to do something positive in terms of its connection here in Ireland which is not by any means a small entity, given that it employs 450 people.  I read in another part of its website that it is servicing $105 billion worth of assets under its management.  Those are not small figures so far as this country is concerned.  It is important that we act upon the invitation and insist that it comes before the committee.  So far as what Mr. Cody has done to enlighten us in terms of the report, we appreciate it.  We may look at the hearings in the UK and take some notes from what happened there, but I think HSBC has a case to answer in terms of its work in Ireland and what it did in Switzerland.

It is strange being on the other side of the fence, having reported on you.  In the invitation to appear before the joint committee I was asked to address four areas, namely, a narrative on how the property and banking sectors had interacted with government, elected representatives and the State during the period prior to the banking crisis in Ireland; a narrative on the nature of the relationship between the property sector, banking, government, elected representatives and the State; a narrative on what, if any, controls or structures were in place to regulate any such relationship; and whether being a small country was a factor in terms of any such relationship.  What follows is as a consequence of the extensive research I have done on foot of my book, my work as a consultant and a journalist and a presentation of facts.  I will begin to answer these four very broad questions by first looking at the historical context and the culture of deference which I argue was firmly established before the boom.  I will address these issues, primarily by focusing on political donations.<br\/><br\/>At the heart of the four corruption tribunals in Ireland in the past three decades - the beef tribunal, also known as the Hamilton inquiry; the McCracken tribunal; the Moriarty tribunal and the Mahon tribunal - were serious concerns about how political action was funded.  These tribunals, in particular the McCracken and Moriarty tribunals, exposed a deferential culture by regulatory authorities towards the banking sector during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.  They also identified a deferential culture by banks towards politics and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  An absence of political will to enforce regulatory compliance was a recurring theme within the tribunals.<\/p><p>I will give two very brief examples of this.  Central Bank inspectors examined the Guinness and Mahon bank loan book in 1976 and 1978.  The inspectors expressed concern that &quot;Guinness &amp;amp; Mahon was facilitating a tax avoidance scheme [which] was tantamount to facilitating tax evasion&quot;.  The Central Bank inspectors discovered that one of its own directors had a loan of &pound;416,000 which was secured by a &pound;230,00 offshore deposit in the Cayman Islands.  The response by the Central Bank was to trust a promise made by the then Guinness and Mahon chief executive who promised that the bank would wind down its loan business to Irish residents which was backed by offshore deposits.  This promise was not kept.<br\/><br\/>Twenty years later, the McCracken tribunal discovered the consequence of this deference.  Ansbacher was the largest incidence of tax evasion in the history of the State.  Revenue subsequently yielded over &euro;112 million in unpaid taxes and penalties from 200 Ansbacher accounts.  This tax evasion was enabled by non-action by the Central Bank, Revenue Commissioners, company law regulators and prosecuting authorities.  For instance, although the Finance Act 1986 empowered Revenue to inspect non-residence declarations held by financial institutions, it did not do so.  <br\/><br\/>The second example of deference I will give is that of Charles J. Haughey's indebtedness to Allied Irish Bank which spiralled from &pound;188,000 to &pound;1.1. million in a four year period between 1975 and 1979.  The Moriarty tribunal noted that AIB &quot;exhibited a marked deference in its attitude&quot; towards the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  On his election as Taoiseach in December 1979, Mr. Haughey's personal overdraft was 77 times his &pound;14,717 gross annual salary.  Mr. Haughey's financial adviser, who also happened to be the <i>de facto<\/i>chief executive of Guinness and Mahon bank, negotiated a &pound;393,000 write-down of the Taoiseach's debts.  The tribunal described this &quot;somewhat unorthodox&quot; bank discount which amounted to one third of Mr. Haughey's overall arrears, as conferring &quot;a substantial benefit on Mr. Haughey in circumstances referrable to his political office and as an indirect payment&quot;.  Moreover, the Moriarty tribunal established that Mr. Haughey received at least &pound;9.1 million in donations between 1979 and 1996.  The McCracken and Moriarty tribunals revealed a distinctive overlap between prominent financial donors of Mr. Haughey and individuals within the banking and property sectors.  The journalist Colm Keena, in particular, has written and investigated a lot of this overlap.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of these two brief lessons from the tribunals is to illustrate that a culture of deference between State authorities, political parties, elected representatives, supervisory authorities, banking institutions and the property sector, was already well established by the 1990s.  This culture of deference operated in a context where political parties and individual politicians were particularly financially vulnerable.<br\/><br\/>The committee asked me to explain the narrative of the relationship between these different entities and I will do so by first looking at disclosed political donations to political individuals and political parties in the three elections of 1997, 2002 and 2007.  What follows is a short explanation of legislation on political funding as a means of describing the nature of the relationship between politics and the property and banking sectors.  The purpose of this is to demonstrate that it is impossible to present a complete picture of how political parties financed their 1997, 2002 and 2007 election campaigns.  Not all donations were legally required to be disclosed.  None the less, the disclosed donations infer a pattern as illustrated in the three graphs in the appendix to this submission.<br\/><br\/>The Electoral Act 1997 was enacted in response to controversy arising from unorthodox political donations which came to public attention during the course of the beef tribunal.  It emerged that some political individuals and political parties were reliant on donations from the beef industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  This relationship between the beef industry and politics created the public perception that a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>existed, in other words, that political donations facilitated policy decisions which benefited the beef sector.  <br\/><br\/>The 1997 Act established new rules for the disclosure of political donations.  For the first time in the history of the Irish State, political donations over a certain limit were required to be disclosed.  The threshold for disclosure of donations to political individuals, including candidates in D&aacute;il, Seanad, European and presidential elections, was &euro;634.87.  The threshold for disclosure of donations to political parties was &euro;5,078.95.  There was no limit as to how much could be donated.  <br\/><br\/>The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, maintained the disclosure limits under the 1997 Act but introduced a limit as to how much could be donated.  The threshold for disclosure of donations to political individuals remained at &euro;634, however, donations by the same donor must not exceed &euro;2,539 in any given year.  The threshold for disclosure of donations to political parties remained at &euro;5,078.  However, donations by the same donor must not now exceed &euro;6,349 in any given year.  Also of significance was the banning of foreign donations in circumstances where the donor was not an Irish citizen.<br\/><br\/>The Electoral Act 1997 and the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, required that political individuals, including candidates, and political parties must submit an annual statement of donations and election expenditure to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  I compiled information from the archives of the Standards in Public Office Commission for a ten-year period in order to construct the graphs in the appendix relating to political party funding.  Where I was unsure about particular figures I took the conservative approach and when in doubt I did not include them.  <br\/><br\/>I will now deal with disclosed donations to political individuals.  Figure No. 1 in the appendix represents all disclosed donations to political individuals between 1997 and 2009.  The period includes the 1997, 2002 and 2007 general elections.  In doing so it must be clearly acknowledged that this figure represents disclosed donations as opposed to undisclosed donations, donations under the &euro;634 threshold.  There are a number of observations that can be extrapolated from this data.<br\/><br\/>First, disclosed donations to political individuals significantly increased in election years.  That is not rocket science.  Second, Fianna F&aacute;il representatives attracted almost twice as many disclosed donations as all the other parties combined during the 2002 and 2007 general elections.  That Fianna F&aacute;il candidates were the beneficiaries of more disclosed donations than candidates from other parties is not surprising because proportionate to other parties, Fianna F&aacute;il traditionally runs more candidates.  For instance, of the 466 candidates who ran in the 2002 election, 22% were from Fianna F&aacute;il.  None the less, during that election year, Fianna F&aacute;il received two thirds of all funding disclosed which means that candidates from that party were in receipt of seven times more disclosed donations than a non-Fianna F&aacute;il candidate.  Third, it is not possible to break down the sources of disclosed donations as is the case for party donations because the donations tend to be from individuals without reference to business addresses.  I can deal with this in more detail later if the committee wishes.<br\/><br\/>Political individuals attracted significantly more disclosed political donations than political parties, notwithstanding the 2001 amended rules which introduced a higher donation limit to political parties of just over &euro;6,000, compared to donations to political individuals at just over &euro;2,500.  Disclosed donations to political individuals in 2007 amounted to &euro;855, 995.  Excluding subscriptions from the salaries of elected representatives to their parties, disclosed donations to political parties in 2007 amounted to just &euro;43,693.  It appears that it is more attractive to donate to political representatives than to political parties.<br\/><br\/>I will now look at disclosed donations to political parties.  Figure No. 2 in the appendix represents all disclosed donations to political parties between 1997 and 2009.  A number of observations can be extrapolated from this data.  Since the introduction of the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, which introduced a limit on the value of donations to be disclosed, a pattern emerged whereby all political parties disclosed under the limit.<\/p><p>For example, the disclosed donations by all political parties in 2001 amounted to &euro;753,523, the year before the 2002 election.  In contrast, the disclosed donations by all political parties in 2006 amounted to &euro;17,000, the year before the 2007 election.  These figures exclude politicians donating to themselves or their own political parties.  There appears to be a deliberate policy by political parties of soliciting donations below the disclosure thresholds.  This is perhaps due to the relatively small difference in the maximum donation that can be accepted by a political party, &euro;6,349, and the amount that must be disclosed, &euro;5,078.  The Fine Gael Party returned a nil disclosure to the Standards in Public Office Commission from 2001 to 2009 and, in fact, made its first disclosure last year.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party disclosed zero returns in disclosed donations for 2009, the year all three political parties ran substantial local and European by-election campaigns and a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon.<br\/><br\/>It is impossible to present a complete picture of how political parties were financed in this period.  Of the &euro;10.1 million spent by political parties and candidates in the 2007 general election which was disclosed to the Standards in Public Office Commission, just &euro;1.3 million of the donations was disclosed, with no information available on the origins of the remaining &euro;8.8 million.  That gap allows an unnecessary perception that something unorthodox is happening with political funding, but much of it can be explained by membership fees, annual draws and so forth.  The &euro;10.1 million figure does not encompass all of what was spent during the 2007 election.  The legislation only requires election expenditure in the period between the dissolution of the D&aacute;il and polling day, usually a period of three to five weeks, to be accounted for.  Electioneering prior to this period is not accounted for.  Election campaigning in the 2007 election, for instance, was well under way before May 2007.  The pre-election statement of intent between Fine Gael and the Labour Party, known as the &quot;Mullingar Accord&quot;, was inaugurated in 2004 and accompanied by a billboard campaign.  <br\/><br\/>I will now look at disclosed donations to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party by sector.  Figure 3 in the appendix represents all disclosed donations to Fianna F&aacute;il, excluding the donations to political representatives or individuals between 1997 and 2007.  They amounted to &euro;1.8 million; 80% of this figure was donated between 1997 and the change of the rules in 2001.  Subsequent to the 2001 Act, the maximum donation a party could receive was limited to &euro;6,349.  As outlined, this is an incomplete picture of how the Fianna F&aacute;il Party was funded because there are no statutory obligations to disclose donations below the legal threshold of &euro;5,078.  Nonetheless the figures do infer trends regarding sources of political donations.  The figures are as follows: some 35%, or &euro;635,970, of Fianna F&aacute;il's disclosed donations were from property and construction interests.  Fianna F&aacute;il received substantial donations in 1998 for the particular and stated purpose of campaigning in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement referendum.  When these are excluded, disclosed donations from property and construction interests amounted to 39%, or &euro;545,818.  A list of property companies and developers who donated to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party can be accessed on the Standards Commission's website.  All of them are on the public record.  Some 20% of the disclosed donations to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in that period came from business interests and amounted to &euro;367,000; 13% came from individuals, amounting to just over &euro;245,000; 9% came from the hotels and catering sector and amounted to just &euro;160,000; 7% came from the motor sector and amounted to just over &euro;122,000; just over 7% came from the food and drinks sector and amounted to just over &euro;126,000, while 5%, or about, &euro;90,000 came from banks and financial services.  This figure does not include, however, donations by individuals who were donating in a personal capacity but who were associated with the banking sector.  Some 4% or just over  &euro;70,000 were from professional services such as solicitors' firms and auctioneers.  Also in that period 34% or almost &euro;89,000 of the disclosed donations of the Progressive Democrats jof &euro;262,000 came from the property sector.<br\/><br\/>It appears that the property barons of the 1990s and 2000s had replaced the beef barons of the 1980s.  The Opposition did not disclose donations from property interests.  The Fine Gael Party disclosed a sum of &euro;197,914 in donations between 1997 and 2000 from a variety of businesses and individuals - 11 donations in all - but it did not disclose donations above the legal threshold from 2001 to 2009.  Almost two thirds of the Labour Party's &euro;392,000 in disclosed donations came from the trade union movement.  Sinn F&eacute;in was in receipt of almost &euro;1.3 million in disclosed donations in this period, much of it from the salaries of elected representatives, North and South, and organisation such as Friends of Sinn F&eacute;in, Australia and Friends of Sinn F&eacute;in, America.  I can give a breakdown of all the figures for all of the parties, if needed.  <br\/><br\/>The committee also asked me to look at controls and structures to regulate such relationships.  I will look at them by considering policy.  Irish legislation was criticised by the Council of Europe Group of States against Corruption, GRECO, in 2009 for failing to account for &quot;behaviour of those persons who are close to power and who try to obtain advantages from their situation by influencing the decision-maker&quot;.  Reliance on political donations from a particular sector may facilitate a perception of undue influence by donors over policy-making.  This undue but not illegal influence of vested interests over regulation and policy-making arises where elites have access to insider information which they utilise for their private benefit.  This informal misuse of power occurs where personal relationships, patronage, lobbying, political favours and political donations unduly influence the decision-making process, even if no laws are broken.<br\/><br\/>Did donors from the property sector have a vested interest in the formulation of policy?  Was the decision-making capacity of political parties eroded by a conflict of interest?  Were key political decisions insulated from critical debate because they were executed within a closed and cartelised system that facilitated regulatory capture?  What did the Honohan, Regling and Watson, Nyberg and Wright reports have to say about policy in this regard?  They offered limited analysis of the policy-making process outside he financial sector.  The Honohan report dedicated just six paragraphs to tax incentives aimed at the construction sector.  The Regling and Watson report briefly described the problem of policy analysis, design and implementation as &quot;unusually severe&quot;, pointing, in particular, to weaknesses in tax policy.  The Nyberg report had five paragraphs on what it termed &quot;advice on economic policy&quot;.  The Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, found that &quot;significant factors contributing to the unsustainable structure of spending in the Irish economy were due to the Government's procyclical fiscal policy stance, budgetary measures aimed at boosting the construction sector, and a relaxed approach to the growing reliance on construction-related and other insecure sources of tax revenue&quot;.  According to the Honohan report, tax reliefs incentive schemes and income tax exemptions for developers and investors included:<blockquote>multi-storey car parks, student accommodation, buildings used for third-level educational purposes, hotels and holiday camps, holiday cottages, rural and urban renewal, park-and-ride facilities, living over the shop, nursing homes, private hospitals and convalescent facilities, sports injury clinics and childcare facilities.  <\/blockquote>The Regling and Watson report noted that such tax reliefs &quot;directed to the property sector, often in particular regions of the country ... contributed to a more general misallocation of resources as some of the tax concessions seemed to have been granted on an ad-hoc basis in a not fully transparent way&quot;.  The incentives were not necessarily bad, as they brought much needed investment to particular areas of the country.  The problem was that they went on for too long.  As the committee has heard, Mr. Wright has acknowledged in his testimony to the banking inquiry that these policies should have been &quot;grandfathered&quot; or ended earlier.  <br\/><br\/>Why were reliefs extended twice in the period of their implementation?<\/p><p>For example, the Finance Act 1994 and Chapter 1, Part 9, of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provided for accelerated capital allowances for hotels.  While this special provision for hotels was terminated in budget 2003, the Finance Act 2003 included transitional arrangements that allowed for the continued availability of a 100% write-off over seven years provided certain conditions were met.  This arrangement was further extended in the Finance Acts 2004 and 2005.  The Finance Act 2006 extended the transitional period by introducing a phase-out period.  Peter Bacon, who has also come before the committee, complied a report for the Irish Hotels Federation which asserted that \"The tax allowance scheme allowed hotels to access both equity and debt finance easier than would be the case otherwise ... the total value of tax allowance related to hotels that have not been open seven years at the end of 2009 will be just over &euro;1.5 billion\".<\/p><p> Other incentives of note include the 2000 to 2007 special incentive tax rate for developers.  This sought to free up land for development by taxing proceeds from the sale of land at 20% instead of the higher rate of up to 42%.  Moreover, Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was amended in 2002 to allow developers to negotiate their way out of providing 20% social and affordable housing in any development through land swap, payments to local authority or the building of equivalent social and affordable housing elsewhere.  It would be helpful if the committee considered the following: a list of the tax reliefs and incentives granted by the Government to developers and investors between 1997 and 2007; the cost of these reliefs and incentives; the reason tax incentives were extended beyond their natural life spans; whether the structure of local government funding facilitated a financial dependency on development levies; whether reliance on such levies, worth nearly &euro;600 million in 2005 and &euro;700 million in 2006, influenced erroneous planning decisions; and the number of politicians, or their close associates, who received interest-free loans or mortgages on favourable terms or who received loans outside of normal lending practices.<\/p><p> The committee also asked me to look at suggested reforms and controls to moderate these kinds of relationships and I now turn to these.  I have presented eight reforms to regulate such relationships.  First, is independent audit of the capacity and operational ability of oversight agencies, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners, the Competition Authority and other agencies charged with the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of white collar crime.  This approach was taken in the UK after its financial crisis.  In 2008, the UK's Attorney General commissioned the De Grazia review which appraised the Serious Fraud Office, SFO, in regard to two US agencies, which were the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.  These were both well established bodies prosecuting serious and complex economic crime.  The review's 34 recommendations focused on operations, capacity, governance and external relationships.<\/p><p> Second, I recommend introducing monetary awards for whistleblowers.  This approach was taken in the USA following the economic crisis.  The Dodd Frank Act 2010 established the Office of the Whistleblower.  The Act expanded powers first introduced under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002.  The Securities and Exchange Commission is now authorised by the US Congress to provide monetary awards ranging between 10% and 30% of the money collected in cases where high quality original whistleblower information leads to a commission enforcement action of over $1 million in sanctions.<\/p><p> My third recommendation is the introduction of a register of liabilities.  Australia, Finland, New Zealand, Poland, Spain and Canada require politicians to publicly disclose any debts they may have.  Ireland only has a register of assets.<\/p><p> Fourth, I note that the Standards in Public Office Commission's annual report 2013 contains 20 recommendations on reforming our ethics and electoral legislation.  I submitted an additional six recommendations on the draft guidelines on party finance in my submission to the commission in 2013.<\/p><p> Fifth, I recommend that political parties be required to publish accounts under the guidelines on party finance in advance of the 2016 general election.  The delay by the Government in introducing these guidelines means that parties are not obliged to publish accounts until mid-2016 which may, in effect, be after the 2016 general election.<\/p><p> Sixth, I recommend the establishment of an independent commission to decide how political activity in Ireland is funded.  The principle that politicians should not regulate themselves is well established.  For example, political actors do not decide constituency boundaries.  Ireland's rules on political funding disproportionately favour incumbents and political parties.<\/p><p> My seventh recommendation relates to lobbying and seeks registration not only of lobbyists but of why decisions have been made.  I recommend the introduction of a web-based centralised information platform to co-ordinate consultations with individuals, stakeholders and lobby groups.  This would serve to report on input received on policy and detail how decisions were made.  It would improve the openness and transparency of engagement in policy-making by all actors.  Stakeholder and lobbying interaction is recorded by health department in Canada within what they call the Consultation and Stakeholder Information Management System, or CMIMS.<\/p><p> My eighth recommendation is to stop blaming our small population or geographical size for bad governance.  The committee asked me to examine whether being a small country is a factor in terms of problematic relationships.  The population size of a country is not a determining factor in measuring governance effectiveness.  Academic research shows that poor governance is correlated with the quality of institutions, in respect of which Niamh Hardiman went into considerable detail yesterday, lower levels of investment and growth, inequality, education, democratisation, colonial heritage, religion and an absence of legislative controls.  In Ireland's case, substantial levels of regulation combined with a high degree of State ownership have facilitated considerable political discretion.  These conditions have been at the heart of the majority of governance scandals since the foundation of the State.<\/p><p> In the appendix to my written submission, I include a table ranking the governance scores of 17 selected countries for 2008.  That year was chosen as the year of Ireland's financial crisis.  Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index, CPI, is a compilation of corruption scores which ranks countries from least corrupt to most corrupt while the World Bank measures good governance using six different indicators, of which four are presented in the appendix.  Although Transparency International and the World Bank use different aggregation methods, they are highly correlated.  The population sizes of the 17 countries is also set out in the table.  While this is a crude exercise, it demonstrates that countries with smaller and larger populations rank both higher and lower than Ireland in the good governance stakes.  Indeed, the table suggests that countries with smaller populations tend to have better governance than countries with larger populations.  To invoke being a small country is to use a bogeyman argument.  It is a lazy explanation for poor governance.  Many small countries escaped the economic collapse unscathed while many large ones did not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031200002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426118400,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Byrne for her opening statement.

I would reply, \"So you are saying that Ireland is more corrupt than all of the African countries and countries that have had dictatorships and so forth\".  There is a misperception in Ireland about how corrupt we are.  In comparative terms, which one can see in the table I have given at the end of my submission, Ireland ranks about the same as the UK, Germany and Belgium.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031200002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1426118400,"counter":392,"content":"<p>Dr. Byrne also stated \"that a culture of deference\" between Government elected representatives and State authorities with banks and the property sector was well established by the 1990s.

There was the Tully tribunal in 1975 that lasted two hours - the shortest tribunal in the history of the State.  There was also serious allegations on the front page of the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>by an outstanding investigative journalist called Joe MacAnthony.  A lot of what we subsequently were to find out was already in the public domain in the 1970s.<br\/><br\/>In my chapter I argued that the national coalition - the Fine Gael-Labour coalition - and some of their actions, ensured that these things were not fully investigated.  I remember interviewing the former Attorney General and High Court judge, Declan Costello, extensively about this.  In the archives I found a memorandum he had sent to the Government.  Around that time, in the UK, they were looking at introducing conflict of interest legislation.  Mr. Costello brought this to Cabinet, he sat at Cabinet at that time.  The UK introduced much of the legislation which subsequently came into being in the mid-1990s, particularly around conflict of interest but there was a reluctance to introduce it here, and Mr. Costello was very frustrated at that.  Twenty or 30 years later he was still noticeably frustrated that the Government, despite very obvious scandals happening, chose not to introduce legislation which would have regulated some of this behaviour.  <br\/><br\/>I think the point the Senator has made is that in the 1970s something happened in Ireland that had not happened before, and that was to do with population changes.  There were more people living in urban Ireland, for the first time, than there was in rural Ireland and one had this pressure on cities that one did not have before.  More people wanted to move into cities, more people wanted planning permission and the existing system was not structured for that demand.  A way of getting around that demand and delays in getting planning permission and facilities was that people tended to give money for planning permission or for certain facilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031200002#E02100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Elaine Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1426118400,"counter":404,"content":"<p>On page 5 of today's submission, Dr. Byrne states, \"[M]uch miisuse of power occurs where personal relationships, patronage, lobbying, political  favours and political donations unduly influence the decision-making process even if no laws are broken\".

With the existence of the Irish State before that period, our legislation on corruption and ethics was derived from British statutes, from 1889, 1908 and 1916.

Also, there was incredible frustration at the limit to what they could do in local government because of funding issues.  Local government in Ireland has very weak financial autonomy compared to that in other EU countries.  There is a large reliance on central government funding.  In Dublin City Council's case, for a decade there were outstanding fees from the Government in property taxes on State buildings around the city.

Some 24% believe the Government's efforts to combat corruption are effective.  I guess this comes back to the analogy I often use about shoes and shoelaces.  In many ways, Ireland has some of the best legislation in the world on governance and ethics.  America and the United Kingdom would give their right arm for the limits on political donations we have and Exchequer funding for political parties.  The US President's recent appointee as ambassador to Ireland is a political appointment, as all appointees are.  Such a concept would be alien to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  There are lots of things where Ireland stands head and shoulders above other countries when it comes to the legislative framework we have in place.

Before President Obama was doing it, the political parties here were deriving the majority of their funding from small donations from many members.

The problem is that the public does not see it, and only sees the gaps between the disclosed and undisclosed money.

Money is necessary to fund the salaries of research assistants and so forth.  My research shows that when particular sectors have donated in such large amounts to political parties, it suggests they were doing so because they were seeking influence or they felt it was necessary.  It is not unusual and occurs in many countries.  I referred to beef barons and property barons.  In the 1980s, the beef industry was donating to all political parties because beef was the biggest indigenous industry in Ireland at the time.<\/p><p>In the 1990s and 2000s it was property, because property was fuelling the economy.

There is a tendency in the Government to focus on numbers in its reforms, for example, how many local councils there are, how many Deputies there are, what are the salaries of particular individuals, whether somebody should vote at 18 years old or 16 years old and whether the age to be President is 35 years old or 21 years old.

With that in mind I will quote the definition of \"mediated corruption\".  I cannot recall the name of the author but it was in relation to the Keating Five.  The gain that the politician sees is political, not personal, and it is not illegitimate in itself as in conventional corruption.  How the public official views the benefit is improper, not necessarily the benefit itself or the fact that the particular citizen receives the benefit.  The connection between the gain and the benefit is improper because it damages the democratic process, not because the public official provides the benefit with a corrupt motive.  I guess this goes back to my experience of working in the United Nations anti-corruption unit where my boss used to say, just because a behaviour is not corrupt in the legal sense it might be morally corrupt.  If one is advising somebody about their behaviour, one might be within the letter of the law but one might be outside the spirit of the law.

However, the difference is that under the draft guidelines, they will be obliged to release that information on particular headings in order that one can compare how much each political party has received and spent under different categories.

It introduced concepts ahead of its time about meritocracy, some of which I have outlined.  This was not something that was particular to Cumann na nGaedheal or Fine Gael.  An election poster of &Eacute;amon de Valera in 1917 in the East Clare by-election, uses the phrase to vote for a patriot, not a place-hunter.  That idea of politics, held by the first-generation across all political backgrounds, was one motivated by the words the Senator has just used, namely, by this moral duty to the country.<\/p> <p>  In many respects, Ireland has a lot of positives and has very robust legislation.  For me, it is immensely frustrating to see such silly mistakes being made, these shoelaces over which we continually trip, about public perception over some of the instances I have mentioned, about ringing bells, appointments to the Seanad or whatever it may be, because it generates such attention that does not reflect the legislative regime that we have.

Just because an individual does not know, one also should ask, \"Well, should they have known?\"  There is a responsibility therein.  One cannot just hide behind this veil of \"I didn't know.\"  The question then arises that one should have known and there is liability therein.<\/p> <p>  The other piece in that article I referred to was in relation to Europe and penalties that the UK is also trying to bring in on not just fining banks, but fining individual bankers.  There has been research done that since 2008 extraordinary fines have been imposed on banking institutions around the world, but behaviour has not changed.<\/p> <p>  The governor of the Bank of England, who also happens to be an Irish passport holder, has argued very vehemently, \"What has changed?\"  We have had an economic collapse.  We have had institutions that have collapsed.  We have had massive consequences to individual citizens, but the behaviour of some of these banks has not changed because it is almost like banks are using fines as a line within their accounts.

It is not an unusual phenomenon.  The Galway tent, notorious in its own way, was our version of it until recently.  Back in the 1960s, the nexus of connection between the construction sector and politicians became evident with the formation of Taca, a Fianna F&aacute;il fund-raising organisation which used to run &pound;100-a-plate dinners to raise money for the party and which were pretty scandalous at the time.  It is known that there were close connections between leading property developers and senior politicians, as the latter could facilitate the former in securing State tenants for planned office buildings, particularly in Dublin, to cater for our growing Civil Service.<br\/><br\/>Politicians at local level also played a crucial role in facilitating ambitious plans.  Since the 1963 Planning Act came into force in October 1964, it has been a &quot;reserved function&quot; of councillors to make decisions on the content of city or county or indeed, town development plans.  What this meant was that they were in charge of zoning land -- making decisions about which land would be designated for development and which land would not be so designated.  They had the power, in other words, to transform the value of agricultural land anywhere in Ireland, multiplying it by a factor of ten or more.  So there was a lot riding on such decisions.<br\/><br\/>Between 1963 and 1971, land values in the Dublin area soared by 530% as the scale of the development opportunities became evident and speculators scrambled to buy up land likely to be rezoned for housing, industry or whatever.  The then Fianna F&aacute;il Government established a committee on the price of building land, chaired by a renowned constitutional lawyer, Mr. Justice John Kenny, to recommend ways of curbing such speculation.  It proposed that all land required for development should be designated and then acquired at its existing use value, plus a premium of 25%.  Sadly, over the past 40 years, however, nothing was done to implement this recommendation by any Government in the entire period.<br\/><br\/>It was inevitable under these circumstances that land speculation would continue and that zoning would become tainted by corruption.  Allegations that &quot;brown envelopes&quot; were changing hands, first surfaced in 1974, but a Garda investigation got nowhere.  Subsequent Garda investigations in the late 1980s and again in 1993 also got nowhere.  The latter investigation, the 1993 investigation, incidentally, arose out of a week-long series of articles in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>written by Mark Brennock and myself, on suspicious land rezoning decisions in County Dublin.  It led off with a news story on the front page, headed, &quot;Cash in brown paper bags for councillors&quot;.  An advertisement placed by a firm of Newry solicitors offering a &euro;10,000 reward on behalf of then anonymous clients for information that would secure the conviction of persons for engaging in land rezoning corruption ultimately led to the establishment of the planning tribunal, chaired first by Judge Feargus Flood and later by Judge Alan Mahon.  The tribunal heard voluminous evidence from witnesses with first-hand experience of corrupt payments and drew a number of conclusions in this regard that were later deemed technically unsound following a Supreme Court ruling.  However, I have no doubt personally that corruption lay at the heart of Dublin County Council&rsquo;s most contentious land rezoning decisions.<br\/><br\/>One has to remember that the planning tribunal was dealing only with County Dublin as it then was.  I have no doubt that there has been corruption elsewhere; otherwise, decisions made by elected representatives against the advice of planning officials are almost inexplicable.  After all, we have a political system that is based on clientilism - as the members of this committee know very well.  I would define clientilism as doing individual favours for individual constituents, in effect, turning citizens into clients.  How much more of a step is it really to seek &quot;political donations&quot; in return for performing such &quot;services&quot; as rezoning such-and-such a parcel of land rather than such-and-such another parcel of land?  I would suggest that there is not much of a step between those two things.<br\/><br\/>Local area plans that were intended to give people more control over what happened in their own areas were turned instead into vehicles for land speculation and the enhancement of land values.  This applied right across the board.  Laois, Monaghan, Westmeath and Wexford, were among the counties that fell victim to this trend.  However, every council in Leinster, it seemed, wanted to secure a slice of Dublin&rsquo;s development.  There was massive over-zoning of land during the boom period.  In some cases, so much land was being zoned under county and local area plans that it could cater for decades of housing development.  In one case, enough land had been zoned in a particular county plan that would have catered for housing demand up until the year 2070.  Every county was making these decisions in disregard for what other counties were doing, or not doing, as the case may be.  Pressures from farmers and other landowners to have their patches of land zoned for development reached fever pitch in 2007, as the property bubble inflated to its full overblown size.  It was little short of a frenzy, as I recall.  There was a sense of &quot;It&rsquo;s now or never&quot; in the air, and some feared that they had already missed the boat or, rather in this case, the hot-air balloon.<br\/><br\/>Pumping up this balloon for most of the period under review was an array of lucrative tax incentives.  There was the long-established section 23 incentive for buy-to-let apartments or houses, and other tax breaks for the development of run-down seaside resorts - a measure introduced by the Rainbow coalition in 1996 - hotels, multi-storey carparks, student housing and a specific area-based tax incentive scheme called the upper Shannon rural renewal scheme, which applied to all of counties Leitrim and Longford as well as parts of Cavan, Roscommon and Sligo.  In theory, nearly anything developed anywhere within this vast designated area would qualify for tax incentives under the scheme introduced in 1998 by then Finance Minister, Charlie McCreevy.  It is hardly surprising then that among the counties severely hit by the phenomenon of ghost estates were Leitrim and Longford, because not only was there massive over-zoning, there was also massive over-development.  <i>Laissez faire<\/i>planning policies, largely landowner or developer-driven, created the framework for it all to happen while the advent of motorways facilitated and encouraged the sprawl of Dublin and other urban centres by leading people to imagine that they could live up to 100 km from where they worked and get there and back by car.  In Gorey, County Wexford, for example, more than 70% of new residents were commuting to work in Dublin, nearly 90 km to the north.  The same was happening all over Leinster and even in parts of Ulster.  I would instance Virginia, County Cavan, or Carrickmacross in County Monaghan, which have suburban housing estates that are really part of Dublin, in effect.<\/p><p>Yet, the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, which were adopted in 1999, had stressed the importance of consolidating the metropolitan area.  In other words, the guidelines were anti-sprawl.  Although if the guidelines were to mean anything they would have to be enforced, incredibly, no effort was made to do this either by local or central Government.  If the suburbs of Dublin were springing up in such unlikely places as Rochfortbridge in County Westmeath, which is 80 km from the capital, it was attributed to market forces and people would come to their senses when houses lost their value, which has happened.<br\/><br\/>The Government even used escalating house prices in Dublin to promote its controversial decentralisation programme, noting that public servants with homes in the capital would do well on selling them and buying a much cheaper house in one of the 53 locations to which more than 10,000 of them were to be dispersed.  The other beneficiaries were the business communities in the towns where new Government office blocks were to be built, including estate agents, shopkeepers, publicans, providers of other local services and those who had sites for sale.  It was the same with property-based tax incentives.  As more investors availed of these incentives, a whole sector of society had a major vested interest in ensuring the incentives continued for as long as possible.<br\/><br\/>The banking inquiry committee needs to ask why the property-based tax incentives were continued for so long even though the construction industry was having its biggest, most profitable spree ever.  Although it was perfectly justified to introduce the section 23 tax incentive in the late 1980s when the construction industry was on its knees and desperately needed a lift, to persist with these incentives when the construction industry was leading the boom was the height of folly.  The Government was adding fuel to the fire, stoking an already hot furnace.  The committee needs to ask former Ministers for Finance of the period precisely why they decided that a range of property-based tax incentives should remain in place, given that no public interest reason can be offered to justify such an irrational fiscal policy.<br\/><br\/>The availability of lucrative tax incentives combined with cheap credit and <i>laissez-faire<\/i>practices in the banking and planning sectors created and sustained the property bubble.  Bankers also played the role of touts for developers.  Frequently, it was bankers who spotted development opportunities at well located sites and lined up client developers to run with them, with the bank providing the loan financing.  Thus, developers ended up &quot;leveraged up to their eyeballs&quot; as one observer put it.  The banks were counting on these developers as men with the Midas touch to repeat their previous performances again and again as more sites came onto the market, even with eye-watering price tags.<br\/><br\/>So many of us were caught up in the bubble that we could not see it in perspective or at all.  It became normal that a fairly average semi-detached house could be worth &euro;1 million or more and that the price per square metre of residential accommodation was higher in Dublin than it was in Paris.  Every day, banks sought to persuade us to take out loans for new cars, holidays, home improvements, houses or whatever, and many of us did in droves.  That is why economist Professor Morgan Kelly's warning of an imminent collapse in the property market, published by <i>The Irish Times<\/i>in December 2006, was regarded by many as being as heretical as Martin Luther nailing his theses to the great west door of the Wittenberg cathedral.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031200002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank McDonald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426118400,"counter":639,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. MacDonald for his opening statement.

It is not unusual for councils to be responsible for the zoning of land, and I have no problem with it.  My problem is that many of those decisions were taken at the behest of developers, landowners or speculators who were in business at the time.  The former chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, Mr. John O'Connor, who subsequently went on to chair the Pyrites Resolution Board, drew attention to it at the end of his term of office saying:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>By law, development should be led by democratic plans but during the boom period developers and vested interests had undue influence on plan making.  Developers had little regard for statutory development plans in buying land and designing schemes.  Banks ignored planning parameters in lending, local authorities failed to vindicate their own development plans and An Bord Plean&aacute;la has had to refuse or amend many poor quality development plans on appeal.  Land values were subverted as well.<\/blockquote>He went on to say that councillors and management succumbed to development pressures.  The notion was that everywhere should be developed.

There were conflicts between management and planners within local authorities, minimal involvement in planning decisions by local authority architects and An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decisions frequently went unheeded by developers.

My personal belief, as I said in my statement, is that there was such a large constituency of people who benefited from the tax incentives that, in itself, led to a lot of lobbying.  Whenever there was a danger that the incentives would be phased out, there was heavy pressure brought to bear on the Government by the construction industry to continue the incentives for as long as possible and to roll them over.  There were multimillionaires in this country who were property investors and who ended up paying hardly any tax at all because they were availing of so many incentives, including section 23, multi-storey car parks, hotels, student housing and so on.  I think they had the ear of Government.  That is my impression.  The construction industry realised the boomtime could only be sustained if the tax incentives were sustained because otherwise, how could people have thought it was good value to buy a two bedroom flat for &euro;450,000 if it was not for the fact that they were able to write all of that off against their tax liability?

The area around Courtown in County Wexford, for example, which included Riverchapel and a vast area, was designated and anything built in that area qualified for the tax incentives, in particular holiday homes.<\/p><p> The real problem with the scheme was that if the aim was to rejuvenate rundown seaside resorts like Enniscrone, Lahinch or Courtown then the incentives should have been restricted to things such as all-weather playing facilities, swimming pools or other such major elements that would have added value to those places.  However, once housing was included as a qualifying category it then ate up the vast bulk of the tax incentives available.  Something like 85% of all the investment leveraged by that tax incentive scheme consisted of houses.  In effect, those houses were three quarter scale.  The great trick of that tax incentive scheme was to persuade people who lived in semi-detached houses in the suburbs to spend their holidays in semi-detached houses, of a lesser scale, in one of the designated areas.  I do not think it was justified to that extent.

The construction industry, in particular, is very well connected, not just with the present Government but also with previous Governments, and very well able to lobby politicians and all the rest of it.  To give an example, there was a case some years ago where the then Government had the option of introducing higher energy performance rating requirements for houses and higher energy performance standards in general.  That initiative was deferred, as a result of which approximately a quarter of a million houses were built during the boom period which have the most woeful energy performance and will all now have to be retrofitted.  The reason that happened, as an FOI request to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government revealed, was that the building regulations were going to have to be changed.  It was going to happen sooner rather than later due to the targets set under the Kyoto Protocol on climate change.  However, the memo went on to say, \"We don't want to signal this to the outside world just yet because the next leap in building standard insulation will probably involve making it difficult for the hollow block construction used widely in the Dublin area to survive\".  What is that except playing to a vested interest?  So what if there were guys making hollow concrete blocks in Dublin?  They can do something else.  Why was it regarded as being so important that this particular sector be protected?  These guys were building crap houses.<\/p><p>Let us be clear about that.  These houses were rubbish, from an energy performance point of view, and yet the Department of the environment allowed it to go on and on.  It was only in recent years that we finally caught up with the idea that we needed to have higher energy performance in housing, so that people do not have to spend so much money on fuel and all the rest, and we can cut down emissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015031200002#W01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank McDonald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1426118400,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. McDonald.

There was an incentive for them to grant planning permission because they would get, say, &euro;60,000 or &euro;200,000 in development levies in return.  It became one of their major money-spinners during the boom period.  Many of these levies, as we now know, were not paid, however, because the market had collapsed and the developers had gone to the wall or whatever.<\/p> <p>  It was not just development levies.  The other factor that played a crucial role in determining whether something was permitted or not was the long-term benefit to the council of the rates revenue that a development could generate.  For example, every shop in the huge complex of Dundrum Town Centre is paying rates to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.

The devotion to the idea of property ownership is related to the cultural and historical legacy of Ireland, and history of dispossession and fear of dispossession, which is something that makes the rental market such a minority thing.  It is quite normal in Switzerland, Germany and other continental countries for people to rent rather than buy because it is more convenient for them and they do not fear being thrown onto the street.  Here, there is a fear that people have no security if they rent so they need to buy.
