I welcome the opportunity to provide them with an update on progress and some technical aspects of the scheme from a breeding perspective.  Given that we were here just a few months ago, I will try not to cover the same ground again.  However, it might be useful to recap a little.  By way of background, the ICBF is an independent, industry-owned agency responsible for the generation of genetic evaluations for cattle in Ireland, and it is licensed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We have attended the various farmer meetings around the country over the past couple of months and have fielded many queries and concerns on the technical breeding and genomics-related aspects of the scheme.  In that context and the context of the invitation to attend again today, I propose to cover some of the key issues from a breeding perspective, and my colleague, Dr. Andrew Cromie, and I will be more than happy to attempt to answer any questions asked.<\/p> <p>    The first question concerns the nature of the core issue in terms of genetic gain in the national suckler herd.  The reality in terms of the genetic gain in the national suckler herd is that farmers have done a very good job in increasing the genetic merit in the terminal, or meat, traits of their animals.  Unfortunately, these gains have been offset by continued decline in the maternal traits, concerning milk and fertility.  The current make-up of the replacement index is contained in figure 1 of my submission.  Members will see that the five key aspects are calving, feed intake, carcase weight, maternal milk, female fertility and, carrying some weighting, docility.  The key point is that genomics can bring to bear the ability to predict how animals will perform in the more difficult to measure and see traits of milk, fertility and docility.  When one looks at an animal, one cannot necessarily tell how well it will calve, its feed intake, the amount of milk it will produce or its fertility or docility levels.  One could have a good stab at guessing its carcase weight or other traits.  Unfortunately, the terminal, or meat, traits that the industry has been chasing are negatively correlated to the maternal traits, which are key for the profitability of our cows.  That means that as we breed for more muscle, a higher growth rate and other traits in our animals, the calving, milk, and fertility traits go in the opposite direction.<\/p> <p>  Why is fertility in our cows important?  Members should consider figure 2 in my submission, which refers to two herds, the first of which is a high-fertility herd of 20 cows producing 19 calves.  Therefore, there are 0.95 calves per cow per year, with an average weaning weight of 350 kg.  The total weaning weight produced in that herd would be 6,650 kg.  The second example is a low-fertility herd, again with 20 cows but producing only 14 calves.  Those calves are heavier than in the first herd, averaging at 400 kg and with a total weaning weight of 5,600 kg.  However, although the weanlings in the second herd are heavier, because there are more in the high-fertility herd the latter produces 1,050 kg more.  At a weanling price of &euro;2.20 per kilogramme, there is a difference of &euro;2,310 between the prices achieved from both herds.<\/p> <p>  With regard to how farmers have come to know the Euro-star evaluations of their cows, in September beef data and genomics programme Euro-star reports were sent to participants in the scheme.<\/p><p>An example page is contained in figure 3.  It contains details on the animal, namely, the jumbo, the tag, the date of birth, the sex and the star rating of the animal.  Most farmers were pleasantly surprised regarding the status of their herds, and the reports have significantly eased the concerns of many of the scheme participants.  However, one of the key messages coming from the reports is that the majority of four and five-star cows are the older cows, as the terminal breeding continues to flush the maternal genes out of our cows.  Thus we need to pay much more attention to the bulls and cows we are using to breed the next generation of replacement females.  That is a key focus of the scheme.<\/p><p> To recap on how Euro-stars are calculated and what the Euro-star rating means, there are two parts to it.  One is the Euro part, which represents the additional profit an animal, male or female, will deliver compared with another animal.  If one animal is rated at &euro;50 in that respect and another animal is rated at &euro;100, the latter animal is predicted to provide &euro;50 more profit per progeny than the animal rated at &euro;50.  In terms of the stars, the animals are ranked into quintiles, in different 20 percentiles.  For example, the five-star animals are the top 20%, the three-star animals are the average, and the one-star animals are the bottom 20%.<\/p><p> The majority of the data used in genetic evaluations come from the individual farms. The 2008 suckler scheme changed the landscape in terms of data for suckler cattle in Ireland.  The culture of data recording on suckler farms that this scheme brought about has had a dramatic impact on the quantity and quality of data that are available for use in genetic evaluations.  The participation of on-farm recording has also facilitated the linking of mart and factory data, which are very powerful data for genetic evaluations.  That is why the evaluation system available to Irish farmers is as powerful as it is, because of the high levels of integration in the various industry data capture systems.<\/p><p> A key question is whether the adoption of Euro-stars take the industry in the right direction?  Figures 5 and 6 show the results of some analysis we have done of around 100,000 replacement females that were born in 2008, the first year of the suckler scheme, and that subsequently came into current beef data and genomics programme participant herds as female replacements.  We then analysed the data we had on the offspring of these females to see how we performed.<\/p><p> Figure 5 contains the weanling performance.  I would point out a few key points.  In terms of the percentage of animals that are still alive, 79% of the five-star females are still alive versus 63% of the one-star females, so there is a difference of 16%.  The five-star females have had 4.57 progeny, on average, versus 3.94 for the one-star animals, which is  0.63 of a calf more for the five-star versus the one-star animals.  The five-star animals are 27 kilos ahead of the one-star animals in terms of the weanling weight, and the value achieved at the marts is &euro;786 versus &euro;757, a difference of &euro;28.  When we add up all those figures, the offspring of five-star animals has averaged &euro;3,587 versus &euro;2,980 for one-star animals.  Five-star cows have had more progeny, are lasting longer, have had heavier weanlings, albeit at a slightly low price per kilo and have generated &euro;28 more per weanling and a total of &euro;600 profit more per date over the one-star animals.<\/p><p> If we note the carcass performance in terms of the factory output, we see a similar profile.  The five-star animals have had more progeny go through the factory.  The animals are being slaughtered significantly younger, almost 39 days younger.  They are slightly heavier in terms of carcass weight.  There is no difference on average in terms of the confirmation, and with respect to the price achieved at the factory, they are ahead by &euro;17.  When we add more progeny and a higher carcass weight, there is a &euro;600 difference between the offspring of five-star animals and that of one-star animals followed through to slaughter.<\/p><p> Figure 7 is a graph that was presented at the Teagasc national beef conference by N&oacute;ir&iacute;n McHugh from Teagasc in which 1,200 cows and calves across 40 herds were weighed.  The results showed that, on average, five-star cows were 26 kg lighter than the one-star cows, thus costing less to maintain, but that the offspring of five-star cows were 30 kg heavier at weanling.  Five-star cows are producing more from less, the essence of the scheme in terms of increased profitability at farm level, and more environmentally sustainable in terms of more outputs from fewer inputs.<\/p><p> Will the four and five-star cows move us away from the breeds we have been using?  The graph illustrates that there are four and five-star cows across all breeds and although some breeds will have more of a challenge, there is no need for herds to change breed in order to meet the four and five-star requirements of the scheme.  What happens when the Euro-star indexes move?  It should be noted that the indexes will move over time as we get more data into the system.  Some will move more than others but there will be movement in all species, including dairy animals, sheep, pigs and chickens.  Beef will be no different.  The key from a scheme perspective is that once an animal has a four and five-star index at the required time, when it is genotyped, it will be eligible from a scheme perspective, even if its rating subsequently drops to three stars or below.<\/p><p> In terms of the current status of engagement with the scheme by farmers for the 2015 requirements, over 19,000 herds have returned samples for genotyping.  In terms of animal survey requirements, over 20,000 herds have returned some data on the survey forms for their animals.  We are currently following up with farmers to ensure maximum levels of completion ahead of the December payment runs by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p><p> We are very confident in the ability of genetics to deliver improved profitability for Irish suckler farmers.  Five-star cows have the potential to deliver an extra &euro;100 profit per year to farmers and, as a result, we strongly believe the scheme has the capacity to deliver long-term benefits to the Irish suckler industry well beyond the six year timelines of the scheme.  The most recent engagement with thousands of farmers across the country has served to reinforce our view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015111700002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Coughlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Aylward taking the first line of questioning?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015111700002#O00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>No, I am not a member of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015111700002#O00300","speaker":"1199"},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Okay.

Would it be a smaller-framed animal, to put it simply?  It would not be as attractive for the likes of the Italian trade as a live export.  With regard to replacement of cattle, we have seen a problem detailed at meetings where an animal had twins and one had a different rating, despite being from the same cow.

I hope to be just as brief with my questions, which arise as a follow-up as I know the witnesses tried to address many of the issues.  With regard to the purchasing of a bull with a rating of four or five stars, the witnesses stated that indexes will move.  Has that always been stated publicly at meetings as some farmers are confused because departmental officials and officials from the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation have given conflicting views?  Will the witnesses confirm today that this is the case and there is no change?<\/p> <p>  With the calculation of different percentages, how is docility only given 4%?  A number of farmers might say a quieter animal would thrive much more.  Why is such a small percentage given in the importance of the overall scheme?  The last question follows on and relates to Deputy Fitzmaurice's comment.  One farmer has given an example of six animals with the same bull and dam which seem to have different ratings.  Four were born in 2008 and two in 2009.  Why have the indexes moved quite widely although they come from the same gene pool?<\/p><p>Perhaps the witnesses will be able to explain it in a way that puts people's minds at ease because the goalposts seem to be moving, which is causing confusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015111700002#O00800","speaker":"1041","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cromie and Mr. Coughlan for coming before the committee.  I found our previous meeting with them very informative.  I will go over some of the issues raised by Deputy Fitzmaurice.  I am participating in the scheme, and last year I bought 16 heifers as replacements before the scheme was introduced.  They happened to be Black Angus, which is an Angus and Hereford cross, and when I received the ratings, 14 of them were five-star heifers and two were four-star heifers.  This was because they are from a dairy herd.  The witnesses can produce figures to state animals are more profitable if they come from dairy herds, given the milk rates, but I am concerned we will lose the Italian and Spanish trade because these animals will not breed E and U grade animals, which are required for the Italian market in particular.  We may lose this trade because we will not have enough of them.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Cattle Breeding Federation's website states 17 traits are taken into account.  We have a list of six here, which means there are 11 more traits.  According to the list we have, weanling weight is the first trait, which can be established through the mart.  Will people such as me, who do not sell weanlings but continue to slaughter, be asked to weigh animals?  With regard to calving intervals, we all want a calf within 12 months because this is the ideal situation, but if farmers change the calving date from September to the following January for a cow which was a four-star or five-star animal, it may be downrated.  Calving difficulties are very hard to rate.  I still have to fill out my form about calving difficulties.  We want everything right, but will somebody state he or she had to jack 10, 11 or 12 calves and one was harder than the other?  This will be very difficult to establish.  Establishing progeny carcass weight is fine for someone slaughtering animals in this country, but when animals are exported, is there a follow-up process when they go to feedlots in Italy or Spain?  Do we have any way to establish an animal was slaughtered in Italy at 350 kg or 360 kg?<\/p> <p>  I am concerned about the dairy element.  I have a number of five-star cows which are either Angus or Hereford crosses.  My own cows, which are very good breeders, calve within 12 months, and produce a lot of milk and good calves, are only rated as one-star cows or two-star cows.  I am concerned we will go too much towards a dairy element.  I have a five-star bull, which I bought this year.  If I cross him with the five-star heifer, the next breed will be half-Limousin.  Will this animal have a five-star rating or will it go down to a four-star rating because the milk rate will drop because of not coming from a dairy herd?  How many generations of breeding does it take to drop the rating of an animal?<\/p> <p>  We cannot establish docility.  Nobody wants a wicked animal on the farm, whether a bull or a cow.  This is about honesty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015111700002#P00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>The minute's silence in the D&aacute;il is scheduled for 3.15 p.m.<\/p><p>I propose that we suspend proceedings for five minutes.

I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  The more information we convey to farmers, the better.  There was a lot of fear when farmers joined the scheme, but as information became available it became more acceptable to them.  I know one farmer who was very concerned and was going to withdraw from the scheme.  He brought his data to me one Sunday evening and we went through it, and he found he was at 68%.  All he had to do was continue. <\/p> <p>  Senator O'Neill referred to dairy herds which are of concern.  My part of the country along the Border and the west produce a lot of good quality weanlings that would be exported.  We do not want to lose that important market.<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses find that milk and fertility are linked in herds?  Many still hope the system will be reduced to three stars, particularly in the initial stages.  A review was promised and perhaps that is being considered at the moment.  The scheme could be reduced to three stars and then perhaps increased in a year or two as people become more used to it.  As people were breeding bulls, in particular, it may be a bit of a problem for them to achieve five stars on the bulls they are producing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015111700002#S00200","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I think the witnesses for coming before the committee.  This is one of the days where the gift of bi-location would be quite handy.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses said survey forms, in one form or another, for 20,000 herds have been sent in and samples have been returned for 19,000 herds.  I understand that initially about 27,000 filled out the form.  What is the latest date this year for sending in data in order that farmers can get paid before Christmas?  If farmers do not submit data for this year, does this mean they are out of the scheme or not?  Can they join at any stage for the five years of the scheme and can the scheme run for five years from that date?  Of the 7,000 who have not yet submitted data, do the witnesses know whether there is any correlation between them and herd size?  Does the figure involve predominantly large, small or medium-sized herds?<\/p> <p>  I tabled two parliamentary questions to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and to say that I did not get very clear answers is putting it mildly.  I asked him if a person who buys a five-star bull could find that in subsequent years the star rating of the same animal was reduced and if he would make a statement on the matter.  He told me that it could reduce, but if a bull was in a five-star category it would remain so.  My second question asked him if there was any guarantee that bulls currently rated star five on AI catalogues would retain their star rating in the future, the effect it could have on farmers if it was subsequently found that AI bulls had been overrated and if he would make a statement on the matter.<\/p><p>The Minister did not really address the issue at all.  I will try to clarify for the officials the point I was trying to make.  I listened to an expert on the subject recently in a southern county.  I went all the way down to listen to him.  He said that the reliability of many of the AI bulls in terms of the star rating was actually rather low.  For example, I could go to the catalogue and decide on a five-star bull.  Then my 50 cows could produce 50 calves.  The same would apply if it were 20 cows or ten or whatever.  However, I could easily find out two or three years later that I had actually mated the cows to a one-star or two-star bull.  It does not matter, except that the progeny, accordingly, would not be what I had thought they would be.  It would have been as if I had got a one-star or two-star rated bull.  In fact, the speaker was recommending that farmers should not use only one AI bull and that they should reduce their risk.  For example, if a farmer had ten cows he could use five bulls and mate two cows per bull to insure against one or more of them proving to be a gliogar.  I am not sure whether the witnesses know what a gliogar is - it is a term for a rotten egg in the Irish language.  Anyway, if a bull proved to be something other than what it was meant to be, then I would not have bought into it.<\/p><p> The Department seems to be concerned about the AI bull, but that would not be on my register as a farmer.  The progeny of the AI bull would be my problem.  Four or five years later I could find myself with a major pain in my head, having thought I had done everything correctly.  In fact, I could be left with progeny that do not match the specification of what I bought.  In that case I would face a severe penalty, if I understand the system correctly.  If a farmer was not knowledgeable beyond my understanding of genomics, he might not pay much heed to it.<\/p><p> I am actually in favour of genomics.  I like the concept and I believe in science.  I believe that over time, once we have enough data collected to start rating things on past performance and so on, we will have a useful tool.  However, I think we are rushing our fences in demanding that farmers have X or Y number of four-star or five-star animals in the coming years.  To my mind, that is how everything works according to the plan of the Department.  I accept the basic science, but I think there are many variables in it.  If I accept what Department officials are saying in terms of output, then obviously farmers are going to move toward the four-star or five-star bulls over time for good reason, since the economic return on the market is going to entice them, just as the economic return from the factories moved farmers towards the confirmation of the animal in the factory or whatever the factories wanted.  When this data becomes available, it will move people.  However, the problem is not that people will not want to move.  The problem is the unintended consequences, since the data they are being given at the moment may be unreliable.  This particularly relates to people who use AI bulls or people using what are now rated as five-star stock bulls but which may subsequently turn out to be one-star bulls.  The original bull is only one animal, but the fact that his progeny might not have the traits he was meant to deliver as a five-star bull could have major consequences for the herd.<\/p><p>Does the system include some type of in-built guarantee for farmers who act in good faith, based on the information given to them, and subsequently find that this information was less than optimum and a reclassification was required, specifically in respect of the bull - the paternal side is likely to produce a large number of progeny - where it fails to live up to its record and produces a large number of sub-optimal cattle?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015111700002#S00300","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>On the conditions, the help-sheet provided states that if a holding decreases by more than 20%, in other words, if the number of animals falls by more than one fifth, the farmer would be disqualified under the amount set out in 2014.

While it would be optimal to receive information from the Italian factories, it is not necessary to make a good prediction.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice asked the reason twins could have different Euro-star ratings given that they have the same father and mother.  This issue arose at a few of the meetings we held.  To take one example, there should be no difference between young twin calves.<\/p><p>In one example I looked at, the sire had been recorded on one of the calves but not on the other.  Immediately there was a clear reason they would be different.  I was asked about animals with the same sire and dam and why their Euro-Star ratings would vary.  As we get data on the animals themselves, it is only natural that they start to separate.  Full brothers or sisters will perform differently depending on the data that are recorded.  That includes the weights of the calves they are weaning, calving intervals and how long they stay in herds.  Those will have different influences on the star ratings.  Just because they are from the same sire and dam, as they gather more data of their own, they will start to differ in terms of their star ratings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015111700002#U00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Coughlan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1447768800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I will pick up on the 40% accuracy question and genotyping and genomics.  I note to Deputy Fitzmaurice that the accuracy of genotyping is 100%.  That is the first point.  When we think about accuracy, how accurate is the process of taking the DNA and establishing a genotype?  That is 100% accurate.  The next question, which is in essence the one Deputy FItzmaurice is asking, is how confident we are in converting that genotype data into a star evaluation.  This is where one has that figure of 40%.  In effect, that is the reliability, which is what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v also adverted to, of the Euro-Star evaluation.  In many ways, these questions are at the nub of one of the issues.  We are dealing here with Euro-Star evaluations which by their nature are based on data and more data.  As a consequence, the evaluations will change over time.  As my colleague, Mr. Coughlan, has indicated, we are absolutely confident at a high level when one looks at it based on lots of data that these four and five-star animals will lead to more profitability for farmers.  People are generally acknowledging that right across the board, but that does not get away from the issue that at the individual animal level, some will go up and some will go down.  In the case of an AI bull or a stock bull, that can, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v indicated, have a profound impact, particularly when it relates to potential progeny.  That is why education and training is such a core part of the beef data and genomics programme.  It is covered as a cost associated with the scheme and is going to start in February.<\/p> <p>  There are approximately 27,500 herds in the scheme.  We have done the initial analysis of how many four and five-star cows there are and farmers have received the reports.  While they are generally happy, there are some herd owners who are in a more challenging place.  This is where we need to have a discussion with them regarding their replacement strategy to ensure they meet the 2018 and 2020 requirements.  In those circumstances, their options will include the use of artificial insemination.  At the information meetings, we saw that while 20% of the progeny from the suckler herd or the cows in the scheme were from AI, almost 60% of herd owners in the scheme were using some level of AI.  That is a very interesting and relevant statistic.  It tells us that guys are engaged with using AI but we need to get them to use it more.<\/p> <p>  The next advice we must give those individuals who are going to use AI is that it is not one AI bull.  I take Deputy Fitzmaurice's point about what would happen where a bull dropped.  If they use a very reliable AI bull, the likelihood of that bull dropping is very small.<\/p><p>The accuracy figure alluded to by Deputy Fitzmaurice is like a confidence interval.  How confident are we that this index is going to change?  Certainly for an AI bull with 90% reliability, we would be very confident that the index will not change.  However, for a young AI bull who is down at 40% or 45% reliability, the same as a stock bull, the index could change.  The advice to herd owners in that regard is they need to use a team of AI bulls.  They will need three or four AI bulls.  Generally if one looks at the herds that are involved, in Gene Ireland or the various AI-based initiatives, they would use three or four different beef bulls across different breeds.  Using a team of bulls has worked very effectively in the context of the dairy herd.  The benefit is that one mitigates against the risk of any one individual falling.  One could go up, one could go down but the average of the group stays the same.  Using four young AI bulls is the equivalent of using a very well-proven stock bull.  That is work that Teagasc would have done in the context of strategies that herd owners can use to try to offset the risk around reliability or the potential fall in reliability.  We are always talking about the bull that goes down, but for every bull that goes down, there is another bull that goes up.<\/p><p> The issue of drops in proof will only affect a proportion of herd owners.  The advice is that if they are using AI bulls, they should use a team.  The other piece of advice from Teagasc and the AI companies and which is a core part of the education and replacement exercise is that if they want to guard against this issue and if the cut-off is &euro;74 - the four and five-star cut-off on the replacement index is &euro;74 - then, on average, the progeny on a &euro;74 cow will be &euro;74 and they will be fine.  However, that is not good advice if they want to cover off some risk.  In that case, they should go higher than that because the bull could potentially fall.  The advice is that if herd owners are going to buy a stock bull, they should look at one at &euro;120 to &euro;150 in terms of the replacement index to give them some ability to offset this potential risk.<\/p><p> We have spoken about the information meetings and Pearse Kelly and Aidan Murray from Teagasc would have presented much of this material at those meetings.  More than 5,000 farmers attended 12 information meetings and they understand this.  They understand that this issue is a part of the Euro-Star indexes.  At an individual level, this is how one guards against a problem with an individual animal.  The key point is that it applies across many animals, whether they are buying in heifers, breeding on their cows or using AI.  Over the course of the six years of the scheme, these issues dissipate.  They also dissipate across the 27,500 herds in the scheme.  That is why, at the high level, from the point of view of the ICBF, Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we are confident that the genomic base and the science behind it will take us to where we need to be at the end of this scheme, which is delivering &euro;150 per cow in terms of additional profitability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015111700002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Andrew Cromie","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>There are a few questions which have yet to be answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015111700002#W00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1447768800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Deputy Connaughton asked about the position between the Department and ourselves <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the star ratings and whether there was any mismatch, but I can assure the Deputy that there is no mismatch.

An increasing number of farmers are starting to weigh their calves themselves, which is a positive development even if it is not a requirement of the scheme.  As farmers see the value in that data, we expect that an increasing number of them will look to weigh their own animals in appreciation of the use of this valuable data in getting more accurate milk evaluations - maternal evaluations - for their cows.

They will receive training some time in future.<\/p> <p>  I once asked a number of Deputies how many of them had read the Oireachtas safety statement which new Members receive when they enter the House.  I hope Deputy Fitzmaurice, who is relatively new to the House, received a copy.  We are all responsible legislators and the Oireachtas produced the legislation providing for mandatory safety statements in the workplace.  If the Deputies to whom I spoke were in any way a representative sample, the number of colleagues who have read the safety statement is incredibly small, particularly when one takes into account the highly responsible job we have and the fact that we introduced legislation providing for safety statements in the belief that they are a great idea.  I make this point because Departments and official bodies present farmers with 50-page printed documents setting out terms and conditions and so forth.  When a farmer does not follow the conditions, as laid down, the officials will say \"Tough luck\" and the farmer will lose X amount of money for not reading the document.  It is a case of good luck, goodbye and goodnight.  If we applied the same approach to Oireachtas Members with regard to safety statements, none of us would get paid.<\/p><p>For this reason, we must accept that if we are relying on the fine print that is conveyed in written documents, we can forget it.  Even if information is being conveyed at meetings that farmers are obliged to attend as a condition of the scheme, those present may not fully concentrate on the proceedings.  I do not know how many times Deputies have made a public statement on radio and people have come back to us having got the message arseways.  That is a common phenomenon, which is the reason I do not like the penalty regime. <br\/><br\/>It has been correctly pointed out that if one uses artificial insemination multiple times, the law of averages dictates that the farmer should pass the test within five or six years.  If one calculated, on an actuarial basis, the chances of the <i>Titanic <\/i>sinking in the middle of the Atlantic killing such a large number of people, the large number of things that would have to go wrong would indicate that the chances of the vessel sinking would be minuscule.  One hears the various statistical scenarios about the <i>Titanic<\/i>having to turn left or right or having to be five minutes early or late.  Nonetheless, the <i>Titanic <\/i>sank, which demonstrates that the most unlikely events occur, even though statistically they are very unlikely.  <br\/><br\/>To return to the artificial insemination bull, will it be mandatory on AI providers to set out in large red or black print the reliability of the data on which the rating of their bull is based at that point in time?  I understand there will be bulls in the catalogues which may have a reliability rating of less than 40%.  One would be careful about putting &euro;1,000 on a bet in Paddy Power with those odds, not to speak of &euro;10,000.  This process involves considerable sums of money, both in terms of the value of the progeny on the market and the lost grants.  <br\/><br\/>If I understand the position correctly, the ICMF's problem is that the scheme is new in that genotyping and data collection are new and the longer and more consistently the ICMF receives the data, the more the actuarial level will increase.  After five or six years, it will plateau at a high level of accuracy but at the beginning, the reliability of the bulls is lower because the ICMF does not have much data on them or their progeny.  In that case, would it not have been better to have removed the penalties from the game on the basis that the market will look after people doing the right thing?  Would it not be preferable not to introduce penalties until the scheme has been operating for a long period, farmers have acclimatised to it and much more reliable data are available?  Once the data are available, the penalties could be introduced over time, perhaps in the next round of the scheme.  At that stage, I assume penalties would not be necessary because most farmers would be doing the right thing as the market will determine that it would be sensible to do so.  <br\/><br\/>It is a statistical fact that 48% of herds have fewer than ten cows.  I was surprised to learn from the data supplied by the Department that approximately 45% of herds in counties Carlow and Kilkenny have fewer than ten suckler cows.  It is not the case, therefore, that the smaller herds are all located on the west coast as there are many smaller herds on the east coast.  While there are fewer herds in the east than in the west, the variation in herd size is not dramatically different between the regions.  In other words, a high proportion of herds in the east are small in number, notwithstanding what many east coast farmers may believe.<\/p><p>There are some very large herds in the west.  If a suckler farmer is using artificial insemination, how many bulls, or AI bulls, are recommended if he has eight cows?  If he gets it wrong, he is in trouble five years down the road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015111700002#Z01300","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":84,"content":"<p>To follow on from my point that the progeny of a five-star bull and five-star heifer should be five stars, which point was raised by Deputy Fitzmaurice and the Chairman, the delegates stated during our previous meeting with them that if one bought a five-star bull, it would retain its five-star rating.

That is the picture today but one must ask how many of those older cows will actually be in the herds in 2017, 2018 and later.

Approximately two and a half hours of that will be devoted to the Euro-stars and replacement strategy in particular.

I note in particular the issues raised at a recent session of this committee, on 8 October, which heard from members of the Organic Farmers Representative Body, and I hope that in the course of our discussion here today we can clarify many of these issues for the committee members.  At the outset, it should probably be said that the Organic Farmers Representative Body is not an umbrella organisation representing all or even most organic farmers.  It represents a number of small livestock farmers and does so most effectively and efficiently.  The usual forum for discussion between the Department and the organic farming sector is the Organic Focus Group, which meets quarterly under an independent chair and which is representative of the entire sector.  The Organic Farmers Representative Body attends these meetings and the Department has also met independently with the body on several occasions to hear its views and to respond to its various proposals.<\/p> <p>  Having studied the transcripts of the discussion at this committee on 8 October, I found that four main issues were raised: the framework of support established under the new organic farming scheme which was introduced as part of the RDP; the question of double-funding under GLAS and the new organic scheme; the problem of delays in making payments to organic farmers; and the cost of membership and inspections applied by the organic control bodies.<\/p> <p>  The new organic farming scheme was introduced following a wide round of consultation which extended over almost two years as part of the process of drafting the new rural development programme.  It also takes account of a detailed value-for-money review which was completed last year and which quite deliberately  links across to both GLAS and to the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, in creating a comprehensive framework of supports for the sector.<\/p> <p>  The new organic farming scheme was launched in April 2015 with a budget of &euro;56 million over the lifetime of the RDP.   It provides for significantly increased rates of payment to all organic farmers, irrespective of sector.  For example, the standard rate payment, which applies to most farmers including livestock farmers, was &euro;106 per hectare under the old scheme, but under the new scheme this has been increased to &euro;170 per hectare, which is a 60% increase.  In addition, the area on which full payment can be made has been increased from 55 hectares to 60 hectares.  The new scheme also specifically targets tillage farmers for the first time, as this is an area that was identified as being in deficit and is of key importance both in its own right and as a source of home-grown organic feed for the livestock sector.  For the same reason, the new scheme also encourages the cultivation of red clover as a high-protein dry-matter fodder crop for the purpose of building supplies of organic feedstuffs.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is very pleased that the new scheme has been hugely successful since its launch, attracting 870 applications in its first tranche.  To put this in context, the highest number of applications ever received previously was 380 applications in 2010.  In addition, over 500 of the 870 applicants are new entrants to organic farming.  The highest number of new entrants to organic farming heretofore was 158, in 2009.  By any standards the new scheme is a major success, and we have already met most if not all of our targets for the entire RDP period in this first intake of applications.<\/p> <p>  There are also 720 existing participants from the previous organic farming scheme, which means that when all applications into the new scheme have been processed and approved, we should have some 1,600 organic farmers in the system.  This is a major step forward.  Together, these farmers manage about 60,000 hectares of land, and because of the structures we are putting in place, we hope to secure this land under organic contract for at least the next five years.  For the first time, this allows us to plan ahead with confidence in terms of an organic food market.<\/p> <p>  Participants under the new organic farming scheme receive significantly higher payment rates than under the previous scheme.  Following extensive negotiations with the European Commission, it has been agreed that the benefit of these higher payment rates can be extended to current scheme participants who are under the previous organic farming scheme.  This ensures that all organic farmers in the country are now operating off the same footing.  Furthermore, the Commission has very recently agreed that we can extend the contracts of people operating under the old scheme so that all participants can now be confident of a secure system of supports right up to the end of the RDP period.<\/p><p> Part of the success of the new scheme is due to the synergies we have put in place with both GLAS and TAMS.  Under GLAS, an organic farmer receives guaranteed priority access to the scheme under tier 1.   Under TAMS II, a dedicated capital investment scheme has been put in place specifically for the benefit of organic farmers, providing support for the widest range of equipment and structures of any TAMS scheme.  The TAMS organic capital development scheme has a budget of  &euro;8 million over the lifetime of the RDP.  In addition, the Department has put in place a wholly Exchequer-funded scheme of financial assistance directed towards processors to facilitate the development of the organic sector, with a budget of &euro;1.2 million in 2015 and similar for succeeding years.  The package of measures available now for the organic sector exceeds anything which was in place previously.  More important, however, it demonstrates clear, joined-up thinking between the different strands of support that could be utilised.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the question of double funding between GLAS and the organic farming scheme.  I wish to clarify that all organic farmers can access the full range of GLAS measures and in many cases this presents a unique opportunity to top up their organic farming payment with up to &euro;5,000 or more a year under GLAS.  The only proviso is when similar actions are in place under both schemes - in such cases it is a clear stipulation of the European legislation that a risk of double-funding exists - that this must be explicitly addressed.  It is not possible to be paid twice for the same action, particularly when in most cases the basis will be compensation for income foregone which is already being paid under one or other action.  We are happy to discuss this with members and we will do our best to explain the issue as clearly as possible.<\/p><p> With regard to delays in making payments to organic farmers, this was indeed an issue last year due to an industrial dispute at local office level.  The impact on organic farmers is deeply regretted and we are doing everything to ensure that the first instalment of this year&rsquo;s payments will go out to all eligible farmers before Christmas.   Reference was made to charges levied by the various organic control bodies.  These are independent bodies which operate on the basis of commercial contracts with their farmer clients.  There are five separate organic control bodies operating in Ireland and it is open to any farmer to choose to which one he or she wants to sign up.  Members will appreciate that it is difficult to comment on the rates being charged in such circumstances.  Each of these bodies is approved by the Department to carry out the necessary controls and checks to ensure that Irish organic farmers are operating to at least the standards laid down across the EU.  In accordance with the governing EU regulations, specifically Article  27 of Council Regulation (EC) 834 of 2007, this certification process can be delegated to approved control bodies.  This is the approach we have taken in Ireland and which is common across many member states of the European Union.  The flexibility to delegate this work to anybody other than an approved control body is not provided for within the governing legislation.<\/p><p> The Department contributes directly towards the cost of inspections by these bodies to the tune of &euro;150 a visit, a contribution which we increased recently from a previous rate of &euro;121.  The organic control bodies play a critical role in ensuring that the standard of Irish organic farming and produce is respected and relied upon worldwide, which, in turn, is key to unlocking the extensive framework of supports we have put in place through the EU regulations.  It is also key to the development of a vibrant and growing organic market.  That is all I have to say at present but my colleagues and I are available to take whatever questions which members may wish to pose.  I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015111700002#FF00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Dillon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dillon for his very informative presentation.

The Department is looking at 1,600 altogether so that means there are 720 existing participants.  Can Mr. Dillon clarify how long it will be before the existing farmers who will enter the scheme this year are fully converted to organic production?  From what they are saying, I understand that many of the smaller farmers are not comfortable remaining in the scheme.  I have discussed the issue with Mr. Dillon and with Ms Furlong previously.<\/p><p>If many of them are lost to the scheme, is there a risk of a trough over the two-year period starting now until it goes fully organic in two years?  While the scheme has higher rates per hectare, double funding was possible under REPS at one time, something Mr. Dillon will address.  Under new EU rules that is not allowed at the moment.  Smaller farmers who farmed ten, 15 or 18 ha had problems.<\/p><p> As well as farmers, does the Department fund the independent groups on which the witnesses said they would not comment?  They are Department-approved, but there seem to be problems in terms of what they are charging.  Does the Department contribute towards them and, if so, how much does it give?<\/p><p> We know there are 760 farmers under the old scheme, with a manual payment system.  I understand the 870 new farmers coming into the scheme will be on a database or a new modified system whereby a button can be pressed and payments sent to them.

There is a lot of fear about the scheme. <\/p><p> The organic groups to which I have spoken raised issues with me.  This may not be the place to discuss them, but Senator O'Brien also spoke about the issue.  We discussed areas such as Connemara, the hills in Mayo, Wicklow, places where there are mountain lamb and areas which would not be fertilised.  Can we get clearance from the EU to classify such areas as organic?  One would not spread fertiliser on the top of a mountain.  Such a scheme would probably involve sheep rather than cattle.  Areas such as Donegal and Kerry could be included.  Many areas in Ireland are left to themselves, fertilisers are not being pumped into them and they are not being tampered with.  The issue arose during a previous meeting and it is worth discussing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015111700002#GG00300","speaker":"1198","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I thank the officials.

Let us remember it is 2015 and we talk about climate change every day.  Agriculture is the one area that adds to the problems of climate change.  Organic farming saves 60% of the CO2 that is produced by conventional farming.  I want to open a conversation in this country about what Austria is doing that we are not.  Some 14% to 16% of Austria's farmers are organic and it has become a centre for all things organic, even tourism.<\/p> <p>  I listened to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who is so articulate.  We are the green island and there are bodies such as Origin Green and Bord Bia, but a very small minority of farms are organic.  The group which came before us at a previous meeting is not powerful.

There are a number of small ones who are coming in and a number of large ones.  We do not anticipate that there will be a large fall-off in production.<\/p> <p>  I might ask some of my colleagues to answer some of the questions as we go through them.  On the issue of double funding with REPS, the big change was that under the new CAP when it was negotiated, the direct payments regulation and the rural development regulation were changed to state explicitly that one is not allowed to be funded twice for the same action.  This was previously identified by the European Commission as a risk to funds.  What one must look at is what income is being forgone by the farmer for a particular scheme and then ask if the same action is involved for two different schemes.  If that is deemed to be so, one cannot be paid under both schemes.  That was identified as a serious risk to funds and it was explicitly stated that double funding had to be avoided.  That is why payments in the organic scheme are made on the basis of income forgone and costs incurred.  For GLAS, payments are made on the basis of income forgone and costs incurred.  Low-input permanent pasture is an example that is often quoted.  The action involved - the income forgone by the farmer in GLAS - is almost identical to the income forgone by the organic farmer.  Therefore, one cannot pay organic payment and low-input permanent pasture payment on the same land.  That is the logic and one can understand it.  It was not an issue in REPS because the regulation was changed since REPS.  That is the point there.<\/p> <p>  I was asked whether the Department funds the organic control bodies.  We make a payment of &euro;150 per visit per annum.  For each member that is attributed to the particular control body, there is an entitlement to a refund from us of &euro;150 per annual visit.

It does not work like that.  The rules are specific and confined within the organic regulations so that one cannot break out of that.  To avail of this, one must be an organic farmer.  The answer is yes, there is provision to graze animals on commonage, but one must be an organic farmer to avail of that opportunity.  While the simple answer is yes, in terms of seeking a relaxation from the Commission as a general overall rule for Ireland, that will not happen.  Organics is a specific form of food production and within that there are measures and opportunities for farmers.  That includes one of them.

We are well aware of that.<\/p> <p>  On Senator O'Brien's points, should we examine further the Austrian model?  Is there something the Austrians are doing that we do not do?  A larger proportion of Austrian farmers are organic.  They have a smaller farm size and a small enough herd size.  They operate on the basis of eight certifying bodies, which are private sector controlled.  We have five and they have eight so there is a lot of competition there.  The Austrians have one representative group, which comprises almost two thirds of all their organic farmers.  That seems to be a difference; there seems to be strong representation.  Perhaps that is a factor.  Perhaps it is just the type of farming they do on the type of land they have, or the fact that they have alpine pastures that are covered in snow for much of the year.  Perhaps it is all those factors together.  However, we have examined and will continue to examine the Austrian model.<\/p> <p>  We are open to constructive suggestions.  If there are arrangements we need to change, we will consider them.  We believe the combination of GLAS, TAMS and the organic farming scheme, particularly considering the capital investment opportunities for organic farmers that are not available for other farmers and the ring-fenced processing money that is not available for other areas, should in itself stimulate interest.  If after the mid-term review of the rural development programme we find an insufficient uptake, we will need to determine what we need to change.

I am accompanied today by Mr. David Dalton, principal officer in the Department&rsquo;s community division, with specific responsibility for, <i>inter alia<\/i>, local government community services and the regulation of local authority burial grounds.<br\/><br\/>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has policy and legislative responsibility for the regulation of local authority burial grounds.  This responsibility covers a range of technical aspects related to the operation of burial grounds but does not extend to matters related to the funeral industry generally.  The main legislative provisions in respect of burial grounds are contained in the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878, as amended by Part 6 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1948, the Local Government Act 1994 and in the rules and regulations for the Regulation of Burial Grounds 1888 and the relevant amending regulations.<\/p><p>The legislation provides that local authorities are burial boards for their respective functional areas.  They have sole responsibility for providing, managing, regulating and controlling burial grounds in their areas.  In this respect, there has been gradual devolution of functions from central to local government over time, with almost all functions relating to burial grounds exercised locally by local authorities at this stage.<br\/><br\/>The underpinning legislation has been in place for some time, but it has served us well and continues to do so.  While there have been calls to review the legislation in recent times, it has remained unchanged as the changes proposed were outside the Department&rsquo;s policy and legislative remit.  I believe that this is also the case with the matter before the committee.<br\/><br\/>The Dublin Cemeteries Committee was established as a body corporate by the The Dublin Cemeteries Committee Act 1970 and is a registered charity for tax purposes.  It currently owns and operates a number of cemeteries in Dublin city and county and has incorporated a number of limited liability companies for the purposes of carrying on certain ancillary funeral related businesses.  A Supreme Court decision in 2009 reaffirmed the capacity of the committee in this regard.  Neither the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government nor Dublin City Council have any function in relation to, or any direct control over, the operation, management, regulation or otherwise of the Dublin cemetery committee or, for that matter, the business of any other private cemetery operator.<br\/><br\/>As outlined in the explanatory memorandum, the Bill has been introduced primarily for the purposes of regulating competition.  At its heart, therefore, the Bill seeks to address a market regulation and competition matter in the funeral industry and to level the playing field between private businesses.  The Department has no policy responsibility in this regard and the proposal to vest responsibility for such a regulator in the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, therefore, is not consistent, in our view, with the scope of the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the operation and management of burial grounds.<br\/><br\/>As stated, the primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of a cemeteries regulator.  First, there is no policy or other need for a cemeteries regulator in respect of local authority or ecclesiastical authority burial grounds which constitute the majority of burial grounds in the State.  Second, the introduction of a regulator for such a limited number of operators and at a time when Government is actively pursuing measures to reduce the number of State agencies and control the number of State employees would appear to run counter to Government policy to reduce the number of such authorities.  Third, a regulator would require a staffing structure and other necessary administrative supports, all giving rise to a potentially significant cost to the Exchequer.  Given the clear purpose of the proposed regulator to regulate competition between private businesses, it appears to duplicate the statutory remit of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  Indeed, the commission has responded to a complaint of anti-competitive practices by Dublin Cemeteries Committee and made recommendations in this regard.<br\/><br\/>I do not believe that the competition matters the Bill seeks to address come within the policy or legislative responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  For this reason, I have not dealt with the technical or legal issues and other matters of concern arising from the Bill.  However, I am happy to detail these briefly if it would be of assistance to the committee as part of the broader discussion on the Bill today.  Given the breadth of policy and technical issues arising from the matter we are here to discuss, I believe a wider consideration by other Departments of the proposals reflected in the Bill is also imperative.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee once again for its invitation to participate in this discussions.  I hope the foregoing will assist the committee in its deliberations and both my colleague, David Dalton, and I will be happy to deal with any queries that might arise in the course of subsequent discussions and which come within the remit of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015111700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Hurley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hurley and invite Ms Isolde Goggin to make her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015111700002#E00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1447768800,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee members for inviting us to appear before them.  We are very pleased to be here on the occasion of the Cemetery Management Bill 2013.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. John Shine, who is the director of our advocacy and market intelligence division, and Ms Haiyan Wang, who is the head of investigation in our competition enforcement division.<\/p> <p>  We are a relatively new organisation having been formed at the end of October 2014 from the amalgamation of what was then the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.<\/p><p>The mission of the commission is to make markets work better for consumers and businesses, and our vision is for open and competitive markets where consumers are protected and empowered and businesses actively compete.  We have brought together the competition and consumer protection roles of the two legacy organisations.<br\/><br\/>I will outline our past involvement in the sector and will move on to our view on the question of regulation.  Funeral-related services are a bit different from run-of-the-mill services that people buy.  A lot of the advice to consumers on our website, <i>www.ccpc.ie<\/i>, is to shop around, but one cannot say that to somebody in a situation of bereavement, as they are very sensitive purchases that consumers have to make in very difficult and stressful circumstances.  They may be particularly vulnerable and be unsure of what they need to do.  They may be very dependent on the service provider, which is normally a funeral director or a provider of cemetery services, to guide them through the process.  As such, it is very important to have transparency and compliance with competition and consumer law in the sector.<br\/><br\/>From an enforcement point of view, the commission conducted a detailed investigation, over a number of years, into alleged anti-competitive practices by Glasnevin Trust.  This was concluded to our satisfaction in March 2015 with the agreement of Glasnevin Trust to a number of remedial measures.  Details of the case are available on the website, but I will summarise the main aspects.  The case arose from a complaint received in November 2011 in which it was alleged that Glasnevin Trust and its subsidiary, Glasnevin Cemetery Monument Works Limited, GCMW, were engaged in anti-competitive practices which were designed to put competing headstone providers, in particular, at a competitive disadvantage.  It was alleged that this amounted to an abuse of dominance by the trust, contrary to the Competition Act.  We carried out a detailed preliminary assessment and, subsequently, a formal investigation.  We engaged with Glasnevin Trust and sought and secured a number of remedial measures from them.  The measures related to the provision of burial plots, headstones and headstone foundations and were designed to mitigate the alleged anti-competitive practices, ensure the protection of consumers and increase transparency.<br\/><br\/>The measures included the requirement that Glasnevin Trust make its prices more transparent to consumers, making it easier for consumers to find a price list for burial plots and foundation fees on its website and in its offices.  In addition, given that many funeral directors were acting on behalf of the bereaved families, Glasnevin Trust was required to take measures to ensure that funeral directors informed consumers of the separate cost of the foundation fee, because the degree of transparency around the foundation fee had been an issue.  Before applying for burial services in Dublin City Council cemeteries, funeral directors were required to confirm to the council that they had informed consumers of the foundation cost.  Third, Glasnevin Trust was to treat competing headstone providers in an equal and non-discriminatory manner in terms of waiting times for permits and foundations and access to the cemetery.  Finally, the trust was to allow competing headstone providers to advertise in their promotional brochures subject to payment of the same fees as would be paid by GCMW, its own subsidiary, for the same advertising.  Based on these measures, we were satisfied to conclude the investigation in early 2015 without any further action being required.  The commission also corresponded with the Irish Monumental Firms Association, setting out our position on the issues that had been raised.  <br\/><br\/>Mindful of the potential vulnerability of consumers at a particularly stressful time, we also provide information to consumers in a dedicated area of our website called &quot;Planning a Funeral&quot; and we have recently added material relating to succession planning.  We operate a helpline for consumers which deals with over 50,000 contacts per annum, from very general inquiries to specific complaints alleging breaches of consumer law.  On average we get some ten contacts per annum on funeral-related issues.  There is no pattern in this respect and the issues raised seem to be one-off issues.  We have not received anything to suggest there are substantive issues relating to breaches of consumer law.<br\/><br\/>That is the history of our involvement in the sector from the point of view of competition and the consumer.  Our remit covers the entire economy, so if there are competition or consumer issues we are already there to deal with them.  On the necessity for regulation, the purpose of the Bill is to establish a cemeteries regulator to provide for the licensing of cemetery authorities and to specify management stipulations for such authorities, to promote competition and to provide for related matters.  Competition law and consumer welfare are already within our remit.<\/p><p>We have no information that would indicate there are substantive issues that merit the creation of a new regulatory authority.  That is not to say that issues causing detriment to consumers might not exist.  Rather, that we do not believe a sufficiently strong case has been made to justify the proposal for a specific regulator.  As a general principle, we believe regulation should be adopted only as a last resort where there are very serious shortcomings in the sector and in circumstances where existing measures have proven incapable of addressing such issues.  Regulation can go too far.  It can impose restrictions on entry to a market that can actually damage competition, leading to cost increases, inefficiencies, lower service quality and general detriment to consumers.  Regulation must be paid for.  My colleague from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government mentioned that it might cost the Exchequer.  In my experience, however, a regulator for a very specific sector is usually paid for by a levy on industry or on businesses in the sector.  That leads to increased costs and these may outweigh the benefits.  We recommend that any proposal to introduce new regulatory structures should be progressed only after very careful consideration of the necessity for and implications of such an initiative.<\/p><p> I will now turn to a couple of specific concerns that strike us in regard to the current proposals.  We understand the key concerns informing the Bill relate to alleged anti-competitive practices in the cemetery industry and, in particular, Glasnevin Trust's engagement in ancillary commercial activities, namely, commercial activities in which there are also other firms engaged.  There is a danger of duplication of existing statutory functions.  We are the statutory authority with responsibility for enforcing competition law and consumer law in the State.  We very much urge anybody who has any concerns about potential breaches of either competition or consumer law to bring them to our attention.  We have the power to investigate and we have done so in the past.  The Bill envisages a role for the proposed regulator that would duplicate some of the statutory functions.<\/p><p> Parties have a right of private action before the courts.  As a result, it is not always necessary for a regulator to act on behalf of aggrieved parties.  Parties can take action themselves, certainly in regard to competition law and some aspects of consumer law.<\/p><p> On effectiveness and proportionality, an issue arises regarding the coverage of the proposed Bill.  It defines a cemetery authority as being any company, committee or body - other than a local authority, a town or borough council or an ecclesiastical authority - that is engaged, pursuant to statute or otherwise, in the management, operation or occupation of a cemetery.  Our understanding is that Dublin is a specific case.  Many of the cemeteries outside the Dublin area are either local authority owned or ecclesiastically owned and consequently would not be covered by the Bill.  Within the Dublin area, it seems the impact would mainly be on Glasnevin Trust.<\/p><p> The Bill proposes to restrict the regulated entities with charitable status from engaging in ancillary commercial services at cemeteries.  Again, Glasnevin Trust appears to be the only cemetery operation with charitable status in the Dublin area.  Engagement by charitable organisations in commercial activities is not, in itself, anti-competitive.  We must bear in mind that operating a cemetery is, by its nature, a very long-term business.  In some cases, the trusts or organisations involved are required to maintain the cemetery in perpetuity.  Therefore, it does not seem unreasonable for the operator to try to find some kind of ancillary commercial activities to fund the maintenance of cemetery grounds that perhaps no longer generate sufficient income from burial plots, particularly the older ones.  The funding requirement is likely to be higher for cemeteries of an historic nature and they generally require more maintenance.  They are not so easily maintained as the modern ones.<\/p><p> As I mentioned when talking about the four measures that had been agreed with Glasnevin Trust in order to promote competition and protect consumers, those concerned have undertaken to treat competing headstone providers in an equal and non-discriminatory fashion.  We would be very happy to engage with any of the other cemetery operators if similar issues arise elsewhere and explain to them how they can meet similar requirements.<\/p><p> Regulation should not be an end in itself.  In considering any proposals for additional regulation, any perceived failings in the sector should be clearly identified.  It should be clearly demonstrated that such issues cannot be adequately addressed within the existing legislative environment before we contemplate additional regulation.  Any such regulation will come at a cost.  No matter how it is constructed, it is likely in the end to be borne by the consumer.<\/p><p>We think that any proposal for further regulation would merit careful consideration and the conduct of a regulatory impact assessment.<\/p><p> In regard to the cemetery sector, we are of the view that the case for further regulation has not been sufficiently articulated and that further examination would be required before proceeding any further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015111700002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Isolde Goggin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I thank Ms. Goggin.

Cemeteries, by their nature, are anti-competitive.  Everybody goes to his or her local cemetery.  If it becomes ridiculously expensive, the market does not correct itself.  That is why we need a regulator.  Planners will not give permission to open a new cemetery in a locality where an existing one is still viable.  Therefore, the business of operating a cemetery is outside the normal checks and balances of a competitive environment.<br\/><br\/>We are a group of ten headstone businesses based all over Dublin.  We are struggling to survive in business, most of us having had our turnovers decimated.  The Dublin Cemeteries Committee, DCC, trading as Glasnevin Trust, is the main reason we are on the verge of collapse.  The DCC is a private statutory body and a charity controlling four of the largest cemeteries in Dublin, namely, Glasnevin, Palmerstown, Newlands Cross and Dardistown at Dublin Airport.  It does not pay corporation tax; we do.  It does not pay rates on its showrooms and factories; we do.  The DCC uses burial data to send brochures to relatives of the deceased.  We do not have access to that information.  It has huge displays inside its cemeteries and its registrars double up as salespeople, pitting them against us on a daily basis.  Until recently, it received 12.5% commission when selling a grave or a headstone.  Some of the staff can have wages of &euro;2,000 a week.  It insists on doing foundations for our headstones, charging us &euro;1,000 in Glasnevin.  We have offered to pour these foundations for &euro;80.  It charges us &euro;500 to spend a day working in its cemeteries.  We have to pass these outrageous fees on to the bereaved of Dublin.  It insists on doing all work on stone cremation walls.  We are not allowed work on any cremation plots, even though this is the only growing part of our business.  It has begun to sell pre-erected blank headstones on graves.  This totally excludes us from the market.  No other cemetery operator anywhere allows this.  So far seven monumental firms within close proximity to Glasnevin have closed.  Just last year, Farrell's of Glasnevin, which had been in business for 126 years, had to shut down.<br\/><br\/>We are not allowed meet potential customers in the DCC's cemeteries.  We are not allowed take photographs of our completed work.  The DCC has, over the years and for spurious reasons, barred seven Dublin monumental firms for operating in its cemeteries.  These firms have never been in any dispute nor ever even queried by any other cemetery owners.  Kerry County Council operates more than 130 cemeteries and Fingal County Council operates more than 30 and none of them has ever had any reason to ban firms or men from going about their business.  The evidence strongly suggests that when a body is both regulator and competitor, it cannot be trusted to be fair and impartial.<br\/><br\/>There are many more examples of abuse of Dublin sculptors, far too many to mention.  The firm I represent has seen its turnover drop from &euro;1.3 million to &euro;350,000.  It could be said that, through loss of earnings, Dublin sculptors have contributed more to Glasnevin than anybody else.  Glasnevin Trust has taken our trade, aided and abetted by the State.  The Oireachtas has given the DCC a far better deal than Apple or Google has received.<br\/><br\/>Some 115 years ago, Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th US President, said:<\/p><blockquote>Artificial bodies ... depending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges, should be subject to proper governmental supervision ... in the interests of the whole people, the Nation should ... assume power of supervision and regulation over ... [such bodies].  This is especially true where the corporation derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some monopolistic element or tendency in its business.<\/blockquote> <p>Over the years we have written to the DCC.  We have suggested arbitration and we even suggested a yearly voluntary contribution by us if it were to stop selling monuments.  The last correspondence we sent to it was nearly two years ago.  It answered us with a solicitor's letter, sent to our individual homes and business addresses, not our association's office, threatening to sue us personally if we continue to protest about it.<\/p><p>As we said in our opening statement, the Dublin Cemeteries Committee now owns and controls five cemeteries and when it doubles in size again, we will no longer exist.  It is now by far the largest provider of burials and cremations in Ireland and its monumental firm is also the largest in Ireland.  It now sells headstones tax and rates-free all over Dublin and beyond, not just in its own cemeteries but in cemeteries from Balbriggan to Bray.  It has now branched into boulders for housing estates and nameplates for houses, all tax-free.<\/p><p> We ask the Oireachtas to pass the Cemetery Management Bill as it is the correct action to take.  New South Wales in Australia and New Zealand have recently introduced new cemetery regulators.  In the D&aacute;il debate, some Deputies hoped this would not be another quango, but the DCC is the oldest quango in Ireland.  It is a body of perpetual succession, with no role for a Minister.  Is it a case of swapping an unaccountable quango for an accountable one?  In The Dublin Cemeteries Committee Act 1970, the Oireachtas entered into a bargain with the owners of Glasnevin Cemetery, conferring powers on it but with no safeguards for anybody whose private interests could be destroyed by it.  To compound the problem, the Oireachtas allowed it to become our competitor with a tax exemption and regulator not answerable to any power in the land.<\/p><p> Heretofore, when the State interfered in a trade or business, the affected parties received some sort of compensation.  For example, those involved with farming, fishing and turf-cutting and even taxi drivers received tax concessions after deregulation.  Make no mistake, Members of the Oireachtas have interfered in our trade and they must make it right.  We are not looking for compensation and we just want fair play and the opportunity for firms to survive.  We sculptors are not out of step but the Oireachtas is, as no other country in the world allows a charity to sell headstones.  An expert on competition and consumer affairs stated that charities must raise money.  Glasnevin Cemetery is a member of what are called the historical cemeteries of Europe, and that group comprises 150 cemeteries.  The other 149 cemeteries do not sell headstones as their staff see it is unethical and immoral.  They do not interfere in the trade.<\/p><p> I had much more to say but I will change my plan.  In August 1988, at the age of 24, I set up a headstone business in Swords, County Dublin.  Business went very well and over time my turnover reached &euro;1.3 million, with ten employees.  I erected headstones in cemeteries in north County Dublin and north Dublin city.  The Dublin Cemeteries Committee opened a large cemetery in Dardistown, just beside Swords.  At the time, I considered this to be a good opportunity but two years after opening the cemetery, the DCC erected just inside the main entrance a large display of new monuments for sale to the bereaved.  It erected signs suggesting that when the monuments are purchased from it, the graveyard would be better maintained than if they were purchased from me or my colleagues.  My first exposure to the power of the DCC was when I met a family in the cemetery who wanted to see some of my recently erected monuments.  I received a phone call the next day to say that if I ever met a family in the cemetery again, I would be barred from all the DCC cemeteries.<\/p><p> Most of the members of this Oireachtas committee would be familiar with their local sculptors and cemetery.  Imagine if the sculptor were not allowed to discuss a headstone with a client or family in a local cemetery.  That would not happen anywhere else in Ireland and it is why Glasnevin Trust, as it now calls itself, cannot be both regulator and competitor.  A few weeks later I was taking some photographs of my recently erected monuments and the following day I received a phone call indicating that no photography was allowed in the cemetery.  This was all the more galling as Glasnevin Trust has pictures of my work all over its offices.  Sculptors all over Ireland inscribe trade names and phone numbers in small letters on the side or base of newly erected work, as this is historically the best way of selling monuments.  I was told not to put my phone number on monuments or I would be barred.  Again, this does not happen anywhere else and it is why Glasnevin Trust cannot be both regulator and competitor.<\/p><p> It has been suggested that we have room to go to the courts.  Glasnevin had a so-called Irish stone rule and although I will not bore members with the details, it dropped the rule when I took the matter to court.  I was left paying &euro;16,000 as a new business.  The legislation is the 1970 Act and there are no internal or external safeguards for us.  The Competition Authority has told us it cannot help us and the issue is one of state aid rather than competition.  The Revenue Commissioners will not talk to us about this because of client confidentiality.<\/p><p>We do not want to know anything about the tax affairs of Glasnevin; we are just saying a charity should not sell monuments.  With regard to charities trading, Glasnevin does not have to sell headstones.  There are many other monumental sculptors.  It can raise money other ways.  How come 149 other members of the historical cemeteries of Europe think it is unethical to sell monuments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015111700002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Pierce","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1447768800,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I express my condolences to the Chairman on his recent loss.<\/p> <p>  I am chairman of Glasnevin Trust.  Glasnevin Trust is the business name of the Dublin Cemeteries Committee, established under the Dublin Cemeteries Committee Act 1970, which followed on from the earlier 1846 Act.  Glasnevin Trust manages the operations of the cemeteries in Goldenbridge, Glasnevin, Palmerstown, Dardistown and Newlands Cross.  It operates solely by reference to the public interest in the provision of burial grounds and cremation facilities, as well as the maintenance of Ireland&rsquo;s historic national cemeteries at Glasnevin and Goldenbridge.  Glasnevin Trust is run by an executive management team and the Dublin Cemeteries Committee.  I am joined today by Mr. George McCullough, the CEO of the trust.<\/p> <p>  Glasnevin Trust manages the burial and cremation, now running at a 50:50 ratio, of approximately 4,000 people annually.  This accounts for less than 30% of the burials in Dublin and the immediate surrounding counties.  The remainder of burials in the Dublin area are carried out in cemeteries owned, operated and subvented by local authorities or in a few privately run cemeteries.<\/p> <p>  Glasnevin Trust also maintains and preserves the considerable heritage assets in Glasnevin Cemetery, which has become the focal point for many of the commemorative events for the decade of centenaries.  More recently, Glasnevin Trust opened the multi-award-winning Glasnevin Cemetery Museum as a major educational and tourism centre.  The museum attracts more than 100,000 visitors annually and is a significant boost to tourism and the economy on the north side of Dublin.  At our initiative, DNA Dublin's Northside Attractions has been developed and was launched at the world travel market two weeks ago by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.<\/p> <p>  Glasnevin Trust employs more than 100 people in Dublin.  Companies owned by the trust also offer florist and monument works services to the bereaved, competing in a market where more than 50 registered monumental sculptor companies and hundreds of flower sellers operate.  Glasnevin Trust, in the absence of any other significant development of local authority cemeteries in the Dublin region over the past 30 years, has developed three cemeteries.  These are Palmerstown Cemetery in 1978, Dardistown Cemetery in 1990 and Newlands Cross Cemetery in 2000.  Simultaneously, it introduced and developed cremation in the Dublin area, establishing the first crematorium, Glasnevin Crematorium Limited, in 1982 and Newlands Cross Crematorium Limited in 2001.  Dardistown crematorium is scheduled to open in 2016.<\/p> <p>  Glasnevin Trust is a statutory and voluntary not-for-profit body, originally established by Daniel O&rsquo;Connell in 1828.  In recent times, Glasnevin Trust, with the invaluable assistance of the Government and the OPW, has overseen the restoration of Glasnevin Cemetery from a dilapidated state to the sanctuary of peace, dignity and reconciliation it is today  The trust&rsquo;s role remains as it was handed down from Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, to bury people of all religions and none, and to ensure that we bury and cremate the dead with dignity and respect.  We believe the ultimate dignity for the deceased is paramount and burial grounds need to be maintained and funded on a sustainable basis.  Many burial grounds operated by local authorities can only survive with significant direct financial subvention from the local authority budgets, which in the past year in Dublin and its hinterland amounted to approximately &euro;2.5 million, and throughout the country amounted to some &euro;10.8 million.  I have with me the breakdown of these figures.<\/p> <p>  In addition to providing burial services, Glasnevin Trust has been working closely with the State in playing its part in the decade of remembrance.  Glasnevin Trust, true to its mission of serving people from all creeds, beliefs and walks of life, has been central to a number of State commemorative ceremonies.  These have ranged from the commemoration of Irish men and women who lost their lives in the First World War, to Collins and Griffith and, just this summer, the State remembrance of the centenary of the burial of Jeremiah O&rsquo;Donovan Rossa as the opening centrepiece for the 1916 commemorations.  In addition to this is the 100th anniversary of Cumann Na mBan, and a multiplicity of commemorations of national importance are held, on a regular basis, at Glasnevin Cemetery.<\/p> <p>  This work will continue right through the 1916 centenary commemorations, with a number of major projects scheduled, among them being the necrology wall for 1916-1923.<\/p><p>This will remember, in a totally non-judgmental manner, all who lost their lives during the struggle for independence in the period 1916-1923.  In addition, Glasnevin Cemetery will be the site for the opening of the governmental commemorations on Easter Sunday morning 2016.  I give this by way of background and explanation as to the role of Glasnevin Trust in the life and history of Dublin and its people since its foundation in 1828.  <\/p><p> I will turn specifically to the purpose of this meeting, that is, to elicit views on the policy issues arising from the Cemeteries Management Bill 2013 and related matters.  I understand that this is a Private Members' Bill advanced by Deputy Maloney.  There are a number of important regulatory issues concerning burials and cremations which have not been addressed in this Bill.  For example, Glasnevin Trust has identified the need for a new regulatory structure for cremations in Ireland.  At the current time, this area is totally unregulated despite its increasing demand.  In Dublin last year, 50% of deceased people were cremated.  We have previously engaged with the Government, from Deputy to ministerial level, for cemetery regulation and proper cremation regulation, and we believe this is an area being progressed by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p><p> This Bill, as set out, has a very narrow focus and does not address the broad issue impacting on burial grounds and cremation services.  It concentrates solely on a small number of burial grounds, including private burial grounds, private family burial grounds, burial grounds run by a charitable trust, Glasnevin Trust and Jewish burial grounds.  Glasnevin Trust, together with Mount Jerome, Mount Venus, Kilmashogue, Dolphin&rsquo;s Barn, Ballybough and Woodtown, would be covered by the Bill, but all others would be expressly excluded.  The Bill proposes to exclude from regulation local authority, ecclesiastical and religious orders&rsquo; cemeteries.   Thus the Bill, as a matter of fact, proposes to regulate fewer than 10% of the burials in the State and a tiny percentage of all burial grounds. <\/p><p> The policy basis for such a narrow focus has not been made clear.  During the D&aacute;il debate on the Bill, certain comments were made about Glasnevin Trust.  It it is important that I address them as many are based on a very distorted and selective view of our operations.  At the heart of these complaints is a protracted challenge that the trust has faced from an individual monumental sculptor, supported by a minority of those in the monumental industry, who contends that the manner in which Glasnevin Trust regulates the cemeteries we operate is illegal.  It has variously claimed that Glasnevin Trust has breached Irish and EU competition law and that the trust was generally operating outside the law.  It has brought its case to the European Commission, the Irish Competition Authority, the High Court and the Supreme Court, which have all ruled in our favour.  Laterally, following a further complaint to the Competition Authority in 2011, now the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the commission stated that it had a number of concerns and made four recommendations to Glasnevin Trust, all of which have been fully complied with.  <\/p><p> In conclusion, I reiterate the absolute commitment of Glasnevin Trust to continue to bury and cremate people, of all denominations and none, with dignity.  We will ensure that all of the burial grounds in our care are maintained to the highest standards, so that the families of the bereaved will continue to have a peaceful and  compassionate environment in which to mourn and remember their loved ones for generations to come, or as our mission statement says \"[T]o preserve the past for future generations\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015111700002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Green","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  We would not be discussing this issue if there was not a problem within the headstone industry.  Ms Hurley stated quite rightly in her contribution that the responsibility for graves, etc., in Ireland is the direct responsibility of local government.  I am not blaming anyone here for the sins of Queen Victoria, Daniel O'Connell, or anyone else, but we would not be having this discussion if historically the Department had dealt with this, especially in 1970 when a Private Members' Bill came before the House.<\/p><p>I dare say to the people to my right and left, as legislators, that if anyone was to try to introduce a private Bill in the House in this day and age, that person would not get as far as the stairs leading up to the D&aacute;il Chamber.  Anyway, this was the sort of thing that happened in the 1970s.  In this case the private Bill served to extend the protection of Glasnevin Trust and its influence and activity.  It afforded protection to the trust that was not available to any other body.  It is extraordinary.  Despite all the good work that Glasnevin Trust has been undertaken historically, it moved into a certain position.  This followed the 1970 private Act, which was passed unanimously in the House.  It was not drafted by any legislator but was drafted outside the House, something that speaks for itself.<\/p><p> I will condense the argument.  The 1970 Act bestowed on Glasnevin Trust a collection of new activities.  The trust could borrow money, buy property, etc.  These were functions it did not have up to that point.  The Act allowed the trust to engage in commercial activity.  The people on my left who have made submissions know the story of all their colleagues who had companies that have gone out of business since the 1970s.  The Act bestowed a privilege on one body that was not conferred on other bodies.  This has already been alluded to by one or two people.  What has happened since the early 1980s is that in the greater Dublin area almost 20 companies have gone out of business.  These companies employed people, paid taxes and so on.  They did not have charitable status, and they no longer exist.  Without being too humorous about it, they did not go out of business because people stopped dying.  They went out of business because they could not compete.  I cited as an example Mr. Pierce's letter in respect of the case in Swords.  It showed the inequality of this situation.  That is why we are before the committee today debating the matter.<\/p><p> The Department has failed to regulate unequal competition in the sector.  A registered charity has a special tax status, something the firms represented today do not.  It was a trust.  Other than one or two names, I do not know who is a member of the trust.  I know it is established in perpetuity as well.<\/p><p> We cannot compare like with like.  What happened in 1970 is something that we, as legislators, have to change in the interests of fairness.  It is not a simple matter for the Department or a question of blaming local authorities, although I believe it should have been rectified historically, because of what has happened since 1970.  Anyway, it is up to us now to rectify the matter.<\/p><p> This country has gone through great change and turmoil.  The word \"quango\" has been mentioned once or twice.  My difficulty with quangos is that we have not got rid of enough of them, but that is for another day.  Anyway, we have to rectify this on the basis of justice and fairness.  In no sector of Irish society should bestowing special private Acts on one body be permissible.  It is unfair.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015111700002#L00200","speaker":"1038","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>My thanks to everyone who has given testimony today.  I have some questions before I make my comments.  The basis of Ms Hurley's statement is that there is no issue anywhere outside Dublin and therefore the legislation is misplaced.  In other words, it is not suitable for a regulatory body to be established as a national body when the difficulty only appears to be an issue in Dublin.  I concur fully.  The purpose of the legislation was an attempt by the gentlemen to my left who have made witness statements today to try to address the matter, having tried every other angle within their means to address the inequality in the Dublin market.<\/p><p>In that context, I ask the witnesses to go back and have a look.  It may be that we need to repeal the 1970 Act to rectify matters.  I ask the witnesses to come back to us with further advice as to what should be done to address the anomalies that have been raised today.<\/p><p> Ms Goggin had a formal complaint made to her and an investigation was pursued.  Her final statement referred to the four things Glasnevin Trust is going to do arising from the investigation.  The trust has undertaken to treat competing headstone providers in an equal and non-discriminatory manner.  Does that mean the trust acknowledges that prior to the investigation it was not treating headstone manufacturers in the Dublin region equally and in a fair manner?  Ms Goggin's comments on the investigation would be very useful to the committee and allow us to ascertain whether the legislation needs to go forward from Second Stage.<\/p><p> I thank Mr. Gerry Brennan and Mr. David Pierce.  This is not our first meeting.  We have been meeting over the last number of years.  To say that they have pursued most graciously simply to be treated at least fairly would be an understatement.  I wish them very well in their endeavours.<\/p><p> Nearly everything Mr. Green said is true.  Glasnevin Cemetery is a credit to the organisation running it.  However, there is a definite inequality in the way it operates by comparison to some of the competitors in the same business.  Fundamentally, why is Glasnevin Cemetery in the business of selling monuments and flowers?  The Act that bestowed on the organisation all of the gratuities it did in the 1970s does not necessitate the cemetery being in a competitive business with regard to manufacturing and installing monuments and selling flowers inside the premises for no other reason than to make a profit in something.  It is a commercial activity in which the trust is competing on an uneven playing field with people who are trying to make their livelihoods and have been in the same market in Dublin for generations.<\/p><p> How much is Glasnevin's salary bill on an annual basis in comparison to the overall running costs?  Why does Glasnevin not publish in a transparent and open way the actual running costs and profits from the businesses that are part of the overall trust?  What is actually done with those profits?  How are they reinvested and what are they reinvested in?  Why are salaries and operating costs not published?  Why is there an element of secrecy around the trust and who are the body of people on it?  I do not understand what the purpose of the secrecy is.  Mr. Green might explain that to the committee.<\/p><p> Arising from the letter he wrote, I ask Mr. Pierce about the following.  The trust has claimed that it has never treated Pierce Monuments unfairly.  The day after Mr. Pierce was there meeting a potential client, he received the letter warning him not to do so again.  What happened thereafter?  What happened after he received the e-mail telling him not to dare to take photographs in the trust's cemeteries again?  What happened after he received the communication telling him that he was not allowed to place a plaque on his monuments?  What communications and clarifications were given to him by the trust arising from that?  What were the reasons for it and how did it affect his business?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015111700002#M00200","speaker":"1075","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I will let the witnesses respond in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015111700002#N00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":198,"content":"<p>If a regulator was put in place, it would extend to the entire country.  That has the potential to increase costs for people.  At the moment, if I hear complaints about anything, they are about the cost of funerals rather than that of erecting headstones.  Funerals take place at a time when people cannot shop around, which is the point that was made by Ms Goggin.  We must be very careful not to do something that will achieve the reverse of what is intended.<\/p><p>I expect that issues would arise in this regard, for example, with regard to extending oversight by such a regulatory authority to church-owned property, which I do not believe would be possible.  <\/p><p> On Glasnevin Cemetery, I echo some of the points made regarding the maintenance of the cemetery.  The original concept behind Glasnevin Cemetery was very enlightened because at that time people feared being buried owing to the burial practices common at the time.  Glasnevin Cemetery makes an important historical contribution, not only for the more celebrated people who are buried there but also for ordinary people.  I should declare an interest in that some of the bones of my ancestors reside in Palmerstown and Glasnevin cemeteries.  I expect a few other people in the room are in a similar position.  <\/p><p> Clearly, research has been done on comparable historical cemeteries.  Is public funding provided for the maintenance of similar cemeteries?  In Ireland, we tend to do things in a way that avoids the use of public funding.  Do the business operations at Glasnevin Cemetery contribute to the maintenance and upkeep of the cemetery in lieu of public funding for maintenance?  All of us will agree that the cemetery is maintained to a high standard.  I echo the view that its new buildings have been a great addition.  What contribution does the business make to the expenditure required to maintain the cemetery?  Are other income streams available for expenditure on maintenance?  If the Glasnevin Trust is a charitable trust, it is not for individual shareholders to make a profit.  There is, however, a question mark hanging over this issue.<\/p><p> The last thing we want to do is add to the cost faced by individuals.  If, however, the cost is to be borne by taxpayers, we need to know what dynamic is at play.  I expect competition would be the more fruitful option.  Serious concerns have been raised by previous speakers.  The introduction of competition appears to be a more viable option than the introduction of a regulatory authority as the latter could increase costs and the shortfall would have to be made up from public funds.  Given that some of the national cultural institutions, which are to play a role in the decade of centenary celebrations, are struggling financially, it is difficult to see from where such public funding would come.  Those are my observations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015111700002#N00300","speaker":"1202","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I welcome our visitors.

What was being alleged here was an abuse of dominance.  We would investigate that and if we felt that it was worthwhile bringing a case to court, we would have to go to the High Court and get it to make a finding of dominance in the first place, a finding of an abuse of dominance and then a direction on remedies - that is, what should be done to fix the situation.  Given the costs and the amount of time involved in that process, often what we do is to engage with the parties and try to get them to agree to change the course of action.  That is what we often do, and we publicise it.  We do not go to court just for the sake of it, because often there is no gain for anybody in that.

Deputy Regina Doherty asked why we are in the business and I want to join it with a comment Deputy Catherine Murphy made abut the enlightened attitude of Daniel O'Connell.  Daniel O'Connell's view was the same as that of all the cemetery people at the time.  In London, the magnificent seven Victorian cemeteries were opened, and all have failed as joint stock companies.  We decided to be a charity at that time, but we did not take a very prudent decision.  Cemeteries sell graves, and when they run out of space, the shareholders disappear.  Glasnevin Trust, under the Dublin Cemeteries Committee, has been in existence for 180 years, and we intend for it to exist for the next 180 years.  We went into the ancillary business.<\/p> <p>  The 1970 Act was to ensure the sustainability of Dublin cemeteries.  Since the Act, Shanganagh is the only public authority cemetery to be opened in Dublin.  We went into the business unashamed.  Selling graves is a commercial business.  Many of the thousands of charities listed on the Revenue Commissioners' website are limited companies and hundreds of them are involved in commercial activities.  There is no secrecy about the members of Glasnevin Trust; they are on our website.  If Deputy Maloney wants to engage with us, as Deputy Dowds has done, we can provide all the names and addresses.  I could give them now, although I do not think we have time.<\/p> <p>  We publish our accounts annually in a format prescribed by the Act and the Charities Regulatory Authority comes in.

We had become aware of all sorts of nefarious practices in the monumental sculpturing business, mostly due to health and safety issues.  In one case, an individual came in with a flat-bed truck and a JCB actor as a crane, which was tipping over as it was lifting stones.  We had to examine what we were doing.  We have a code of practice and monumental by-laws.  Every cemetery has a set of monumental by-laws which dictate who can erect a monument, on which grave it can be erected and what can be said in the inscription, for the orderly management of the cemetery.<\/p><p>In other words, is one entitled to put a headstone up on a grave?  That has to be checked.  It has to go through the records and all the systems of control, such as safety statements, vehicle registration, Safe Pass, health and safety, and, most importantly, insurance to us and to members of the public.  We introduced a registration process in which any monumental sculptor could register with us under health and safety and a code of practice to abide by our by-laws and insurance.  We introduced that on 13 June 2006.  There were 16 sculptors registered, including Glasnevin Cemetery monument works.  We now have 22 or 23 sculptors registered.  They are registered sculptors that are on our books at Glasnevin, Palmerstown, Newlands Cross and Dardistown.  There are another 30 <i>ad hoc<\/i>sculptors - not only monumental sculptors but sculptors who carry out work occasionally in our cemeteries, which is usually of a very high quality - who comply with the exact same conditions.  To say that Glasnevin Trust, Glasnevin Cemetery or Dublin Cemeteries Committee have put monumental sculptors out of business is not correct.  Added to that, many of the funeral directors who operate in Dublin city now sell monuments.  Fanagan's, Kirwan's, Nichol's and all of the funeral directors in the greater Dublin area sell monuments, generally for members of the monumental stonemasons' alliance.  Added to that, cremation has increased by 50% so up to 50% fewer people are buying monuments.  The monument business is contracting.  <br\/><br\/>Mr. Pierce alluded to the by-laws of Dardistown Cemetery in his statement.  When we opened Dardistown Cemetery in 1990 we introduced a by-law that only indigenous stone could be used.  Mr. Pierce and his colleagues rigorously objected to that.  We had no axe to grind and had nothing to make on it.We do not run quarries or supply stone to the stone industry.  Its purpose was to encourage more art and more use of indigenous stone because we foresaw that Indian and Chinese mass-produced stone, which some people would call blood stone or slavery stone, would come into this country and replace the native stone from Kerry, Cork, Galway, Limerick, or Donegal, and all the small, usually farmer-run quarries around the country.  We were quite right.  It has disappeared.  We stepped back from that by-law because of the furore that resulted from sectoral interests in the stone business.  That resulted in Mr. Pierce talking direct action again the Dublin Cemeteries Committee through the Competition Authority in 1991, through the European competition authority in 1991 and 1992, more recently through the Competition Authority in 2011 and 2013, and through the High Court and the Supreme Court, all of which found in favour of Glasnevin Trust.  This Bill is pointed directly at Glasnevin Trust and at no one else, apart from a few of the others from other cemeteries around the country.  Mr. Pierce took an action against Dublin Cemeteries Committee in the Supreme Court, which ruled in our favour.  This Bill is designed to overturn the decision of the Supreme Court.  It is as simple as that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015111700002#R00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. George McCullough","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCullough.

The Bill conflates many different issues.  The regulator of cemeteries should be the local authority and the licensing body in the area.  It is a statutory body and probably the most important tier of government, or should be the most important tier of government, as in most other countries.  The Bill provides for the establishment of boards of not more than ten members.  That is not practical given that cemeteries are provided by a range of bodies.  While the Bill appears to deal largely with the situation in Glasnevin, we have to deal with all the other cemeteries around the country.  If implemented, there would be huge implications for Church bodies, local authorities and joint burial boards throughout the State.  I can foresee many problems with it.  In regard to head 2(3)(e), which deals specifically with the issue of competition, there may be some merit in trying to separate the role of cemetery provider from the commercial activities that take place in cemeteries.  There should not be monopolies in this area.  I have heard the debate as to whether monopolies are operating in the case of Glasnevin Cemetery.  The solution is for the local authority to be the regulator and, in many cases, the provider, which is the practice in most counties throughout the State.  I have been a member of joint burial boards.  That system seems to work reasonably well, though there is room for improvement.  There are Church bodies and other bodies that own cemeteries, and commercial interests are also buying and operating cemeteries.<\/p><p>They could be licensed by local authorities.<\/p><p> The work of sculptors, monumental firms, etc., must be opened up to the same laws on commercial activity as everything else and it must be handled very carefully, given the situations that have arisen in different parts of the country.  To some extent, that is a separate issue.  However, it is the responsibility of the local authority, as regulator, to ensure that everything operates in a fair, proper and professional manner.  The Government is supposed to be getting rid of quangos.  Establishing another office or quango to manage this would be ludicrous.  The local authorities are already in existence and their members are elected by the communities and families that use the services.  Responsibility in this regard needs to be vested in the local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2015111700002#T00700","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447768800,"counter":248,"content":"<p>In the context of the goodwill relating to the agreement the CCPC reached with Glasnevin Trust, will Ms Goggin report back to the committee on the advertising prices of a comparable publication, including the distribution and readership, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the pamphlet's price of &euro;6,000 for a page of advertising?

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and maintain revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It was a more sustainable charge than those it replaced.  It is applied at low rates on a wide base.  The USC, like the income levy before it, does not apply to social welfare payments such as contributory and non-contributory State pensions and similar payments.  However, occupational pensions, including those of retired civil servants, are liable to the USC if the payment is greater than the exemption threshold, which for 2015 is &euro;12,012.  Public servants who enter the public service before April 1995 are, or were, in the case of retired individuals, liable to a reduced, modified PRSI rate which does not generate an entitlement to the State pension.  Such individuals receive a proportionately higher occupational pensions than post-1995 entrants who pay class A PRSI and therefore such individuals do not generate an entitlement to the State pension.<\/p><p>As Deputies may be aware, delivering on a commitment in the programme for Government, my Department reviewed USC during the lead-up to the 2012 budget.  The report is available on <i>www.finance.gov.ie<\/i>.  The issue of USC applying to occupational pensions of retired public servants who entered the public service before April 1995 was examined as part of the review and the Government decided not to exempt the occupational pensions of these people from USC given that it would be very costly and difficult to achieve.  It is unlikely that such an exemption could be achieved without providing a similar exemption to other income earners and occupational pension recipients, particularly those in receipt of occupational pensions who do not have an entitlement to an Irish contributory State pension.  Technical difficulties would arise with the design and administration of such a relief in view of the fact that a contributory social welfare pension entitlement may vary significantly between individuals, depending on factors such as number of contributions, dependants and the age of the pensioner and any dependant.<\/p><p>Finally, such an exemption would also undermine the principle of the USC being applied to income on a broad basis with few exceptions.<\/p><p> In view of these issues, and as a result of the review of the USC, the Government decided in budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the universal social charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum, in order to take very low-income earners out of the charge to USC.<\/p><p> Budget 2015 provided for an increase in the exemption threshold to &euro;12,012, equalising the position for single individuals whose sole source of income is the State contributory pension with public service pensioners whose pension is at an equivalent level.  Budget 2016 has further increased this threshold to &euro;13,000 per annum from 1 January 2016.  It is estimated that over 700,000 income earners will not be liable to USC at all from next year.<\/p><p> Budget 2016 is continuing the process, commenced in budget 2015, of reducing the tax burden on low and middle-income earners including, among other changes, a decrease in the three lowest rates of universal social charge with effect from January 2016.

The main findings are that average household incomes will increase by 1.6% or &euro;14 per week as a result of budget 2016; there are higher than average gains for the bottom two quintiles, while the smallest gain is in the top quintile; social welfare measures primarily benefit the bottom two quintiles; child expenditure, though universal, favours lower income households; income tax changes, though spread across all quintiles, are most beneficial to middle and higher-income groups; households with children are the biggest beneficiaries from budget 2016, in particular, working lone parents; households without children gain less than the average, with unemployed single persons showing the smallest increases; there is no significant change in the at-risk-of-poverty rate, as social transfers continue to perform strongly in reducing poverty; the budget provides greater rewards for working, with over 80% of the unemployed being substantially better off in work; the impact of the increase in the national minimum wage is quite significant for the small minority of households affected, with middle-income quintiles gaining the most; and compared to the previous year, budget 2016 delivers considerably bigger gains to the poorest households.  The assessment contradicts Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's argument.<\/p> <p>  Admittedly, if one picks out only one element of the budget, such as USC, personal tax reductions, it is the nature of tax reductions that the more one earns, the more one gets if tax is reduced.

If we believe in a labour force organised on the basis that people with additional responsibilities, in promotional posts or who work longer hours have more gross pay, if we use income tax and universal social charge, USC, as the method of giving relief, it is self-evident that people on a higher income from a particular source will gain more than people on lower incomes.  The budget has a number of policy instruments and by using a mix, we can change the distributional effects, as I outlined in the social impact study by the Department of Social Protection.<\/p><p> To return to the Deputy's point, taking the examples given of people who are low-paid or high-paid, currently a single individual employee on the minimum wage of &euro;17,542 per annum pays income tax of &euro;4.01 and universal social charge of &euro;7.19 per week and is exempt from paying PRSI.  This effective tax rate is therefore 3.3%.  As a result of the changes introduced in the 2016 budget, a minimum wage worker will see an increase in gross income of &euro;1,014 to &euro;18,556.  Despite this increase in gross income, the weekly universal social charge will reduce to &euro;6.09 per week.  A full-time minimum wage worker will see a 4.2% increase in net income as a result of the measures in the 2016 budget.<\/p><p> In contrast, a single employee earning &euro;70,000 per annum currently pays &euro;24,785 per annum or over &euro;476 per week in income tax, USC and PRSI.  After the 2016 budget, such an individual will see an increase in net income of 2%, less than half that of the minimum wage worker.  The minimum wage worker will get an increase of 4.2% whereas the single person on &euro;70,000 gets a 2% increase.  The Deputy's criticism is only valid if he believes in a labour force where there is equal pay right through it, regardless of qualifications, responsibilities or hours worked.  If personal taxes are reduced, the impact of a reduction in such taxes will be greater for people who pay much in personal taxes as against those who pay a little in such taxes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#B01500","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":284,"content":"<p>If a person works hard, uses his or her \"smarts\" and takes responsibility and risk, he or she should be economically compensated.

For example, I know a 68-year-old woman who had a stroke and waited 45 minutes for an ambulance to arrive at her house because of a lack of ambulances.

She had another stroke and a nurse was pulled away from her when she was in the hospital shower, leading to her falling and sustaining a head injury.

Otherwise, the rules are being changed.  We made a major change in not following the Deputy's formula by capping the reliefs at &euro;70,000 per income.  If we followed the Deputy's \"spark\" argument, we would not have capped it at &euro;70,000 but run it up to the highest incomes in the country.  The Deputy cannot have it both ways and if that is the kind of society in which he believes, it is an inevitable consequence of that model, which I believe in as well, that people on higher incomes seeing relief through personal tax reductions will get more in euro than a person on a lower income but with the same percentage relief.  To avoid extravagant gains, we have capped this at &euro;70,000.

At a basic level, there are people who are working but who cannot afford to pay rent.  There are civil and public servants coming to my office who cannot pay rent and who are using homeless services or sleeping in cars.  When that is happening, regardless of ideology, every single bit of available relief should go to helping such people.<\/p><p>Let us forget about ideology, philosophy and incentivising people at the top.  I maintain there is simply no justification for giving to those on &euro;70,000, &euro;80,000, &euro;100,000 or more in this way.  Whatever else one may say about those people, they can pay the bills.  They are not in danger, for the most part, of losing their homes.  However, the vast majority of people on low pay are in a situation where they are actually having difficulty keeping roofs over their heads.<\/p><p> We have this problem and it is getting worse.  The take-home pay of people is insufficient to cover the bills and keep a roof over their heads.  Against that background, does the Minister not accept that he simply must engineer tax changes such that every cent is directed at bringing that group up to the point where they are not coming home after a week's work unable to pay to keep a roof over their heads?  Whatever way the Minister wants to do it is fine - I do not care.  It is self-evident that we should do this and, against that background, what the Minister has done is simply not good enough.<\/p><p> The Minister may argue that he has capped the benefits that may have accrued otherwise.  I accept the Minister has done that, but in the current scenario whereby we have the phenomena of the working poor, far more radical measures are necessary, and I do not believe they are contained in the budget.<\/p><p> Does the Minister recognise the connection between growing wage differentials among top earners and low and average earners?  That gap is growing all the time.  It is connected to growth in inequality generally and wealth inequality in particular.  Any serious studies undertaken on the subject confirm that the wage and salary hierarchy contributes over time to a growing gap between rich and poor.  In other words, if a person earns &euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000 per year, he need not spend all of it to stay alive.  The person can save and invest.  That money makes profit for him and it accumulates over time.  By contrast, the person on low income who has to borrow to pay the bills or do most things is getting poorer on a cumulative basis over time.  Wage differentials contribute to growing wealth inequality.  There is a significant if not a majority consensus now to the effect that the wealth inequality flowing from income inequality is one of the biggest problems we face.  This is clearly evident in Irish society, just as it is a pattern throughout the world.  In approaching budgets, we should seek to address that and rebalance things.  We should have taxes that are redistributive, Robin Hood taxes, if I can put it that way.  They should take from the rich to give to the poor because the gap is too big.<\/p><p> I will offer an obvious example.  The Minister might hold that we have to incentivise the man at the top, for example, a banker, who may be on &euro;500,000 per year or more.  I struggle to see why a banker should get paid ten times or 11 times what a nurse gets paid.  Is it because of the length of hours worked or the level of responsibility?  I am afraid I see no great difference in that regard.  Arguably, the nurse is doing far more of a service than the banker.  I do not see how one can justify a differentiation by a factor of ten between what one and the other earns.  Perhaps the Minister disagrees with that, but I struggle to see the justification.<\/p><p> Against that background, if I were Minister for Finance, I would hold that we need a tax system which at least reduces the gap in net income between those two groups because it has grown spectacularly.  Moreover, it contributes in the macro sense to a growing gap in wealth inequality.  It is summed up by some of the biggest billionaires in this country who at this point make money because they have money.  Do we not need to do something about that?  Is there not something wrong with that?  Let us suppose a person has &euro;1 billion.  He can add to his personal wealth, probably by 5% per year or perhaps 10%, not because he works longer hours or because he is more educated but simply because he has a great deal of money to start with.  Any fair approach to taxation would recognise that there is something wrong with the idea that people get richer simply because they are rich while other people who are working their backs off are struggling to pay the bills.  Is that not correct?<\/p><p> I put those points to the Minister.  I can guess what the answer will be.  Nonetheless I believe these are serious issues which are not being addressed.  In fact, I believe they are not even recognised by the Government as issues that need to be addressed.  A growing chorus of voices maintains that these gaps between rich and poor in terms of income and wealth have to be addressed for the sake of justice and for the sake of macroeconomic stability as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#C00800","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett has made many points.  I will try to address at least some of them.  First, Deputy Boyd Barrett suggested that there are people who are doing rather well, are getting well-paid, can pay their way and need no tax relief.  That is true, but that was not the way it was in 2011 when we came to power.  At the time, many middle-income people could not pay their way.  They could not do all those things.  It is as a result of Government policy that they can now pay their bills.  Society is complicated.  It is part of the social compact and the work of the trade union movement to establish the proper wage for a particular job.<\/p> <p>  My opening position at the start of this debate was that I do not believe one can run a society if everyone gets paid the same regardless of what they do, how long they work or what responsibility they take.  I do not believe there is a flat-rate model.  Therefore, once we allow for differentiation, we will have differentiation.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett has excoriated middle class people on the basis that they do not need any relief.  However, middle class people have to pay mortgages and the costs of raising their children out of after-tax income.  They are part of what is called the squeezed middle.  They find it hard enough to live when they have to pay mortgages and pay for the education of their children.  They pay for everything, in fact.  There is no model of society where one size fits all.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett in one sense.  One of the aspects of statecraft, if that is what we call what we do, is to seek to achieve a balance to continue with a degree of social cohesion in the country.  The Opposition Deputies are strong advocates of soak-the-rich policies.  Yet when the Government put a tax on property, they were all shouting and roaring over how it was unfair.  They wanted to exempt people who had &euro;2 million pads, &euro;3 million pads and &euro;10 million pads.  Deputy Boyd Barrett and his colleagues are unique.  They are the only socialists I know of in the world who are against property taxes.  I simply do not get it.  Of course, I do get it.

In 2016 it is expected that there will be 2.2 million taxpayer units, including married couples under joint assessment.  It is expected that the total yield from income tax and universal social charge will be approximately &euro;18.7 billion.  That is the total pot.  Of that yield, approximately &euro;6.6 billion will be paid by people with incomes under &euro;70,000 per year.  That covers approximately 2 million people.

I do not want to labour this point because we fundamentally disagree on it.  The Minister has not addressed the question I put to him about wealth inequality.  Does he see it as a problem?  He will be aware that many people - including Thomas Piketty most famously, and David McWilliams more recently in this country - have argued that growing wealth inequality is a problem.  Obviously, we have been making that point for a long time.  It is a problem at the social justice level and it is becoming a macroeconomic problem because too few people control too much money.  It is estimated that the personal wealth of the richest man in Ireland has increased from &euro;2 billion in 2006 to &euro;6 billion this year.  At a time when the rest of the country has been getting poorer, his personal wealth has trebled.  Does the Minister agree that such a level of concentration of wealth, which is echoed around the world, is a problem?  I am asking a straight question.  I am one of many people who see it as a problem.  I suggest that the only way for the Minister to address this problem is to introduce radical redistributive tax measures which are Robin Hood in nature, to put it in simple terms.  I do not say this to encourage a vendetta against middle class people or anything like that.  I say it in the context of the recognition that there is a level of inequality that cannot be justified because it is dangerous for society and the economy.  Does the Minister have any sympathy with that view, which is a growing one?  To my mind, it is obvious.<\/p> <p>  For the record, we have said that taxes should not be imposed on the family home.  As the Minister knows, we have said that wealth taxes, including taxes on property, should apply to all other assets excluding the family home over a certain threshold of wealth.  I ask him to believe me when I say that someone who owns multiple properties or who owns a mansion would pay a hell of a lot more under our proposals.  We do not agree with a property tax that hits the family home and fails to take account of the income which may be coming into that home.  The Minister is very familiar with this argument, so it is a bit disingenuous of him to misrepresent it.  In my constituency, there are many cases of people who happen to live in properties that are valuable because property prices are high in their local areas.  The Minister knows that many people live in houses with values that bear no relation whatsoever to the incomes coming into those houses.  Many pensioners on very small pensions - sometimes the State pension - are being taxed excessively on the basis of the value of their houses.  That is the injustice that led us to oppose the Minister's property tax and to propose a different type of wealth tax.  I ask the Minister to be honest when he is characterising the position we have put.  The Minister could double, treble or quadruple the second home tax and it would be okay with me because it would get at multiple property owners.  We would not be talking about someone's primary residence.  I emphasise that a tax on somebody's primary residence that does not take account of income is just not fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#E00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>As I said at the time of last month's budget, the growth in the economy means that as politicians, we are now moving into the fortunate position where we have policy choices once again.

The Deputy began by asking, as a general question, whether I am aware of the work done by various economists in describing the inequalities of income on a worldwide basis.  Of course I am aware of that work.  However, the data to which he refers are mostly American.  There has been a widening of individual wealth in the United States.  That is not mirrored by what has been happening in Ireland.  That has not happened at all.  I am sure the general debate in this regard emerged at the G20 summit in Turkey in recent weeks.

Income tax and USC are imposed on income.  Wealth is a different thing.  Wealth is stored income which one has not had to spend.  The wealth of most people in Ireland, including those on very good incomes, is in the value of their family homes.  That is where the wealth is.  Most people do not have huge property assets beyond the family home.  If I decide not to tax the family home, I am exempting the greatest amount of wealth that is available in society.  The Deputy referred to a multi-millionaire who is living in a mansion.  Under the Deputy's model, if that mansion is the family home, the multimillionaire will not pay tax on it.  He would pay tax under the Deputy's system if he had a second mansion, but I would tax him on the first mansion and I am doing so.  That is the way the property tax I am running operates.<\/p> <p>  I think the Deputy's approach is illogical and ineffective because the tranche of society from which his model would collect money is too small.  If he wants to have a look at how it would work, I remind him that it was tried in the 1980s by a Government of which I was a member.  When a property tax is applied on a narrow base as suggested by the Deputy, and various exemptions are also applied, the returns are nugatory.  I was in the Government that brought in this form of tax.  The main reason for its subsequent abolition by Fianna F&aacute;il was that Mr. Haughey did not want a wealth tax.  He was wrong on that, but he was right on the issue of the nugatory returns.  The administrative costs were nearly as much as what was collected.  The Deputy has accused me of being dishonest.

He represents a constituency where the value of family homes is the highest in the country.  I think he is influenced by constituency considerations that are clouding his clear-cut ideological position.  I think that is the case.  Our system is already the most efficient in the OECD at improving direct income equality through the system of social transfers.  This is measured using the Gini coefficient, of which the Deputy is aware.  He will find that independent research has been done on this matter.  It must be recognised that for social transfers to take place, we must have high earners to tax.  If our income tax system becomes too high by comparison with other countries, fewer of these individuals will choose to live in Ireland and we will therefore lose some of the tax income that is used to pay for social transfers.<\/p> <p>  I reduced personal taxes in the budget because I believe personal taxes are too high.  Regardless of one's level of income, if one is charged more than 50% on the next &euro;1, I think that is too high.  People start moving around and wondering whether they can become tax exiles.  They also make certain arrangements, lobby for more tax breaks or do some kind of property tax break.  We have gone through all that.  I would like to have all income, as a starting point, taxed at below 50%.  Then I would like to move it down progressively, in the first instance by organising incentives for people on low and middle incomes.  I think that is the way to go.  I will explain why I am doing this.  If we increase taxes on fixed assets and reduce personal taxes, we are not taxing work.  We are taxing assets that are very difficult to transfer.  Skilled people are very mobile.  If they are taxed too highly, they can move.  We have a common labour market with the UK now.<\/p><p>Many young smart people in Dublin do not see a problem in working in London, if it is a choice.  So we need to get our personal tax rates down to ensure that our workforce is incentivised and that we can continue our successful policies of job creation.  I remind the committee that this morning's quarterly household survey shows that the level of unemployment has dropped to 8.9%, which is the first time since 2008 that the jobless figure in Ireland began with the figure 8.  The other factor is that I want emigrants to come home.  As the economy continues to grow at very strong rates, we will experience skills shortages within 18 months in certain sectors of the economy.  We need to incentivise well-qualified young people to come back to make their homes and lead their lives in Ireland.  That requires reductions in personal taxes.  It does not require a one-size-fits-all system in which we take a tenner off everybody in the interests of equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#E00700","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":305,"content":"<p>Cheaper accommodation would go a lot further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#F00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":306,"content":"<p>That is part of it as well.

It has been an interesting debate but it captures the essence of the budgetary debates we have had, not just this year but also in the last few years.  Neither I nor my party believe that someone who earns &euro;70,000, &euro;80,000 or &euro;100,000 is necessarily on the pig's back.  It is all relative and it depends on people's financial commitments such as mortgages and child care costs.  I believe it would be wrong to examine one particular measure on its own.  One must look in the round at the Government's approach to budgeting.  That is why we advocated a different approach this year.  The Minister is correct in that the more tax a person pays, the more he or she will benefit from a tax cut; that is simple maths.  However, when one looks at the effect of the last number of budgets and the fact that many of the instruments introduced did not take into account in any way a person's ability to pay the local property tax, the water charges, or PRSI after the abolition of the exemption, then it is my view - and I think it is borne out by the evidence - that the burden was placed most heavily onto those who had quite low levels of income.  That is why we advocated for a different approach in budget 2016 to reducing the tax burden.  For example, an increase in tax credits would have meant more proportionately to a person on a modest income.  Equally, a greater expansion of the USC bands at the lower rates would have benefited everybody but would have proportionally meant more to those who have had to carry the burden of water charges, the local property tax and the abolition of the PRSI exemption.  The Government is doing it one way now when it is giving money back, but when it was taking money from people it was done in quite a regressive way.  As justification for his approach the Minister has used the significant increase in direct taxation in the earlier years of the crisis.  That increase was introduced largely by the late Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, in the form of the USC.  Those increases were very significant for people's pay packets but they were progressive.  However, the measures brought in by the current Minister, Deputy Noonan, prior to the last 12 months were strongly regressive, and now when he gives money back he is again doing it in a way that benefits people on higher incomes.  People who are on high incomes are not necessarily very well off in net terms; it depends on individual financial circumstances.  This budget was an opportunity to undo some of the damage done by the failure to take into account ability to pay.  The Minister said that he looked very carefully to see where he could help somebody on &euro;25,000, because their gain is about 1.1%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#F00500","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":309,"content":"<p>That is a single person.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#F00600","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":310,"content":"<p>Yes.  In the budget documentation the Government is cleverly presenting the example of a person on a minimum wage, as if the minimum wage increase is being paid for by the Government.  It is not; it is being paid for by employers.  On this occasion, the way to help a person in the &euro;20,000 to &euro;30,000 bracket could have been to increase tax credits.  Those people are still paying a significant amount of tax, albeit a fraction of what somebody on &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000 is paying.  It is a question of taking account of what has happened in the last three or four years.  The burden has fallen very heavily on people on low incomes and those at the lower end of the middle income bracket.  We have a different point of view and it is one that has been thrashed out this year and last year.

When we debated this on budget night I said to Deputy McGrath and Deputy Boyd Barrett that we are fortunate to have choices again.  What Deputy McGrath proposes is one way of doing it, and there are certain advantages to it.  However, the reason I opted for cuts in USC were twofold.  Firstly, the rate of personal tax is the big disincentive in terms of job creation and getting emigrants to return.  People do not get it when one tricks around with credits and bands.  If a person is working in London, Sydney or New York and is thinking of coming home, they will ask what the pay rates at home are.  It is the rate of tax that jumps off the page.  Unless the rate is changed, the priority - after tax rates being so high and after the tax take being so high - is to incentivise by reducing rates.  That is not to say that a future Minister in a future budget would not, quite rightly, move credits and move bands.  The international literature on tax reductions will always concentrate on the rate as the big driver and incentive.  The literature would also argue that once the 50% rate is passed it can cause big trouble.  If a person says \"If I work overtime I will get &euro;100, but &euro;55 of that is gone in tax,\" the incentives are out the gate at that stage.  It has to be kept below that rate.<\/p> <p>  There are other reasons for the credits and the bands.  Raising the standard income tax credits would, in general, only have benefitted those earning more than &euro;16,500 per year, as this is the level of income already sheltered from income tax by the personal tax credits.  One of the reasons I chose to make changes in the USC which will benefit all those who are earning &euro;12,012 or more is that raising the exemption threshold at which USC becomes chargeable from &euro;12,012 to &euro;13,000 per annum will remove an estimated 40,000 individuals from liability to the charge entirely.  The reduction in the three lowest rates of USC will benefit 1.5 million extra people.  What the Deputy is proposing does not do what it says on the tin either because those on incomes below &euro;16,500 get no advantage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#F00800","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>We dealt with that proposal separately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#F00900","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I gave a strong return on USC.

In this budget I was interested in incentivising people, and it seems to be working.  There is a huge third-quarter increase in the number of people at work.  There is a huge increase in the number of people going from part-time to full-time work, and it will continue.  However, that is not to say that the Deputy will never be right.

The Minister indicated the level of income at which people pay and the level of taxes they pay, but VAT and all of the other taxes have not been taken into consideration by the Minister.

We came to that figure by way of our proposal to raise the minimum wage by &euro;1.50 more than the Government seeks to raise it - that is, to &euro;10.65 per hour.  At that level, it would be the threshold with regard to a normal week's work for a worker.  We feel the &euro;13,000 figure the Minister has selected falls far too short.

We can then have a dialogue if that is necessary.<\/p> <p>  It would appear from the wording of the proposed amendment that it is the Deputy's intention that all those earning up to &euro;376 per week, which is just over the earnings of a full-time worker on the new minimum wage of approximately &euro;357 per week, be exempted from the charge for USC entirely.  It is unclear whether the Deputy also intends that the amendment covers all income earners with incomes of less than &euro;19,572, rather than just workers.  Such a group would include pensioners and people with income from their investments.  The Deputy should be aware that the changes proposed in the Finance Bill include a provision to extend the exemption threshold for USC from the current &euro;12,012 to &euro;13,000 per annum.  This measure alone will remove an estimated 40,000 low-income earners from liability to the charge entirely.  This is in addition to the number of individuals removed from the charge as a result of the two previous extensions of the exemption limit in 2012 and 2015.  It is now estimated that more than 700,000 individuals, or 29% of all income earners, will not be liable to USC from next year.  In addition to this and as a result in the reduction of the two lower rates of USC and the extension of the ceiling for the second rate of USC from &euro;17,576 to &euro;18,668, all those earning the increased minimum wage with an average working week of 39 hours will remain liable to the two lower rates of USC only, notwithstanding the increase in their gross income.  It should also be noted that a new PRSI credit has been introduced in budget 2016 in order to address the PRSI step effect which would otherwise have had a negative impact on full-time minimum-wage workers from January 2016.<\/p> <p>  To increase the USC exemption threshold to &euro;19,572 would increase the entry point to the charge above the current entry point to income tax of &euro;16,500 per annum for a single employee.  To do this would seriously undermine the rationale for the introduction of the USC, which was to broaden the tax base from its previous narrow, unsustainable level.  In addition, the USC was intended to ensure that most individuals would make some contribution, however small, to the provision of services and towards assisting in restoring the public finances.  The removal of individuals earning up to &euro;19,572 from the charge would effectively reverse the base-broadening which has already been achieved.  When the Government considers options for a budgetary tax package, it must take account of all the parts of the package.  Therefore, single measures cannot be contemplated in isolation.  Taking these factors into account, I am not minded to expend resources on the production of the report requested by the Deputy and therefore I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p> <p>  As regards indirect taxes, it is more appropriate to look at these as a proportion of people's expenditure, as distinct from their income.

Over the past year I have responded to a number of parliamentary questions regarding the estimated cost of extending the PAYE-type credit to the self-employed.  A number of different figures were quoted in these responses, including higher and lower costs relative to the credit introduced in budget 2016, depending on the specific question asked.  For example, an estimated cost of &euro;470 million was given to extending the employee PAYE credit in March.  This was based on extending the &euro;1,650 credit to all non-PAYE cases, including schedule D, proprietary directors and assisting spouses.  This estimate included cases classed as schedule D on the basis that the majority of the taxpayer's gross income is non-PAYE.  Some of these cases may have been availing of the PAYE credit.  On that basis it was estimated that the credit would be available to approximately 284,600 cases.  Furthermore, the March costing was based on estimated income for 2015.  Budget measures are costed on the basis of estimated income for 2016.  This should also be considered when comparing the two figures.<\/p> <p>  By contrast, in October a cost of &euro;137 million was given in response to a parliamentary question on the cost of introducing an earned income credit of &euro;1,650 for self-employed people.  In this case, I specified in the response that it was assumed the credit would only be extended to cases identified to be in receipt of trading or professional Case 1 or Case 2 income for individuals not in receipt of the PAYE allowance.<\/p> <p>  The essential point is that if we costed everything and introduced it at one third of the &euro;1,650 credit, it would amount to a credit of &euro;550.  While I did not absolutely commit to close the gap completely over a three-year period, the arithmetic would suggest that this is the trajectory.  Second, I did not want double credits for anyone.  If a person already has part PAYE income and had been getting &euro;1,650, I am not proposing that we give that person an additional credit of a similar amount, ultimately, for that portion of their income from self-employed work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#H00200","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I want the Minister to clarify a point relating to the reduction of approximately 170,000 in the number of people expected to benefit.

It could be expected, therefore, that approximately 82,800 individuals would be entitled to claim an earned income credit on the basis of Irish trading or professional income.

However, in the case of PAYE taxpayers the Revenue has taken steps for a number of years to automatically allow the credit without the person having to make a claim, wherever possible.  For example, the Revenue uses the data it receives from the Department of Social Protection in respect of child benefit together with other data from Revenue records to automatically grant the credit.  I am advised that in 2015 the Revenue gave the relief automatically to approximately 81,000 taxpayers on this basis.

My colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, in conjunction with her Department and the SEC, have advised that they consider that there are only two viable options open to deal with this issue.  We can either provide remediation by means of a specific provision in the Finance Bill or increase remuneration for affected examiner staff in order to offset the significant loss of income as a result of taxing travel and subsistence payments.<\/p><p>I am advised that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is strongly opposed to the possibility of increased remuneration and I tend to agree with its position.  This leaves a difficult decision.  If we do not wish to increase the public pay bill significantly, we need to consider how we can continue to pay expenses to these people at the same level as they have previously received them.  We could simply deduct the tax, which the SEC should have been doing all along, but then, of course, the expenses received into their hands by these staff would decrease considerably.  I am advised this could put the SEC in a position where it would be difficult to attract sufficient numbers of such staff in order for the State examinations in 2016 to be concluded successfully.  On this basis I consider that, having regard to historical practice, it would seem appropriate to include a measure in the Finance Bill 2015 to exempt certain expenses of SEC examiner staff from taxation.<\/p><p>Bearing in mind the need to ensure this measure operates exactly as intended, and with a very narrow focus, there have been ongoing discussions involving the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Finance, Revenue, the Department of Education and Skills and the SEC.

The purpose of the amendment is twofold: to extend the exemption to include a small benefit in addition to a voucher; and to provide that the exemption applies to benefits and vouchers gifted to employees on or after 22 October 2015.  The new section provides a legislative basis for a concession that is currently operated by the Revenue Commissioners.  This will allow an exemption from income tax, PRSI and USC to an individual where an employer gives that employee a small benefit or voucher in a year of assessment.  There are some restrictions, namely: the benefit or voucher cannot exceed &euro;500 in value; it cannot be exchanged in part or in full for cash; it cannot be part of any salary sacrifice arrangement between the employee and employer; and only one benefit or voucher may be given in any one year.  By changing the commencement provision, it will allow Christmas bonuses that meet the conditions to qualify for tax exemption this year.  It is the practice of some employers to give some benefit, Christmas bonus or voucher to employees at this time.  Up to now, they could give a voucher to the value of &euro;250 and this was not taxable.  The amount will now be increased to &euro;500 and it will not be subject to income tax.<\/p><p>The principal reason for the new draft is that after the Bill was published, it was pointed out to me that it would only come into effect on 1 January and would, therefore, be of no benefit to people this Christmas.  I am bringing the effective date forward to 22 October - the date on which the Bill was published - in order that employers will be free to increase the value of the bonuses or vouchers they give to employees.  In a way, this mirrors what is being done by the Department of Social Protection in terms of paying increased Christmas bonuses to persons on welfare payments.  The amendment will give rise to a small benefit for people at work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#M00800","speaker":"955"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447776000,"counter":425,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447776000,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Section 10 deleted.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447776000,"counter":427,"content":"<p>Section 11 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1447776000,"counter":428,"content":"<p>SECTION 12<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 15:<\/p><blockquote>In page 12, to delete line 21 and substitute the following:&ldquo;(2) <i>Subsection (1) <\/i>applies for the year of assessment 2016 and each subsequent year of assessment.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>This section is due to commence on 1 January 2016.

The Revenue Commissioners may also take into account the individual's gross income from non-PAYE sources in deciding how they should be treated.

Certain forms of income that relate to forestry, such as grants and premiums, are exempt from tax at present, but there are restrictions in place which seek to limit the ability of people on high incomes and high earners to avail of such tax breaks.  One of the problems with the tax system in this country is that it is peppered with tax reliefs.  I suggest that tax reliefs distort the progressive nature of the income tax base.  Obviously, the purpose of a tax relief is to incentivise a certain type of behaviour which is considered to be in the common good.  When tax reliefs are made available to extremely high earners, they have the effect of reducing significantly the tax liability of those people.  In light of all the reasons we have previously discussed - many people are dying on the streets while others are struggling to get our crumbling health system to deliver health services to them - we would absolutely oppose the idea that a tax relief should be extended to high earners.  At a time when many people, including hundreds of thousands of children, are living in extreme poverty, it is shocking to propose that the restrictions currently limiting the ability of high earners to avail of this tax relief should be withdrawn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#N00700","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":441,"content":"<p>The Deputy has just asked for tax relief for rural towns.  The management of our woodlands is a rural activity.  I do not like to take things out of the high income earners' liabilities, but there is a justification for this proposal.  Most of the constituency represented by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is rural.  It is hard for one to harvest forestry if one has to go back in for a second or third time.  The tax restriction on this income has made it impossible for owners, especially farmers, to bring in the heavy machinery that is necessary to harvest in one go the trees of the same age that mature at the same time.  When they have tried to do so, they have run into circumstances in which, after they have grown trees for 25 or 30 years, this income would become liable for the high earners' tax relief in a single year.  That is the purpose of this change.  If the Deputy thinks about it, he will appreciate that it is helpful to the economy of rural Ireland because it will encourage the further development of forestry, especially on those lands that are not really viable for much other farming activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#N00800","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I mentioned that tax reliefs are a distortion of the income base, but I also said that there are circumstances in which they can be used for the common good.  There is no doubt that this proposal would have a marginal effect on the rural economy.  I would make the point that having roads on which people can drive would also have an effect on the rural economy.  There are roads in north-west Meath that are completely impassable for at least six months of the year.  People have to make diversions of six miles or more to drive their children to school or to get to church or the shops.  I know people in rural parts of north-west Meath who do not invite their customers to the location of their business because they know that if their customers make the journey once they will not do so again.  They offer instead to meet their customers in the town of Virginia, in south-west Cavan.  The point I am making to the Minister is that there is a hierarchy of need.  I suggest that the level of need and pressure is most severe among a swathe of citizens in this country.  I refer not only to those affected by health difficulties and homelessness, but also to small businesspeople who are looking for roads to be tarmacked so that their businesses can function.  I suggest that super-high earners are at the bottom of that hierarchy of need.  They need no new tax breaks in order to be able to meet the needs of their lives.  The income levels they already have mean they are able to meet all the human needs they experience multiple times over.  If we are to use tax reliefs, we should not target them on the basis of the needs of extremely high earners.  Some of the towns throughout the country that are dying on their feet because so few people are living in them have been mentioned.  In many of those towns, Main Street is Shutter Street because so many shops have closed.  We need to target the funds in that direction rather than putting them into the deep pockets of high earners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#N00900","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I do not disagree with the Deputy's analysis of the high earner restriction.  As a general rule, I am opposed to changes in the application of that restriction because it has been effective.  It continues to be an effective measure, and I believe this is due in large part to the fact that it applies across such a wide range of reliefs.  In this instance, however, I am satisfied that the cashflow cost to the Exchequer can be justified when it is viewed against the overall benefits to the sector itself and to the environment generally.  The high earner restriction is intended to apply to high earners and not to those who are caught simply because of the way their incomes are earned.  The most recent report on the operation of the restriction, which related to the 2013 tax year, stated that seven people in receipt of this exempt income were subject to the high earner restriction.  On that basis, I do not expect this change to have any appreciable impact on the functioning of the high earner restriction.  The people who have expertise in this area have advised me that at present the restriction can kick in when areas of forestry that are as small as 8 hectares are harvested.  At present, people who have 25 hectares of forest that matures at the same time are choosing to go in three times, three years in a row, in order to avoid the implications of the high earner restriction.  This reduces the viability of what they are doing and causes roads similar to the inaccessible ones the Deputy mentioned in his constituency to get ploughed up by heavy trucks in three consecutive years.  The commercial way of doing this work would be to provide for one clean felling.  Ultimately, it is not as if people get money from forestry every year.  The Deputy knows the way it works.  Those involved get some incentive grants when they plant their trees and some more incentive grants when those trees reach a particular age, but the main income comes once, when those trees are felled.  It is not as if the people in question are going to get the same income the following year.  They get caught in the high earner restriction in one particular year.  To avoid this, they tend to spread the felling of the trees over a number of years.  Such an approach is less viable and is not environmentally friendly.

Some of Revenue's recent figures about the uneven distribution of income in the State were startling.  According to Revenue, the total income of those liable to income tax was &euro;77 billion in 2011.  Revenue projects that this figure will increase to &euro;98 billion in 2016.  The analysis gives a breakdown of where that &euro;21 billion increase will find a home.  Some &euro;12 billion, more than 50% of that new income, will go to the top 10% of earners, while &euro;14 billion, more than 66%, will go to the top 14% of earners.  We are seeing a society develop in which the new income generated therein will lean heavily towards a small section of that society.<\/p><p>Income gaps have yawned in recent years.  We are not referring to the normal rich and poor in society any more, or to what happened in the 1970s and 1980s in that regard.  Rather, the incomes of the top 20% have increased significantly.  The Minister mentioned that the top 20% of earners were paying two thirds of all income tax, but the top 10% earn 33% of all income.  It might feel like the top earners are being taxed sizably, but they are consuming a sizable portion of the income as well.<\/p><p>The question is how to have an income tax rate that allows people to work harder and take home more money while contributing more.  It puts a brake on the growth of the income chasm between rich and poor.  How can this be done in a way that does not penalise people who are even on middle incomes?  We suggest that, on every &euro;1 over &euro;100,000, 7 cent extra will go into the State's coffers.  This would have the effect of creating a somewhat more equal society, putting a brake on the growing disparity in incomes and bringing hundreds of million of euro into the State's coffers to address the life-and-death issues being experienced by those in the lowest third of the population's earners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#O01100","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I assume that Deputy Doherty was referring to the introduction of a third rate of income tax.  Based on Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's contribution, the proposal seems to be one of a third rate at 47% on incomes in excess of &euro;100,000.<\/p> <p>  A fair, efficient and competitive income tax system is essential for economic growth and job creation.  I have long said that the burden of the income tax system is too high and is acting as a disincentive for work and investment.  The USC measures in this Bill are a further step, following the income tax and USC measures in last year's Act, to reduce progressively the marginal tax rate on low and middle-income earners in a manner that maintains the highly progressive nature of the Irish tax system.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy is aware, there is a commitment in the programme for Government not to increase the top marginal tax rates.  A third rate of tax at 47% would increase the top rate by 7% and have the effect of increasing the top marginal rates of tax to 59% for employees and 62% for the self-employed.  Furthermore, and as I stated in my budget speech, it is my intention that, if we are returned to government and as resources become available, we will progressively reduce the marginal rate to no more than 50% for all workers to make Ireland more attractive for mobile foreign investment and skills, including those of our returning emigrants.<\/p> <p>  It is important to point out the significance of marginal tax rates, as they influence individual decisions to work more or, indeed, work at all.  The OECD working paper on tax and economic growth talks about \"the possibility that high top marginal rates will increase the average tax rates paid by high-skilled and high-income earners so much that they will migrate to countries with lower rates resulting in a brain drain which may lower innovative activity and productivity\".<\/p><p>Higher marginal tax rates for earners may also incentivise a greater level of tax evasion and contribute to the development of a shadow economy.  Therefore, apart from the detrimental effect I believe that such high marginal rates of tax would have on growth of the economy this kind of measure would run contrary to the commitment in the programme for Government.  Although the Deputy only proposes the drafting of a report on the actions for introducing an additional marginal rate of tax, to produce such a report would introduce an element of uncertainty as to the direction of the Government's income tax policy and, as such, could be damaging to the promotion of foreign direct investment and job creation.

I can see why he is doing it.  It is for technical reasons.  That is fair enough, he gets the issue debated.

Even though there was some positive news with regard to job figures today, that cohort is shrinking still.  It is not a case that people leaving is a block on policy development, people are leaving as a result of the policies that have been implemented.  Second, the level of capital investment in recent years has collapsed in the State.

It is well known that a level of investment down from 1.8% to 1.5% is not enough to maintain the capital stock in the State.  Infrastructure such as roads, broadband and all the competitive advantages one would seek in a healthy economy to create jobs will not be maintained and competitive advantages will be lost.  Therefore, the argument is that this is a tax on jobs and would prevent jobs being created in the future.  The flipside is the truth because if the Government has the tax take it can invest in the capital infrastructures in order to have a competitive advantage in the future.  Third, the Netherlands has a higher marginal rate of tax than Ireland.  The Netherlands is the receiver of the most foreign direct investment in Europe, so there is not necessarily a correlation between marginal tax rates and foreign direct investment.  It would have higher thresholds for that margin to be ascertained but that correlation does not exist.  The arguments do not stack with regard to these types of taxes and their effects on job creation, investment and society.  That is why I ask the Minister to reappraise his position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#P00200","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Certainly we can all identify with very high levels of emigration that took place since the crisis struck in 2008.  Many people were driven out of the country.  In some years the best and the brightest left.  The reason they left was that the policies that were pursued by the Administration leading up to those years proved to be a disaster.  That is a matter of fact.  We will not get them back by producing more adverse policies but will drive more of them out.  The Deputy's proposal for a marginal tax rate for the self employed of 62% and for PAYE people of 59% would drive more people out.  The OECD has done research on this issue.  I have quoted the part which states that too high marginal tax rates will lead to migration.  There is a clearcut difference between the position of the Government and the position of Sinn F&eacute;in on these issues.  Sinn F&eacute;in is a high tax party.  It wants high tax and high expenditure.  My argument is that is the wrong economic model and we have experience of that in the past.  It would damage the economy rather than support it.  There is a general principle in economics and in taxation that if tax is raised on something the tendency is to get less of it and if tax is reduced on something the tendency is to get more of it.  The tax on work in this country is personal taxation.  If personal taxes are increased on work, there will be less employment and fewer jobs.  If personal taxation is reduced, as the Government is doing, we have proved that we will get more.  We can be criticised for many things but our success in job creation in such bad circumstances has been very good.<\/p> <p>  Let us contrast the two positions.  We imposed a property tax, I think Fianna F&aacute;il advocated it at one stage.  We put a charge on scarce resources such as water because we think people should have a water charge which restricts usage in effect.  If we have a scarce resource there should be a charge on it so that one does not let thousands of gallons of water flow down the drain.  The approach of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party is different.  Its approach is not to have a property tax, a tax on fixed assets, which cannot be moved abroad, or a tax on scarce resources, such as water, but allow it to be wasted, and at the same time it wants to put 7% on to the marginal rates of personal taxes.  These are all free choices.  <\/p> <p>  As I said to Deputy Michael McGrath earlier we are in a situation with a growing economy that there are choices.  It is no longer the case that everybody has to follow the troika mandate.  My argument with Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and the Sinn F&eacute;in approach is that they are bad choices and would damage the economy, stop the growth that is now driving forward and reduce the number of jobs that are being created, if not eliminate them completely.  That is where the alternative positions are and I presume we want to fight an election on that issue.  I am absolutely convinced that Sinn F&eacute;in policies do not pass the economic literacy test.  There is evidence everywhere that the kind of policies it is proposing are incoherent because it wants to exempt property and water from charges yet it wants to bang another 7% on top of the personal taxes.  I know the Deputy will argue it only applies to the very rich and that it will only apply to those earning more than &euro;100,000.  I have seen several times, during my 34 years in the House, that policies were introduced with a floor or a ceiling and they drift on.  The Government that has the first economic difficulty and cannot balance its budget because that will be the rule from two years onwards, one will find that the &euro;100,000 ceiling will be reduced to &euro;80,000 and to &euro;70,000 and then down to &euro;60,000.  The Sinn F&eacute;in proposal for a 59% marginal tax rate and its 62% marginal tax rate for the self employed will very quickly apply at low middle incomes and it will gunter, if that is a correct English word, the economy and the prospects of extra jobs being created. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#P00300","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I am glad the Minister has batteries in his crystal ball and can see into the future so well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#P00400","speaker":"1080"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":461,"content":"<p>That is what policy-making is about.

He is arguing against something we are not even proposing.  That shows maybe it is easier to do that than to argue our proposals.  Not to get back into the property tax, but there was a rupture between people's ability to pay tax and the value of their homes with the crash.  That rupture between the value of a home and a person's income and ability to pay mortgages and so on made it illogical to impose a property tax.  In fact the Government was taxing their debt.  Sinn F&eacute;in's view on these issues is that we want a European model economy.  One of the great lies in political discourse is that we can have a European public service delivery on a US tax system.<\/p><p>That is what the Minister is proposing.  The evidence is that 7,700 people have been on trolleys at Drogheda and Navan hospitals since the start of January.  That is an indication of the level of public provision crash we are experiencing.  It is as if the whole town of Trim - men, women and children - was forced onto trolleys in the hospitals serving that locality.  The point I am making is that we cannot have both the US-Fine Gael tax system and the European provision.  Instead, we have the public service collapse that is being seen at the moment.<\/p><p> I will conclude by responding to what the Minister said about taxation behaviour.  He will be familiar with the concept of price elasticity.  There is not necessarily a linear relationship between tax or price and behaviour.  If one asks people whether they would be happy to pay a little more tax in order to have a health service that does not involve 100 year old grandmothers having to spend five days on trolleys or children having to take painkillers for six months while they wait for dentists to look after their teeth, most of them will say they are prepared to pay an extra 7 cent if that is necessary and if they can afford it.  All this amendment is doing is asking people with big pockets to contribute 7 cent more.  It is no more and no less than that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#P00600","speaker":"1080","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":464,"content":"<p>The Deputy is using a method of debating that is often employed.

However, they are not general.  The health service, the education service and other desirable services are short of resources because the economy was destroyed.  Until very recently, the economy was no longer generating the resources needed to adequately fund such services.  The way to have proper health and education services and to expand all the services that we consider necessary is to make sure the economy continues to grow and then to use the resources of that growing economy to fund the necessary services.  If the necessary services are funded first, while putting the fiscal burden back on the economy, one will repeat the cycle and the economy will decline again.  It might even collapse again in such circumstances.  That is the problem with the Deputy's economic analysis.

The way to make things better is the way we have been doing it.  If we can get the economy growing at very strong rates, the economy will throw up resources that we can use not only to provide better services but also to reduce tax and balance the budget.  In the last budget, allocations were made to those three areas or methods of expenditure.  When we balance the budget, there will be just two areas to focus on - reducing tax and providing services.  We will see what the balance is then.  I fundamentally disagree with the policy that has been presented by Sinn F&eacute;in because I do not think it passes the economic literacy test.  I am not saying that in an offensive way.  I am suggesting that there are loads of internal contradictions to it.  Any fair analysis of Sinn F&eacute;in's proposals will find that on more than one occasion, one bit collides with another bit.  Such an approach will not achieve economic growth.  By contrast, there is a coherence in Government policy.  Our primary objective is to keep the recovery going by maintaining growth rates of more than 4% and by getting more and more people back to work.  In this country, the big differential between being in poverty and being reasonably well off is having a job.  We should do everything we possibly can to get people back to work.

There is a lack of consistency there because it has now become the only practical method of levying tax.  Strangely, that was not the Taoiseach's view a few years ago.  If we are talking about consistency, I must point out that we have been genuinely consistent, and will remain so, in saying that we think taxes on the family home, as against so-called property taxes, treat huge swathes of people unfairly.  That is the substance of our argument and it should not be mischaracterised.  The Minister's incentives are primarily directed at the wealthiest sections of society.

Approximately half of the production costs of a modern movie are incurred in Ireland, with the other half being incurred overseas in casting, finishing, cutting, production, etc.  In the initial stages of developing the Irish industry we are unlikely to get these.  A cap of &euro;70 million should be able to attract movies with total budgets of approximately &euro;150 million each.  The expectation of those who inquired is that this will be the approximate gross budget of some of the movies that might be made in Ireland, but it is difficult to be certain.  My advisers examined comparable incentives offered in other countries and they are allowed all over the place.  We are not the most generous.  Early last year the United Kingdom changed its incentives to make itself more attractive.  It offer a lower effective tax rate than our 31% and has no cap.

The current figure in relation to this relief for 2014 is &euro;72.6 million.<\/p> <p>  To date in 2015, 66 applications for the corporation tax credit were received with an estimated cost to the Exchequer of &euro;48,219,224.  Credits have been authorised to 35 projects at a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;14,635,470.  No one project has approached the current cap to date this year.  However, one project under the old scheme made a subsequent application for additional episodes under the new scheme.  This application, if made in entirety under the new scheme, would have breached the current cap.<\/p> <p>  Sometimes it is movies one is talking about.  Seemingly, that is what the industry here would like to attract.  It involves big employers, big budgets, etc.  However, a lot of the activity here is television based.

It builds up, depending on how many episodes they shoot here and if they come back to do another series.<\/p> <p>  As I say, I am a bit tentative in my answers because I am not absolutely certain of where it will head, but I am convinced that it is worth doing.

The tax will apply to petroleum profits from discoveries made under petroleum authorisations granted from June 2014.  The PPT is as a result of a Government decision of 17 June 2014 to bring into law new fiscal terms for oil and gas exploration and production.  This was recommended in the Wood MacKenzie report published at that time by this Government.<\/p> <p>  The PPT will replace the profit resource rent tax introduced in the Finance Act 2008 for new petroleum authorisations.  The overall objective of the new fiscal terms is to strengthen the taxation provisions to provide for an increased financial return to the State from future discoveries while continuing to attract the high-risk exploration investment needed to prove the potential of the Irish offshore.  The petroleum production tax will apply on a field-by-field basis.  It will be calculated on a field's net income using a rate that operates on a sliding scale between 0% and 40%.  The tax rate is determined by reference to the profit ratio of each field, which is calculated using a formula set out in the legislation.<\/p> <p>  Additionally, the new fiscal terms provide that in each year of production, where the tax payable under the profit ratio formula would be less than 5% of the annual gross revenues, a minimum tax rate of 5% of gross revenues will be charged.  The PPT will be payable in addition to the existing 25% corporation tax rate that applies to the profits from oil and gas exploration and production.<\/p><p>The tax will be payable on an annual basis, with scope for more frequent payments in light of developments in the Irish offshore.  Petroleum production tax payments will be deductible for the purposes of calculating the amount of corporation tax due.  The introduction of the PPT will increase the maximum marginal tax take on a producing field from 40% to 55%.<\/p><p> The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture report was published on 9 May 2012 and contained a total of 11 recommendations, including that there be a significant increase in the tax rate applying to profits from production of oil and gas.  The committee's report was debated in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 27 June 2012.  The debate opened in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 4 May 2013 and concluded on 9 July 2013.  During the course of the July D&aacute;il debate on the joint committee report, the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources indicated his intention to seek further independent expert advice on the fitness for purpose of Ireland's fiscal terms in advance of the launch of the 2015 Atlantic margin licensing round.  Wood Mackenzie was engaged to carry out that assignment.  In the course of its work, Wood Mackenzie received the joint committee report and met with a number of interested parties, including members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications and members of the former Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture, which produced the 2012 report.  The consultants also met representatives of the oil industry, trade unions and other participants in the debate on fiscal terms.  In addition, they conducted a substantial amount of quantitative analysis to establish the impact of current and possible future fiscal terms on a wide range of hypothetical future oil and gas field economics.<\/p><p> The results from the analysis were compared with those obtained under the fiscal terms of a peer group of countries of a similar profile to Ireland in terms of exploration.  The petroleum production tax that is being introduced in this Bill is as a result of the analysis and subsequent recommendations set out in the Wood Mackenzie report.  The joint committee report was considered by Wood Mackenzie, as I said, and specific references to that report are included in the final report from the consultants.  In particular, the Wood Mackenzie report noted that the joint Oireachtas committee's recommendation to increase the tax rate to 80% for very profitable fields might be a deterrent to incremental investment.  It noted, too, that the joint committee's recommendation to increase the existing regime's tax rate would have no impact on the State's share of revenue in the early years of production.  The Wood Mackenzie report recommended instead an arrangement whereby the State would receive a minimum annual payment of 5% of the gross revenues of a field once production has commenced.  The consultants agreed with the joint committee's recommendation that retrospective changes to fiscal and licensing terms could risk long-term reputational damage.  The Deputy will see, therefore, that the joint committee report informed the review by Wood Mackenzie.<\/p><p> The joint committee report recommended increases to the petroleum resource rent tax of 40% for small discoveries, 60% for medium discoveries and 80% for very large discoveries.  It is important to recognise that Ireland competes with other countries to attract exploration investment and the fiscal terms cannot be set in isolation from that fact.  When compared with successful island gas-producing countries, the level of exploration drilling in the Irish offshore is very low, with only 159 exploration and appraisal wells drilled since exploration began.  More than two thirds of those wells were drilled in the 1970s and 1980s.  The probability of a commercial discovery on drilling of a well is one in 32 in Ireland, compared with a probability of one in six in the United Kingdom and one in seven in Norway.  The joint Oireachtas committee's recommended rate changes would, in the case of very profitable discoveries, have seen a higher rate of tax applying in Ireland than in Norway.  It is impractical to expect Ireland to have Norwegian-style tax rates without first having Norwegian levels of commercial discovery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#Y04100","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":609,"content":"<p>We might come back to some of this on Report Stage.

Since this was done, there has not been a lot of drilling.  With energy prices having gone down so much in the past year, we probably will not see a rush to drill in deep Atlantic waters.<\/p> <p>  To give the Deputy a better insight, the number of explorations and appraisals of wells that took place between 2003 and 2013 was 17 in Ireland, 857 in the UK and 445 in Norway.  Those explorations led to no commercial discovery in Ireland, 56 discoveries in the UK and 71 in Norway.  In terms of results, therefore, we are not as fruitful as the other countries to which there is frequent reference in these discussions.  In Ireland, the probability of a discovery on drilling of a well is one in eight and the probability of a commercial discovery is one in 32.

The classification of certain workers within the construction and IT sectors is an issue that has been going on for many years.  I understand there has been a joint investigation, involving the Revenue Commission and the Department of Social Protection, on this matter and that it has identified a number of cases.  However, I believe this goes way beyond the reported 200 cases identified in the construction industry mid-year.<\/p><p>We need a report that considers what can be done.  Are amendments required to the taxation code in regard to dealing with strict anti-avoidance measures?  It is important that this is done and completed before consideration of next year's Finance Bill.  We call on the Minister to begin that work and to have it ready so that it can be discussed and teased out in ample time to ensure that we can, if necessary, amend sections of the Finance Bill to stamp out this type of activity.  This activity brings a loss to the State and Revenue, but it is also an issue of workers' rights in that these workers are not afforded the type of protections employees are entitled to.  The bumping up of profits of many of these companies is also at the core of this activity.  Some people enter into this classification voluntarily, while others only do so because it is the only way they can get a job.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to consider these amendments favourably and to have some type of analysis done that can be published and teased out. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#BB00800","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":645,"content":"<p>With the Chairman's permission I propose to address amendments Nos. 40 and 41 together.<\/p> <p>  The issues raised by the Deputy reflect legitimate concerns surrounding employment law which can extend beyond both the construction and the IT sectors.  The employment market has become increasingly complex in recent years, to the point that there are many variations on how people are engaged by end users.  For example, the use of intermediary type structures to provide labour has become quite prevalent across a number of sectors.  This is particularly so in the IT, pharmachem and airline industries, although it also features in the media and construction sectors.  While the use of intermediary companies is generally not a predominant feature in the construction sector, significant taxation risks attaching to this sector necessitated the introduction of the RCT system which in recent times has moved to an electronic platform, eRCT. <\/p> <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the construction sector is an acknowledged area of high risk internationally and in Ireland it is no different.  The scale of the activity carried out within the sector also contributes to a high risk rating.  Based on real time data that is available to Revenue from the electronic relevant contracts tax system, in 2014 approximately 320,000 contracts to the value of &euro;29 billion were reported by contractors, along with payment notifications of roughly &euro;10.1 billion. <\/p> <p>  There are a number of risks associated with construction contracts and Revenue is continually monitoring developments to ensure that the compliance programmes are tailored to meet evolving risk areas.  This process is aided by the data Revenue gets through the eRCT system as well as its risk evaluation analysis and profiling, REAP, system and other data sources.  <\/p> <p>  Revenue conducts the full range of interventions to combat tax evasion in the sector.  This includes risk management interventions, Revenue audits and investigations as well as site visits.  The outcome of Revenue's work includes recovering unpaid tax, including PAYE tax from employers who failed to operate the PAYE system on payments made, the payment of interest on late payment and the pursuit of penalties for failure to notify Revenue, through the eRCT system, of contracts entered into and payments made under these contracts.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that concern has been expressed that the eRCT system promotes the use of bogus self-employed situations.  As with any contract of engagement in the construction sector, whether a person is engaged as an employee or as a self-employed contractor is determined by the facts and evidence of each case and guidance on that matter is provided in the code of practice for determining employment or self-employment status of Individuals, which was prepared jointly by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, business representative bodies and relevant State agencies. <\/p> <p>  It is important to point out the eRCT system is a tax deduction at source system and it does not determine whether a person in the construction sector, or indeed in any other sector, is an employee or a self-employed contractor.  Under the eRCT system, on receipt of details of relevant contracts that are notified to Revenue in real time by principal contractors, Revenue immediately informs the relevant sub-contractors of those details.  If any of the details notified to the sub-contractor are incorrect , or if the sub-contractor is of the view that he or she is not in fact a sub-contractor, then he or she can notify Revenue of those facts.  A sub-contractor is fully entitled to clarify with the Revenue Commissioners any matters he or she unsure about and, if in the course of this, the Revenue Commissioners form the view that a contract is in fact a contract of employment rather than a contract for a self-employed contractor, they will take such action as they deem appropriate to ensure that PAYE is operated. <\/p> <p>  For other sectors, such as the IT sector highlighted by the Deputy, where there is the use of intermediary type structures, these typically take the form of a personal services company, frequently with only one worker or, alternatively, a managed service company, which is generally structured with at least six unconnected shareholders. <\/p> <p>  In some instances, the driver behind the use of intermediary type structures is the individual who has chosen to establish a corporate structure.<\/p><p>However, many cases have come to light where it appears that end-users are insisting that if an individual wishes to be engaged by an end-user, he or she must establish a personal services company or be engaged via a managed service company.  Intermediary type structures can pose a risk to the Exchequer in terms of different outcomes in respect of: employer's and employee's PRSI; indefinite deferral of the payment of part or all of the remuneration with a consequent deferral of payment of the associated tax and USC; payment of unwarranted tax-free expenses, different pension planning opportunities; and different tax planning opportunities.  A consequence of the use of intermediary-type structures is that two individuals who perform the same services for an end-user could have different tax outcomes and different entitlements to social insurance benefits.<\/p><p> It must be recognised that the type of arrangements to which I refer may not be driven solely by tax considerations.  From the end-user's point of view, there can be clear advantages in ensuring that individuals are not engaged as employees.  A feature of these arrangements is that employer's PRSI is avoided.  The consequences for the individuals who provides labour include the loss of rights to holiday pay, sick pay, maternity pay and employer pension contributions.  In addition, they lose rights under employment protection legislation such as those relating to maternity and parental leave and unfair dismissal.<\/p><p> Due to the complex nature of the issues involved, my officials have been working on preparing a public consultation process and I understand a submission seeking my approval to proceed will reach me shortly.  Such a process would allow all interested parties to feed into a broad-ranging consideration of the issues involved.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept these amendments.

The scheme focuses on the construction and refurbishment of buildings and structures to be used for the maintenance, repair and overhaul of commercial aircraft and the dismantling of such aircraft for the purposes of salvaging or recycling parts or materials.  The relief, which provides for a seven year write-off of this capital expenditure, will operate for five years and is subject to all the normal rules for capital allowances.<\/p><p>The first amendment is to section 268 of the Taxes Consolidation Act and is to restrict the amount of tax relief available so that the aid granted per project does not reach the <i>de minimis<\/i>limits set by the European Commission.  The <i>de minimis<\/i>guidelines stipulate that the aid granted must not exceed the &euro;200,000 limit over any three consecutive financial years.  In order to ensure this level of aid is not breached, I have imposed a cap on the amount of expenditure that can qualify for tax relief at the accelerated rate provided for under the scheme.  In the case of a company, this equates to overall construction expenditure of &euro;5 million.  In the case of an individual, the limit is &euro;1.25 million of relevant expenditure.  Restrictions regarding the location of qualifying airports that were inherent in the regional aid guidelines are also removed.  All airports in the State will now be in a position to avail of the scheme.  <\/p><p>The second amendment is to section 272 of the Taxes Consolidation Act.  Subsection (3)(k) is amended to reflect that during the first five years of the qualifying period capital expenditure that is subject to the <i>de minimis<\/i>limits, known as special capital expenditure in the amendment, will qualify for capital allowances at the accelerated rate, which is 15% over six years and 10% in the final year.  All capital expenditure in excess of that limit will qualify for capital allowances at the normal rate of 4% over 25 years as will capital expenditure incurred after the five year qualifying period.  Subsection (4)(k) is also amended and outlines the period within which the allowances can be transferred to a subsequent purchaser.  <\/p><p>The third amendment is a technical amendment to section 274 of the Taxes Consolidation Act which outlines the period within which a balancing adjustment can apply.  <\/p><p>The fourth amendment includes the relief in the high earners' restriction under Schedule 25B of the Taxes Consolidation Act. <\/p><p>The final two amendments relate to section 31 of the Finance Act 2013 and section 33 of the Finance Act 2014.  Section 31 of the Finance Act 2013 introduced the scheme of accelerated capital allowances and section 33 of the Finance Act 2014 subsequently amended the scheme.  These sections have now taken effect as and from 13 October 2015 by means of the financial resolution taken on budget night.  <\/p><p>The sections were initially sought by the Shannon enablers group to assist with the development of Shannon Airport as a commercial centre for operations such as those described in the sections.  Subsequently it was extended to all airports.  There is a potential for significant job creation in the aviation sector in Ireland.  By providing for this targeted incentive I hope to encourage the establishment of the necessary infrastructure to allow us to attract significant maintenance, repair, overhaul and dismantling activities to Ireland.  This would foster the development of centres of excellence within this engineering sector which we can build on from the perspective of job creation in the future.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#DD00800","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":673,"content":"<p>The scheme was envisaged originally under the Finance Act 2013 but never materialised as a result of rules on state aid.

State aid rules come into play where one sector or a part of one sector is treated more favourably than another for one reason or another.

After the will of the Oireachtas is identified, one goes to the Commission to examine its attitude to the policy.  Of course one tries to tailor it in a way that is in accordance with state aid guidelines.  The Commission needs to examine the legislation before it will consider it.  The sequence is to decide the policy, draft the legislation and then submit it to Europe.  The Commission can be quite slow because it has lots of applications from different parts of the Union.

Is this an issue that concerns the Minister and is it something he is willing to examine?  Could we examine and report on this issue?  A huge amount of losses are available to these two financial institutions, which are profitable at this point in time, to offset against profits for tax purposes in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#EE01000","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":690,"content":"<p>Section 396(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 entitles companies to carry forward losses incurred in a trade for an accounting period for offset against income of the same trade for succeeding accounting periods.  A restriction on losses was previously in place which limited the amount of prior-year losses that a NAMA-participating institution could offset against trading profits to 50% of trading profit for each accounting period.  This restriction was introduced under the NAMA Act 2009, whereby a new section, section 396C, was inserted into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.<\/p> <p>  In the lead-up to the introduction of the new capital rules on 1 January 2014 under the capital requirements directive known as CRD IV, and at a time when the State owned 99.8% of AIB and 15% of Bank of Ireland, section 396C no longer served its original purpose and, indeed, was actually working against the State&rsquo;s investment in the banks.  Accordingly, in section 33 of the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2013, I decided it was appropriate to remove the restriction on relief for losses in participating institutions with effect from accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.  The Deputy will recall that we had a lengthy debate on the issue during Committee Stage of the Bill.  While the profitability position of the banks may have changed since then, the merits of allowing the banks to utilise their losses still stand.  The benefits to the State of allowing banks to utilise their losses include improvement in capital ratios under the new capital standards.  Under the new rules, deferred tax assets are to be fully deducted from capital over a phased ten-year horizon.  The utilisation of deferred tax assets reduces their value on the banks&rsquo; balance sheets and hence the deduction from capital becomes less important.  The carrying value of deferred tax assets at AIB and BOI represent approximately 27% and 15% of shareholders&rsquo; funds respectively.  This is a much larger percentage than most other European banks.  As such, our banks are more affected by the new capital rules than others.<\/p> <p>  Improving the existing value of the State&rsquo;s equity and debt investments is another advantage.  With many investors valuing banks off the new more stringent capital rules, or what the markets call a fully loaded basis - that is, capital calculated with all the new CRD IV rules taken on board today rather than phased in over time - it stands to reason that if their capital levels benefit from the ability to utilise losses then the value of the bank&rsquo;s equity and debt instruments will too. <\/p> <p>  A third benefit is that the risk to the State, as backstop provider of capital, is also reduced.  While the utilisation of losses may result in some banks not paying corporation tax, I introduced a financial institutions levy in 2013 which brings in approximately &euro;150 million per annum for the period 2014 to 2016.  As part of budget 2016, I announced my proposals to extend this levy to 2021, subject to a review of the methodology used to calculate the levy.  This measure will bring in an additional &euro;750 million over the period, which is a very significant additional contribution to the Exchequer.<\/p> <p>  As a consequence of those points, I will not be accepting the proposed amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#EE01100","speaker":"955"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":691,"content":"<p>I will press the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12015111700002#EE01200","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speech","time":1447776000,"counter":692,"content":"<p>In accordance with the Order of the D&aacute;il of 12 November 2015, the division is postponed until completion of the proceedings on the matters to be dealt with in this session.<\/p> <p>  As the proceedings on sections 20 to 26, inclusive, have been completed, the postponed division on amendment No. 42 will now be taken.
