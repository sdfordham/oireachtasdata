I thank the Chairperson for the opportunity to appear before the committee.  I will discuss those three issues within the broader context of how the economy is doing.  I will also speak about the budget.<\/p> <p>  The most recent national accounts were published at the end of last week.  The headline figures are that there has been real GDP growth of 5.5% in the first half of 2017.  Every sector grew on an annual basis in both the first and second quarter with the exception of financial and insurance activities.  The construction sector expanded by a fifth in the first half of 2017 compared to the same period last year.  Our forecasts are now for GDP to increase by between 4.5% and 5% in 2017.  Perhaps more interesting that GDP is the new measure of modified domestic demand which the Central Statistics Office, CSO, have developed.  It gives a more accurate measure of activity in the domestic economy by stripping out intellectual property investment and purchases of aircraft by leasing firms.<\/p><p>Modified domestic demand grew by 2.4% in the first half of this year, which is slightly below what my expectations were, given how strong employment growth has been.  The relatively strong growth should continue into 2018 as, in our view, the economy continues to approach its potential and, on the back of this, unemployment should fall below 6%.  Employment growth should continue at a strong pace in 2018.  Clearly, the outlook for 2019 is much more uncertain, not least because of Brexit, but also because of other factors such as the potential for interest rate increases by the European Central Bank, which would dampen domestic demand in the Irish economy.<br\/><br\/>The public finances are improving.  The general Government deficit will be close to zero in 2018 and 2019 on current forecasts, but it must be borne in mind that the gross debt level remains elevated and is greater than 100% if expressed in the new GNI* metric, though that metric is itself problematic.  Our view - and this is currently one of the debates between some of the institutions such as the OECD, the ESRI and others - is that there is limited evidence of overheating in the economy.  Total employment and the employment rate are still below pre-crisis peaks.  The employment rate is indeed below the EU average, despite the assumption that the Irish economy is rocketing along and doing really well.  It is doing really well compared with how it was doing, but its employment rate is below the EU average and significantly below the top performers such as Sweden.  The unemployment rate is also still relatively high; it is higher than in such countries as Germany, the UK and the US.  The recent growth in consumption that we saw in 2016 follows almost a decade of stagnation and therefore partially reflects a working through of pent-up demand.  At the same time, consumer price inflation is only 0.4%, while average hourly earnings are growing at just 1.6% year on year, again after years of stagnation.  Underlying investment is admittedly growing strongly but is doing so from a very low base, while consumer credit is less than half its 2009 peak.<br\/><br\/>Some of the more traditional metrics used to attempt to understand whether an economy is overheating include the current account balance.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to measure the real current account balance at present.  Technically, it is in surplus.  The current account*, which is the new metric, is in deficit but there is a lot going in and out of that which perhaps does not reflect the real economy and its sustainability.<br\/><br\/>Property prices are growing very quickly but, again, are less than three quarters of their peak value, and the recent price growth should be understood as essentially a market failure in the housing market, with supply running well below projected long-run demand, something that is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.<br\/><br\/>The committee invited me to comment on income taxation, labour market participation and demographics.  Regarding income taxation, according to OECD data, the total employee tax wedge - that is, income tax, USC and employee PRSI - for a single person as a percentage of gross wage earnings is 19.2%.  This is the lowest in the EU 15 and less than half that of Belgium and Germany.  It is also lower than that of the United States.  Ireland is also the lowest tax country if we compare the same person's tax wedge as a percentage of total labour costs.  This would include employer PRSI.  If we compare <i>per capita<\/i>receipts from taxes on labour in Ireland with <i>per capita<\/i>receipts in the other high-income EU countries - I am talking again about income tax, USC and PRSI - we find that receipts in Ireland are almost &euro;2,000 lower.  It is the low level of social contributions, namely, PRSI, that really explains this difference.  The OECD also compares earnings from 50% to 250% of average incomes for a range of family types and finds that Ireland is a consistently low-tax jurisdiction.  The graphs I have provided in the supplementary materials show that labour taxation in Ireland is very progressive.  However, given the high level of gross income inequality - that is, market income inequality - in Ireland, this is only sufficient to move Ireland to the middle of the EU pack in terms of net income inequality.  If we were to reduce that progressivity, we would become one of the more unequal countries.  Finally, this progressivity is mainly attributable to the structure of the income tax.  The USC is only modestly progressive, although it does have the advantage of being immune to almost all tax expenditures, most of which are regressive in nature.  Pension tax relief, for example, tends to accrue to the top 20% of earners.<br\/><br\/>Regarding labour force participation and demographics, the most recent cross-country data from the OECD, which is for 2015, shows that Ireland had a labour force participation rate of 70.1% for persons aged 15 to 64.<\/p><p>This was below the EU average of 72.7% and significantly below the UK&rsquo;s 77.6%.  Ireland is more than 11 percentage points below Sweden and 17 percentage points below Iceland.<br\/><br\/>One notable barrier to labour force participation in Ireland is the extremely high cost of child care.  This is particularly relevant in the case of second earners and lone parents and mainly effects female labour force participation.  The implication for budget 2019 and beyond is clear.  It is necessary to increase State spending on child care subsidies and to reduce the cost of child care.  Budget 2018 was a very important start, but we are still far from best practice in terms of the quantum of State supports for child care.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has very favourable demographics compared with most other advanced economies.  Our working age ratio of 65.2% is broadly in line with that of the EU as a whole.  The important difference is that we have a much larger young person ratio than the EU and a much smaller elderly population.  This means the Irish economy has a higher growth potential than that of the EU, which is very positive.  On the other hand, Ireland&rsquo;s relatively small elderly population, which at 12% is just two thirds of the EU average of 18%, makes our long-run fiscal position appear stronger than it really is.  This position will deteriorate over time as the population ages.  Elderly people require additional spending on health and social protection and are generally out of the workforce.  Finally, our fertility rate of 1.9 is well above the EU average of 1.5.  This is positive in terms of long-term economic growth.  However, this fertility rate also implies deteriorating demographics over time in the absence of inward migration, as 2.1 is the replacement rate.<br\/><br\/>In respect of fiscal policy, the remaining fiscal space available is less than &euro;500 million in 2018.  This is concerning given the severity of the housing crisis and the evident need for additional State support in this area.  In addition, our analysis shows that Ireland underspends on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis compared with other high-income EU countries - those with a GDP <i>per capita <\/i>of &euro;30,000 or more - in a number of areas.  Notably, we estimate that the State underspends in a number of areas fundamental to long-run economic growth, specifically education, infrastructure and research and development, where the cumulative underspend is in the order of &euro;2.5 billion to &euro;3 billion.  There is a particularly large underspend on primary education, especially in the area of ancillary supports, and on tertiary education.  In this context we argue that long-run economic growth, employment and equity goals can best be achieved by prioritising use of the available fiscal space to increase public capital investment levels, increase spending on education, and increase direct spending and subsidies for research and development.  Here, we are going beyond budget 2018 and talking about the period to 2021.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, measured on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis, combined taxes and social contributions in Ireland are significantly lower than in comparator high-income EU countries.  Taxes and social contributions are combined by the OECD because they are compulsory payments.  The OECD sees social contributions as taxes in effect.  Ireland is particularly low when it comes to taxing stocks of capital, for example, property taxes, inheritance tax or wealth tax, and when it comes to social contributions from employers.  Overall, there is no evidence that the Irish tax system is onerous compared with other high-income European states.  In light of this, and in the context of substantial areas of underspend, the case for further tax cuts is extremely weak.  Indeed there is a strong argument for increasing taxes in certain areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McDonnell.

Our view is that it is a start.  State spending on child care is well below what it would be in the Nordic countries.<\/p><p>In the countries that have such high labour force participation rates, particularly for women, second earners and lone parents, the barriers for entering the labour force and staying in the labour force are much lower.  I view that as year one and we gradually ramp that up over time.

One should consider moving it to being something akin to primary school teachers, who are salaried over a year and it can be a genuine profession, leading to a higher quality workforce in the long run.  To give the best bang for buck, the best returns economically are in within education.  Within education, the best bang for buck is the earlier the better.  Therefore, pre-primary care and pre-primary education are extremely important for the development of human capital.  It is a terrible phrase, but it is one used in the economics literature.  The biggest barrier to human capital, of course, is poverty, but early childhood care and education are also extremely important.  In our view, that should almost be top of the priority list for budget 2019 and beyond.<\/p><p> The marginal tax rate kicks in at quite a low rate when compared internationally.  However, the effective tax rate for someone on average earnings is well below what it is elsewhere - the graphs are included in the supplementary materials.  Comparing personal average tax rates and labour income for a single earner, for example, we are below the EU 15 all the way up to 250%, which is as far as the OECD does it.

There is also a table entitled, \"Comparison: Income Tax plus Employee Social Security Contributions in 2016 as a Percentage of Gross Wage Earnings\", which looks at the single personal average earnings for Ireland, the other EU 15 countries, the United States and the OECD as a whole.  The total payment is 19.2% according to the OECD, which is the lowest in the EU 15.  For example, the United Kingdom has 23.3%.  The EU 15 average is over 30%.  Even countries like the United States have a higher level of tax.  It is simply not factually correct to say there is an onerous burden on the average earner.  The reason for that is the system of tax credits, which keeps the effective tax rate really low.  Even though the marginal rate kicks in quite early, the effective tax rate that people are actually paying is quite low for most of the distribution.  The tax wedge as a percentage of labour costs is lower again because employer PRSI is so low in Ireland compared with comparator countries.  It is important to bear that in mind.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has issues relating to costs.  We have high costs in a number of areas such as child care, rent, groceries and so on.

I could go through the list of such taxes, including VAT on the consumption of goods, parking charges, high bus fares and the cost of rent.  Many people believe property tax is a regressive charge because it does not take income into account.  Does Dr. McDonnell accept that people are right to resist things like property tax?

The easiest question to answer is the one about fiscal space.  I agree that it is miserable.  It is not nearly sufficient to deal with all the problems that will arise over the next year.  Part of the problem with the fiscal space is that the Commission's methodology for calculating it - which is bunkum, as any serious economist knows - is reducing it by over &euro;1 billion in the context of next month's budget.  The Commission's view is that we have been overheating ever since we had an unemployment rate of 10.3%.  Its model is not designed for Ireland at all.  It is essentially taking some of our fiscal space away from us.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked me to be specific about the taxes I am proposing.  He spoke about different property taxes and the range of hidden charges.  His point about the range of hidden taxes and charges is absolutely correct.  The taxes that people rarely notice are VAT and excise duty.  Maybe people notice excise duty when they see how much cheaper certain things are in other countries.  Ireland over-taxes, and is a high-tax country, in the area of consumption taxes.  On average, such taxes are higher in Ireland, on a per-person basis, than they are in the other ten high-income countries.  This point does not necessarily apply to VAT, but is particularly relevant to excise duty.  Our excise rates are extremely high by comparison with other countries.  We have a range of regressive charges.  The television licence is a flat charge.  That is the most regressive structure one can have.  It is probably our most regressive tax or charge.  Everyone has to pay it, in effect.<\/p> <p>  It is true that the property tax is not progressive in the same way as income tax or the USC.  I believe this conclusion was reached in research from the ESRI.<\/p><p>It is a tax on an asset, not necessarily a wealth tax <i>per se<\/i>, and it has certain problematic elements such as where a person with a very low income pays a high level of property tax.  The best way to deal with such situations is to provide relief by way of a charge on the property which would only become due on sale or transfer.  It would accrue over time and, when it is being inherited or sold, the State would get what is owed to it first.  Over a lifetime, the State would get the same amount of property tax but it would not cause hardship issues for low-income households.The determination of what hardship was could be left to a democratic decision but I have not carried out any research into that point.<br\/><br\/>The Nevin Institute has published papers on a financial transaction tax, FTT, and on a wealth tax.  A wealth tax on all assets over &euro;1 million, without reliefs, would generate a yield of around &euro;0.3 billion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Is that at 1%?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#H00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Yes.  It does not sound like a lot but the current long-term return on capital is approximately 4%, meaning it is tax of 25% of that amount.  It would only affect the top 1% or 2% of households.  A wealth tax operates from a different base from income tax and wealth inequality is much more pronounced.  Many economists take the view that the best way to deal with intergenerational wealth inequality is inheritance and gift tax, which we call capital acquisitions tax.  We tax the person who gets the money rather than the inheritance itself and that is a better system than the one in the UK.  The problem is the system of reliefs is so inordinately generous for particular types of assets that many people can have an inheritance worth millions without paying a penny in tax.<\/p> <p>  I was asked whether I could be specific about the different types of taxes.  I stated that we have an overall revenue problem and we are not so much a low-tax country as a low-revenue country.  The big difference is social security contributions, which in Ireland are PRSI.  Employer PRSI makes up 80% of the gap to the high-income EU average and that is the elephant in the room.  It is often called a social wage because in many countries it goes towards benefits for workers.  If the benefits went towards something such as child care subsidies it would be for the benefit of employers in the long run, as it would increase the size of the labour force.  If it went to the retraining and upskilling of workers it would lead to a more productive workforce.  Child care subsidies also lead to a more productive workforce by keeping women in the workforce and, as we know, women are more educated than men.  Moreover, when they fall out of the workforce they often never fully come back.<\/p> <p>  Genuine reform will be necessary in regard to the sufficiency of revenue as there is a pensions time bomb, health care is going to increase year on year and we have an infrastructure deficit, which has been well flagged and of which the committee is cognisant.  Our research and development deficit, compared to the top performers, is &euro;0.5 billion per year.  The literature on economics suggests one has to have a functioning innovation system to develop top companies but we ignore that completely and our spending is two thirds of that in Sweden and elsewhere.  Such countries have the idea of the \"entrepreneurial state\" but we do not have that.<\/p><p>We discuss increasing employer PRSI and the property tax - there can be other types of property tax, for example, on stocks &ndash; and perhaps reducing consumption taxes.  We are not just about increasing taxes - the distributive impact is important; for example, taxes on pollutants could be increased and used to subsidise renewable energies - but also about reforming the taxation and revenue systems and public spending to bring us into line with the best performing countries in the world in terms of policy.  We are a long way off that.  In our summer and autumn quarterlies and some of our working papers, we have tried to show what those countries do and describe what needs to be done to get us there.<\/p><p> The fiscal space is extremely small this year, but we view this as a five-to-ten-year issue and beyond.  Improvements can be made year on year.  Unfortunately, we cannot solve everything in one year, but at least we can make a start.

Should we not leave the choice as to how that human capital is developed to parents?<\/p> <p>  I agree with Dr. McDonnell, in that this is some of the most important and valuable work that we are doing, but there is a slight dichotomy.  On one hand, Dr. McDonnell is saying that child care is too expensive, which is the case for many people.  On the other hand, he is saying that this is the most important work that anyone can do and we should be paying child care workers the same that we pay primary school teachers.  If Dr. McDonnell does not have the figures, he can revert to me with them, but what is the average pay of a child care worker and what is the average hourly pay of a primary school teacher?  If we are to value this work and increase the pay of child care workers to that of primary school teachers, what would it cost and how would we afford it?  I am fully supportive of that idea.<\/p> <p>  How would Dr. McDonnell have voted in Dublin City Council last night if he had had a call on increasing the property tax?  It was a \"Yes\" or \"No\" vote, so I would love if he could give me a \"Yes\" or \"No\" response.<\/p> <p>  The ESRI appeared before us and, interestingly, pushed for a switch to a site value tax.

If we are talking about human capital, the single most important thing we can do is prevent childhood poverty.  That means family income supports and other supports.

I see no reason the two could not be combined or blended without necessarily being merged completely.  The classic idea from the 19th century was, of course, the land tax from Henry George.  The economics literature is clear that all of those taxes are extremely positive in terms of the economic benefits, particularly compared with some other taxes.  They are not necessarily progressive because they are not based on income.  When taxes are based on wealth, they generally are progressive.  The site valuation tax has the advantage of not necessarily disincentivising development.  On the other hand, the property tax perhaps reflects the real value and may be more progressive in terms of its actual effect.  Personally, I think both taxes are good ideas.  One would not necessarily have both of them in place.  To get rid of a property tax and replace it with a site valuation tax would, I suspect, be politically very difficult.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McDonnell and invite Mr. Berney to read his opening statement, after which the remaining members can ask questions of both witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#K00500","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting us here today.  While the statement we submitted to the committee touches on the issues we were asked to address, members will notice that it contains no reference to the Lansdowne Road agreement or the proposal for a new public sector pay agreement.  There is a very good reason for that.  As politicians, the committee members will appreciate that the trade union movement is a democratic organisation and the process of approving the public sector pay agreement only concluded earlier this week.  It would have been premature for us to include comments on the agreement in our submission prior to it having been accepted by our affiliate organisations.  It was accepted by a large majority of the public services committee on Monday.  In accepting the agreement, the public services committee of ICTU notes that there are still some issues that are hangovers from the crisis era and that there are matters to be addressed around the issue of public pay.<\/p><p>Most notable in this regard is the question of new entrant pay and pay equalisation.  The headlines have focused on teachers, but there are new entrant pay scales in all parts of the public service and there is still pay inequality in many parts of the public service.  We should focus on trying to eliminate this over the coming period.  There is also, of course, the question of retention and recruitment in critical areas of the public service which need to be addressed as part of the public service pay agreement.  However, the agreement has been accepted by a large majority of the public services committee and we are looking forward now to implementing the agreement and making sure that the issues to which I have just referred are addressed within that context because they are very important issues.<br\/><br\/>My remaining remarks are really in the context of the pre-budget submission that Congress has produced.  I understand that all Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Senators, as well as councillors, have received a copy of our pre-budget submission, so my comments are made within that context.  From our perspective, people deserve to see an inclusive, equality-proofed budget that places the welfare and betterment of the majority at its very core.  We have a responsibility to make sure budget 2018 is the first in a series of transformative budgets that will prioritise higher living standards and quality of life underpinned by a programme of investment in infrastructure and improvement to services.  For budget 2018, Congress has three key priorities.  We must begin the process of tackling the housing and homelessness crisis.  That must be our absolute priority.  We must end the reduced VAT rate for the tourism sector, which has cost some &euro;2.2 billion in lost revenue to date, and invest in public services such as education, health and child care in order to lower living costs.  I will come back in a moment to the question Deputy Ryan asked earlier about the cost of privately provided child care as opposed to pay for teachers and so on.<br\/><br\/>On the question of housing and homelessness, failure to tackle the housing crisis properly in budget 2018 would see Ireland pay a high price in terms of future social cohesion, damage to future growth prospects and increased living costs for working people.  Although housing and homelessness are acute problems in themselves, they are very much labour market problems as well because they inhibit people's participation rates in the labour force if they do not have access to affordable housing.  Congress proposes that local authorities across the country take the lead in the provision of social housing as the only long-term sustainable response to the crisis.  Unfortunately, we abandoned the housing market to private developers and let profit become the key driver of housing provision.  However, the market has failed and, as classical economics tells us that government must step in in the case of market failure, the Government must now step in and declare a national housing emergency and act accordingly.  Local authorities, as we said, should take the lead in a major house-building programme with funding of at least &euro;1 billion from Government, providing at least 10,000 social housing units a year by late 2018.  Given this is an emergency, compulsory purchase orders must be utilised as a matter of urgency - there has been conjecture around the constitutionality of that, but we do not believe the Constitution is an impediment - to ensure available serviced land is put to good use, while the introduction of the vacant site levy should be brought forward from January 2019.  We simply cannot afford a return to the developer-led and developer-shaped policies of previous years, despite recent attempts from the private sector to extract more tax breaks and subsidies in order to build houses.  I notice Deputy Ryan said that IBEC was here yesterday.  There is a subgroup of IBEC that represents property developers.  If the committee reads its pre-budget submission, it will be shocked to see what it is seeking.  Essentially, it wants a tax-free environment.  If that were to be the approach to incentivising developers, it would make the situation far worse.  We question the value of the help-to-buy scheme and think that money would be far better used by giving the funding to local authorities for housing construction.  In the short and medium term, thousands of lives and life chances are being damaged beyond repair by the housing crisis.  This itself is cause enough to act.  However, the crisis will also discourage inward investment, drive up living costs for working people and have an adverse impact on the labour market.  Budget 2018 is an opportunity to deliver a game-changer on this critical issue.<br\/><br\/>One of the issues we were asked to talk about is the tourism sector's VAT subsidy.  Congress continues to argue for an end to the special reduced rate of VAT enjoyed by the hospitality and tourism sector.  This is a <i>de facto<\/i>subsidy that has already cost the State &euro;2.2 billion in taxes forgone.<\/p><p>There is no justification for this ongoing subsidy to a highly profitable and predominantly low wage sector.  This is a sector that refuses to participate in the joint labour committee system the Government has established for wage setting in sectors.  It refuses to participate in the process.<\/p><p> There is no evidence of any significant new job creation or that the consumer has benefited in any way.  ICTU regards the subsidy as being used simply to take profits.  There is no other use for it that we can see.  In fact all the evidence suggests that the reduced rate operates as a subsidy to very profitable corporations, which is a waste of valuable resources when set against areas of obvious need such as homelessness.  Ending this unjustified and wasteful subsidy will create additional fiscal space which can then be used for much more urgent priorities in education, child care and infrastructure.<\/p><p> A question was asked earlier about where we can get new taxes.  In the last table of our pre-budget submission, congress has set out where new taxes can be raised.  This is one of the places where a significant amount of money could be raised without any real risk.<\/p><p> We want to emphasise the importance of investment.  Workers deserve a much improved social wage paid for through general taxation or social insurance.  Congress is calling for additional investment in public services, including education, health and child care, in a bid to lower living costs and to boost a social wage for working people.  We know that Brexit carries huge risks for the Irish economy.  The best way to respond to Brexit and other threats to our collective prosperity is to invest in the things we need.  We need to invest in skills to retrain and upskill workers especially in sectors most vulnerable to Brexit and to climate change.  Deputy Ryan and others are aware of the need to invest in adjustment transition for workers who are affected by vulnerable industries with regard to Ireland's climate change obligations.  We need to invest in infrastructure such as public and other transport hubs to meet the challenge of diversifying trade flows.  Investment is also needed in the areas of research, innovation, marketing and organisational capacity to develop new products and services and locate new markets and alliances.  We also need to invest in core economic and social infrastructure to help make Ireland a country with high levels of well-being, equality and economic efficiency.<\/p><p> Plans for tax cuts in the budget should be abandoned.  Ireland has massive infrastructure deficits in housing, transport, broadband, renewable energy and water treatment that require immediate attention.  Such investments must take priority over tax cuts.<\/p><p> Public capital investment should be doubled over the next three years and the rainy day fund should be used now rather than later to address vital areas of infrastructure deficit.  Ireland has a young and growing population, and bottlenecks will only get worse if we fail to invest now.<\/p><p> The trade union movement stands in solidarity with the most vulnerable people in society, including pensioners, young people and others who are dependent on social welfare, income support and social transfers.  Social welfare payments should be restored by more than the expected cost of living increases in 2018.  I am happy to take any questions from members on the congress pre-budget submission and I have brought spare copies with me if the committee needs them.<\/p><p> Deputy Ryan asked about the wages of child care workers in the private sector and those of a primary teacher.  I cannot be absolutely certain as I do not have exact figures, but I will find them for the Deputy.  Congress published a paper on this issue not too long ago.  From memory, child care workers in the private sector earn, on average, between &euro;12 and &euro;15 per hour.  A primary school teacher would earn somewhere between &euro;25 and &euro;30 per hour, as far as I am aware.  The question is that the policy direction has decided to subsidise private child care provision.  Money is given to private child care providers, yet there has been no examination of the possibility of providing child care services within the State sector.  In Scandinavian countries, for instance, children go to primary school much earlier than children in Ireland.  They go into a different setting than a classroom where child care is provided and there is an educational dimension within that setting.  There is no reason at all why, with a small infrastructural spend, Ireland could not produce child care settings in the public sector in primary schools.  This would not be for the purpose of sending children to school.  Obviously their early developmental education would be much different from that which they would encounter when they attend primary school.  Directly intervening in the sector with public sector child care provision is one way of dealing with a problem that has been completely ignored and not given proper consideration in this State, as far as I can see.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Berney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Berney.

I thank Mr. Berney for his comments and I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for his resistance.<\/p> <p>  I shall make a couple of responses.  Budgetary oversight is interesting; we met representatives of IBEC yesterday and have listened to different participants.  The meetings have left me with a strong sense of the challenges that politicians face in terms of making decisions because everyone has made valid arguments with some interesting contrasts.  First, ICTU made a presentation and mentioned the abolition of the VAT rate.  Last Monday, Fianna F&aacute;il held a party think-in at which Professor Alan Ahearne made a presentation.  He made the point that the abolition of the VAT rate would double or increase it by 50%.  The difficulty with removing a tax is one might have to re-impose it.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Berney about the questionable treatment of workers.  However, I disagree with his belief that increasing the VAT rate and returning it to its original rate would more than likely be passed on to consumers when they go out for a bite to eat or stay in hotels.  I would like to hear his response to that.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Berney when he said: \"Local authorities should take the lead in a major housebuilding programme with funding of at least &euro;1 billion from government, providing at least 10,000 social housing units a year by late 2018.\"  Does he live in the real world?  I would love to see such a development.  My own local authority of South Dublin County Council will complete ten social houses this year.  Therefore, ICTU's request is unrealistic.  I wish it were realistic.  I am disappointed with ICTU making such a generalisation.  I would like to have seen something more concrete, please pardon the pun, in terms of ways to deal effectively with the housing crisis.  The figure is totally impractical.  I wish I could wave a magic wand and provide 10,000 social housing units by the end of next year.  The figure produced by ICTU is unrealistic and I am disappointed with the organisation.  <\/p> <p>  One of my colleagues has suggested that close to &euro;1 billion for the housing assistance payment, HAP, has been provided in the budget.  That is a huge payment but it is one of the prices that we must pay.  <\/p> <p>  Neither of the witnesses has said anything about the vulnerable middle classes.  Dr. McDonnell mentioned USC cuts.  I represent the constituency of Dublin South-West.  It represents a good microcosm of the country because it has middle class, working class, working-middle class people and people who are seriously disadvantaged.  The constituency also has a really struggling middle class for whom September is the new Christmas in terms of child care costs and back to school allowances.  They are the people who budget from month to month.  If there is an unexpected cost in a month, let us say the car, fridge or washing machine breaks down and needs a part that has not been budgeted for, these people are thrown into a financial crisis.  Therefore, a targeted tax reduction such as the USC would be welcome.<\/p> <p>  There is a lack of appreciation for people who must budget on a monthly basis.  Recently I tabled parliamentary questions on motor taxation.  If one pays one's motor tax monthly one is penalised.  That situation may not seem much to people who can afford to pay their motor tax for a year.  If one budgets from month to month one can pay up to an extra &euro;100 or &euro;150 per year, which means at least &euro;10 a month.  I agree with NERI that the  property tax, and Fianna F&aacute;il has said it for years, should reflect a person's ability to pay.  I like the idea of the offsetting effect.  In other words, the State ends up accruing the same amount of income from the tax.  <\/p> <p>  I reiterate that the struggling middle class must budget from month to month and exist on a financial knife edge.  Any little break we can give them would be greatly appreciated.  I ask the organisations to factor that into their calculations.<\/p> <p>  Consumption taxes were mentioned such as excise tax.  How can one reduce the excise tax on alcohol?  There is a political debate on alcohol at present so a call to reduce the excise tax is completely unrealistic.<\/p><p> I shall conclude by discussing child care.  I agree that the State has kept child care at arm's length from preschool for some unknown reason.  I would co-locate preschool facilities.  In the past few years we have embarked on a massive school building programme.  Not including preschool facilities is a missed opportunity.  School facilities could have been a one-stop shop for parents.  Of course, primary school teachers are qualified to teach preschool children.  I suggest that we increase the skills level in the sector.  Unfortunately, as preschool education operates in the private sector, it means the cost of preschool will increase.  I would appreciate any comments that the witnesses can make on these issues.  The increased grant has, anecdotally, led to increased charges being imposed by some child care providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#N00200","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I urge the Deputy to move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#O00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>That is okay.

Our proposals were not meant to be fanciful or unachievable.  From our perspective, we face a situation where there is a limited amount of fiscal space and, therefore, we must prioritise how best to spend the available money.  ICTU has tried to identify priorities in its pre-budget submission.  Congress has thousands of members like those described by Deputy Lahart.  We have tried to improve their incomes through the collective bargaining process.  Hopefully, those who are employed in the public sector will benefit from the increases they will get through the wage increase that forms part of the public service pay agreement.  ICTU has launched a campaign to increase pay in the private sector as well.  We are trying to ensure, as best we can, that the traditional and most effective way of increasing wealth through collective bargaining is maximised.<\/p> <p>  ICTU has tried to emphasise that the scale of the problem is so great that we need a new response to address the homelessness and housing crisis.  The only way to do this is to present the challenge accurately.  That is why we have clearly stated that we need 10,000 new houses per year.  I accept that we will not magic them out of nowhere.  ICTU emphasised the problem in order to draw attention to finding solutions.  That is why I made the point that local authorities must take a lead.  There are significant gaps in the capacity of local authorities to do so.  That does not mean we cannot look at ways to provide adequate resources to local authorities to meet the challenge.  We must tackle the problem in some shape or form.  The local authorities are best placed to understand the problem.  For example, land that is not currently in use and is lying idle should be used to meet the housing need.  ICTU believes that local authorities should take the lead in tackling the housing crisis.  The purpose of the pre-budget submission by ICTU is to highlight the extent of the challenge we face.  ICTU wants to focus attention on the political and policy-making systems in order to find ways to meet the challenge.  Congress, as an organisation, can only point to the challenge and suggest ways to meet the challenge, which is what we have tried to do.  Ultimately, the solution comes down to the political choices that are made by the people in these Houses on how to spend the available resources.  We believe that the Government, in the 2018 budget, should, instead of cutting taxes, use whatever money is available to invest in the key infrastructural deficits that exist in the economy and our society.  It is our view that this is the best way to spend the money.  We are not unsympathetic to the point made by Deputy Lahart.<\/p> <p>  I shall respond to the question of dispensing with the 9% VAT rate in the hospitality sector.  The Deputy said that the initiative would lead to the tax being doubled.  That cost does not necessarily have to be passed on to consumers.  ICTU has seen evidence that suggests that the hospitality sector has increased its profits due to the increased money generated by the reduced rate of VAT.  Those in the sector can simply reduce their profits rather than pass the cost on to consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#O00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Berney"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Berney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#O01000","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Deputy Lahart made the point that it is difficult to reimpose a tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#O01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>That is not really my view.

One of the things that speaks to is that we should be very cautious about engaging in tax cuts, particularly when the economy is on an upswing.  Actually the best time to cut taxes is during a recession, provided one has built up a sufficient surplus to be able to do that, to keep demand going in the economy and to keep things on a steady ship.  With employment growing and the economy doing well, what one wants to avoid doing is overheating the economy.  Given that we all acknowledge that there is a problem in the housing sector, the response to that, whether it is private or public, will be to ramp up house building and construction.  We have seen that construction is already starting to expand quite quickly.  What one does not do is to supplement it by cutting taxes at the same time because one runs the risk of overheating, such as what has happened in virtually every country in the world at different points.  When people think about having all of this money, they suggest spending it and improving things now.  Our emphasis is always on investment.  What I mean by that is investing in something now to gain something even in 20 years' time when it comes to child care or education or in the near future when it comes to infrastructure and perhaps never at all, as it is a gamble when one invests in research and development.  However, one cannot win if one does not try.<\/p> <p>  One point, that was perhaps taken up incorrectly, was that I did not actually mean to give the impression that we think that excise taxes should be cut necessarily.  I agree the bad items should be taxed, whether it is alcohol, cigarettes, sugar, carbon and so on.  I was simply making the point that it is actually the one area where we are a high tax country.  It might be a good thing that we take those things seriously as problems, betting, of course being another example.<\/p> <p>  I agree absolutely that in the longer term it would be better to co-locate and to roll preschool education in with primary education.  It will take us a long time to get to that point, but to do it will require fiscal resources and ramping up.  It would be wonderful to get a commitment from this D&aacute;il to deal with this preschool issue, as well as housing, by putting in place a plan for it to happen during the next five to ten years.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the vulnerable middle classes, my first port of call is to say that their tax burden, as it were, is actually quite low compared with other high income countries.  Perhaps that may be slightly simplistic.  The labour taxes are low, but the employee contribution is not necessarily low.  Perhaps reorienting the distribution of who pays labour taxation from the employee to the employer would help the hard pressed worker.  We know that the countries that have a high level of employer PRSI do not seem to have a dearth of employed workers but tend to be the countries with the highest employment rates in the world.  Of course, it is more complicated than that.  Measures, such as reducing child care costs, improved infrastructure, which means lower public transport costs, better roads and rural broadband are all things that will help the economy and will help reduce costs. <\/p> <p>  Dealing with the housing crisis will push down the cost of rental in the long run and also will push down property prices as well.  All of those measures will benefit the younger generation coming through, which of course, is the suffering generation, the people who did not get jobs in their twenties in 2008 and beyond and are now suffering from higher costs in many ways.  That is the generation that has really suffered.  What we can do for them is ensure that we have strong infrastructure and that we are Brexit-proofed by investing in education infrastructure or in research and development.  There are certain sectors to which we will need to provide specific help to assist them, such as agrifood, but overall that would be the strategy that we would employ in terms of helping the hard-pressed middle earner.  We are very cognisant of the issue but in our view the strategy we are proposing would help them more in the medium to long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#P00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McDonnell.

I wish to address a number of questions to Mr. Berney.<\/p><p>In regard to VAT in the hospitality sector, I note that ICTU really seemed to focus on the fact that the lower rate of VAT did not give anything back to workers.  Mr. Berney feels that his members have not benefited and are still being paid low wages when the sector is making profits.  That seems like quite a hostile approach.  It does not appear that ICTU has factored in the impact of Brexit on the hospitality sector, which is unknown.  It seems premature to revert to the prior rate and increase it without properly considering the impact of Brexit.  We could potentially lose jobs in the hospitality sector if the VAT rate were to go back up.  Has ICTU considered that?  <\/p><p> In terms of the rainy day fund, Mr. Berney says that we should spend it now and not save, but obviously this is a committee that has oversight of the budget and every household should put aside, if they can, savings in their budget.  It seems a prudent thing for a country to put aside some funds to protect itself in the event that the unforeseen happens.  I have to disagree with Mr. Berney on that point.<\/p><p> In regard to the housing help to buy scheme, Mr. Berney makes the point that the allocation of money to that scheme should be taken from it and reallocated to the local authorities.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has stated that money is no object in terms of building homes and that the local authorities have access to as much money as they need.  In that vein, the help to buy scheme was not referred to in terms of reducing it, or eliminating it.  What are his views on the Minister's suggestion that money for local authority housing is no object?<\/p><p> I will now address questions to Dr. McDonnell on the growth of GDP.  Obviously Government and politicians are fixated on the GDP growth rate, but my question is whether the welfare of the country is improving.  In the past number of years, we have seen an increasing number of people commuting longer distances to work, having to spend longer times on the train or in the car, resulting in increased stress levels and mental health issues.  The number of jobs has increased, but many are low paid or part-time jobs with zero contract hours offering no stability or security.  Now we are discussing the reintroduction of bed-sits to deal with our housing crisis.  We are very focused on GDP, GNP, GNI* and the measures of how the economy is doing, but there is little focus on the welfare of our people and our country.  I would like to hear Dr. McDonnell's views on that point.<\/p><p> Dr. McDonnell stated that we rank 25th in the OECD in terms of public expenditure on research and development.  We put money into tax relief for expenditure on research and development in the private sector.  Is it Dr. McDonnell's view or the view of the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, that we should redirect that money to public research and development?  Would the country and the people be better served if we did that?  Does that policy warrant a review?<\/p><p> I am glad that Dr. McDonnell referred to child care.  Many child care workers in the country are on the minimum wage and do not earn &euro;12 to &euro;15 an hour.  It has to be the only job where one can do a four year higher level degree and then earn the minimum wage.  We have major problems.  It is not a coincidence that it is a sector and a job that is predominantly done by women.  The country needs to get to grips with the fact that women are not treated equally.  In the year 2017, we are still moving around the subject of inequality, pay inequality, women's access to the workplace, and the low level of labour force participation predominantly among women, who have to take time out from work.  <\/p><p> I am very glad that Dr. McDonnell states that we should invest in child care.  I agree wholeheartedly.  It should have happened years ago.  We are so far behind, and we need to get moving on that.  I would like to hear the views of both Dr. McDonnell and Mr. Berney on shared parental leave.  We have maternity leave, but only the woman can take that leave.  It often makes financial sense for the household to do that, but it can mean six months and more out of the workplace.  The woman goes back to work but is very often been passed over by a colleagues who has been at work.  That is not to say anything against the person who has stayed at work, but we do not attribute enough value to the work in the home and we do not give the family the choice as to who can take time out.  It is my strong view that shared parental leave, where the parents make the choice as to who takes the time and when he or she will take it, would go a long way towards addressing the inequality that women face in the workplace today.<\/p><p> When we are talking about housing and homelessness, we very much focus on the acute issues of homelessness, people on the streets or in emergency accommodation.  I have a different experience as a person in my 30s.  Many of my friends cannot get on the property ladder and have no prospect of getting on the property ladder.  First, they cannot save the deposit, particularly if they are living in Dublin, and that is a problem for many people, but also because they are on contracts of six or 12 month duration and have no job security, the banks will not look at their applications.  What can we do?  The banking sector is operating on archaic and old regulations and old risk models.  They have not come up to speed with the way that work is now organised.  A job is not as secure as it once was.<\/p><p>Not everybody has a permanent, pensionable job and the days of such jobs are numbered.  What can we do for people in their 30s and 40s who are struggling to get access to finance?  On the USC, I take Dr. McDonnell's point that we should increase taxes but people want a break.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#P00300","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#R00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>There are conversations about whether we should reduce the USC or widen the tax bands.

I know they do not agree wholeheartedly with reducing taxes but we have choices to make.  Do they think the USC is the best thing to address, rather than tax bands?<\/p> <p>  My final questions is on the sugar tax.  Companies have become very smart by using alternatives to sugar to sweeten their drinks.  A tax that may have been able to take in &euro;100 million in revenue would now only take &euro;40 million.  There is also a cross-Border problem.  What can we do to close off any loophole in that respect, to avoid implementing a tax and then being obliged to spend two or three years fixing the problem?  As with the rent pressure zones, there are loopholes and people are getting around them.  Landlords cannot increase rent by more than 4% so they are kicking tenants out to sell the house or revamp it for a family member to move into.  They then do not do that and just get new tenants.  Where we can see loopholes happening in advance, should we not close them off?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#R00300","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1505894400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>Deputy Josepha Madigan resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":67,"content":"<p>The question on the VAT rate referred to ending a subsidy, and that is what it is.  There is no evidence to suggest there would be job losses in the sector.  Employment in the sector has increased and will continue to increase significantly, though there is a Brexit risk associated with currency fluctuations.  I do not look at the currency markets every day but there has been a slight improvement in the position of sterling recently.  We can see no justification whatsoever for continuing the subsidy as it is simply profit-taking.<\/p> <p>  There was a question on earnings in child care.  The &euro;12 which I referenced is the average based on a survey we did and which I can supply to the Deputy.  The Deputy is correct that there is an appallingly low level of income in that sector and the trade unions are doing their best to provide the benefits of collective bargaining to workers in the sector.  We will continue to do that and through those efforts we can, hopefully, make a difference.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is also correct about young people struggling to get onto the property ladder through access to finance and our members talk to us all the time about the issue.  I am not sure what the answer is and there is no silver bullet for the problem but, in the past, local authorities provided housing finance to young people and couples who could not get mortgages through the private sector, and maybe we could look at that again.  It is all about resources and in the past hour or so we have identified measures which would probably entail spending all the country's income.  Unfortunately, we do not have it.  We have to prioritise so that we can, in the small fiscal space we have, make a difference.  As Dr. McDonnell said, however, there are major things on which we need to make a start, such as child care and the infrastructural deficit.  I agree that parental leave should be shared and it should be for a family to decide how to use it, rather than it be given to one parent over the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Berney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I completely agree on the point about shared leave.  Having to take a career break is one of the most important factors in the gender pay gap.<\/p><p>That this is not shared leave is essentially discriminatory and shows a mid-20th century attitude to child care responsibilities.<\/p><p> As has been pointed out, those working in the child care sector, almost all of whom are women, are extremely badly paid.  The longer-term solution is to professionalise and systematise and to have the State provide the vast bulk of resources for the sector to ensure it becomes more formalised.  The State must deal with child care in the same way that it deals with primary and secondary education, including in terms of budgeting.  <\/p><p> On the issue of the research and development tax expenditures versus direct subsidies or funding of higher level institutes to carry out their own research, the OECD examined this issue in the case of Ireland.  Among the issues it noted was that public research and development expenditure in Ireland is extremely low, as is research and development expenditure at national level, that is, public and private expenditure combined.  It also noted that research and development tax expenditure is very costly and recommended that the direction of fiscal reform in this area be moved towards subsidies.  We do not do enough of this in Ireland and we do not provide sufficient support to the fourth level sector in the area of research and development.<\/p><p> The concept of national innovation systems and an entrepreneurial state is all about the triple helix, as it is known, of higher level education, the state and the private sector working together and co-ordinating.  Part of this could simply be the State taking equity stakes in high potential startups coming out of universities and research institutes.  We spend two thirds of what the top performing countries spend in this area.  This will lead to lower levels of productivity growth, a lower quality of life for everyone and less employment growth in the long run. <\/p><p> Another important aspect of this is the regional element because the universities not only in Dublin, but also in Cork, Limerick and Galway, are employment generation and innovation hubs in particular areas.  We are obviously aware of the capital plans for the period until 2040.  We view research and development as a form of capital.  While it is important to keep research and development separate from capital, it achieves the same effects as capital and boosts productivity in the long run.  That should be very much part of the plan.<\/p><p> While GDP growth is very high, it is meaningless at the moment.  It is an accounting artefact for reasons that are well understood.  The concept of modified domestic demand is a little bit better and the rate of growth under this measure has been strong in recent years, although not as strong as GDP growth.<\/p><p> As to whether welfare has been improving, deprivation rates are much higher than they were at the start of the crisis.  In 2015, the deprivation rate was 25.5% of households - more than one quarter - and the at-risk of poverty rate stood at 16.9%.  Professor John FitzGerald pointed this out.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>What is the at-risk of poverty rate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#S00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>The latest figure, which was for 2015, is 16.9%.

The deprivation rate stood at approximately 10% before the crash and now stands at approximately 25%, having peaked at over 30% in 2013.  It remains very high, however, and indicates that many households are suffering, particularly those at the bottom of the income distribution scale.  The unemployment crisis was the main driver of this.  One of the things that will help a great deal will be employment growth.  Employment is considerably lower than it was at the height of the boom.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Chambers is correct that we have not been investing in infrastructure in recent years and investment was disproportionately hit.<\/p><p>It means that as employment grows, public transport infrastructure is creaking.  Coming on a train from Maynooth into Dublin one finds it difficult to breathe.  It is arguably unsafe.  Because of house prices in Dublin, people are having to move out to Meath, Louth and Wicklow, which means longer commutes and spending more time away from their families, which is psychologically devastating and corrosive in the long run.  These problems can be dealt with but it is the focus on things like infrastructure that will be very important.<br\/><br\/>I was asked about the great debate on increasing the standard rate versus reducing the USC.  Of course, it depends on what reforms one makes to USC.  There is only about &euro;333 million.  I made the point that increasing the standard rate cut-off point by &euro;1,000 would mean a full-year cost of marginally over &euro;200 million according to the Department of Finance's tax strategy group.  One could reduce the 2.5% rate to 1.5% at &euro;164 million, which would be approximately half the fiscal space.  With a break-down of 2:1 tax and spend, one is talking about net space of a little over &euro;100 million for taxes with, obviously, more arising from tax increases on excise that are likely to happen.  What one can do for households is really about shaving at the edges.  In our opinion, it is better to focus on things like child care.  From a progressivity point of view, reducing the universal social charge probably would be preferable.  As was pointed out, a lot of households will not benefit at all from an increase in the standard rate.  Again, in terms of the tax burden <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>other countries, low-income workers in Ireland pay very low effective rates, but middle earners also pay very low effective rates compared with other high-income EU member states.  It is kind of a rotten choice as I look at it.<br\/><br\/>I do not really have any solution in terms of the sugar tax.  The soft drinks companies have already changed the sugar content.  One cannot even buy some of the drinks that used to exist in 2016.  If it is in fact true that aspartame is not as damaging as sugar, the tax is already doing what it is supposed to do.  Excise is not technically supposed to bring in revenue, it is technically supposed to reduce bad behaviour and poor choices.  If the yield ultimately goes to zero, it will supposedly have done its job.  It is the same with alcohol and cigarettes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>It is all about moderation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#T00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":76,"content":"<p>It is all about moderation, yes, so the State will always get a cut.  If they are getting away with it by changing their behaviour in a way that is positive for human health, I am fine with that.<\/p> <p>  I do not have a particular macro solution on the issue of affordable housing.  One of the things that will lead to more affordable housing in the long run is dealing with the mismatch between demand and supply.  Simply building more houses will cause house prices to come down.  They will come more into line with earnings for middle earners as that ratio improves, albeit I take the point about short-term contracts, which situation may improve as the labour market tightens.  We still have not reached our potential with job vacancy rates remaining poor in Ireland compared with other countries.  Workers will be able to negotiate better conditions as the market tightens and that will help.  Those policies in terms of building houses and the labour market taking care of itself will both assist in what the member is talking about.<\/p> <p>  Introducing some fiscal instrument to support those households may or may not be a good idea.  It would certainly be difficult to force banks to lend money to those households.  Presumably, the banks' models are based on probability of capacity to pay over the next 25 to 30 years.  Clearly, if they see a contract of six to 12 months, they would have an issue.<\/p><p>I do not necessarily have a solution to that problem other than to say that building houses will drop rental costs as well.  Part of the issue is that rental costs are so much higher than mortgage costs.  People want to buy houses, which is simply fuelling house prices, which will continue to increase over the next two years at least, unfortunately, and probably at a double digit rate.  The solution is getting the public and private sectors to build houses - the Deputy spoke about welfare - in areas close to urban centres, such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway city centres.  That should be the focus in terms of public policy.

It is probably fruitless to look at cross-country comparisons because the marginal tax rate is one of thousands of factors that affect employment rates within countries.  It is more useful to look at a single country over time.  In the United States, there have been fairly dramatic increases and decreases in the marginal tax rate over more than a century.  Over that time, there has been no relationship between marginal tax rates and economic growth or employment growth.  In fact, the golden era of the United States between 1945 and 1973 was the period when marginal tax rates were at their highest.  That is a fact, but it does not mean there is a causative relationship.  The literature suggests that whether a country has a tax burden of 20%, as it is in the United States, or of 50% to 55%, as it is in Denmark, makes very little overall difference to economic growth in the long run.<\/p><p>While the composition is obviously important, other factors, including the productivity of the economy, are much more relevant.

Ultimately, the marginal rate for self-employed above &euro;100,000 is the highest rate.  Personally, I find the debate on marginal tax rates to be somewhat problematic.  The effective tax rate is much more relevant.  From what I have seen, what is more important is effective tax rates at the bottom of the income distribution where there is a choice about labour market entry at all.  I have not seen the evidence about whether I will work if my marginal tax rate is 47% or 48% and I am on &euro;80,000 or &euro;90,000.  People tend to talk about a guy in a pub who said he would not move back to Ireland because of this.  I have not seen econometric evidence that suggests it is relevant although I would be very interested in seeing it.<\/p> <p>  Again, cross-country comparisons are extremely problematic because even the 28 member states of the EU are very different from each other.  The only way one can do any kind of analysis is of a single country over time where the institutional structure and the structure of the labour force are similar.  One could do state by state where relevant.  We have seen very good research on the minimum wage, for example.  That is the level at which one has to do it or one will otherwise fail the like-with-like test required in any scientific analysis.  As a final point, I note that while I say the marginal tax rate is not hugely important, it would be wrong to say it is of no relevance at all.  Clearly, all taxes have some impact on the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#Y00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Deputy Calleary has five minutes.

Dr. McDonnell said something in the early stage of his presentation about one of the bigger issues facing the economy, namely, the notion of interest rate increases.  In his engagement with Deputy Lahart, Dr. McDonnell spoke about families being under pressure and on the verge of poverty.  Deputy Lahart set out the experience we have all had.  How significant would a 1% increase in interest rates next year be on the figures Dr. McDonnell quoted for families at risk of poverty and on our general consumption trends and patterns?<\/p> <p>  I agree absolutely on child care.  A child can be four and a half or five when he or she moves to primary school but the education system and the way we value education is entirely different.  We need to do a great deal more.  If we implement a system of full payment and justify payment for child care workers in recognition of their degrees, will Mr. Berney's ICTU not then lob in a relativity claim for national school teachers to keep them separate?  We will then end up in this spiral we always do where we are watching over our shoulders.  I do not mean that in a smart aleck way, but when one looks at costings, one must look at all the knock-on effects.<\/p> <p>  On a similar note, Mr. Berney spoke about the public service pay agreement.  We have major difficulties at the moment in our health service in nursing, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy because we cannot fill vacancies.  The nature of our agreements are that everyone gets the same increase and we do not have the flexibility required at local management level to redesign contracts.  It is not even the pay element of contracts, it is also career breaks and so on.  There are entire nursing classes going to the UK after getting a degree here because our system does not allow career breaks or recognition of past work.<\/p><p>Is there not a point to be made in this regard?  Yes, there is the old-style agreement.  However, we need greater flexibility to respond to challenges.  Health care is the obvious one at present.  There is so much pressure.<\/p><p> On the VAT issue, Deputy Pearse Doherty is correct.  We have been forced to spend weekends in Dublin recently and the gouging of Dublin hotel prices that is going on is a disgrace.  There has been a drop of 140,000 in the number of UK visitors.  The west coast tourism market in particular depends on UK visitors.  The fall in numbers cannot just be dismissed as a matter of having to watch sterling or other currencies.  It is a very real figure.  Many areas depend on that market.  Even if it is not profit-taking, it is the market that keeps businesses and employment going.  That is the argument on the VAT issue.  Perhaps we need to separate it out between accommodation and food, as Deputy Pearse Doherty suggested.  There may be time to have a discussion about regionalising tax rates on consumption.  Dr. McDonnell pointed out that consumption taxes here are actually incredibly high.  Perhaps we should stop looking at the entire island and start looking at regions that need a particular boost.  This ties in with the discussion we were having yesterday about the sustainability of regional economies.<\/p><p> ICTU wants a housing emergency declared.  We all know what we are dealing with on a daily basis.  If we declare a housing emergency in the morning, what will that actually mean?  The difficulty is that we need to build houses.

If he takes the time to look at the submission ICTU made to the Joint Committee on the Future of Healthcare, he will see that we place major emphasis on the need for reform in the health sector and the need for portability of skills.  There are things nurses currently do which other grades could perhaps do.  There are things doctors do that may be more appropriate to nurses.  There is a whole process of organisational reform that could happen within the health service to address some of the problems to which the Deputy referred.  He talked about nurses leaving <i>en masse<\/i>to go to the UK.  There is an argument that we are not providing sufficient university places to train nurses.

There is a range of solutions, including reforms to the health service such as those I have talked about, to give nurses more responsibility and do some of the things to which the Deputy referred.  It is also necessary to look at how we train nurses and to consider whether we are training enough nurses and doctors to respond to the needs of the health service.  The public service pay agreement has charged the Public Service Pay Commission with looking at the retention and recruitment issue in the health service in order to identify the bottlenecks and consider how the problems can be resolved.  That work is going to be done as a priority and we should have a report on it before the end of the year.  That will address some of the issues raised by the Deputy.  The unions will make submission in the normal way to the commission.  I look forward to that report.<\/p><p>On the question of the VAT rate, the simple point we are trying to make is that we currently provide a very generous VAT rate to the hospitality sector.  We have a crisis in other parts of our economy, where that money could be better spent.  We strongly believe that the money provided through that subsidy could be better spent elsewhere.  We do not necessarily see the risk.  If we increased the VAT rate tomorrow, I do not see evidence that hotels and hospitality venues would close down across the west of Ireland.  While there has been a drop in visitor numbers from the UK, the numbers from the United States have increased in the same period with one group replacing the other.  That is according to statistics from the tourism industry.  It was on \"Morning Ireland\" just the other morning.  In the crisis that we are currently facing across a lot of our public services, there are better uses for the money that is being provided to the hospitality sector through the subsidy of the lower VAT rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#Z00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Berney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Berney not agree that it is an incentive or stimulus, particularly with sterling weakened at the moment and in terms of Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#AA00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>If it were being used to reduce hotel room rates or prices in the sector for potential visitors, it might be possible to make that argument but there is no evidence of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Berney"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Berney.

It would have a very damaging effect on the Irish economy.  The Department of Finance stability programme update in April or May gave an estimate as to how much a 1% increase would cost in terms of jobs and economic growth.  Given our very high private debt levels, an increase in interest rates would be a straight-up negative shock to the Irish economy, in my view, although it would perhaps bring some benefits to the banks.  There is nothing we can do about it, unfortunately.  The expectation is that interest rates will start to increase in 2019.  One thing that might work against this is if Brexit has a more devastating effect than is anticipated.  That might dampen growth and employment growth in the euro area, leading the ECB to postpone an interest rate increase.  In that case, however, we are wishing for one bad thing in order to avoid another bad thing.  Interest rates are going to go up.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that the Irish economy has been benefitting over the last few years from low oil prices and low interest rates.  They have supported the Irish economy and that support is going to go away.  The high rates of growth we are seeing at the moment should be understood as a temporary phenomenon.  We should not get carried away with thinking that we have moved completely past the crisis.  We do still have that burden in terms of households and businesses.  That is all the more reason to be prudent now.  To the extent that we are talking about fiscal policy, we should focus on things that will boost productivity rather than boosting income flows in the short term.  That would be my perspective.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Calleary made an interesting point about regionalisation of VAT.  It might then be prudent to have a system of regional authorities, perhaps not the 30 or so local authorities but a smaller number, such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and two or three others, with a certain degree of fiscal power over commercial rates, property tax and even VAT.  They might be allowed to set their own local economic plans.  I suppose it would empower county councillors to have a proper executive and legislature.  Without having that structure in place, however, regional VAT rates could be arbitrary.  Would we be talking about special zones for particular counties?  We could have issues in the adjoining county if, for example, there was a lower VAT rate in Longford than in Westmeath.  Would Dublin have one rate and the rest of the country another?  That could just push people out into Kildare and Meath for their shopping.  We need to be very careful about this.<\/p><p>If different parts of the country had different fiscal powers in different areas, that would be one thing, but having regional VAT rates could have unintended consequences.  However, I am certainly cognisant that the economy outside the M50 is not performing as strongly as is the case in Dublin.  It should be noted that when a recovery happens, it tends to happen in the dominant economic zones first and then tends to spread out.  We have not fully seen that yet but we are seeing unemployment rates, for example, falling across the board now.  That should continue for another year and a half.  It does not fully answer the Deputy's question about regionalising VAT.  However, it is an interesting idea and over the next 12 or 18 months we intend looking at regionalisation of fiscal policy, for example, to see if it is viable.  However, I do not have the answer yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#AA00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the witnesses and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#BB00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>May I ask-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#BB00300","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I asked the Deputy earlier and he said \"No\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#BB00400","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Further to what Dr. McDonnell just said, last week Fingal County Council increased its local property tax by reducing the 15% discount to 10%.

Ireland is particularly generous with some of the reliefs associated with inheritance tax.  Obviously, it is not very popular, but there is very different treatment of different assets.

Perhaps blending the reliefs might be a better solution.<\/p> <p>  We are also concerned that 80% of the pension tax relief goes to the top 20% of income earners.  Obviously, it is extremely regressive and it is not necessarily achieving its goal of ensuring that everybody has an adequate pension in old age, which presumably is the official goal at least.  To my mind, it would be better to use that money to increase the basic pension for everyone in the long term.  That would be one example.<\/p> <p>  Broadly speaking, we have a fairly jaundiced view of most tax expenditures.  Essentially, they are hidden subsidies to particular sectors.  Often they outlive their usefulness.  We believe that all tax expenditures should have sunset clauses attached and that they should be reviewed automatically every three years at least.  This does not mean that they should be abolished.  Some tax expenditures serve a very useful function.  The research and development tax expenditure was mentioned earlier.  I know some people have criticised it, but providing incentives to engage in research and development is a good thing.  Other examples could be given of positive tax expenditures.

A couple of years ago a former colleague of mine on the Commission on Taxation did a lot of good work in that area.  Many of the tax expenditures have already been closed off.

Again, a core point is that there should always be a sunset clause.

I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to appear before the committee and the opportunity to outline our views on a future tax strategy for the Irish indigenous sector aimed at strengthening and growing the country's tax base while building resilience into our economic model.  There are important factors against which we present this proposal: an increasing demand for expenditure on services to meet the needs of an expanding and ageing population; external political and economic risks that could impact Ireland's small economy, as highlighted by many international bodies as well as the Departments of Finance and the Taoiseach in their national risk assessment report; a highly concentrated tax base with very little buffering in the face of any unforeseen global or domestic disruptions; and a significant reliance on foreign-owned multinationals.<\/p> <p>  Foreign-owned multinationals account for 80% of Ireland's corporate tax base, and US multinationals account for 70% of employment in IDA-supported companies.  The foreign-dominated pharmaceutical sector on its own accounts for almost 40% of the value of manufacturing production in Ireland.  We have an Irish economy that is approximately one third smaller when the main effects of multinational activity are removed, using the new GNI* economic measurement as opposed to GDP.  Our debt ratio, using the GNI* measurement, is the fourth highest in the OECD, according to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council last week.<\/p> <p>  To deal with this backdrop of risks and vulnerabilities we need a diversified and resilient tax base that is capable of withstanding shocks.  However, our current base has become increasingly reliant on taxes on labour and on corporation tax paid by foreign multinationals, as the committee can see in the diagram we have provided.  Several international bodies have highlighted these dependencies to us.  The European Commission country report on Ireland this year said, \"The stability of tax revenues in the medium term is a concern for public finances ...  [T]he increasing reliance on buoyant corporate tax receipts to finance permanent increases in current expenditure is a concern.\"  It stressed that \"Ireland is a small and ... open economy [and] its public finances remain vulnerable to external shocks and changes in economic outlook\".  The IMF has also been instructive regarding what Ireland must do.  It recommends that our policies focus on rebuilding fiscal buffers and strengthening resilience.  It said measures to strengthen human capital and reinforce competitiveness, particularly for domestic enterprises, are key to supporting sustained growth and reducing regional disparities.<\/p> <p>  While Ireland cannot control external shocks, what it can control, it must.  The Government's report on Irish trade, Ireland Connected, stresses that the key to sustaining jobs and incomes is Ireland's ability to succeed in international markets.  Our national plans have placed a firm focus on exports as key to our economic growth.  New EU free trade agreements, an expanding eurozone economy and rapid growth in services as a share of world trade represent real opportunities for Ireland.  However, we need tax policy and tax administration changes if we are to realise the plan.  While Ireland's exporting story has been one of success, there is an acceptance that it is highly dependent on exports from foreign companies and that our indigenous export model is skewed in many respects.  Although there are \"superstar\" Irish performers that are globally focused, Irish manufacturing companies remain narrowly concentrated.<\/p> <p>  In parallel with our high-performing FDI sector, Ireland now needs an innovative, export-led indigenous sector.  We rightly have a comprehensive roadmap for FDI.  However, a detailed and long-term roadmap is also urgently needed for the indigenous sector.<\/p><p>The thorough and strategic approach that we have adopted on FDI must be applied for the benefit of Irish indigenous companies and entrepreneurs if we are not just to protect our tax base but to grow it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Olivia Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Before I commence I wish to say that this is the piece of work we did and it is effectively the strategy we are proposing for the indigenous sector.  This is the Government's strategy for tax and foreign direct investment, FDI.  Fundamentally, we are saying that we want to see an equivalent of that for the Irish indigenous sector and this is our suggestion for what that might look like.<\/p> <p>  Detailed analysis from the Irish Tax Institute's new report highlights a range of mismatches in tax policy that are hindering efforts to grasp global trade opportunities and meet the challenges Ireland faces.  While our 12.5% corporation tax rate is valued by many Irish businesses, we have a pattern of sustained high rates across a range of other taxes that are critical for growth and we have some tax reliefs that are either not available or not accessible to Irish SMEs.  The right tools, supported by the right policies are essential.  This urgent need to change tax policy is reflected in independent research we did with Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes where 84% of the companies to whom it spoke believe that tax policies relating to the future of the Irish indigenous sector need to be addressed in this year's budget.  We must take a strategically-focused approach to Irish business and address barriers in the tax environment.  Policies that focus on the country's access to highly-skilled talent, expertise, innovation and R&amp;D, as well as capital investment and finance, are critical to the plan.<\/p> <p>  The first challenge for releasing the necessary dynamism that the IMF has stressed as critical, is the high capital tax environment.  We know that Irish SMEs are more reliant on bank finance than those in other EU member states and that they need to diversify into other equity sources of finance.  The Government has recognised the need to develop appropriate alternative funding mechanisms to support companies over the coming years.  This makes the capital gains tax environment critical.  However, the high capital gains tax rate is restricting external investment in Irish businesses and creating \"reluctant\" business owners who may hold onto businesses beyond the point where they have the capacity to grow them to the scale required in a new global exporting environment.  Unless addressed, that will hinder the structural changes needed for a new and more resilient export model, including the national ambition to \"increase the number of our Irish-owned companies of scale by 30%\".  In fact, the 33% CGT rate is the fourth highest rate in the OECD and ten percentage points above the median OECD CGT rate.  It is also high when one compares it with Germany, which has a rate of 25%, and also an excellent record of business investment.<\/p> <p>  We do have a targeted \"entrepreneur relief\" which reduces the high CGT burden on business sales to a limited degree and is especially important given the serious competition from the UK regime, as highlighted earlier this month by the UK Institute for Fiscal Studies.  Ireland&rsquo;s CGT regime is not competitive when compared with the UK and the entrepreneur relief which should mitigate our high rates locks out important angel investors, who are willing to invest money, experience and industry expertise in ambitious young companies.  Business angel investment in Ireland is low compared with other countries such as the UK, Spain, France, Germany and Sweden, which are doing this well.<\/p> <p>  There has been much talk about our personal tax regime in the context of an export strategy.  We need the best human capital and talent to build management expertise, innovation and R&amp;D capability and to drive export-led expansion.  However, challenges abound here too.  In addition to having high personal tax rates, Ireland does not currently have a workable share option scheme that allows SMEs to attract and reward highly skilled and hard-found talented employees.  SMEs must compete with larger companies for talent and 38% of them do not believe they can compete with the larger companies when recruiting for the best candidate.  A new share option scheme would help them attract the talent they need.<\/p> <p>  On R&amp;D and innovation, which is the second pillar, in the work and research carried out, especially post-Brexit, innovation and new product development are deemed essential to export growth.  Only 1% of small firms and 16% of medium firms consider themselves to be R&amp;D active, which is a low number in the context of our national ambitions.  Innovation in younger companies has flat-lined since 2009.  The 1% figure is a concern in the context of IMF findings which show that SMEs are the drivers of change in innovation.<\/p><p>Ireland has an attractive R&amp;D tax credit regime, but some administration barriers are weighing on its success in terms of the low take-up among SMEs.  Irish Tax Institute research shows that 75% of companies are aware of the R&amp;D tax credit and 20% have availed of it.  However, of those who availed of it, almost half said that the process was difficult to prepare for and administer and only 35% of companies surveyed said that they intend to use it in the next 18 months, although that would rise to 62% if there was more clarity around the criteria for qualification.<\/p><p> In summary, we appreciate that fiscal constraints limit the funds available in this year's budget and that not all the essential policy changes can be addressed this year.  In light of the urgency of Brexit and the need to capture markets we would like to see some changes that might assist in the talent and innovation area.  These include a less punitive capital tax environment; a workable share options regime; some reduction in the personal tax burden and; and, an improvement to the foreign earnings deduction regime.<\/p><p> In the longer term, which in some ways is almost more important, we would like to see the announcement of a new tax roadmap for the Irish indigenous sector, alongside the roadmap for FDI so that we give Ireland the best possible growth opportunity into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#EE00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Cora O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Brien and Ms Buckley for their presentations.

What do the witnesses consider to be the fairest and most progressive way of doing that?  I am conscious that if we reduce, for example, the 5% rate of USC to 4.5% we will hit 1.3 million people.

In budget after budget, we have debate and conflict surrounding the small amount of money available to respond to major demands for increases in expenditure on capital, social services, housing and health.  We also have a small amount available for tax cuts to relieve people of the burden of taxation on labour.  We need to focus on a plan for growing the tax base.  In a country with a population of 4.7 million, there is only limited scope for broadening the tax base from domestic sources.  Some 40% of Exchequer returns come from labour, while a further &euro;10 billion is collected from PRSI, although technically PRSI does not qualify as a tax.  These are significant sums which are collected on the back of labour and work.  VAT generates another substantial amount of State income.<br\/><br\/>Unless we want to increase taxes, which is a very difficult decision, the only way to broaden the tax base is to achieve growth outside the country by taking advantage of external opportunities.  One of the areas on which our study focused was services, the largest area of growth in world trade and an area in which Ireland is particularly good.  Trade in services is growing at 10%.  While we have the potential to take advantage of this growth, we also have significant skill shortages in this area.  For example, one State-owned website, <i>TechlifeIreland.com<\/i>, currently features 3,000 job vacancies.  We must avail of the advantages that present themselves.  Growing the tax base means asking what we can do outside our population of 4.7 million people.<br\/><br\/>In the context of the Brexit debate, one of the questions being asked is why a country would remove itself from the European market and the seamless transit it offers for goods, services and people.  We can take advantage of the value this market offers.  On the economic front, recent positive figures show growth returning to the eurozone economy.  The question is how we can take advantage of this and grow our tax base.  The way to do this is through exports but this requires us to have entrepreneur and business friendly tax policies as we face into a budget with tight constraints. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#GG00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Olivia Buckley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I will address some of the other questions Deputy Chambers asked.  On the share options scheme, the main difficulty with share options is that income tax is charged on options when they are exercised, which is likely to be before the person has sold the shares.  As such, the person will not have money to pay the tax.  A capital gains tax also applies.  Both these taxes are high.<\/p> <p>  Share options are generally provided in small companies.  For example, a person may wish to forgo a high salary in a large company to take a chance on an innovative company achieving growth.  Offering such persons share options to work for the company is an important way of attracting talent to small and innovative companies.  While share options must be taxed, in other countries, for example, Sweden, they are taxed at the point at which the person sells the shares and has cash to pay the tax.  In such circumstances, the sale is subject to capital gains tax.  We would like to see a share options scheme as small companies, in particular, need one. <\/p> <p>  On personal tax, a debate is taking place on whether to use the &euro;200 million available to reduce the universal social charge or widen tax bands.  We are trying to move forward from the budget to budget approach.  There are different proposals on the table, all of which are intended to relieve the tax burden but only by a little as there is not much fiscal space available.  Our focus is on growing the fiscal space to ensure we have more money to play with in future as we seek to make the necessary reforms to the personal tax regime.<\/p><p> The decision to reduce the corporate tax rate to 12.5% was one of the best things we have ever done in terms of tax strategy and in providing certainty and assurance.  The current rate is generating corporate tax receipts at equivalent ratios to countries with much higher rates.  It is also the right thing to do for a small and open economy.  The debate about corporate, personal and capital tax must take place against the backdrop of the type of economy we have.  Our message is very much that we should start with the overall economic objectives and needs and work back to tax policy, rather than taking each tax head in isolation and arguing it should be set at this or that rate.  I agree the corporate tax rate is very sustainable and certain. <\/p><p> Corporate tax is volatile in all countries.  While Ireland has a high dependency on foreign multinational companies - these companies are very welcome and the money they provide helped us through the crisis - one of the reasons we produced the report was to seek to achieve greater balance and sustainability by generating more revenue from the domestic sector.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Cora O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I also asked a question about combining the universal social charge with PRSI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#HH00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":184,"content":"<p>That would be a substantial undertaking and one which would certainly simplify the tax system.

There are a number of angles to this.  A lot of work is going on in terms of the feedback from our membership.  There has been a huge amount of Brexit briefings and advisory work.<\/p><p>Companies are seeking advice on what sort of plans they need to be make for customs union arrangements, what this implies and what it costs.  Much of the research has been done in the vacuum of not knowing the final details but our companies and their advisers are certainly very focused on it.  We will be in London next week to meet our sister institute, the Chartered Institute of Taxation, CIOT, along with its Belfast members.  We had meetings in Belfast and Dublin earlier in the summer.  There is no doubt that the focus is on the mechanics, namely, on what may happen and how.<\/p><p> The broader issue of whether companies are Brexit-ready goes back perhaps to our export strategy.  A number of worrying statistics came out in the past couple of months.  When we conducted our research into behaviour and attitudes, we looked at export-prone companies, that is, companies in export-driven sectors.  There are three worrying statistics here.  Most companies are still focused on the domestic market as their real priority.  Over half of the companies we looked at were exporting to the UK.  However, those that are not already doing so do not, for obvious reasons relating to Brexit, see huge potential to do so in the next 18 months.  Fewer than half are exporting beyond the UK market and do not see themselves doing so in the next 18 months.  There is an underlying cautiousness, fear and lack of confidence, a sense of constrained circumstances - whether they involve finance, capacity or sales staff - and a sense of an inability to enter export markets in the eurozone in particular.  We know that the eurozone has been prioritised by Enterprise Ireland as one of the areas in which we can really take advantage.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation is also looking at Europe's free trade agreements with countries such as Japan and Canada to see what advantage we can take from these.  There is, however, an underlying sense of worry.<\/p><p> Diversification is the real answer to Brexit.  Quite apart from dealing with the mechanics of Brexit, I am not so sure that we are Brexit-ready when it comes to diversification to markets in other countries.  The chief executive of Enterprise Ireland spoke on \"Morning Ireland\" recently from the latter's showcase event.  I do not have the statistics from the Enterprise Ireland survey to hand, but one of the areas she highlighted was the research showing that companies were not as Brexit-ready as they might like in the broader terms of looking at the world.  Our export figures show that most of our exports in both services and goods, that is, approximately 85% to 90%, are carried out by multinational companies.  This means that only 10% of our overall exports are driven by the indigenous sector.  We do not have the same level of statistics for services, but looking at goods and products we can see that we have some really good superstars, companies that have conquered the world, and we are very proud of them.  However, only 11% of them are exporting more than 20 products to more than 20 countries and they account for almost 50% of the value.  The fact that our indigenous sector is reduced down to 10%, with 11% of those accounting for 50% of our exports, shows how limited we really are.  The median number of countries our companies export to is actually five and the median number of products exported is four.  Nine out of ten products exported by our indigenous companies are food products and one of these - chilled boned beef - accounts for 23% of our exports.<\/p><p> Ms O'Brien has already dealt with the area of innovation, diversification and research and development, which has flatlined in small companies.  Very small and medium-sized companies consider themselves to be innovation-active.  We have a great deal going for us but we also have much work to do.  No stone must be left unturned.<\/p><p> In the context of our tax policies as supported by our tax administration system - which will Ms O'Brien might want to expand upon - if the members wish to be Brexit-proofed as policymakers, they will have to look at every line of possibility in terms of what we can do for SMEs and how we might - with the relevant policies in place to support this - transform Ireland into a really ambitious country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#JJ01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Olivia Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>The tax administration issue is really about support services for small businesses.

We live in a world where I believe capital has too much power.  In the negotiated position of the various factors of production, and because capital can move so fast and is so transferable, it has huge power over labour.  Natural capital does not move so it is completely undermined in the current economic system that we have.  Everything is designed to support the interests of capital and we forget about the labour and natural capital or costs. A lot of the political problems currently happening around the world are, I believe, because labour rates are not increasing.  The share of income going to capital versus labour is historically completely out of kilter, not just in Ireland but across the board.  Would the witnesses agree with that view as a broader macroeconomic assessment?  Any time, therefore, we have people coming in to say we have to reduce the burden on capital I believe that this is not the world we are in with regard to the big challenge.  Let us say we went from 33% down to 25%, which makes rational sense to promote the indigenous economy, where would we get that &euro;200 million from?

I will make some general comments on why we have focused on this area and Ms O'Brien might wish to add something on the technicalities.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of reasons for this focus in our report.  As Ms O'Brien outlined, we find ourselves with the fourth highest rate of capital gains tax in the OECD with a median percentage of 23%.  Countries like Germany and the UK have much lower rates.  We view ourselves as an open economy where a cold wind has a significant economic effect, given the nature and scale of our economy.<\/p> <p>  An issue was raised acutely by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in the UK last week.  It outlined that the mobility of capital and people is a risk for Ireland, given that we are a small country neighbouring the UK with Newry less than one hour up the road from here.<\/p> <p>  Ms O'Brien has researched another issue relating to capital taxes, so I will let her pick up on this point after I have finished.  We have a national ambition.  Multiple extensive and thorough reports on Brexit were commissioned and well written by many people.  There were reports from the then Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and Ireland Connected on the Brexit challenges facing Ireland.  One of the major elements that these reports examined was the need to scale up our companies.  If one is going to expand and drive into export markets, one needs to scale up.  The figures set out in one of those reports - I believe it was Ireland Connected's report - indicated that we needed to scale up our companies by 30%.  That requires investment at a time when we as a country have a greater dependency on bank finance than anyone else.  Interest rates have been raised as an issue in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Other countries have far more competitive regimes than ours in terms of attracting angel and third-party investors to companies.  We are low compared with the UK, Spain, France, Germany and Sweden.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the debate on capital or labour, we consider what strategic direction is required, what other countries have used, how competitively do we stand on capital taxation and what do we need to grow our companies not just for the sake of growing them, but to give our people the best chance economically.  Going back to the beginning of our argument, this is all about people having world class services and giving children the best chance at education.  We need the best hospitals and health services and we want housing, but we must look to Exchequer returns and see what can be accumulated that will allow us to do all of that for our people.  This debate is not for the sake of the accumulation of capital and wealth, rather it is about how to give a country of just 4.7 million people the best chance and deciding what role the capital environment will play in that.<\/p><p>It plays an important part in other people's strategies and in the scaling of their companies.  As a country, we must ask ourselves what a competitive environment is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#NN00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Olivia Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":227,"content":"<p>We are considering this matter from two points of view, namely, what will help small businesses to grow and become more dynamic and what will generate more tax for the Exchequer.

As we sit here discussing issues such as what is the best way to cut &euro;200 million in personal income taxes, as Fianna F&aacute;il members have asked a number of people, there are 456 patients lying on trolleys.  Many of them are in pain, some of them are extremely elderly and some are very vulnerable.  As we came here this morning 3,000 children woke up in emergency accommodation, accompanied by 5,000 adults.  Rough sleepers were moved along from doorways.  We use feeble words such as, \"We need to challenge or address the crisis in health or housing\", yet the debate is completely occupied by reduction in personal income tax rates.  I must be unique among the other political parties because nobody comes to my office to ask for a reduction in personal income tax rates, although many people tell me they are under pressure because of the costs of child care, education, health and so forth.  The institute has also been a party to that debate.  That is its role.  How can the institute suggest that we should reduce the tax rates or marginal tax rates at a point when it is so familiar with the other crises that exist and with the fact that the pot is not bottomless?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#PP00700","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I will try to step back a little from that.

What is driving ours and where we need to get our money is exports.  There is also foreign direct investment, which we cannot forget in the debate.  There is huge movement in and out of the country by a very mobile labour market.  There has not been enough research carried out on what is the right income tax policy for a very small open economy.  I would welcome some economic analysis.  We cannot do that as we are not an economic body, but we would definitely support the right income tax policy for Ireland for the next five years.

Ms Freeman has just recently joined the organisation and is still coming to terms with the volume of paperwork, so I will do most of the talking.  I thank the committee for inviting us here today and for taking the time to look at these very important matters.<\/p> <p>  As the committee members will know, Chambers Ireland is the largest business organisation in the State.  With over 45 member chambers in our network, we represent businesses in every region and economic sector in Ireland.  We are very much generalist and represent all types of business without breaking them down into specific sub-sectors.  This geographic representation gives us a unique understanding of the challenges facing businesses throughout Ireland.  In particular, we know and understand the threats to those doing business and providing much-needed jobs in towns and villages.  We also understand the opportunities and believe Government can play a major role in minimising the threats and turning the opportunities into realities.<\/p> <p>  Moving straight on to the first area we were asked to address, the 9% rate of VAT in the hospitality sector has contributed significantly to the growth of tourism and jobs in the last few years.  Tourists are also arriving from increasingly diversified markets.  We welcome recent announcements about new direct air links and affordable fares, which will undoubtedly contribute to this area.  However, in spite of 4.2% growth in arrivals in the first six months of 2017, there was a concerning fall of 6.4% in visitor numbers from Great Britain during that period.  The tourism and hospitality sector has particular regional importance, providing much-needed employment in rural Ireland and Border areas.  The fall in tourist numbers from Great Britain was predicted following Brexit.  The fall in the value of sterling has made Ireland less attractive financially while also potentially improving the competitiveness of UK tourist offerings for Irish and other eurozone visitors.  There is also a competitiveness aspect this debate.  Some 17 out of 19 eurozone countries have tourism VAT rates of 10% or less, making our current rate competitive against that cohort.  Taking those matters into consideration, together with the uncertainty surrounding the nature of and timeframes for Brexit, we believe that the 9% VAT rate should remain in place.  To increase it to our standard rate of 13.5% would be detrimental to the sector.<\/p> <p>  On the vacant site levy and local property tax, Chambers Ireland has long called for a broad-based system of property taxation.  The chief attributes required for such a system to be acceptable would include a local tax to fund local services and local development needs; fairly applied taxation, in that everyone should contribute something; taxation that is structured to broaden the revenue base of local government leading, in turn, to a reduction in the pressure on the business community via rates and other charges; and that the tax should be equitable.  Having established the local property tax and a high compliance ratio, we are concerned that the objectives above are being watered down with property values still locked at 2013 levels and many exemptions now in place.<\/p> <p>  We appreciate the difficulties significant increases in house prices cause when computing liabilities.  However the bands and rates of taxation applied could, for example, be adapted.  In addition, local authorities have flexibility to vary LPT payable through the local adjustment factor by an amount of plus or minus 15%.  While it falls within the remit of local councils to determine the use of this factor, there is an opportunity for appropriate use of this flexibility to raise funds for local services and development which otherwise could not be delivered or would have to be funded by increases in business rates.  We have called on councils to assess the opportunity in each of their areas to raise additional funds.  In the long term, Government should consider the development of a land tax that is based on the value of a parcel of land as a replacement for LPT.  As the value of a piece of land increases, the rate of tax increases.  Such an approach to land management would encourage improved use of land and not penalise improvements in the way LPT does.  With regard to the vacant site levy which is due to be levied from January 2019, we have recommended that it be brought forward to January 2018 as one of several measures that could be employed to encourage housing development.  <\/p> <p>  Turning to our pre-budget submission, we conducted an extensive consultation process with our network about the concerns of the business community, feedback from which forms the basis of our submission.  We recognise that there is limited fiscal space and we strongly encourage Government to continue to urge the EU to review and update the fiscal space calculations to reflect economic circumstances, the nature of investments proposed and relative borrowing costs.<\/p><p>There has been a very strong message from our network that investment in infrastructure needs to be the absolute priority in budget 2018 with a preference that other matters such as small business focus and tax reform are addressed by making commitments under the multi-annual framework model for future budgets.  A significant component of the rationale for this was the importance of maximising our competitiveness in light of Brexit uncertainty.  Our submission is fully laid out on our website.<\/p><p> The key elements are in three separate areas: infrastructure, small business focus and tax reform.  The feedback was that investment in infrastructure should take precedence.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe's commitment to an additional &euro;4.1 billion in capital spending between 2018 and 2021 is welcome as is the commitment to link capital plans to the national planning framework, NPF.  We believe the NPF is hugely important.  <\/p><p> One of the key areas we need that investment to target is housing.  Our current issues in housing are a huge threat to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.  We welcome the attention it is receiving but it is vitally important to implement the latest plans with a huge sense of urgency.  Transport is a crucial area for investment.  Greater connectivity between our regions and improving inter-city transport should be prioritised.  The Government must deliver the national planning framework, the next draft of which is due at the end of September, and we need to ensure that spending on infrastructure ties in strategically with that.  A recent Indecon Cork and Limerick Chambers research report found an M20 motorway would create over 5,000 jobs, help create a seamless Atlantic corridor and enable much greater connectivity between the regions.  Our ports infrastructure and connectivity to those ports also needs to be upgraded particularly to help open up more direct access to EU markets in light of Brexit.<\/p><p> It is essential to roll out the national broadband plan as soon as possible.  Businesses cannot function without quality high speed broadband.  It affects a company&rsquo;s ability to do business, hampers access to new markets and renders it increasingly difficult to do business with the Government, for example, applying for Government tenders, dealing with Revenue and filing annual returns with the Companies Registration Office.  Download and upload speeds also need to be future-proofed to ensure competitiveness with other jurisdictions.  <\/p><p> In the area of energy, our priority is ensuring a dependable and sustainable supply.  We also have to be ready for a welcome increase in population of 1 million people over the next 25 years as the CSO has predicted.  We need to prioritise continual investment in our grid infrastructure and address climate change issues.  We have more detailed information in our full pre-budget submission.  We need to know how it is proposed to fund a sustainable water supply across the country from general taxation, to ensure reliable funding and to open up the opportunity to raise external funding for vital projects.  <\/p><p> In the area of education, Ireland continues to have the youngest population in Europe with one-third of the population under the age of 25.  We must aspire to be the best there is with a best practice education system encompassing everything from early child care to college education and beyond.  In the area of adult education and upskilling in business, with unemployment heading for 6% and below, which is a great story, there is a need to reallocate funding from unemployment programmes to schemes specifically geared at upskilling those already in employment.  This will increase our competitive capability internationally and augment the ability of existing businesses to grow.<\/p><p> We need to continue investment in accessible, affordable, high quality child care services and to meet our commitments outlined in the national women&rsquo;s strategy. <\/p><p> I will now turn to the other two sections.  Recognising that we would like to see the concept of the multi-annual framework model being used here and limiting the surprises in a budget, the small business focus should continue to be the retention of the 9% VAT rate, the implementation of an employee share ownership scheme tailored to the needs of SMEs and establishing grant support for SMEs undertaking innovative research and development.  In addition, there should be Brexit supports including financial commitment to back up announced proposals to expand our networks overseas and additional supports for a wide range of businesses to expand our export horizons with the necessary training and skills. <\/p><p> On tax reform, we need to reduce the marginal rate of tax below 50%.  We need a competitive capital gains tax regime with the UK.  We need to continue commitments we have made in the past to supporting the self-employed, entrepreneurs and small businesses in areas such as the USC surcharge, income tax credit, parity for the self-employed in maternity and paternity benefits and a tax credit on employers PRSI for micro-enterprises <\/p><p> We greatly welcome the committee&rsquo;s interest in these areas and are happy to respond to its questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#SS00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Talbot for his opening statement.

The question for us is what will happen if we are even 4.5% less competitive?  We must also consider that depreciation in the value of sterling might potentially put people off coming to eurozone areas.  It is not just an Irish problem.  There is a risk of Irish consumers heading to the UK.  There are several risks that could undermine the amount of revenue we collect that would be taxed, whether the rate is 9% or 13.5%.<\/p> <p>  The other issue that came through very strongly from our network was the regional-rural impacts that could arise from this.  Our geographic mandate means we are very focused on towns, villages and communities across the country.  We have some way to go before we get the tourism and the recovery fully out to all those areas.  I mentioned things such as the national planning framework.  It is really important to ensure we target investment so people can understand where they fit into the national planning framework.  Are they one of the cities that will be developed or are they a rural area that needs to link into it?  We feel the retention of the 9% rate is important to retain jobs particularly in regional and rural areas.  <\/p> <p>  On the other question about the lack of diversification, there are several ways of looking at it.  There is diversification in what they do and diversification in the markets in which they sell.  We are all hoping to see further supports and hopefully EU support for further supports to assist companies to diversify the markets they are selling into.  We focus on things such as the need to upgrade ports infrastructures to facilitate Irish exporters with more direct access into EU markets from our ports rather than having to, for example, go across the UK.  With regard to the diversification of the products and services companies, we are a very innovative nation and we have lots of things going on.

The Chairman talked about the presentation from ICTU and its very strong proposal that the VAT rate should be increased.  Part of that is coming from the fact that it is still perceived as a very low paying sector and that the benefit in the reduction of VAT has not been passed on to employees or, if it has, it is marginal.  I would like to hear Mr. Talbot's views on that.  It is very difficult to maintain the VAT rate at 9% when there are hoteliers in Dublin charging &euro;600 for a room without breakfast.  There is a regional aspect to it.  In the west of Ireland, which I represent, it is vastly different to Dublin.  How do we deal with that?  It seems as though there are huge profits being made in some urban centres, with the benefit not being passed on to the employees and the price reductions not being passed on to the consumer.<\/p> <p>  In terms of preparedness for Brexit, how prepared does Mr. Talbot think his members are?  Are there any things we should be taking into consideration for the budget for next year and for the committee's work into the future in terms of helping Chambers Ireland members?  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Talbot spoke about the need for investment in transport, broadband and infrastructure.  In the west of Ireland, there is a massive infrastructure deficit and broadband is a huge issue.  It appears that lots of the resources available are being pumped into infrastructure projects in urban areas.  While we need that because we have populations migrating east - if they are not emigrating - it is creating huge problems for us in the west of Ireland.<\/p><p>What are Mr. Talbot's thoughts in terms of regional balance for this budget?  Are we in the west of Ireland getting our fair share of the investment in infrastructure as opposed to the rest of the country?  In terms of job creation, there are now people commuting exceptionally long distances.  They are spending a lot of time in their cars and on trains, increasing the time away from their families.  It is having a devastating impact on family life, on mental health and on all those other factors.  What are the members of Chambers Ireland saying about that?  From where are they getting their pool of people?  Obviously the housing issue is definitely having an impact on that, but the fact that our investment in infrastructure and capital is so weighted towards the urban centres means that we are not giving the regions a fair chance at providing that employment and assisting them to keep people in those areas.  <\/p><p> My final question is on climate change.  I know Mr. Talbot has touched on this and on the need to address these issues.  This country is looking at substantial fines.  How prepared is the business community to adapt to any budgetary measures which might be introduced in order to tackle emissions targets?  Has Mr. Talbot's organisation done any work on how industry and businesses might cope with the huge fines we may face?  How receptive are they to doing their fair share in terms of reducing emissions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#UU00400","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

They are now working much more closely together and are seeing the value of getting together to get higher levels of investment into an area.<\/p> <p>  To address the Deputy's specific queries, on the low-pay sector there is a question mark between when the rate of unemployment was at 15% and now, when it is down to 6%.  We certainly now need to be looking at the quality of jobs that are coming through.  If we go back to looking at the 9% rate of tax and when it should be changed, we continue to believe that now is not the right time.  I did not really mention it earlier but I specifically mentioned international competitiveness in my presentation.  Approximately 10% seems to be the normal rate for tourism businesses in Europe.  We feel that 9% is right in that sector at the moment.  It is creating employment and with the unemployment level coming to 6% other challenges in the economy will be created.  We may start to see wage pressure coming through for example.  I think we are seeing that because we are reaching full employment.  We believe that is positive.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of Dublin hotels being able to charge the rates they can charge at the moment, we have spoken to tour operators and and such businesses.  They say that if one is trying to get a tour coming into Ireland and visiting the east and west coasts, it is still important to get people into Dublin, but it is vitally important that they come to Ireland and we get them over the far side.  It is also vitally important that when cruise ships come calling to ports other than Dublin that there are attractions which can get people off the boat and spending money locally.  There are a whole lot of areas in which we need to remain competitive in the tourism sector.  I am not sure how the obvious shortage of supply that is facilitating hotel prices in Dublin can be dealt with.  <\/p> <p>  I keep coming back to two things.  First, our focus as an organisation this year is that infrastructure must be the priority.  We have said that we are prepared to forgo some of our other typically standard projects, such as tax reform, small business supports and so on, to make sure that we are spending money on infrastructure around the country.  I know it is a little bit further south than the Deputy's constituency, but I specifically mentioned the Cork to Limerick motorway and that then joins up all the way up to Gort, Tuam and Galway.  It is really opening up the Deputy's area.  We are pushing very hard for that sort of infrastructure building.  I also specifically mentioned how important we believe the national planning framework is in order for us to have a proper debate about how we support regional and rural development and not just to allow Dublin to keep growing at the rate at which it has traditionally grown.  We really believe that national planning framework is vitally important in starting to address some of the many issues.  We do not feel that it will be too easy to address them in budget 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#VV00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":282,"content":"<p>Before Mr. Talbot moves off that point, he has spoken about the motorway from Gort into Tuam and then on to Dublin.<\/p><p>One could draw a line from Tuam up to Mullingar and one would cut off the entire north west.

It is vitally important that Chambers Ireland advocates for proper infrastructure - for a good road network in the north west and for proper rail links, because Mayo is one of the counties making the greatest use of freight rail.

We are also very focused on the far north west, the Letterkenny and Donegal area, for example.  We also engage with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, for example on the road link between Monaghan and Strabane in Northern Ireland, which is not a particular focus of the authorities in Northern Ireland which are more focused on the links from Belfast laterally rather than those cutting across.  We are very focused on these things but I thank the Deputy for pointing out that there is more we can do and we would love to do more in that regard.<\/p> <p>  If the Deputy is happy for me to move on to other points, on the whole area of climate change, we have not looked overly closely at the impact of fines and how the business community will deal with them.  We believe our members are very open to dealing with climate change.  There is a sense of frustration among our members at times at the length of time it can take to get really important planning approvals in respect of energy, the national grid and those sorts of things.  Our members would be very supportive of efforts by organisations to put in proper infrastructure which would help us meet our climate change targets.  To go into the detail of our pre-budget submission again, we have many recommendations on areas such as electric vehicles, the electrification of the public transport fleet and the Government using Government procurement and the e-tender platform to facilitate and encourage more environmentally friendly purchasing by Government itself.   There are many things which we are trying to introduce to the debate to try to improve things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#WW00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation and its comments on the site levy.  Moving on to where the witnesses have spoken about land tax, what is their thinking in that regard?  Do they think that the local property tax is not a just system in the sense that major property across the country is not taxed?  On that issue, there is a planned re-evaluation, possibly for 2019, which will lead to major increases for households in urban areas, certainly in parts of Dublin.  I note the views of some commentators, including our colleague, Senator McDowell, for example, who sent us a briefing recently.  It is probably related to the next election.  He is hoping that some of us may be able to vote for him as a Senator.  He made the proposal that perhaps there should be some kind of regional valuations system.<\/p> <p>  To be fair we have been trying to broaden the tax base as much as possible and this committee is very interested in doing so but the property tax is becoming the local government tax, as other people have said.  Obviously Mr. Talbot's organisation has a heavy involvement in this area in the context of rates and it members have a huge interest as business people, as well as as householders, in respect of what happens with them.  Has Chambers Ireland given any attention to the efficiency of councils?  Many people have been taken aback by how lethargic local councils sometimes are in respect of moving on the housing crisis, for example, or moving on other major issues.  Councils are very often involved in many kinds of local development issues, but sometimes people think they should stick to the knitting, which is providing the basic essential services for households and businesses.<\/p><p>I wonder whether Mr. Talbot can see trouble ahead with regard to the local property tax, which was not the subject of huge political campaigns when it was introduced.  I suppose it went straight to Revenue and the Department of Social Protection.  That is one of the major things I want to ask about.<br\/><br\/>Reference has been made to the 9% rate.  A rate of 23% is imposed on a range of businesses.  We are fixated on this, to some extent.  Many people feel that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is making a very valid point.  The key point that was made earlier by the witnesses from the Nevin Economic Research Institute, whom Mr. Talbot may have heard, was that tax expenditure should be the subject of an absolute timeframe.  They referred to sunset clauses etc.  Are we going to have this debate about VAT <i>ad infinitum<\/i>into the future?<br\/><br\/>I noted what Mr. Talbot had to say about the situation with regard to water.

At national level, we have not focused particularly on the proposal to have a directly elected Dublin mayor.  We have allowed the four main chambers in the Dublin area to have that debate.  I do not feel I am sufficiently well briefed to go into that issue.<\/p> <p>  I would like to return to the issue of a land tax.  We feel that the taxation of land is a very efficient way to go about raising tax and broadening the tax base.  It is also about the efficient use of land, which ties back into the national planning framework.  It is great to see factories in deeply residential areas like Baldoyle Industrial Park, which is close to the Deputy's constituency, being rebuilt and regenerated.  As my son goes to school in Kilbarrack, I am aware that it is a hugely residential area.  We need to make sure we have the right mix of accessible jobs and accessible public transport in order that people do not have to travel too far.  We need to make sure we make the best use of the DART, the Luas lines that are being built and, in due course, the metro north system.<\/p> <p>  The point I would like to make about how land is taxed is that there is a danger that the property tax will start to look like how the residential property tax looked at the end of the 1980s and in the early 1990s.  As valuations increased, it became politically difficult and something had to change.  We ended up giving up on property tax.  It took several years to get something back on the table.  We need to consider whether we should look at how a commercial site value tax and a residential site value tax might integrate together.  Would such an integrated tax act as a substitute for commercial rates as well?  As I said in my presentation, we are concerned that the current local property tax system has stagnated.  In 2018 or 2019, a big decision will have to be made on whether to let the existing rules go through or, as I suggested in my presentation, to change the 0.18% and 0.25% bands to make the figures a little more acceptable to ordinary taxpayers who are working hard to pay their bills and do not expect huge increases in these taxes.<\/p> <p>  We suggest there is still a great deal of work to be done here.  We believe the introduction of a land tax would be a better way of taxing than the current system of commercial rates based on the historical valuation system and on the striking of rates by councils.  Ultimately, the rate that is struck by a council is a balancing figure after it has added up all the other income it is not getting.  In the intervening period, there is an opportunity to increase the valuation in 2019, to adapt the rates or to look at the effective use of the 15% variation system, or all three.  I know that last week, for example, Fingal County Council moved back from the full 15% reduction and pulled it back to 10%.<\/p><p>At a time when there is a housing crisis and many other things are going on, often specific to certain areas, there is an opportunity for councillors to realise they are not taking full advantage of a pool of funding that is available.  We believe an opportunity exists in that regard.  At its core, we would rather see an efficient land tax introduced.  Not only would that create a broad base of taxation, but it would also lead to more efficient use of land.  We would then be able to return to issues like the density of population in areas where infrastructure has been developed.  Our network's view is that in the interests of the efficient use of infrastructure, there needs to be more carefully managed and controlled skyrise development.<\/p><p> I would like to respond to a couple of other questions.  As I listened to the commentary of the Nevin Economic Research Institute, I felt there was a lot of stuff we agreed on.  We are not particularly keen for the debate on the 9% rate to continue forever and a day.  When it was brought in, it was meant to be a timebound thing.  We have come through the financial crisis and our own fiscal stability issues.  Now we have the Brexit crisis.  The strong word coming through from our network - we have four chambers in Dublin and 42 chambers outside Dublin - is that this rate is having a significant impact on regional and rural jobs.  The members of our network are asking us to continue to call strongly for the 9% rate to be maintained.  I think people recognise that this debate will continue.  Perhaps, in due course, we should consider whether the 23% and 13.5% VAT rates are the right rates to have as we seek to get a more balanced and broader tax base.  Are those rates competitive from a global perspective?  Irish people pay many other taxes.  If one wants to buy a car, one has to pay VRT, which rarely gets a mention these days.  When other parties and stakeholders look at our excise duties, they say they are too high.  We have not really focused on any of that.  I think there is a general acceptance that the rate will need to be balanced at some point.  It is a question of timing.  We do not believe it should happen now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#XX00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Talbot and Ms Freeman for attending today's meeting, making their presentations, engaging with the committee and providing their pre-budget submissions.

I begin by expressing my gratitude to the Chairman of the committee, Senator Catherine Noone, and the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution for the invitation to speak here today at the committee&rsquo;s first public session.  I also thank the clerk to the committee, Mr. Ted McEnery, for his assistance in making the necessary preparations for today&rsquo;s meeting.  I am very grateful to him.<\/p> <p>  I am joined this afternoon, as the Chairman has indicated, by the secretary to the Citizens' Assembly, Ms Sharon Finegan and the deputy secretary, Ms Gr&aacute;inne Hynes.  I assume they will be in a position to assist me as we go along.<\/p> <p>  The Citizens&rsquo; Assembly received its mandate from the Houses of the Oireachtas and it is, therefore, appropriate that I appear before it to discuss the assembly&rsquo;s deliberation on the eighth amendment of the Constitution.  In these introductory remarks I aim to provide the members of the committee with a clear account of the processes underpinning the work of the assembly and how we approached the task and structured our work programme that led to the formulation of recommendations contained in the report, which was submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas on 29 June 2017.  In appearing before the committee today, I am anxious to provide members with any further assistance required as the committee commences its role.<\/p> <p>  I shall now tell the committee something about how the assembly was set up.  I was appointed chair of the assembly on 29 July 2016 and work began on setting up the assembly in August 2016.  Following public tendering processes, suppliers were selected to provide the necessary services required to carry out the logistical arrangements required for an exercise such as the assembly.  The Oireachtas resolution, which approved the establishment of the assembly and which was the starting point, stipulated that the assembly would be made up of 99 members of the public chosen at random to represent the views of the people and be broadly representative of society as reflected in the census, including age, gender, social class and regional spread.<\/p> <p>  Red C Research and Marketing Limited was contracted to provide this representative sample of 99 members and substitute members.   A representative sample frame was developed by Red C.  Detailed demographic quotas were set to ensure the sample was representative of all adults based on census 2011 and the quarterly national household survey population estimates.  This is the standard methodology used for establishing a geographical spread in a national sample.  Full details about the recruitment of the members of the assembly are contained in chapter 2B of the report.  I invite members of the committee to consider that.  This process yielded a varied cohort of citizens young and old, who travelled from all corners of the country to attend each meeting.  I am satisfied that the method used delivered a representative sample of modern society, within the confines of what is possible with a sample size of 99 as stipulated by the Oireachtas resolution.<\/p> <p>  I shall now outline the work programme we undertook.  Across five weekends between November 2016 and April 2017 the assembly met to consider the first topic set out in the resolution, the eighth amendment of the Constitution.  Full details of the work which was undertaken are provided in the report.  This topic is one of the most divisive and difficult subjects in public life in Ireland, as the Chairman said earlier.  The importance of structuring a discussion which was balanced, fair and above all informative and - I stress - evidence-based was the guiding principle with which I undertook all our work at the assembly.  I want to make clear to the committee members here today that our work was at all times undertaken in good faith with these guiding principles.  I was assisted in devising the work programme by the secretariat and the expert advisory group, which was established pursuant to the Oireachtas resolution.  The expert advisory group had an integral role in advising me on the formation of a work programme and the selection of potential speakers.<\/p> <p>  I had initially hoped that the assembly would be able to conclude its work on the eighth amendment over four weekends.  However, in January 2017 it became clear to me that given the complexity of the topic, in particular in relation to the law, it would be necessary to dedicate a further weekend solely to the preparation of recommendations.  As chairperson, I wanted to be satisfied that the members would have all the required information to allow them to make fully informed decisions on the core issue for their recommendations to the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas resolution provides that our recommendations must be &ldquo;determined by a majority of the votes of members present and voting&rdquo;.  I also wanted to be satisfied that enough time would be dedicated to exploring a ballot paper and incorporating members' input in the ballot paper.  I wanted to ensure the voting process was not rushed in a single half-day session.  For those reasons I decided to dedicate a fifth and final weekend to the issue.<\/p> <p>  We began our consideration of this topic by looking at the current position with regard to the eighth amendment, tracking the history of the development of the law in Ireland, considering the current legal situation arising from Article 40.3.3&deg; and the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, and how this is implemented by the medical profession and by the HSE crisis pregnancy counselling service.<\/p><p>In the second and third weekends, we responded to requests for information from members and provided this information to them.  I emphasise that this was done based on facts and expert testimony.  Specifically, members were given expert testimony on fatal foetal abnormalities, rape, international abortion trends and the experience in the United Kingdom, including the experience of Irish women who travelled to the UK.  The members also received a number of presentations on how laws are made and changed.<br\/><br\/>At the beginning of the fourth weekend, before we heard directly from women affected by the eighth amendment and advocacy groups, members were also given information on the legal implications of the eighth amendment in medical and parental decision-making beyond the termination of pregnancy and any rights of the unborn beyond the right to life.  The final expert presentation addressed the legal consequences of the various options in respect of the eighth amendment, namely, retention, repeal or amendment.<br\/><br\/>Subject to an exception in one area, each speaker was chosen on the basis of his or her expertise and my view of his or her ability to give impartial and relevant fact-based information to members.  The exception relates to the ethical perspectives, in respect of which it was considered appropriate that pro-life and pro-choice perspectives be presented to members after they had been presented with an overview of ethical reasoning.  Members heard ethical arguments relating to the moral status of the foetus and reproductive autonomy.<br\/><br\/>The factual grounding provided to members was given without commentary as to the perceived advantages or disadvantages of the eighth amendment.  By approaching the work programme in this way and by hearing from neutral expert witnesses, members were able to listen to the content presented and were not burdened with having to consider if the information they were hearing was driven by subjectivity or personal views.<br\/><br\/>Each speaker was chosen because of his or her expertise and impartiality on the topic.  The quality of the material put before the assembly is self-evident and all of it is available in appendix E of the report and on the assembly website.  I have brought a copy of appendix E, a very heavy document consisting of two volumes and running to almost 1,000 pages.  It would be worthwhile if the committee were to consider the papers members of the assembly heard at the four weekends during which this topic was discussed.  Having reconsidered these papers over the weekend, I believe them to be very useful.  While I accept the committee has a big task, I urge members to remember that this material is available. <br\/><br\/>I believe the consideration given by members of the assembly is unique on this topic in an Irish context.  The assembly was an exercise in deliberative democracy, meaning that I, as chairperson, listened to the requests of my fellow members when devising our work programme.  Throughout the weekends, we had open feedback sessions when we heard from members about what they wanted to hear to allow them to make informed decisions about the eighth amendment of the Constitution.  What a citizens' assembly format allowed us to do was respond to the needs of the members, a representative sample of ordinary members of society, about what questions they wanted to have answered and from whom they wanted to hear.<br\/><br\/>I wish to say something about the role of advocacy groups and personal stories.  As I mentioned, the remainder of the fourth weekend was dedicated to hearing testimony and opinions brought to the assembly via the submissions process.  We began by hearing the personal stories of six women directly affected by the eighth amendment.  In listening to their testimony the assembly had the benefit of hearing real lived experiences across a spectrum of circumstances.  The women were first selected from women who wrote directly to the assembly.  To ensure a broad range of circumstances was presented, a representative group was contacted in respect of one situation to assist with the identification of women who might be willing to tell their stories.  The selection of the voices to be included in this session was done with the assistance of professional guidance.  Full details of this process are included in chapter 3 of the report.  Transcripts of each of the recordings are also included in appendix E of the report and are available on the website. <br\/><br\/>The final day of the fourth weekend was dedicated to hearing from advocacy and other representative groups which had made submissions to the assembly.  We extended the proceedings on that day to allow the members to hear from as broad a range of groups as possible.  However, in spite of this extension, the large number of groups which sought to participate made it inevitable - and I regret this - that some groups would be disappointed when I made the selection about whom to invite.  In making the decision on selection I took into account the views of members and was further informed by the following factors, namely, the extent to which the submissions provided by a group addressed the eighth amendment of the Constitution; the extent to which the submissions covered new material not previously considered by the assembly; and the need to ensure balance on either side of the debate, on the day, over the course of the weekend and across the work programme of the assembly in its entirety.<br\/><br\/>In total, 17 groups were invited and accepted an invitation to address the assembly.  Each group was invited to prepare a five-page paper, make a presentation to the assembly and make itself available for a questions and answers session with the members.  Individuals representing the groups were permitted to have an additional representative join them on the podium for the questions and answers session if they so wished.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I wish to say something briefly about submissions.  Another important aspect of our work programme was the submissions process.  We witnessed an unprecedented level of public engagement, receiving in excess of 13,000 submissions both online and by post.  We took a number of steps to assist members to meaningfully engage with the submissions, including publishing all of the submissions received on the assembly&rsquo;s website; prioritising the publication of the submissions received by advocacy groups, representative groups and academics; preparing a random sample of all of the submissions received and setting aside dedicated time on the agenda to consider these; and highlighting for members all of the personal stories received to allow them to have access to first-hand perspectives on the eighth amendment.<br\/><br\/>The submissions played an important role in contributing to the work programme of the assembly.  We had a session dedicated to their discussion and much of the fourth weekend was based on them.  I am satisfied that every effort was made to facilitate access to the submissions and the feedback from members, which we received every weekend, was very positive in this regard.<br\/><br\/>The voted recommendations were, of course, what the whole process was about.  I will focus on the recommendations of the assembly, as contained in the assembly report submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas on 29 June 2017.  It is important to note, as is obvious from the report, that the issues which the members voted on were framed by reference to Article 40.3.3&deg;, rather than the terminology used in the resolution of the Oireachtas, which referred to the eighth amendment of the Constitution.<\/p><p>Due to the inextricable link that the 13th and 14th amendments have with the eighth amendment, which relate to the right to travel and the right to information, respectively, it was felt that it was more accurate to discuss Article 40.3.3o rather than the eighth amendment.  I am still of that view.<\/p><p> The assembly's recommendations were determined through four distinct ballot papers that were sequential in nature, meaning that later ballots were dependent on the outcome of earlier ballots.  Depending on the votes on earlier ballots, not all the later ballots were going to be reached.<\/p><p> In summary, the Citizens' Assembly made the following recommendations by a majority vote: Article 40.3.3o should not be retained in full, the majority being 87%; Article 40.3.3o should be replaced or amended, the majority being 56%; and Article 40.3.3o should be replaced with a constitutional provision that explicitly authorises the Oireachtas to legislate to address termination of pregnancy, any right of the unborn and any right of the pregnant woman, the majority in that case being 57%.  Put simply, the members voted that they wanted to remove Article 40.3.3o from the Constitution and, for the avoidance of doubt, replace it with a provision in the Constitution that would make it clear that termination of pregnancy, any right of the unborn and any right of the pregnant woman were matters for the Oireachtas.  It would be solely a matter for the Oireachtas to decide how to legislate on these issues.<\/p><p> The assembly made further recommendations about what should be included in the legislation.  Specifically, the reasons, if any, for which termination of pregnancy should be lawful in Ireland, as well as any gestational limits that should apply, were addressed.  I will preface my next remarks by saying that there were 13 reasons.  I will discuss No. 13 first before dealing with the others.  The committee will have seen the framework in the report.<\/p><p> Regarding reason No. 13, 64% of members recommended that the termination of pregnancy without restriction should be lawful, with that voting also detailing the gestational limits, if any, that should apply, as set out on page 36 of the report.  In addition, a majority of members recommended 12 reasons for which termination of pregnancy should be lawful in Ireland and recommended the gestational limits, if any, in respect of each of those reasons.  Those reasons and the details of the majorities that supported them are: real and substantial physical risk to the life of the woman, 99%; real and substantial risk to the life of the woman by suicide, 95%; serious risk to the physical health of the woman, 93%; serious risk to the mental health of the woman, 90%; serious risk to the health of the woman, 91%; risk to the physical health of the woman, 79%; risk to the mental health of the woman, 78%; risk to the health of the woman, 78%; pregnancy as result of rape, 89%; the unborn child has a foetal abnormality that is likely to result in death before or shortly after birth, 89%; the unborn child has a significant foetal abnormality that is not likely to result in death before or shortly after birth, 80%; and socioeconomic reasons, 72%.  In an additional question on the ballot paper, 72% of members recommended that a distinction should not be drawn between the physical and mental health of the woman.<\/p><p> It is essential that the Oireachtas understands the backdrop to these decisions and the context in which the recommendations were made in this complex area of law and, in particular, the ultimate formation of the ballot papers.  I have provided a full and detailed explanation of this in chapter 1 of the report.  In addition, transcripts of the weekend's proceedings - I am referring to the fifth weekend when the voting took place - are provided in an effort to be transparent and open about the manner in which we went about our business.  If committee members read the transcript, they will see exactly what happened that weekend regarding the formulation of the ballot paper and the voting.<\/p><p> I will briefly say something about ancillary recommendations.  I am aware that the committee has decided to dedicate one module of its work to consideration of these recommendations.  In feedback over a number of meetings, the assembly's members made clear that they wanted to see wider policy issues, as distinct from just legal ones, reflected in the recommendations of the assembly.  On the final weekend of the assembly's consideration of the eighth amendment, members were invited to write down their comments and suggestions on further recommendations.  They were informed that these would be included and reflected as recommendations in the final report.  In the interests of transparency, the report provides the full verbatim text of these comments in appendix B.  The five ancillary recommendations of the assembly based on member feedback are provided on pages 37 and 38, and I would be happy to discuss these further with the committee later.<\/p><p> The legitimacy of the assembly's recommendations is built upon the robust process applied to our consideration of the topic.  I am aware that the results caused surprise across some sections of society, but I truly believe they were reached not by chance or accident, but following a thorough and rational thought process that each member undertook as he or she stepped up to the ballot box.  Each vote was underpinned by expert evidence received from 25 professionals across 80 hours of active assembly participation.  This in turn was supplemented by hours of preparatory work on behalf of the members in reading papers, submissions and such like.<\/p><p> Members heard arguments from advocates representing 17 groups on both sides of the debate.  They also heard first-hand personal stories of women who had been impacted by the eighth amendment.  The six women's crisis pregnancies resulted in different outcomes, but each felt that the eighth amendment impacted on her decision-making.<\/p><p> All this material contributed to the recommendations before the committee today.  I encourage each member of the committee, the wider Oireachtas membership and the public with an interest in this topic to review the footage of the questions and answers and feedback sessions at the April weekend when the recommendations were made.  That footage illustrates the participation and engagement of the members in the process.  It is evidence of the diligence with which they approached the task and the thoughtful and thought-provoking questions they asked of our experts, advocacy groups and secretariat.  They took to their role with the utmost seriousness and dedication and carried it out with exceptional maturity, compassion and respect, which is not always present in this debate.  In the circumstances, I urge Oireachtas Members to view the assembly members' recommendations with respect and due consideration.<\/p><p> Before I conclude, I wish to emphasise a point.  The assembly is an exercise in deliberative democracy, which places ordinary citizens into consideration of the important legal and policy issues facing society today.  However, the recommendations that the assembly has made are just that - recommendations.<\/p><p>The assembly does not, cannot and should not usurp the role of elected Members of D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  As chair of the assembly I do not underestimate the difficulty of the task facing committee members as politicians in considering this topic further.<\/p><p> One of the most fundamental aspects of the eighth amendment is that it was introduced by the people in a referendum, which is the only way in which our Constitution, Bunreacht na &Eacute;ireann, can be changed.  The Constitution is the foundation of our legal system.  Under the Constitution, the people are sovereign.  The people are the ultimate decision-makers in terms of what provisions are inserted in or removed from our Constitution and what changes are made to it.<\/p><p> I wish the committee well with its work - I genuinely mean that - and both I and the secretariat are at members' disposal if we can be of any assistance as they continue their work.  I formally express my gratitude to the members of the assembly who willingly gave up a Saturday in October and a further five weekends of their busy lives from November to April to participate in the assembly&rsquo;s consideration of this topic.  I look forward to engaging with the committee during this session on the work carried out by the assembly on the eighth amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092000002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Justice Mary Laffoy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505910600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Justice Laffoy for her presentation and for her hard work as chair of the assembly.

I also thank our 99 fellow citizens who took part in this particular exercise.  In trying to address this issue and the roadmap that has been laid out by the Citizens' Assembly, one could argue that it is a roadmap, or equally a map of many roads.  It does not give us any clearly defined pathway.  There are many recommendations in the Citizens' Assembly.  In that context, how did the assembly reach these decisions?  Were fatal foetal abnormality, incest, rape, and the various options that were highlighted towards the end of the report outlined at the start of the process?  When were they framed in the mind of the assembly?  Was it at the outset or did they arise in the course of the discussions with the various witnesses and testimonies that were presented at the Citizens' Assembly?  There was surprise in some quarters that 64% of the members of the Citizens' Assembly recommended that termination of a pregnancy without restriction would be lawful.  That was a surprise to some people and certainly created much discussion.  On the broader issue of the 13 recommendations that are outlined, where did they come from in terms of being printed and voted upon?  I would appreciate if the witness could elaborate on that.<\/p> <p>  The witness said in her opening statement, \"I had initially hoped that the assembly would be able to conclude its work ... over four weekends\", but that it became clear that because of the complexities, in particular in relation to law, it would be necessary to have another weekend.  Does the witness mean the law as it is or the law that would have to exist if there were to be a change to the Constitution?  Is the witness referring to the complexities of the present legal structures?<\/p> <p>  When the witness was discussing the substantive issues, was there a change in the mood of the Citizens' Assembly over a period of weeks or at the start of the particular deliberations?  Does the witness think that views and opinions and people's minds were changed during that process when witnesses were making deliberations, or is it possible to ascertain that?  There was no vote at the start to compare with the vote at the end.  Was there a change in the attitudes of the citizens to the testimonies, the witness statements of the medical, legal and ethical experts, and the personal stories people relayed of the impact the eighth amendment has had on them?  I assume there were advocacy groups from both sides who relayed personal stories of the eighth amendment to the Citizens' Assembly.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of fatal foetal abnormalities, we have had numerous debates in the D&aacute;il Chamber, and indeed across broader society.  Fatal foetal abnormality, incest and rape are very often seen as areas where there may be a certain amount of common ground.  There may be people on the pro-choice side and the pro-life side who have a very strong view, but there also seems to be a group in the middle.  Is that reflected?  Is that an area where there was a feeling or a vibe from the assembly around these particular issues, or was it just very blunt votes at the end of the process that gave us the varying views of the committee itself?<\/p> <p>  The witness is a judge who has sat and listened to these debates.  She has observed them both as a judge and citizen over many years.  Did the assembly take any legal advice, other than the testimony that was presented by witnesses who were called, or did the witness or secretariat or the Citizens' Assembly seek any independent legal advice for themselves with which to frame the discussion.  If such advice was taken, was it published or made available?<\/p> <p>  The witness said in her speech-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092000002#G00300","speaker":"1229"},{"type":"speech","time":1505910600,"counter":306,"content":"<p>The Deputy has five minutes left.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092000002#G00400","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1505910600,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I will finish soon.

That is my understanding of what the Deputy wanted to know.  As I said in the opening address, we started establishing the framework from the start.  We had our first meeting, and the Deputy will see from the report that we explained the law to the members, gave explanations about medical issues and all that.  As we went along, we invited feedback from the members.  We asked them what they wanted to know, what information they would like us to give them and what speakers they would like to hear.  I know that I am not directly answering the question that was asked about where the recommendations came from, but as we were framing the work programme we were trying to identify what issues would arise at the end of the day - not necessarily the recommendations, but the issues that we should address.<\/p><p>If the Deputy looks at the work programme, he will see that the matters that came up in the recommendations were covered as we went along.  The Deputy has concentrated on the reasons but the recommendations started with whether there should be a change in the law, the strong feeling being that there should be.  The next issue was how the change was to be effected and the final recommendation was for a provision in the Constitution that the Oireachtas should have full autonomy to legislate in this area.  Over and above the 13 recommendations, consideration was given to the reasons abortion could be lawful in this jurisdiction.  The chair, the secretariat and the expert advisory group formed a draft ballot for consideration by the members and this had only eight reasons.  Those eight reasons reflected what happened as we went along through the work programme.  I do not know if that answers the Deputy's question.  The issues which came up were those which come up in most jurisdictions in regard to this area.  The work programme guidance, which we gave members as we went along, reflected that.<\/p><p> Two questions were asked relating to the same thing, namely, whether we noticed a change in mood or a different vibe.  I sat through every session, all day, and all the round-table discussions.  I sat at the top, looked down and observed everything that was going on and I can truthfully say that I did not notice a change in mood over the course of the process.

We worked very hard to ensure that the members were informed and that they understood all of the aspects of the topics that we were concerned with - the legal aspects, the medical aspects and the ethical aspects - and what issues were important.  The whole objective was to inform them so that they would be in a position to make the proper decision.  That was what I saw as my task as and I hope I fulfilled that task.

What emerges from that is that the number of women going to the United Kingdom and The Netherlands for terminations has reduced.  The committee is probably aware of that.  However, on the HSE website on 13 May it stated - I can barely read it - \"Recent research shows that increasing numbers of women from the island of Ireland are making contact with online abortion pill providers\".  That is a factor that the committee should examine.  We got great assistance from the crisis pregnancy agency at the HSE.  I think the committee would benefit from getting assistance from it.

They lend themselves pretty much to \"Yes\" or \"No\" answers.  In Ms Justice Laffoy's view, given that the assembly members were required not to have taken a public position on the subject of abortion such as having a history of participating in public actions, would it be fair to say that the assembly mainly comprised people without very strong views on either side of the spectrum?  That is my first question.<\/p> <p>  It has been suggested by some people that the citizens of the assembly were somehow misled into voting as liberally as they did.  What would Ms Justice Laffoy say to that accusation?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher has asked what would have been my third question, so I will not repeat it.  Therefore, my third question is as follows.  This is the first time in Ireland that we have been speaking about having free access to abortion.  In Ms Justice Laffoy's view, is that because the conversation on abortion has so far been lacking?  Does she think that Government has a responsibility to educate the public to the same level that the citizens of the Citizens' Assembly were educated?<\/p><p>Do we have a duty as a Government to educate?  Somebody brought up an education programme earlier.  What are Ms Justice Laffoy's views on something like that?<\/p><p> Is it her view that the citizens in the assembly thought the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was a good basis to work off?  What were their views on that?  Did the Act lead to distrust among the citizens about letting politicians legislate for abortion?  What in Ms Justice Laffoy's view persuaded the two thirds majority to vote in favour of access to abortion without restriction as to reasons in early pregnancy?  How do we come to a point where the majority favoured unrestricted access in the first trimester?  Why did a high proportion of the Citizens' Assembly vote for access to abortion on socio-economic grounds?  In inviting groups to present before the assembly, like the Guttmacher Institute and BPAS, Ms Justice Laffoy and the secretariat were accused of bias.  She dealt with this ably in her remarks.  What lessons does she have for the committee from that experience, as we are likely to be hearing from groups like that?  Does she have any advice to us about accusations that might be made against us?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092000002#J00900","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505910600,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Connell has asked me to speculate on a lot of things and I am probably not going to go very far down the speculation route.

I must say that honestly because, as we said in relation to another question, neither the secretary nor I engaged in debate with the members on the topic on a personal level.  However, the answer to the Deputy's question is that we adopted a process to choose the members of the assembly by engaging RED C which was in accordance with the resolution of the Oireachtas.  On that basis, and as we went that route, one has to assume we ended up with 99 citizens who reflected the general public.

There was a vote to see that included on the ballot paper and it was carried by a majority in the room.  In discussing that, the advice the citizens got from the expert advisory group was that some of the reasons for which they sought \"socio-economic\" were covered in what became reason No. 13 but which was reason No. 8 on our initial ballot, namely \"without restriction as to reason\".  Nevertheless, the citizens voted to put it on.  As the chair has said, that has some connection with the perceived difficulty for socio-economic groups.

I do not think it is as difficult as some people are making it out to be.  I suggest that quite a clear pathway has been signposted by the Citizens' Assembly.  Ms Justice Laffoy said in her presentation that the members of the assembly carried out their role \"with exceptional maturity, compassion and respect\".  She mentioned that they listened to 17 groups over 80 hours of active participation and heard directly from six women who have experienced crisis pregnancies.  She referred to them as \"a varied cohort of citizens\" who are \"representative... of modern Irish society\".  Would it be fair to say that they listened to the reality of why most women have abortions in this country and came up with a set of proposals that deal with the reality of why most people have abortions?  Before the assembly met, we heard a lot of talk about the hard cases that involve risk to life, fatal foetal abnormality or rape.  The assembly heard about the reasons ten pregnant people leave the country every single day.  As Ms Justice Laffoy has said, importantly, each day three women have abortions in their own bedrooms with safe medical abortion pills.<\/p> <p>  Ms Justice Laffoy made the point in her concluding remarks that the results of the Citizens' Assembly \"caused surprise across some sections of society\".  She said she truly believes those results \"were reached not by chance or accident\".  An attempt has been made very quickly to cast aspersions or undermine the assembly.  When RTE was reporting on the conclusion of the assembly the following day, it was suggested that the task of the committee that is sitting now \"is essentially to water down these proposals [so that they are] not politically toxic\".  Is it not the case that the Citizens' Assembly showed us that members of the public are pushing for further advancement in the more liberal provision of abortion?  For example, the use of the word \"socio-economic\" was insisted on by the members of the assembly, having heard direct evidence about those who have money, etc.  They were made aware that 15% of Irish people who go for abortions have passed the 12-week timescale because of the difficulty of saving money and making bookings, etc.<\/p> <p>  The citizens removed the qualifier of \"serious\" so that the previous reference to \"serious risk to health\" now refers merely to \"risk to health\".  It is far from the case that the politicians have to educate the public.  It looks like the public is educating the politicians on issues like abortion.  Would Ms Justice Laffoy agree that we now have an opportunity, arising from the Citizens' Assembly's recommendations that we should have abortion on request up to 12 weeks without a reason having to be given by the woman, which is the basis for most abortion laws around the world, and that abortion on other grounds should be possible after 12 weeks?  It is now a question of whether the parties will take a strong and courageous stand to vindicate what the Citizens' Assembly has recommended, or will continue with an Irish solution to an Irish problem.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask some specific questions.  The first issue to be considered was whether the eighth amendment should be repealed or replaced.  Obviously, this has been the subject of some discussion.  I want to ask about the intent of the Citizens' Assembly in narrowly deciding to replace rather than repeal.  Would Ms Justice Laffoy accept that this decision was made from a position of cutting out any legal uncertainty?  A significant portion of the presentation they were given - I think it was six pages - referred to the legal uncertainty that might arise if a replacement for the eighth amendment was not included in the Constitution.  Would Ms Justice Laffoy accept that more time is needed to discuss the dangers of replacing the eighth amendment with particular wordings?  Maybe more time should have been given to that.<\/p> <p>  I want to clarify what Ms Justice Laffoy thinks the assembly meant in its second ballot.  According to her report, \"Put simply, most of the members voted that they wanted to remove Article 40.3.3&deg; from the Constitution and for the avoidance of doubt to replace it with a provision in the Constitution, which would make it clear that termination of pregnancy, any rights of the unborn, and any rights of the pregnant woman are matters for the Oireachtas\".  In other words, there would not be anything in the Constitution about the rights of the unborn.  According to the Citizens' Assembly, it should be a matter for the Oireachtas to legislate for.  I think there is confusion on that.  I believe the assembly recommended that the rights of the pregnant woman or the unborn should be dealt with separately from the Constitution and, therefore, the Constitution should not have any reference to those rights.  Is it not clear that this is what the members of the assembly meant, given that they recommended the following day that abortion should be available on request up to 12 weeks?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092000002#L00500","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1505910600,"counter":341,"content":"<p>The Deputy has used almost six minutes of her time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092000002#L00600","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1505910600,"counter":342,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092000002#L00700","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1505910600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I will allow a little leniency, as I did with others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092000002#L00800","speaker":"1406"},{"type":"speech","time":1505910600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Has Ms Justice Laffoy been a bit surprised with the reaction of certain people, including some journalists and political people, to the report of the Citizens' Assembly?

The company was to select a representative sample based on various demographics such as age, gender, socioeconomic background and geographical spread.  There is a detailed methodology document on the assembly's website as to how the company went about it.  The methodology used by Red C Research &amp;amp; Marketing Limited shows that rather than splitting the country into 26 counties, it stratified by region across 15 broad regions and the members were selected out of those regions.  It is done by urban-rural split within the four major regions of Dublin, rest of Leinster, Munster and Connacht.  Using this stratification it did a random sample within that.  That is quite standard in polling when one is trying to get a nationally representative sample.<\/p> <p>  Ordinarily, what would happen from a polling perspective is one would have a group of 1,000 and that would then throw up more people across the 15 stratifications, so one might in those instances get to the 26.

It is important to emphasise that what the members of the assembly got from the first four weeks, which they were able to utilise in the fifth week, was an informed position.  They were brought to an informed position about the law, the medical position and ethics.  The objective was to get them to an informed position.  I cannot assess how well they were informed or why they came to the outcome they reached but I believe every effort was made to inform them of the issues they were going to have to address in the ballot.<\/p> <p>  There is an element of speculation in the Deputy's last question.  It is not something I have thought about previously.  The Deputy asked if the majority went for reason No. 13, no restriction, because they thought the rape or incest reason was too difficult.  I do not know if that is the answer but there is no doubt that we provided the information to the citizens.  Again, I refer the Deputy to Tom O'Malley's paper, which is very interesting.  There are two and a half pages at the end in which he highlights the difficulties relating to rape and incest.

Before we ask them, I thank Ms Justice Laffoy and the citizens for an outstanding piece of work.  It has been great for the Irish public.  Ms Justice Laffoy made the point that she was dealing with a topic which she described as one of the most divisive and difficult.  However, is it not the case that her work has shown the opposite, that when one creates a space where people can discuss this topic rationally with expert medical and legal opinion, an overwhelming majority of people - two thirds - adopts a view akin to that of most of our European peers, which is access to abortion without restrictions?  On the idea of reasons being selected randomly as favoured ones, Ms Justice Laffoy said in answer to Deputy Kelleher that there were no particular reasons.  It was an understanding, perhaps, that a reasons based approach is not something that works in other jurisdictions and that the best way forward is to trust women and medical practitioners.  Does Ms Justice Laffoy think there is an expectation among the citizens that their views and recommendations will be implemented in full?<\/p> <p>  I have two further brief questions.  Having voted to repeal and take this out of the Constitution, the idea of replace and putting something in instead is a little confusing for people.  Ms Justice Laffoy has made it clear to the committee, as well as in her written documents, and the 74 submissions from the citizens have also made it clear that the reason they did that is not that they wanted it in the Constitution but that they wanted to make sure that the Legislature would not be restricted in legislating.  In her judicial experience, can Ms Justice Laffoy think of any other example where we would provide in the Constitution, \"the Oireachtas must legislate for this\"?  Normally, we trust the Judiciary to interpret the Constitution and we allow the Oireachtas to do it.  Is there any other area where we say, in essence, \"let the Oireachtas legislate\" and more or less dilute the role of the Judiciary?  Are we not better off leaving it the way it is, that the Oireachtas legislates and the Judiciary interprets that?<\/p> <p>  On the ancillary recommendations, why was decriminalisation not recommended?

It is very much appreciated and I hope we can mirror the maturity and respect she spoke about in relation to the process so far.  Many of my questions have been touched on by Deputies Coppinger and Clare Daly but I might hone in a little more on the uncertainty piece around Brian Murray's legal advice and ask whether when Ms Justice Laffoy outlined to the assembly that there were three possible consequences of a straight repeal, it would be fair to describe the assembly's intentions as being to copper-fasten option 1, which would be to give the Oireachtas absolute authority to legislate for abortion access and to prevent any pre-eighth amendment constitutional right?  Although there were three options and areas of uncertainty they would make sure that they would rule out the other two so that it could not be used or construed in any other way in terms of the uncertainty he raised.<\/p> <p>  Why was the assembly not given the option of voting to insert an express positive right to abortion access or to bodily autonomy in pregnancy?  On a point of clarification I note that Ms Justice Laffoy described in the report that the assembly's intention was to give full control and exclusive authority to make law in this area.  I suppose that ties in a little with what Deputy Clare Daly was saying in relation to the Judiciary and its role.  That is very strong language.  Could Ms Justice Laffoy clarify whether it was the intention of the assembly to recommend that any abortion legislation passed by the Oireachtas would be immune from challenge in the courts?  I felt that the reference to \"exclusive authority\" and \"full control\" was very strong language and I ask Ms Justice Laffoy to clarify that for me please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092000002#N01400","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505910600,"counter":377,"content":"<p>On the first question, I think I would agree with the Senator that what the citizens were thinking of was copper-fastening the position and not leaving any uncertainty there.  I think that is why they took the line they took.  Incidentally, and this is just by the way, after that session we had a question and answer session and Brian Murray answered questions, and we subsequently prepared a transcript of that.  It is available if it is of any assistance.  It may give some insight into the minds of the people who were asking the questions, but I agree that that was their objective; to copper-fasten.<\/p> <p>  I suppose one has to awfully careful about the terminology one uses in this context.  When we talk about certainty and there not being any challenges open and all of that, what I have been thinking of is a constitutional challenge, in other words, that I would prefer and hope the Oireachtas would not produce legislation which within a few weeks would be subject to proceedings in the High Court which claimed a declaration that section whatever it is of the Act is invalid having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.  So it is to avoid a challenge of invalidity having regard to the terms of the Constitution that I am concerned with.  Of course, the courts must keep an eye on the Legislature and ensure that the Legislature is acting in accordance with law.  One does not suggest cutting that out, but I think if the Oireachtas is going down the road to amend the Constitution, and to do so by way of legislation it should strive to ensure that the legislation will not be the subject of a constitutional challenge.  I should add that is very much a personal view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092000002#N01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Justice Mary Laffoy"},{"type":"speech","time":1505910600,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Could Ms Justice Laffoy respond to the other question about why the assembly was not given the option of voting to insert an express positive right to abortion access or bodily autonomy?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EAJ2017092000002#N01600","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505910600,"counter":379,"content":"<p>That never arose.

That was one issue.  The second issue was whether there should be a distinction between physical health and mental health.  In order to do the job properly, we ended up with all of those questions.  There was a focus on health but there was some diversion of opinion as to whether the reason should be limited to &quot;serious risk&quot; as distinct from risk <i>simpliciter<\/i>.  The committee will see the reasons on ballot 4B on page 31.  We started off with reasons 1 and 2, which were &quot;Real and substantial physical risk to the life of the woman&quot; and &quot;Real and substantial risk to the life of the woman by suicide&quot;.  They are the X case reasons, which are set out now in the 2013 Act.  Then we got down to dealing with risk to health as distinct from risk to life.  There we have questions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.  The distinction is that some of them relate to risk <i>simpliciter<\/i>and others to serious risk and some of them do not have a distinction between physical and mental health.

I am somewhat taking off from where Deputy Hildegarde Naughton finished.  In the event that the Legislature was free to legislate, some concern has been expressed that, given the nature of how our Governments are put together, which is by coalition, it could be that a particular party, be it small or large, might have the balance of power and that we could have large swings in the legislation depending on the power the party or individual would have.  This leads into the theme around certainty.  Was there any discussion on that and the possibility of a super majority of 55%, for example, or that Deputies would have a conscience clause inserted so that no Whip would be applied?  This is about ideas around allaying those fears.  For example, we had three elections in 1981 and 1982.  We could possibly have three changes in legislation coming one after the other.

If we look at the 2013 Act, for instance, which gave effect to the X case following the decision in Strasbourg, we see that one section provides that \"It shall be lawful to\" carry out such an act.  In fact, two sections, sections 7 and 9, make that provision.  Then, towards the end, section 22 says \"It shall be an offence to\" carry out another act.  The issue of decriminalisation really turns on what is legislated for and how the Oireachtas decides that a certain procedure will be lawful.  This cannot be dealt with without taking a broad view of what might happen.  If one looks at the 2013 Act, it gives one an idea of what might happen.  I do not know.  Thought will have to be given to what will be made lawful.  If something is not made lawful then it will be an offence to do it.  To be honest I have not given this any thought.  It might be something on which the committee should obtain advice.  I have not given any thought to whether this could be taken out of the criminal sphere altogether.

Ms Justice Laffoy stressed that, in her view, this was a thorough process and she used the term \"neutral expert witnesses\".  I do not understand, however, why the assembly did not set out to consider how the eighth amendment had contributed to abortion rates in Ireland being significantly lower than most countries or the very obvious reality that thousands of lives have been saved as a result of this amendment and the way it has impacted on our legal system.  It did not consider that argument.  I did not see that in the work of the assembly and I found it disturbing from the beginning.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the neutrality of expert witnesses, there was no significant analysis of how the legalisation of abortion in other jurisdictions - particularly Britain, our nearest neighbour - has led to the, often unforeseen, widening of availability of abortion.  One thinks of what Lord Steel would have put on the record.  He was instrumental, as Ms Justice Laffoy will know, in the 1967 legislation in Britain.  Would Ms Justice Laffoy reconsider bringing in an abortion provider like the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, BPAS, or an abortion-supporting foundation like the Guttmacher Institute instead of getting a neutral scholar to research the issue?  Would she agree that those people might be experts but that they are not neutral?  Was it not inevitable that they would sanitise matters, either through their coverage of the issue or through their omissions, in some way?  For example, there was no detailed analysis of what happens to an unborn baby in the course of a late-term abortion or, indeed, of the dramatic incidents of incomplete late-term abortions, such as have happened in Britain over the years, where children were simply left to die.  I did not find that in the thorough process which Ms Justice Laffoy argues took place.  I wonder whether there is a real question about how thorough the assembly was and whether the choice of non-neutral experts, such as an abortion provider and an abortion-supporting foundation, contributed to a certain sanitisation of the issues.<\/p> <p>  Finally, I found it disturbing to watch members of the assembly asking the most basic of questions at pretty much the last moment - questions in respect of how a late-term abortion is carried out, for example - before then going on to vote for far-reaching recommendations.  Surely such a sad and tragic spectacle did not escape Ms Justice Laffoy's notice.  Supplementary to that, is she aware of any lobbying, or any attempts within the group, to encourage other members to take a particular view of the facts?  I would be grateful for anything she has to report to us on that.

I will make the introductions and then I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Nesirky, to outline our views on the White Paper's scenarios.  I will then conclude with a few examples of where the European Union can work with member states on social policy to improve the lives of young people in Europe and beyond.  We propose to discuss the various scenarios in the White Paper and offer an idea of how young people could review each of the five potential directions for Europe outlined within.<\/p> <p>  We are representing the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, which is the representative body for the voluntary youth sector, comprising 49 organisations working in the community with up to 38,000 young people aged ten to 24 years.  On the European level, NYCI is a member of the European Youth Forum and, in partnership with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, implements the EU structured dialogue process.  In Ireland we call it \"Young Voices\" because it is more appealing to young people.  The EU structured dialogue process is an engagement between young people and policymakers in order to implement the priorities of European policy co-operation and to make young people&rsquo;s voices heard in the European policy-shaping process.  This gives young people a voice on the European stage and also on a national stage, as we try to implement all recommendations on a national and local level.  It gives the NYCI an opportunity to link into the perspective of young people across the EU member states.<\/p> <p>  We have attended many consultations at European level on the future of Europe, but also on a range of different issues.  Mr. Nesirky and I have been speaking about the future of Europe and engaging in that.  We have had consultations with young people from throughout Ireland on the topic.  Mr. Nesirky and I have been involved in many consultations on a national and local level and today we will give feedback from the outcomes of these consultations.  What we are saying is not just our view, it is the view of young people with whom we have been engaging.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Nesirky will now discuss each direction offered in this report and review it in the context of impact on young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092000002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Vanessa Mulhall"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505905800,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I will review the five scenarios in the context of the impact on and desirability for young people.  The first scenario suggests carrying on.  As young people, we feel this suggestion is not really a tenable choice.  The concept of a static Europe is not an option for the future.  Since the inception of the European project, we have seen its form, spheres of influence and reach exist in a continuous state of change.  Change is one of the few constants in Europe and as young people we ask that we have the opportunity to be engaged in shaping this change.  A simple way to do this would be to extend the voting rights to 16 and 17 year olds and, therefore, the ability to vote in the 2019 European Parliament elections.  In Ireland alone, this would facilitate 127,000 young people aged 16 and 17 to have a say in deciding who represents them in the European Parliament.  It would give young people a sense of engagement and ownership in the future of Europe by bringing Europe down from Brussels and into their hands.  While a referendum is required to allow young people aged 16 and 17 to vote in D&aacute;il and presidential elections, this is not the case for local and European elections.  The Oireachtas could extend voting rights to young people aged 16 and 17 by means of legislation.  Giving young people the opportunity to democratically engage would counteract the feeling of disconnect from Europe.<\/p> <p>  The second scenario is to strip back on integration, bypassing more controversial areas of policy, and reduce the European Union to nothing but the Single Market.  Obviously, the Single Market brings many benefits to the economy, trade, tourism, etc.  Its four freedoms are vital for a country like Ireland with a small, open economy.  However, stripping the EU back to an economic and trading block is not the answer to the current challenges facing Europe.  Such a scenario would suggest that the EU will reduce its role on social issues, which, from our perspective, would be a negative development.  Young people want the EU to be more active on social issues, not less active.<\/p> <p>  The third scenario is referred to as \"Those who want to do more\", creating what the report has dubbed a \"coalition of the willing\" - a cluster of 15 countries willing to embrace more integration in criminal jurisdiction, defence, and social and economic policy.<\/p> <p>  While we, as young people, welcome further integration because it will likely lead to further progression and harmonisation in social policy, our initial feedback on this suggestion is a retaliation against a two-speed, two-tier Europe in the context of the impact it may have on young people.  In a Europe where member states differ when it comes to social policy, further division within the Union could amplify the sense of alienation towards Europe for the young people not within this internal union.  However, we recognise the need to be conscious of the current trends within the European Union and to view this scenario within this context.  We are currently seeing what could be described as an informal coalition of the unwilling, states which would rather face sanctions from the European Union rather than take in a quota of migrants.  This begs the question of whether a two-speed Europe is inevitable and, if so, how do Ireland and Europe play a role in the continuation of engagement with young people on this second level?  For these reasons, as young people, we hope this scenario does not come to fruition.<\/p> <p>  A consultation on Brexit organised by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs demonstrated that young people wish to remain in the EU and be part of its future and beyond that to embrace it.  They do not want to see a divided Europe.<\/p> <p>  The next scenario is called \"Doing less more efficiently\", a scenario in which the EU focuses on key issues, such as those suggested in the White Paper: trade, counter-terrorism, security and migration.  While efficiency is welcomed, we have concern over the selection of policy areas the EU proposes it would focus on and the lack of clarity on how these focal policy areas would be chosen.  If we are doing much less, who chooses what the focus areas are?  A Europe which focuses purely on trade, counter-terrorism, security, migration, the management of borders and defence could be perceived by young people as a step away from the idea of the European project we are working towards: a Europe where security is found through interdependence, rather than a Europe assisting in regulating borders to foster a sense of security.  This scenario, based on our view that social policy needs to be valued as an integral part of the Union, offers a regressive path for young people and Europe as a whole.  Europe needs to be a civic, social and cultural presence in the lives of young people as well as an economic one.<\/p> <p>  The final scenario is called \"Doing much more together\".  Throughout this presentation Ms Mulhall and I have hopefully communicated young people's desire for a Europe which tackles social issues as well as economic ones.  This final scenario is an opportunity for that.  Doing much more together is an opportunity to see a Europe which acts as a cohesive unit.  We believe a European approach to social policy will be beneficial to young people.<\/p> <p>  A Europe working together is a Europe which can be a decisive actor on the international stage.  For example, Europe could weigh in heavily on the Sustainable Development Goals, a strategy to ensure a sustainable world and one with which young people are engaging worldwide.  Europe has the responsibility to create the engagement mechanisms for civil society.  We need to bring the sustainable development goals to the heart of policy-making at European and member state level.  Working together on this strategy is the only opportunity for success.<\/p> <p>  The issue of climate, like that of human rights, has proved the need for engagement on a transnational level.  Young people have a clear stake in the future of our climate.  Europe could realise a response to the migration crisis by not only engaging with the migrants who need assistance, but also by tackling the causes at an international level.  Europe could use its collective power to look outward and have a positive global influence.  It is important not to be inward-looking but, instead, to be willing to help tackle issues such as poverty, inequality and social injustice on a global level.  We are more powerful together.<\/p> <p>  Whenever a heavily integrated Europe is mentioned on a political stage, as young people, we feel it is essential to bring up the point that while we should value the benefits of integration, we should also be cautious to move at a speed that does not alienate those who feel disconnected from the direction in which Europe is moving.  While an integrated Europe holds benefits for young people, forcing this integration upon those who feel disconnected may be detrimental.  This ties into the need to break Europe out of the \"Brussels bubble\", making Europe accessible and present in young people's lives.<\/p> <p>  I will hand back to Ms Mulhall, who will give some concrete examples of policy failures and successes in Europe and outline our conclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Nesirky"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505905800,"counter":484,"content":"<p>We see the benefit for young people in a Europe that does much more together, but economic and political decisions need to be placed in this context.  Too often the EU over-promises and under-delivers.  For example, we welcomed the decision of the EU institutions to allocate &euro;6 billion to address youth unemployment and implement the EU Youth Guarantee.  We heard a lot about how the Youth Guarantee would make a big difference in the lives of young people.  While we welcome the fact that youth unemployment has declined from 31% in 2012 to 13% in 2017, we can see that there is still a high level of long-term unemployment, which is something we really need to work on.  The implementation of the Youth Guarantee in Ireland has been disappointing.  We are not the only ones saying this.  We share this view with the European Court of Auditors, as shown by a recent report carried out by the court.<\/p> <p>  When the EU promises actions, it must do more to ensure implementation, and member states should work to implement what comes forth.  As we envisage the future of Europe, we should look beyond the most popular or easy options to create the best outcomes for Europe and for those who will carry on this project, namely, young people.  It should be a Europe where social policy and, in general, the idea of shared values at the heart of Europe are seen as important as policies on trade and economic development.  The social and economic dimensions of the EU should be seen as different sides of the same coin: one cannot have one without the other.  While Article 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union states that the EU will establish an internal market, it also states that the EU must aim at full employment and social progress, shall combat social exclusion and discrimination and shall promote social justice and protection, equality between women and men and solidarity between generations.  This also links back to the sustainable development goals and how we aim to reach them by 2030.  We need to incorporate that into the future of Europe also.  These elements are what we are asking for when we call for a European approach to social policy.<\/p> <p>  Nowhere better do we see this in action than through the ERASMUS+ programme, which empowers young people across Europe to engage through mobility to active citizenship and focuses on youth work, education, training and sport.  Youth work is also vital to the future of Europe as it shows that non-formal education for young people drives socio-economic progress and continues to invest in this highly successful programme.  Young people should not be treated as tokens but as actors in playing out the future of Europe.  We are seeing that happen today because we are here making a presentation, are part of the conversation on the future of Europe and are not taking this as a tokenistic meeting with politicians.  When designing the future Europe, we want young people to be considered in the democratic processes of the Union.  Europe needs to continue to fund initiatives that encourage young people's engagement in influencing policy, such as the EU structured dialogue process that I mentioned earlier and in which we have been involved with the NYCI.<\/p> <p>  The debate on the future of Europe is very important to young people.  We have had many consultations with young people who say they want to be part of Europe, they like being part of Europe, they feel a connection, Europe is no longer over there, we are part of it and we can see things happening and can see the progress.  I thank the committee for having invited us.  There is a Youth Work Changes Lives event happening in the Mansion House next Wednesday.  Everyone has been invited.  It is an opportunity for young people to meet politicians from their own constituencies, for members to hear our views on what is happening on a social level and for them to engage with young people on a political level.  I thank the committee for its time.

People such as us talk about the future of Europe, but the witnesses are the future of Ireland and of Europe.  We will not be here.

I am sure he was very busy down in his constituency all during the summer.  I welcome back our staff as well.  I welcome the National Youth Council of Ireland and I am delighted it is taking an interest in the White Paper on the Future of Europe because there seems to be little interest in it at present because of Brexit.  In fact, people are kind of frozen in time regarding Brexit, and the White Paper on the Future of Europe, which has been published, circulated and discussed, is not really getting that much attention.  I thank Mr. Nesirky and Ms Mulhall for their presentations.  I welcome Ms Cullen as well to today's meeting.  It is a wonderful opportunity for the National Youth Council of Ireland to appear before the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, and I know the witnesses appreciate that because while it takes a considerable number of votes to get into these Houses, they have the privilege of coming in today to make their case, which they did very well.  I wish all three of them a future in politics.  I hope they pursue political careers in whichever parties they wish or no party at all.<\/p> <p>  They have made some very important points.  There was a very practical suggestion regarding the local and European elections.  They made the point that there is no need for a referendum to allow 16 and 17 year olds a vote in those elections, and all parties and the Government should consider that suggestion very carefully.  I believe young people would participate in local elections.  The two elections would be held on the one day, I presume, in May.  As a result, young people would be involved in having a say in Europe because it really is their future.  This was not taken into consideration when Britain voted by 51.9% to leave the European Union.  My knowledge of the situation, and the witnesses are probably more aware of this and might be able to respond to it, is that the majority of young people who did so voted to remain.  Perhaps that is not correct.<\/p> <p>  Ms Mulhall mentioned the ERASMUS+ programme.  The British Government does not seem to be taking much interest in it.  It is one of the very successful initiatives of the EU.  My daughter participated in it in Italy and got married to a lovely young Italian.  They are now living in Roscommon and have a daughter.  There are many such families.  One of the greatest integrations of Europe ever came through that one programme.  Educationally and linguistically, it has brought many people together.  I do not have the numbers offhand but I know there have been thousands of marriages and partnerships through that programme.  However, there is no agreement yet as to whether young students in the United Kingdom will be able to participate in the ERASMUS+ programme after the UK leaves the EU, and that is a very serious situation.<\/p> <p>  Without further ado, I will just say the witnesses delivered a very good presentation.  They are highlighting the fact this White Paper exists.  People are genuinely not engaged with it.  I have received no representations or comments on it.  I think the witnesses are the first to do so.  Perhaps the Chairman or the secretariat will tell me about others who have appeared before the committee.  We have not had much time to discuss it in detail either.  The witnesses have kicked off this session by their participation in it, and I thank them for coming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092000002#C00300","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1505905800,"counter":487,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nesirky and Ms Mulhall for their presentation.  The National Youth Council of Ireland is the first delegation to make a presentation as part of our work programme on this issue, and that is very appropriate.  I note what they had to say about social issues and a social Europe.  That was a central theme coming through in their remarks.  They mentioned all the big issues of the day: youth unemployment, which is a big issue for Europe and, while not as big a problem in Ireland, one which obviously needs to be dealt with all the same, climate change, migration and so forth.  When we were talking outside they said they would not mention Brexit, and in one way that is a good thing in that we are moving on, but it is a fact that young people in the United Kingdom wholeheartedly supported the Remain campaign.<\/p><p>We should be conscious that young people see the EU as central to their future.  The European Union has brought about peace, prosperity and progress for many decades.  Obviously, young people would not remember the wars but it is clear to them that the European Union brings peace, prosperity and progress.<\/p><p> There is a movement towards greater integration and more enhanced co-operation in respect of defence and corporate tax harmonisation.  These signals are coming from the Franco-German alliance at the core of the European Union.  Does the National Youth Council of Ireland have a policy on Irish neutrality?  Certainly many people would be proud of the role we have played in foreign affairs in the United Nations, promoting peace and justice, basic human rights throughout the world and engaging in peacekeeping as part of a UN mandate.  Do they have a view on that in the context of talks about a more militarised European Union in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092000002#C00400","speaker":"1360","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505905800,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Haughey.

It is very good to see young people thinking about the future of Europe because that is what everybody has to think about.  The founding fathers of the European Community were specific in thinking about the future of Europe and Deputy Haughey referred to the impact of wars in the past.  I think young people need to focus specifically on that issue and its implications.  As we all know, regardless of age - I have no reason to believe that reducing the age of franchise is not a good thing and it may well be a good move - what is important is for whom one votes.  It will be important who that age cohort will vote for in the future.  Recent events tend to support that sufficient thought was not given to that in more than one instance, where the decisions of people who were elected had a very negative bearing on global events.  We no longer live in a narrow community but in a global community.  Modern communications has changed everything.  Travel has changed that.  The decisions taken today in one part of the globe may well affect all of us on the next day or very quickly afterwards and can have a very positive or negative effect, depending on the situation.  I will make a comparison.  Much focus has been made recently about tax equalisation throughout the EU and a case is pending before the European Court of Justice.  Many people think the outcome will be of benefit to Ireland if the court finds against Ireland.  That is not the case.  It will seriously disadvantage us and require us to collect taxes on profits earned in other countries.  That is something we should not do under any circumstances.  It will obviously make Ireland a negative area for foreign direct investment, which creates many jobs.  For example, 150,000 jobs in Ireland are funded directly through US foreign direct investment and we are grateful for that.  What few recognise readily is that about 85,000 jobs have been created by Irish direct investment in the US.  Let us remember that the population in the United States of America is 60 times the Irish population.  When we talk about foreign direct investment, and Ireland is a beneficiary particularly, we should remember also that Irish investors have been investing abroad and have created jobs in many jurisdictions but we do not get any recognition for that.  The pressure on Ireland to act collectively is not necessarily in the best interest of the country.  I agree entirely in respect of a two-speed European Union.  Smaller countries will come off worse except for those countries that are fostered in particular by one or two of the larger countries.  We have to fight our own corner. <\/p> <p> The voice of youth in the European Union is of major importance, as has been pointed out by other speakers.  The younger generation are thinking of their lives ahead and how decisions will affect them.  That is how it should be.  I think the older generation should also be thinking about their lives ahead but that does not always follow.  I think the concept of a social Europe has been on the back burner for a number of years, for the simple reason that the economic situation was not good.  Economic turmoil prevailed.  I have been a member of the Committee on European Union Affairs during all of that period and it was sad to see it happen.  When the economic resources go out the door, thinking falls on to the back burner.  I think as the economies throughout the European Union improve, social Europe will also improve.  The European Union did not cover itself in glory in the way it dealt with refugees.  I think that was appalling.  Yet, if one conducts a vox pop of the so-called man or woman in the street, one will find a little reticence, people will say they are not anti-European or anti-immigrant but they need to protect their own society.  It is correct to state we need to protect ourselves but we need to do so globally.  We need to protect all of us and not to think as if we were looking in on something.  We, the people of Europe, need to think European and take ownership of the European projects and do as these young people are doing, which is to take ownership of the future.  If we isolate ourselves from that, we will be going the wrong way.  Many people believe the answer is to have a directly-elected president of the European Union, but I am not so sure about that because one can always fire a person who has been appointed to a position, but one cannot readily fire the person who has been elected.  That point is always in the back of my mind.<\/p> <p>  This generation has a role and responsibility in the formation of the European Union of the future.  By virtue of its population mass the European Union will have a significant impact on global economies, the social economies and the way people coexist in the future.  I think now is a good time to focus on this concept and to relay those particular objectives and goals to our European leaders and those whom we elect to represent us in the European Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092000002#D00300","speaker":"1322"},{"type":"speech","time":1505905800,"counter":491,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Durkan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092000002#D00400","speaker":"1319"},{"type":"speech","time":1505905800,"counter":492,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and welcome Ms Vanessa Mulhall and Mr. Robert Nesirky.  I am very interested in their proposals on shaping policy and processes in the European Union.<\/p> <p>  As a teacher I often heard people complain about schools and colleges being locked up for the entire summer.  I wonder what the representatives of the National Youth Council would think were we to open the Parliament on a Saturday and allow a youth parliament, elected representatives from all over the country, similar to the elected Members of the D&aacute;il, to scrutinise legislation and to bring forward their views on legislation.  Do they feel they could engage with that process?  It might be a radical idea but if we want to hear the views of young voices, that is where we would hear them.  Too many people of my age make decisions for people of their age.  I think that is wrong.  I would be interested to hear their views on a youth parliament that would function as a parliament?  Perhaps we should extend that to the wider European movement.  I am not asking the members of the youth parliament to introduce legislation but merely to comment and appraise legislation.<\/p> <p>  I am 100% behind the idea of extending the vote to those aged 16 years.  I might have a selfish interest in it, in the not too distant future but I certainly believe that 16 and 17 year olds should have the vote.  I always found during my time in teaching that initially the class clown would be elected as the class representative, until people realised they did not want a joker but a person who could achieve things.  Very soon, after the first quarter, there would be a request to rerun the ballot and the astute and tough negotiators would be elected.  Admittedly I worked in further and not second level education.<\/p><p>I support the views of the witnesses on extending the vote to 16 and 17 year olds.  We already tried this with Senator Fintan Warfield's Bill in the Seanad which, sadly, got nowhere.  Have the witnesses personally, their extended friends or the National Youth Council started a lobbying campaign to ensure that we extend the franchise in local government and presidential elections?  I do not see any reason that we should not have people of 16 and 17 deciding on their local councillors.  <\/p><p> I am particularly concerned about the focus in Europe on the economic aspect of the Single Market.  The European project has a much wider brief.  For many years, I have felt that the European project has been taken over by the bureaucrats to a certain degree.  I also feel that governments go to Europe and negotiate particular things, and then come back and say Europe has imposed something on them and they have no choice.  The politicians say it is not their fault and that they should not lose their seats as they are only doing what Europe told them.  Do the witnesses feel the same way as I do?  All politicians, local and national, should step up to the plate and say they have negotiated something and they agree with it.  They should explain why they agree rather than trying to fob it off.<\/p><p> My colleagues mentioned the desire of Europe to integrate military issues, particularly in respect of defence.  Why have we not integrated police forces in respect of drugs and human trafficking in particular?  Would the witnesses prioritise the integration of police forces and the sharing of intelligence or would they go down the defence route?<\/p><p> Going back to the social issues, migration is a massive problem for Europe at the moment.  I have been out to Sicily to see it first hand.  I am deeply concerned that, of those who are taking these horrendous journeys across Africa particularly, and coming from Bangladesh as well and facing the perils of the Mediterranean, close to 95% are economic migrants.  Mr. Nesirky referred to taking responsibility for this issue and doing something in the countries of origin.  I have brought it up in Europe and here.  The likes of the big sports companies, for example, a large company in Meath, relocated to China.  We do not pay any less for the product that is now manufactured in China than we did when it was manufactured in Meath.  Clearly, the company is making a super-normal profit on cheap labour.  The same would be true of a company in Donegal that manufactured t-shirts and moved to Morocco to get labour at a fraction of the price.  Would the witnesses use the tax system to harmonise pricing and restore some of the funding that, for the want of a better description, is being plundered out of these cheap economies back into those economies to educate and train the people?<\/p><p> I thank the witnesses for taking the time to engage with the committee.  I would like to see them far more involved not just in youth affairs, but in everything.  After all, the legislation we pass in these Houses will affect them in a very short time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092000002#D00500","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505905800,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Craughwell.

What positive or negative effects might play out with regard to the future of Europe?  What can be done to assist this?  As my colleague, Senator Leyden, suggested earlier, it is a very worthwhile and important process for the engagement of young people through different European connections at different levels.  It is important for their own experience and progression.  What do we need to do to ensure that it is continued or opened up further?

The Erasmus plus programme was mentioned in terms of university education.  I remind the committee that the programme is an amalgamation of three different key actions.  It is a much broader church than members might think.  It enables informal and non-formal education across the EU member states and outside the Union.  Erasmus is a key part of the education aspect, which is the tide that raises all boats.  There is currently a campaign at European level called \"Erasmus times ten\".  Although that is a bit of a reach goal, it is asking the Commission to increase Erasmus funding in the upcoming budget.<\/p> <p>  The National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, does not have policies on Irish neutrality, tax or European defence.  On a broader level, Ireland has a global responsibility to be an influencer when it comes to facing up to multinational corporations and addressing atrocities committed around the world, on the European borders and, depending on who one asks, within our borders.  We are in Europe.  This report was a vision that was laid out by Mr. Juncker.  He is a leader and it is his job to present a vision.  In the conversations that we are having here and that are happening across Europe, we can tailor it down to a form with which we are all happy.  While there were some criticisms of tax and neutrality in this room, we also have to remember that we are part of these conversations.  We are one of 28 parties, currently, that will be involved.<\/p> <p>  There was a question about voting at age 16, which I will touch on very briefly.  It concerned young people and the weight of their vote, which could have a huge impact globally.  It was portrayed in a slightly negative light.  Young people are not a homogenous group.  One cannot point at them and say they are all going to vote for this party or influence an election in a particular way.  That is a key thing to remember.  Who cares if it would have a massive effect?  At least it would be democratic and at least it would be following those lines.<\/p> <p>  In Senator Craughwell's discussion of empowerment, he put forward a very interesting idea.  We need to acknowledge the institutions that already contribute to this engagement, including the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government as well as D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g and Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  The scrutiny of policy to which the Senator referred sort of exists already under the NYCI young voices programme.  Why do young people need to mirror the Parliament to scrutinise legislation?  Why do we need to be a mock-up of the Parliament?  Why do we not create an institution or facilitate this kind of scrutiny in a way that is youth friendly?  Maybe the parliamentary structure is not the best format for a young person to debate policy.  I can also understand the symbolic level of engagement it would allow and it sounds pretty great.  In the UK youth parliament elections last year, 1 million people voted.  That is an incredible mandate for those young MYPs and for the members of the Scottish youth parliament and the youth senate.  There are really good examples just on our doorstep and we also have some fantastic institutions in Ireland.  It is a question of constantly evaluating what we are doing and asking how we can do it better.  Perhaps Ms Mulhall would like to address the issue of the vote at age 16.  She has quite a lot of experience with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092000002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Nesirky"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505905800,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I was one of the young people who attended the debate in the Seanad on voting at age 16.  Even though I am not 16, I was left feeling really disappointed at the fact that it did not happen.  The NYCI has set up a committee of young people from all around the country, both under and over 16, to lobby on the issue.  I would stress the fact that anyone can vote for anybody.  Young people can make their own decisions on who they are going to vote for.  There is no wrong person to vote for.  If they have their views, so be it.  Older people can vote for who they want.  Young people should be able to do the same.<\/p><p>The idea of having a youth parliament is an amazing one.  We do have the comhairle and we have the structured dialogue, Young Voices, which has a reach of an awful lot of young people all around the country.  They have great engagements, which is unbelievable because when a lot of people talk about young people they say they are not engaged but when we go to consultations, the empowerment and passion to deal with political issues is amazing in terms of the energy that comes out of the room.  What young people want to do is engage with policy makers and decision makers on what is happening and what is affecting them.  It is what we want to do.<\/p><p> The NYCI, through working with European partners, has developed a youth check, seic &oacute;g in Irish.  Basically, that is an impact assessment tool for policy and legislation that is designed in the Parliament.  We designed these from BOBF, Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, from the five national outcomes.  There is a list of questions that would be checked against policies.  If the policy went against any of the questions that came out of BOBF, it would mean that the policy would have to be re-examined because it would have a negative effect on young people.  The whole idea of having a parliament for young people to attend is an amazing one because it would show at first hand what young people have to say and why our views need to be heard.  We are talking about the future of Europe.  The future is tomorrow; it is not years ahead.  Tomorrow, the next day and the day after that is the future.

I welcome the opportunity to address the Oireachtas joint committee on this important debate in European affairs, one which IBEC believes should be a priority in the agenda of the Government.  The Brexit negotiations must also remain an important priority for Ireland but they must not overshadow or restrict our attention and contribution to the debate on the future of Europe.<\/p> <p>  It is important to acknowledge from the outset that Ireland has benefitted enormously from EU membership.  We have grown from an inward-looking, protectionist economy to a highly competitive country with a strong business sector, providing good jobs and supporting high standards of living for our citizens.  The development of the European Single Market and EU trade policy have been critical in the internationalisation of Irish business.  These factors have helped diversify markets in and outside the EU, particularly for traditional sectors such as food and drink.  For example, we are major exporters of butter to Germany, lamb to France and dairy ingredients and infant formula to a wide range of global markets, including Asia.<\/p> <p>  Membership of the EU and Single Market has also helped maximise the growth and employment opportunities for a broad range of services businesses from computer to international financial services, including aviation leasing.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has also contributed to the success of the European project.  Our pro-business environment has attracted substantial foreign direct investment, FDI, to Ireland and to Europe.  That has helped transform our own economy, with multinational employment increasing from 65,000 in 1985 to nearly 200,000 in 2017.  It has also contributed to the building of an innovative ecosystem in Europe in areas such as technology, pharmaceuticals and medical devices - a fact that is all too often not understood or recognised by poorly informed commentators on the Irish economy.<\/p> <p>  Our continued ability to attract FDI and the success of the Irish business model is based on what the OECD terms \"substance\".  Our 12.5% rate of corporation tax is part of Ireland's unique offering and it is vital that we remain committed to retaining it.  However, it is not the only part of our attractiveness for investment.  Other factors include our well educated and flexible labour supply, our commitment to world-class high-end manufacturing and our well-developed clusters and participation in global supply chains.  Without those additional factors, Ireland could not attract the scale of investment to the EU that we do.<\/p> <p>  IBEC is committed to Ireland&rsquo;s continued EU membership and active participation in an EU based on strong values, including openness to investment and trade.  However, we recognise that the challenges facing Europe are more intense than ever &ndash; with Brexit, dealing with a migration crisis, populism challenging established political norms and an uncertain and more protectionist global environment.  Europe's responses to these challenges will determine not only the future of the EU but also Europe's influence in a world badly in need of positive stimuli.<\/p><p>Now is the time to reflect upon what Ireland wants from the EU and how we can continue to both benefit from and contribute to the future of the Union.  We are losing our traditional ally and closest neighbour so we need to build stronger alliances with others in the EU.  The EU itself is facing numerous challenges, from the shift in its relationship with major global partners, threats of terrorism, the migration crisis and more.  Ireland needs to think deeply about what it wants from the future of the EU.  We need to be strategic in paving our way forward, taking time to reflect upon what the most important issues are for our businesses and our citizens ensuring that the best way forward for Europe is also the best way forward for Ireland. <br\/><br\/>This year, the European Commission published a White Paper and five reflection papers on the future of Europe.  At his recent annual state of the Union address last Wednesday, the President of the Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, outlined his own views on the future of Europe.  IBEC supports the positive outlook<b><\/b>on the future of Europe and remains optimistic for what Europe can achieve for businesses and citizens alike with the right approach.  The EU is well on the way to full economic recovery after the crisis. <b><\/b>Ireland is a particularly good example<b><\/b>of how well-targeted policies coupled with a well-developed business model have led to strong economic growth and decreased unemployment in the wake of financial collapse.  Europe can become an engine for growth in the world. <br\/><br\/>We welcome the EU commitment to the trade agenda<b><\/b>and further opening of markets across the world.  IBEC has been a long-term supporter of trade deals that provide real opportunities for Irish business.  We look forward to conclusion of the EU free trade agreement with Japan, our major trading partner in Asia.  We also welcome opening negotiations with Australia and New Zealand.  Of course, the negotiation of each trade deal must be based on what is to be gained and what is to be given away via access to our EU markets.  In this context, negotiations can be complex and difficult.  The ongoing negotiations with the bloc of South American countries known as Mercosur is one such example.  However, it is essential that the right balance is achieved between gains and concessions, even if this takes longer than one might hope. <br\/><br\/>We also urge a sense of caution in respect of the investment screening proposed by the President Juncker and the Commission.  We accept that there may be a limited role for screening of foreign investment in strategic EU infrastructure assets such as ports.  However, we strongly believe that the Commission must not interfere with or delay normal foreign investment decisions by companies and member states.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Full completion of and competition in the Single Market has long been a key demand of IBEC of the European Commission.  We were pleased to hear President Juncker reiterate his call for a stronger Single Market and economic and monetary union, EMU.  These are the areas in which the EU can add real value, where it can be &ldquo;big on the big, and small on the small&rdquo;.  We hope that the current Commission and its successor ensure that deepening of the Single Market, including the digital single market, banking union and capital markets, are on the top of future EU agendas. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>We welcome President Juncker&rsquo;s proposal of setting up a task force on subsidiarity and proportionality, ensuring that the EU works only on those areas which it can add real value, and leaves issues best dealt with at national levels for member states&rsquo; competencies<b>.  <\/b>One such area is tax policy.  Tax policy is, and should remain, fully within the competence of the member states.  We are extremely concerned about President Juncker&rsquo;s suggestion on moving towards qualified majority voting on taxation.  Taxation is a sensitive area for member states, intrinsically linked with government spending, the nuanced requirements of member state social systems, infrastructure needs and business models.  It is essential that member states maintain full sovereignty when it comes to decision making on all taxation matters.  This is essential for Ireland to remain competitive in a post-Brexit world, given the fact that we are likely to be the member state most affected by Brexit. <br\/><br\/>A clear takeaway from the Commission agenda this year, which is clearly laid out in the White Paper, reflection papers and President Juncker&rsquo;s recent address, is that Europe is moving towards increased spending on security and defence<b>. <\/b>This is an unavoidable reality.  Cyber-threats are something with which the business community is particularly concerned.  Indeed, in June of this year, some Irish companies confirmed that their computer systems had been compromised by a global cyber-attack.  These are the types of new challenges that will continue to threaten the security of the business environment in coming years.  It is an area of extreme sensitivity, particularly in Ireland, but as our reality in Europe changes, we must face these challenges with a united front and ensure that we continue to be the best place in the world to live and do business. <br\/><br\/><b><\/b>I would like to conclude by outlining some principles on IBEC&rsquo;s vision for the future of Europe.  It must be an EU that adds value.  It should prioritise deepening of the Single Market, including completing the digital single market, capital markets union and banking union.  These are the areas in which the EU can have real added value and make tangible improvements in the business environment which, in turn, has positive knock-on effects for citizens through job creation, innovation and better choice.  It must be an EU that is more efficient<b>.  <\/b>To prosper, the EU must focus on efficiency and avoid interfering in areas best left to member states.  It must respect the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity.  Sensitive areas such as tax policy should be dealt with at member state level where they can be developed in a bespoke manner and tailored to the needs of a member state's citizens and business models.  It must be<b><\/b>an EU that is flexible and meets the needs of different member states<b>.  <\/b>Member states' individual needs and nuances should also be considered at a European level.  Ireland, for example, could benefit from having more flexibility in EU fiscal support and the Stability and Growth Pact rules, which would allow the Government to facilitate essential infrastructure developments, thereby allowing the country to harness growth opportunities and to provide quality housing, transport and health care for our citizens.  It must be an EU that is open to trade and investment.  The EU should continue prioritising ambitious trade deals with third countries, including with the UK post Brexit.  It is essential that the relationship between the UK and Ireland, which goes far beyond the establishment of the European Economic Community, is in no way jeopardised in the future relationship between the UK and EU.  This means ensuring that an ambitious trade deal, as similar to the current trading situation as possible, is reached as soon as possible. <br\/><br\/>I thank members for their attention and the opportunity to present IBEC's initial views on this important European debate.  IBEC will further consult with its members in the coming weeks and will be developing a fuller position that we plan to share with the Taoiseach, relevant Ministers and their Departments ahead of the scheduled discussions at European Council meetings later this year.  We would also be happy this share that position with the Chairman and committee.  I look forward to members' questions and subsequent discussion. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092000002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pat Ivory","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505905800,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ivory for his attention to detail.

IBEC will play a very important role.  I read with great interest its report on the priorities of Irish business in the EU-UK negotiations.  It is a comprehensive document and is worth reading for anyone in business.  IBEC represents about 70% of the Irish private sector workforce and has a staff of over 200 in seven locations around Ireland and in Brussels.  It had a seminar last week in Galway on its members' concerns.  It is very important that IBEC exists and that it is strengthened to cope with the future.<\/p> <p>  As far as the White Paper is concerned, Europe should not be frozen in time at this stage.  We must accept that there is going to be a British withdrawal; whether it is orderly or disorderly, they are not going to change it.  That is the message we are getting back.  I would recommend that the EU extend and continue membership negotiations with Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia.  We should not put off these new member states coming in.  We should increase membership from 27 to 30.<\/p><p>We have many documents, which the Chairman and secretariat know, from the Brexit negotiations.  We have documents on their aspirations for Northern Ireland and Ireland, position papers and future partnership papers; we are inundated with documentation.  The negotiations are under way and we could have many views on the outcome.  Everyone seems to be an expert but at the end of the day we really do not know the outcome.  The Prime Minister, Theresa May, will make a very important speech on Friday in which she will set out her situation.  We are meeting the European Parliament Brexit co-ordinator on Thursday morning in a joint session that will take place in the D&aacute;il Chamber and he will present his views.  We already met Michel Barnier.  I am going with the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly to Brussels this weekend to meet Mr. Barnier and others.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly has a Brexit committee to deal with the effects of Brexit.  In that case, we work alongside our British members, which is rather interesting.  <\/p><p> IBEC will probably not comment on this but I do not think there is an awareness in the Government of how serious this situation is.  There is plenty of talk about it.  I am convinced there should be a dedicated Brexit Minister who deals exclusively with Brexit issues.  It is fine tying it to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but it requires a dedicated Minister.  We have a dedicated spokesperson on Brexit, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and he is working very hard in that regard.  I presume that when Fianna F&aacute;il comes back into Government, we will have a Brexit Minister because the negotiation will still be going on at that stage.  <\/p><p> There should also be an Ireland-Europe house - I will not call it a Brexit house - in the Department of Agriculture on Kildare Street dedicated to displaying the effects of Brexit and the future of Ireland post-Brexit.  It should be a one-stop shop where people can go for information, whether the IFA or the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, and it should be absolutely dedicated to providing facts about Brexit and also the opportunities it presents.  Perhaps the witnesses are not in a position to encourage that but I actively encourage British companies to relocate part of their production to the Republic of Ireland, particularly the west of Ireland and my constituency of Roscommon-Galway, which is in close proximity to Ireland West Airport Knock.  It has the potential to provide an export hub for a similar airport in Europe such as Baden-Baden, which is in the centre of Europe.  It would be ideal for sensitive exports flying over Britain.<\/p><p> My concern is if we rely on going through Britain with our exports there could be delays in the tunnel or at customs and excise and so on.  We need to strengthen the roll-on, roll-off down in Rosslare.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport needs to be involved there.  It seems to have no interest.  The Minister has never visited Ireland West Airport Knock and he is obviously not interested in it.  I do not know if he has visited Rosslare.  That Department should be fully on top of the situation and should be seeking derogations and support from Europe for the development of the ports and airports in this country.  They could make a case for a derogation from state aid rules to allow an increase from 75% to 90% for the development of our regional airports.  There is plenty of work to do.  I actively encourage companies to look at the Republic of Ireland to ensure we have a foothold in the large European market after Brexit and without tariffs.  If they can link in with the availability of space in the regions, it would be a marvellous boost.  Let us be positive.  We will just have to take opportunities in what is presented to us in the future in an active way.  I ask the Government to please do something.  The republic of opportunities will not exist unless we solve Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092000002#G00300","speaker":"1393","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505905800,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Leyden and welcome his contribution.

Its constant briefs and work in the area has been most impressive and I put on record my congratulations in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On the future of Europe, one of the greatest threats is that of migration as it is occurring across Europe in an uncontrolled way.  It is a much bigger threat than Brexit.  Having been to Sicily to look at the problem, I am aware the refugee crisis, as it was traditionally known, is now a migration crisis largely based on economic migration rather than on refugees.  It is a problem for Europe.  Some of IBEC's members left this country to go to the cheaper economies to manufacture yet their prices have not changed.  Sports and t-shirt manufacturers, in particular, have gone to Morocco and China and other places.  I am interested in IBEC's view on tax and how the tax system may be used to equalise investment in those third world countries, in other words how to take the super-normal profits off them and reinvest them in those countries.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with the point made on delaying foreign direct investment.  No European unit should be able to control the FDI of any member state.  Member states are out there competing for foreign direct investment and IBEC has a role in that.  Without doubt, we have to look at Brexit as we look at the development of the European Union.  It is my view the British Government will not impose a border of any sort in the North of Ireland.  We will finish up with a situation like that on the frontier between Greece and Turkey where there is no frontier on the Turkish side but one on the Greek side.  It will eventually mean the Irish will be the people who finish up having to manage the Border, not the British.  <\/p> <p>  Last week, we met businesses in Cushendall and Rathlin Island in Northern Ireland.  I met a very large transport company in Cushendall which was going to relocate to Dublin because it will lose its customers if it does not.  The entire organisation of shell-fisheries will be wiped out on Rathlin Island.  Kelp production on Rathlin island will be wiped out.  Some of these are transferable to the Republic but some are not.  If there is no border, what is to stop 40 ft trailers coming across the Border?  If we have a divergence in standards, how will it impact the Irish market, for example, if British beef is coming through an open border?  The British have no interest in putting a border in place.  I am interested in the witnesses' view on that.  <\/p> <p>  The area of cyber security was mentioned.  It is an area in which I have a deep interest.  We are totally unprepared for serious cyber security management.  I am interested in IBEC's view on that.  As far as I recall, we have three people at the top of the cyber security system.  At times, some of them are not available because they are called away to other duties.  That is absolutely frightening.  On the weekend of the recent major attack, it is my understanding that nobody was on duty at all in the cyber security framework in Ireland, or at least nobody at a senior level.  I have been calling for some time for a director of national intelligence to take over these roles.  I am interested in the witnesses' view on that.  <\/p> <p>  I disagree with my colleague on the expansion of Europe.  I would be inclined to consolidate now rather than risk expanding to the point where we start diminishing marginal returns.  I am interested in the witnesses' view on that.  Those concerned with the Common Agricultural Policy, youth affairs and social affairs all want more money but there will be much less money when the British break with Europe.<\/p><p>I would be interested to hear how Dr. Ivory sees the change in income for the European project through its member states.  Does he see Ireland, and the other countries, having to pony up, so to speak, more money?  Do they have the money to pony up more?<\/p><p> I refer to the expansion of our ports.  I will be looking for the view of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, on this but it is my view that we cannot be transporting across the United Kingdom if we are looking at the possibility of tariffs on the way in and on the way out.  I would be interested in hearing Dr. Ivory's views on that.  I am sorry for having so many questions, Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092000002#H00800","speaker":"1390","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505905800,"counter":515,"content":"<p>That is great, but I have to explain something.

I was attending another IBEC meeting across the road; bilocation is still difficult.  I agree strongly with most of Dr. Ivory's views regarding the future of Europe and, in particular, the attempts by some personalities in Europe to control the investment in this country by one means or another but by circuitous means more particularly.  The proposal to force this country to collect taxes on profits earned in other jurisdictions is out of order and completely beyond the realm in terms of what Europe is about.  If that were to prevail, it would mean that this country as a location for foreign direct investment would become very unattractive.  I spoke about that earlier this morning and I want to emphasise it again now.<\/p> <p>  I would point out that we all have a role to play in Europe and in the future of Europe, and we should not be selective in that regard.  There are areas that need to be changed and that can be changed by agreement.  Some people believe that they should force the agreement, but that is not what Europe is about.<\/p> <p>  We must recognise also that Brexit is likely go one way or the other.  I do not accept that we have to acquiesce to anything imposed upon us by any member of the European Union which decides to exit the Union and that we have to comply with the regulation that will follow.  They have to comply with what follows.  They are the people who initiated it in the first place and they are the ones who have to provide for the outcome.<\/p> <p>  My last point relates to borders, customs and so on.  It cannot nor should it ever be possible that a country leaving the European Union can benefit as a result at the expense of the remaining members.  If that happens, the entire European project will close very quickly.  My belief is that there is an attempt to try to challenge that concept and if there is a break-off by a group of countries which see a different type of Europe, it is all over as far as some countries are concerned.  I would particularly emphasise the vulnerability of the smaller countries.

That is the reason we place so much emphasis in our policy document on customs and trade and examining how we can ensure that trade continues to flow between Ireland and the UK and also between Ireland, in transit across the UK, and our partners across Europe.<\/p> <p>  I accept that we should be looking at innovative solutions, perhaps in terms of developing trade through airports and linking in to other airports in Europe.  That is something that will be useful to explore, but the reality is that the vast majority of goods that move between Ireland and the UK and Ireland and the EU are through ports on roll on-roll off trucks through the UK into the other ports in Europe.  We have to find a sensible solution and in that context, Senator Leyden raised the issue of our partners in the UK on the business side.  We have agreement with our partners in the business community across Europe that the focus now should be on having a prolonged period of transition arrangements of a number of years to provide the space to work through all these complex issues and also to arrive at the best possible future trading relationship between the EU and the UK.  That is where we believe the attention should be focused in the negotiations.<\/p> <p>  We believe we need to keep under constant review the resources we are putting into cyber security in Ireland.  It is an increasing risk for business.  As an organisation, we have been doing much more in terms of looking at cyber security risks and threats.  We have established a digital economy policy committee, which is in constant dialogue with Departments, and cyber security would be one of the items dealt with in that regard.  We should examine all options, including having a director of national intelligence, and we should be working in close collaboration with our EU partners in terms of tackling cyber security into the future.<\/p> <p>  Senator Craughwell raised the issue of whether the tax system could be used to support development.  We have a very well developed Irish aid programme.  We are committed to the strategic development goals.  I will travel to Geneva in the coming weeks to speak at the World Trade Organization, WTO, on the strategic development goals and how they are achieved.<\/p> <p>  We have to maintain complete sovereignty over our tax system.  I welcome the comments from the Deputies and Senators, and the committee, that this is a critical item.  We hope that in the committee's report on the future of European tax policy, which is a critical item, it remains at member state level and a sovereignty issue for us.  There should be no movement towards qualified majority voting.  There should be no acceptance of a digital tax in Europe of an equalising nature, which is currently being discussed.  We believe those taxation issues are best left at member state level and the European Commission should not interfere in this particular area of member state competence.<\/p> <p>  We believe the future of Europe is a very important topic.  On migration, which the Senator raised also, we would say that Ireland has always had an open approach to accepting people here as much as possible.<\/p><p>We also have a flexible and educated labour force.  Many people from across the EU and further afield have contributed to business in Ireland and have helped to develop our business model.  We want that access to skilled and educated labour from across the EU to continue because it adds a great deal to our economy and our businesses avail of it.  This set-up also provides the well-educated Irish workforce, including young people, with good employment opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2017092000002#J01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pat Ivory","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505905800,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending today.

We want to stress the devastating impact of the housing and homelessness crisis on the well-being, human rights and dignity of our most vulnerable citizens; homeless families and children.  In particular, there is an urgent need for the State to move away from the private market approach to social housing delivery.  We argue that the State should put the same effort it put into saving the financial system in 2008 into addressing one of the most serious social crises the nation has faced in many years.<\/p> <p>  The research for our report, Investing in the Right to a Home: Housing, HAPs and Hubs, was conducted as part of a European Union Horizon 2020 funded research project called RE-InVEST.  This used a human rights capability, theoretical frameworks and participatory approach.  In our report, which was launched in July, we stated that the homeless crisis is going to worsen significantly.  Unfortunately, we have already been proven correct.  There was a shocking increase of 153 new children made homeless in Dublin in July.  The number of children who are homeless in Dublin has risen from 567 in June 2014 to 2,423 in July this year.  This is a 327% increase in three years.  At this rate of increase, we could see a situation where more than 6,000 children are homeless in Dublin by 2020.<\/p> <p>  Our research investigated the structural causes of the crisis of family homelessness.  We found it to be the outcome of the shift away from local authorities directly building social housing to neoliberal policies that have marketised, privatised and financialised the delivery of social and private housing.  This has shifted housing towards being a speculative commodity rather than a basic need and a human right.  Austerity, in particular, dealt a devastating blow to the provision of social housing.  In 1975, more than 7,000 local authority housing units were built in Ireland; in 2015, the figure was just 65.  The delivery of social housing was shifted primarily to the private rental market in 2014 with the introduction of the housing assistance payment, HAP, a measure that was cemented in Rebuilding Ireland whereby private rented housing was to provide over 65% of all new social housing.<\/p> <p>  The housing rights of the most vulnerable have diminished over time as policy has shifted from traditional social housing building programmes to the greater use of private rental subsidies.  Our research found that given the ease with which landlords can evict tenants from the private rental sector, the housing assistance payment fails to provide security of tenure and thus does not fulfil the right to housing of homeless families.  We found that vulnerable homeless families suffer a structural exclusion from the private rental market because they cannot compete with professionals for the limited available property.  They suffer a double discrimination from landlords as homeless families and as single mothers.  The families we worked with were putting huge effort into trying to find private rented accommodation.  This rejection, and their failure to compete, results in severe socio-emotional impacts on the mental health of the parents.  They feel they are responsible for failing to provide a home for their children.  This approach puts the responsibility for the homelessness crisis onto the families and thus exacerbates their feelings of social exclusion, shame and failure.<\/p> <p>  In addition, from a cost perspective, we found that direct social housing presents a far greater return than the housing assistance payment approach and State investment.  Over a 30 year lifetime, the HAP system will be &euro;23 billion more expensive than local authority provision.  International research shows that countries such as Denmark and Austria that provide a high level of state and non-market social and affordable rental housing, meet the housing needs of their populations much better than countries like Ireland where just 9% of the housing stock is social housing.  In Austria, for example, 24% of the housing stock is social housing.  Given the lack of supply in the private housing market, which is going to remain the case for a number of years to come, the only scenario we can see is a dramatic worsening of the housing and homelessness crisis, unless the State draws on international best practice on housing provision and provides an emergency State-building programme.<\/p> <p>  Our research has put forward five recommendations.  We feel that the State is failing these families and their children.  All the evidence points to a lack of institutional willingness to turn the State's resources towards meet basic housing needs of our most vulnerable.  We propose an increase in capital funding for local authorities, the redirection of the use of State-owned land for emergency building rather than marketing it to developers and the establishment of a semi-State affordable homes company.  Local authorities should have the obligation to source HAP accommodation for homeless families and to rehouse families if they lose their rented accommodation.  We also feel there needs to be an amendment to the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act in order that it will become more difficult for landlords to evict tenants.<\/p> <p>  I shall now hand over to my colleague and co-author of the report, Dr. Mary Murphy, to speak about hubs and the human right to housing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rory Hearne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505896200,"counter":538,"content":"<p>In our report, we wanted to draw attention to the reality of life in emergency homeless accommodation and the emerging family hubs.  We concentrated in particular on the emerging family hubs because we have a concern that these are seen as a panacea and a solution - albeit a temporary one - to the situation in which families in emergency hotel accommodation find themselves.<\/p> <p>  Our research found that while the family hubs are better than hotels, especially from a safety perspective - families told us they felt safer there - there are still a lot of shortfalls around the capacity of families to live any kind of normal family life in the family hubs.  Families are restricted in their capacity to parent and child development is restricted along with child well-being.  Education and employment is restricted and the maintenance of family and social networks is restricted.  Anything that one might care to name becomes very difficult to do.  To some degree, it is more difficult in a family hub than in a hotel because when one tries to maintain a regulatory environment that respects child protection guidelines, one is forced to put in a fairly strict regime of co-living.  That strict regime of co-living restricts people's capacity to live what we would might think of as a normal day; there are a lot of rules and regulations.  People feel they are under surveillance and they feel their lives are very controlled by the institutionalised system in which they are living.  There is a sense that it adds up to therapeutic incarceration whereby people are institutionalised and their capacity to function by themselves is curtailed and narrowed.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has a long, sad history of institutionalised responses to gendered forms of poverty and exclusion.  We need only think of the Magdalen laundries and direct provision in this regard.  Our real fear is that even with the best of intentions we may again be setting the State up with a system of institutionalised response to a social policy problem that will dig in and be with us for decades.  We are sounding strong warning bells in that respect.<\/p> <p>  It is very clear that even with the best response, as Dr. Hearne has outlined, this housing crisis will not be solvable in the next five or six years and these families are going to be there for a longer term.  It really worries us that there is not much sign or evidence that the State is taking seriously its obligation to these families over that longer period.  We do not see a plan to minimise the potential long-term damage that can happen to families when they are in such institutionalised settings, be they hotels or family hubs.<\/p> <p>  We would like to see a much more definitive policy.  Why are we using family hubs?  What is the policy rationale?  What is the funding?  What are the operational guidelines?  What is the regulatory framework?  What is the monitoring?  What are the rights of the families in those hubs and how are those rights enabled?  What is the redress when there are problems?  What are the safeguards to make sure they are not pushed, in a very coercive regime, sanctioned or penalised for failing to meet these rules we have been speaking about.  There is an awful lot more work to be done to explain the policy rationale behind family hubs and to minimise the potential long-term damage when families find themselves living there.<\/p> <p>  We caution that what we are seeing in this context is between that and a harder discourse beginning to emerge around families being too choosy in the context of whether they take up social housing offers.  We see a variety of different types of comments being made that add up to a sense that families are coming to be seen as the problem and not the structural issue of housing shortages.  That is really the problem.<\/p><p>Our fear is that over the next couple of years we will see families being blamed for the problem of homelessness rather than the shortage of social housing being identified as the structural problem we need to fix.  For that reason, we really do believe that we need to keep the spotlight on the need to make sure there are legislative obligations on the State to eradicate the problem of family homelessness.  That can be translated into small statutory instruments, such as time limits on the use of family hubs or sunset legislation that would require the State to dissolve the use of institutionalised responses to family homelessness within a certain timeframe, for example by 2020.  There are various ways of setting out legislative guarantees to make sure that family homelessness stays on the agenda and is managed out of the system.  We believe none of this will happen without a larger attempt to recognise that we are talking about serious power inequalities in this regard.  We are talking about a housing market dominated by big financial actors, increasingly international financial companies and financial speculators, and we are talking about a relatively conservative approach to interpreting the right to property in the 1937 Constitution.  That, alongside powerful political and media narratives, make people accept the market as an almost inevitable natural response to housing and we would argue that the cognitive lock of the market being seen as the primary vehicle to redress the housing problem, which is beginning to be edged out gradually, really needs to be broken much more forcefully in the political discourse.  <\/p><p> We believe there is much merit to stressing a strong rights-based approach to housing as a way of breaking that strong narrative of the market being the only solution.  The economic and social rights campaign had brought the case for a right to housing in the Constitution to the Constitutional Convention.  We still argue that this could be useful.  Beth Watts makes the point that when one has a rights-based approach, it allows one to find a priority when there are competing policy objectives.  For example, it is often said that we do not want to build large social housing complexes because they recreate social housing problems of the past.  That is put up as the reason the State needs to be timid about its response to building social housing.  We argue that if a right to housing was embedded, the right of a person to housing would trump the other kind of policy objections that exist to forcefully taking on board a strong social housing building programme, so it also-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I am going to cut Dr. Murphy off, if that is okay, and move to questions.

Dr. Hearne's focus was on the longer-term solutions on the best way to meet the social housing need that exists.  The Government keeps telling us that it is spending more money on social housing delivery than ever before, that money is no object and that the programme for newly built social housing is very ambitious.  This year, the capital spend is approximately &euro;733 million, which is half what it was back in 2007.  I seek the witnesses' comments in respect of their recommendation around capital funding increase.  What do the witnesses believe is the required level of investment, irrespective of what the delivery mechanism is, and what do they think is the requisite output of social housing ?  This year it will be approximately 4,500 real social housing units.  Only about 25% of the total social housing solutions, according to the Government, will be real social housing in that sense.<\/p> <p>  I am highly supportive of Dr. Murphy's proposals in terms of the sunset clause and the time limits.  One thing that has exercised this committee is the question of families in hubs.  I have been to the hub at the Mater Dei Institute, which is immeasurably better than a commercial hotel or bed and breakfast accommodation.  What does the Department need to be putting in place to ensure the best possible standards are met and that some of the reports from families in emergency accommodation to the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive that have got into the newspapers are not repeated in the hub?

If we achieve that, would we be protected from the housing bubbles and the boom and burst cycles we seem to continue to go through?<\/p> <p>  Most, if not all, social housing stock across Europe is off-balance sheet and is not constrained by fiscal policy.  I wonder whether we should be looking at a model in which our local authorities could deliver off-balance sheet social housing stock.  We need affordable housing as well as social housing.  I believe that this is putting huge demands on the whole housing sector.  I am aware that we will debate the constitutional right to a home in the D&aacute;il this evening and I wonder how much difference that would make if it was in place tomorrow morning.

The private rented market has been taken away from local authorities.  If one wants to apply for housing assistance payment, HAP, one has to go to Cork.  If one wants to get on the housing list, one might be waiting for up to six weeks before getting an appointment.  In an emergency, that should be done automatically and within a week.  The landlord must then fill out the HAP form.  As that form goes to Cork, it again is taken from the local authority.  Do the witnesses think that in the future, the Department should return those powers to the local authorities?  They used to look after all of the different rental schemes, such as rent allowance.  For one's first-time deposit, one must now apply to a social welfare office.  If someone comes to one's clinic and it is their first time applying for the housing list, they must now be sent to social welfare.  Everything is mixed up.  The local authorities should be given back the power to deal with all these situations.<\/p> <p>  The Government is looking at private arrangements.  It is looking at Cl&uacute;id, housing co-operatives and all the different private housing bodies.  That is not the way forward.  We need to build local authority houses, ensuring that extra staff are put into every local authority in the country and that they have all the powers necessary until this emergency housing crisis is over in order that it can be dealt with quickly.  There is nothing as quick as a local authority that can deal with the housing lists and HAP in its own area.<\/p> <p>  The Minister is now setting a cap.  If one earns more that &euro;26,500 one cannot go on a local authority housing list and therefore will not receive the HAP payments.  We are technically making these people homeless, because they are then in rented accommodation and they cannot afford to get a house or go on the housing list.  A whole new type of homelessness exists which is not being addressed.  Are these issues the witnesses believe the local authorities need to look at?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#E00500","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Murphy and Dr. Hearne for their presentations this morning but more importantly, for their report.  It is a serious piece of research and it raises many issues.  There are the five key issues the witnesses discussed, namely, prevention, stocks and flows, emergency housing, HAP - which was discussed in great detail and about which I share many of their concerns - security of tenure and the difficulties where tenants are walking the streets trying to identify a place in HAP.  I happen to live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and I can tell the committee that HAP accommodation cannot be found.  These people go back to the housing authority the next day and are told they need to go back out again, to get up a bit earlier and go on <i>daft.ie<\/i>.  These people do not even have a battery, never mind a plug or the ability to power up an IT platform.  They are simply demoralised.<\/p><p>There are places all around the country where rents are much higher than others and the witnesses have raised many concerns.  The reality is that it is Government policy.  HAP is a principal Government policy in respect of housing.<\/p><p>That needs to change.  I would be interested to hear about the witnesses' advocacy and campaigning in that regard.<\/p><p> I want to touch on a few of the other issues referred to.  The witnesses said the fastest, most effective way to prevent homelessness was to build houses and strengthen security of tenure.  I agree except that it is not the fastest way.  The reality is that it is taking time.  It is a slow process to roll out and it needs to happen faster.  That is the reality of it.  However, it is the most effective approach.  We need to avail of our landbanks and State assets in real estate.  We need to roll out the delivery of all forms of housing, be it private, affordable or social.  Let us not draw a distinction.  People are having difficulty accessing all forms of housing.  The witnesses said they would like to see the establishment of a new semi-State Irish affordable homes company as proposed by the National Economic and Social Council and detailed in the Nevin report.  We have recently heard about NAMA or the Government coming up with suggestions about that body's role in all of that. I would like to hear the witnesses' comments.  I am not sure that NAMA is particularly the right vehicle, given its history, to be doing this but I would be interested to hear what the witnesses have to say.  The witnesses said greater clarity is needed on HAP tenants and who sources them.  They might just share some of those experiences and what alternative there is in terms of local authority obligations and responsibilities.<\/p><p> The biggest difficulty I have with the presentation was what was said about hubs.  It is a little disingenuous and unfair to suggest hubs are potentially the next Magdalen laundries.  That is just carrying it a bit too far.  I had to bring an elderly man in his 70s to a hostel recently.  He had never been in a hostel before but had lost his home and his family through various circumstances.  He was in need of a home.  The first thing he said when he stepped into my car was that he was afraid and that he feared for his safety.  He was not talking about the wallpaper on the wall, a roof, or a two-storey, one-storey or bed-sitter dwelling.  He was talking about being afraid.  He said he did not mind going into support accommodation but he wanted to be secure.  Security was, strangely, more important than a roof over his head.  That is something I learned on that journey into town.  I have had the experience of having to bring people to hostels, which have been terrible places.  They have met people outside the door and been in fear.  Anything has to be better than what we called \"wet hostels\" and had in the past.<\/p><p> I am not saying it is a long-term solution and it needs to be something the Government clarifies.  It is a short-term response, which we need to emphasise, to an emergency need for people who are homeless and, in many cases, destitute.  Forget about the circumstances; they need a home and they have children.  We have seen time and again on television the one-bedroom accommodation for families.  I have spoken to people who have been in hubs and had a good experience.  It is not ideal but it is a hell of a lot better than what we are coming from.  It is important to get that out there.  I agree about the sunset clause and that it would be ideal in 2019 to phase them out, which may be what I would like to hear more about.  I take it the witnesses accept that hubs are better than the traditional emergency homeless accommodation we have had in the last two or three years.  While I accept that it is not enough, it is an improvement, which is worth noting.  It is not the panacea or solution and I agree with the reference in the presentation to the possibility of a sunset clause and phasing these hubs out.  That is positive.  It is also important that people go into hubs and are given a care or support plan and some guarantees about their transition from that hub to more permanent accommodation which is suited to their needs.  I refer to accommodation that is suitable to their needs because in this great debate about social housing we have lost sight of that idea of accommodation that is suited to their needs at this particular time.  That is something about which we have to be realistic in our housing policy.  I would appreciate it if the witnesses would touch on those points.<\/p><p> Finally, I agree with 99% of what the witnesses are saying.  It is positive and I am delighted that they have come here to share their experience and research.  They have put a spotlight on it, which is positive.  All of us across the room are open to new ways of looking at this issue and addressing it, regardless of ideology.  The final point about power, voice and participation goes for every one of us.  It is really important and valid that the people involved are empowered and part of the decision-making process.  However, it is a slow process.  Can the witnesses set out some of the weaknesses of the few hubs they have seen in recent times?  Can they identify additional matters that need to be addressed in respect of those hubs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#E00600","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I welcome the speakers.  I missed some of the presentation but if I picked it up correctly, it seems the witnesses were critical of HAP and the 30-year timeline.  As I understand it, HAP is initially intended to allow those who were on a severely restricted rent allowance and could not work to compete in the market for any accommodation in their city, town or village.  It empowers people in my area significantly.  I live in Drogheda and am delighted that the Minister introduced rent controls there yesterday.  It allows families who could never otherwise compete for a house to do so.  I disagree with the witness who said it was not value for money, albeit I may have misinterpreted what was said.  Of course it is value for money.  It puts power in the pockets of people to get a home which they otherwise could not, albeit to rent it.  Second, it allows people to work while continuing to receive HAP.  That is a significant change, which I very much welcome.  Under the old rent allowance system, one could not do that, which made it a real poverty trap.<\/p> <p>  I accept and acknowledge the points about the housing list problems and so on.  I do not know if the witnesses are aware of the Government's housing plans.  I am not aware that they referred to them, but there is significant funding for 47,000 social housing units in the Government policy to be constructed by 2021 with a budget of &euro;5.3 billion.  I do not know if that was mentioned but my impression is that it was not.  Perhaps I missed it being said.  From listening to the witnesses, I agree on all of the issues around family pressures and other difficulties.  If one does not have a home and a place to lay one's head, if one's children are not in secure accommodation and one does not have a park or a normal life as most of us who are older would define it, one has serious disadvantages.  I welcome very much the initiatives which have been taken and I would like the witnesses to comment on them if they can.<\/p> <p>  My next point goes back to a core issue for me.  More than 6,000 homes were offered by the Housing Agency to local authorities up and down the country, including Dublin.  More than 1,000 homes in Dublin were refused by local authorities under the process in which the Housing Agency was acting as an agent for NAMA.  When we talk about local authorities, I am not convinced.  I do not know if the witnesses have a view.  They did not want these houses and they did not take them.  I am not taking any blame from the Government as to what is and is not happening.  The fact is that local authorities did not perform.  When people talk about local authorities building homes, I am not convinced they have the capacity to do that.  I welcome the comment about a not-for-profit organisation that would do that or indeed a State body such as NAMA which might build homes.  That makes sense.  Such a body would have the scale and capacity to do it.  The National Building Agency built thousands of homes in the past.  I do not know if there are other people here who were on local authorities at the time.  The agency designed, built and managed houses on behalf of local authorities and made a very significant difference, certainly in the 1970s and 1980s when I was a local authority member.  The witnesses' comments are very welcome.  As Senator Boyhan said, they are putting the spotlight on issues.  However, they were not particularly balanced.  That is the truth of it.<\/p> <p>  While we are in this very difficult situation, for Sinn F&eacute;in to compare the amount of money spent in 2007 on housing, which was at the height of the boom, with the position now, which is at the end of the bust, is unreasonable.  The fact is that 100,000 houses a year were being produced then and the manner in which that was being done was unsustainable.  The Government is ramping up, albeit houses take a long time to build, a proper and adequate response, notwithstanding the huge issues that are there.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has the capacity to deliver and he is making the changes.<\/p><p>Do the witnesses have any comment, good, bad or indifferent, on Government spending policy?  I would be happy if they, as academics, would refer to those in their reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#F00200","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I have three questions.  My first question is on the housing assistance payment, HAP.  Some of the statistics the witnesses have provided in the section on HAP are staggering.  Mind-blowing would not be an exaggeration.  Their report states that HAP is an expensive policy option and far more costly than building social housing directly.  They calculate that over a period of 30 years in Dublin, &euro;274,128 more would be spent on securing a social house through HAP than would be spent on a direct State build through the local authorities.  Using Rebuilding Ireland's figure of 87,000 private rental units, they calculate that it would cost &euro;23.8 billion more than direct State builds by local authorities over 30 years.  If those statistics are anywhere near being correct, it means that Government policy on this issue is criminal and it is enriching landlords at the expense of society on a massive scale when better options are available.  I ask the witnesses to stand over those figures and go into them in more detail because the implications are huge.<\/p> <p>  When local authorities meet in November to set their budgets for next year, there is a very strong case for them to decide that enough funding should be set aside, whether through loans or direct Government grants, and enough plans should be put in place to build very large numbers of local authority homes in their jurisdictions next year.  There is a very strong argument that if those funds and plans are not in place, those budgets should not be passed and it should be put back into the court of Government, if necessary provoking a political crisis over this.  The statistics in the report indicating 8,794 local authority builds in 1975, more than 4,000 in 2006 and 75 in 2016 would justify such a stance.  Will the witnesses comment on a tripling of Exchequer capital funding to &euro;1 billion per annum to allow 5,000 such homes to be built within 16 months?<\/p> <p>  If tenants receive notice to quit coming into this winter on foot of economic evictions and rent rises, they should give serious consideration to the difficult step of refusing to co-operate to the notice to quit, thereby refusing to play a part in making themselves homeless.  I believe there would be strong support in many cases from friends, family, neighbours, housing activists and political parties of the left for such a stance.  I am putting that out there, but I am asking the authors of the report to comment on their call for the amending of Part 4, section 34 of the Private Residential Tenancies Act, essentially to allow a greater security of tenure for tenants, which would be a very important legislative change.  What do the witnesses have in mind in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#G00200","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I call Senator Grace O'Sullivan, who is the last committee member to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#G00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Murphy and Dr. Hearne for their report, Investing in the Right to a Home: Housing, HAPs and Hubs.  It is fantastic because it enables debate.  It highlights that we continue to be in a serious emergency state with regard to the supply of homes and the social responsibility of the Government.  The market forces are not delivering housing with any speed given the crisis we face.  The Government and we, as Members of the Oireachtas, are firefighting and not finding solutions at all.  Hubs are not homes.  Based on my understanding of the witnesses' report, the hubs are enabling a long-term problem in our society.  For the moment they are putting a roof over people's head, but that may not be the right social response in this emergency situation.  Local authorities should be empowered and given the capital to start supplying housing as soon as possible.  On security of tenure, people should not be forced to compete in the market and should not suffer the possibility of being evicted from their homes.  Is the Government's current policy sustainable given that we are in housing poverty and that we are seeing inequality in housing supply and a lack of sustainability?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#G00400","speaker":"1385"},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Murphy and Dr. Hearne for a great report and for highlighting a number of key issues facing us with this housing emergency.  I have a few questions on different areas that the report touches on.  I agree with them that ultimately we need to build social housing.  If we do not do that, everything else will not work and is not sustainable in the long term.  What annual output do we need to clear the waiting lists and deal with the current emergency?  Our view is that we need a minimum of 20,000 council houses a year for the next five years.  In so far as there may be a problem in ramping up output in year one - it could certainly be done by year two - what is the witnesses' view of compulsory acquisition and leasing of vacant properties as a way of ramping up output of social housing to the degree we need?<\/p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe we should stop using the term \"social housing\"?  In my opinion social housing has become a slippery term which can embrace everything including HAP, which they rightly criticise, voluntary housing, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and council houses.  Would they agree with the contention that a negligible proportion of the 110,000 social housing units that Rebuilding Ireland claimed it would deliver were actual council houses?  Should those of us who want to see increased output of public housing stop using the term \"social housing\" and be specific by saying \"council housing\" or \"public housing\"?<\/p><p>What do the witnesses have to say about affordable housing?<\/p><p> Connected to that is the issue of Part V and the reduction of the allocation to 10% rather than the 20%, which was made up of 10% social housing and 10% affordable housing, that we had in the past.  What are the witnesses' views on that and how it connects to the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF?  We have estimated that the development at Cherrywood, which at 8,000 units is going to be one of the biggest developments in the State, could solve the entire D&uacute;n Laoghaire housing crisis, in my opinion.  It will not, however, because we are only going to get 800 social housing units and we may only get as little as 1% affordable housing from the LIHAF funding for the &euro;15 million we have put in.  Have the witnesses any comment on that?<\/p><p> Do the witnesses think that the social mix argument that is being used by the Government essentially to privatise, part-privatise or to have public private partnerships on public land, which is what the Government proposes, is just an ideological argument to justify privatisation?  Is the stigmatisation of social housing implicit in this?  The implication is that if one has lots of public housing together, there will be anti-social problems.  Do the witnesses believe this is stigmatisation?  I do.  I believe it is also an excuse rather than pointing to the lack of services and infrastructure that were often associated with big public housing developments in the past.<\/p><p> With regard to HAP, Dr. Hearne is absolutely right to point out the issues around security of tenure, but I will agree with Deputy O'Dowd in one respect.  the one and only positive aspect of HAP is that it has a differential rent that allows a person to work.  The problem is the lack of security of tenure.  I am unsure if it was mentioned in the report but as well as the aspects of insecurity of tenure with HAP, it is even less secure than the previous rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  With RAS the local authority had an obligation to rehouse people if the private landlord pulled out, but people do not even have that option with HAP.  The suggestion that it is social housing in any shape or form is nonsense because a person is thrown back out to the wolves if the landlord pulls out.  This week I had dealings with a woman who was for the third time being thrown out of a HAP tenancy.  I will, by the way, credit the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I rang him up and asked if he could help this lady because they would not give her the homeless HAP.  She had had the homeless HAP but then was not homeless, so they would not give her the homeless HAP rate to get new accommodation when she was being evicted.  In fairness, after a phone call, the Minister Deputy Eoghan Murphy dealt with it.  It should not, however, have come to that.  It is crazy.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the eligibility thresholds.  This relates to the stigma and social mix aspects.  Do the witnesses think that rather than stigmatising groups we should raise the eligibility thresholds for social housing in order that it is not seen as something just for the very poorest of people?  In many other jurisdictions it is the case that social housing is a much more widespread option for people to get housing, regardless of social background.<\/p><p> The witnesses referred to the right to housing and constitutional issues.  The D&aacute;il will face a Bill today put forward by People Before Profit on precisely this issue.  Many housing NGOs have called for this measure over the years.  Will the witnesses assist us in the debate that will happen today?  I hope I am wrong but I suspect the Government will say it will not make any difference at all as a means of justifying voting down the Bill, even though for years the Government has been saying that the lack of such a guarantee was an obstacle to introducing some of the more radical measures we might take to deal with housing.  Perhaps the witnesses will elaborate a little more specifically on how inserting a constitutional right to housing and re-shifting the balance between private property rights and the common good in respect of housing would be beneficial in dealing with the housing crisis, stopping evictions, getting hold of landbanks etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#G00500","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":553,"content":"<p>Every day we hear figures of money being announced for housing here and there.

In 2013, eight houses were to be built in Killarney.  Four years later there has been much toing and froing between the local authority and the Department, after going through four stages of approval with the length of time the Department takes to come back.  That is why we still have almost 5,000 people on the waiting list in Killarney.<\/p> <p>  I was very disappointed to hear Deputy O'Dowd say that he believed that local authorities had lost their way in building houses.  He is just reiterating what the former Taoiseach said.  I was very angry when the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il that local authorities had lost their way in building houses.  They have lost their way because houses cannot be built if they do not have money.  The Department has created such a length of time before they finally give back the money.  One of the stages of approval requires that the price for the 20 houses, for example, be reduced.  We all know, however, that the price will be determined when the actual tender goes out and the contractors apply.

We have been speaking of the points they raised for a long time.  I believe, and we have always said, there should be a rights-based approach to housing and we totally agree that people should have a right to a home.  Dr. Hearne gave some statistics about 2015 during which 65 social houses were built, and it is quite clear where this crisis is coming from.  It is the lack of social housing.  Anyone who studies this issue can see this.  We have no affordable housing scheme from the Government, which is crazy.  The reality is that this is the nub.  We have heard the argument numerous times that we cannot build social and affordable housing schemes in areas and that private housing must be built.  I have literally had this up to the eyeballs.  We need to get down and build large housing estates, social and affordable.  We have to do it.  If this means buying land outside the perimeters of the city, that is an issue we should consider.<\/p><p> I listened to the programme on housing last night and it was interesting to hear the developers say that the price of land was a major problem.  Obviously, that is the case and we need to address that.  We cannot allow people to set massive prices on lands.  Some controls must be put in place and I would like to hear the witnesses' opinions on that.<\/p><p> On the cost of building, the prices continue to inflate.  From what I can see, the prices on houses are higher now than was the case at the height of the Celtic tiger period.  That was confirmed in the programme last night.  What is happening is ludicrous.<\/p><p> People talk about the housing assistance payment, HAP.  There is one aspect of HAP that really gets to me.  We have to get people into homes but we get them in and we talk about subsidising them.  It is the money landlords are getting that is driving many people out of their homes.  Landlords see that they can get &euro;1,300 or &euro;1,400 a month in rent.  The figure is creeping up all the time and whether we like it or not, there is a drive to put people out of homes.  It is sickening to see that.  Every day of the week people come into my office for the same reason, namely, the landlord is looking to get the house back to sell it.  It is disgusting.<\/p><p> I would like to hear more about the proposal on semi-State companies building social and affordable housing.  Regardless of whether it is done by the local authorities through a semi-State company that is set up, we have to go down that road as otherwise, this problem will plague us for the next number of years.<\/p><p> One of the greatest tragedies has been the remit NAMA was given to sell land and all the properties.  It is scandalous.  It is selling off land that speculators are buying and hoarding.  That is outrageous.  NAMA's remit should be changed.  It could have been changed by any Government.  Its social and affordable housing remit could have been given to local authorities instead of the nonsense we hear that housing units were offered to local authorities.  They were offered to the local authorities, which had to pay NAMA for flipping properties.  It baffles me that this was allowed.  I will finish on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#H00800","speaker":"1303","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Ellis.  I wish to make some points also and I will then call the witnesses.  To go back to what the report is about, namely, investing in the right to a home, without rehashing the debate, we all know what we have come from here.  Most of us in this room have been members of local authorities for long periods of time.  We saw the lack of direct build and when it was pulled back and went to private developers and so on; we do not need to rehash all of that.  However, we cannot provide social housing at the pace required for obvious reasons.  As there is a shortage of approximately 100,000 construction workers who are required in the next three years, to provide the homes we need we must have the skilled workers to go with that.<\/p> <p>  In the interim, it is emotive and disingenuous to refer to a hub as a Magdalen laundry or direct provision.  This committee was invited to the Mater Dei hub on Monday and to various other facilities that are provided.  I accept it is awful that any family should end up here but I was blown away by the hub in terms of the facilities that were provided and the supports for families and individuals.  There were family rooms and play rooms, chickens and hens running around the gardens, playground facilities, television rooms, computer rooms and private rooms for families if their child wanted to have a birthday party.  I am not saying all of that is ideal but it is making the best of a very bad situation for those families.  It is a short-term solution to allow time to provide long-term social homes.  It is important that we keep in mind the purpose of hubs.  They are a short-term solution to provide a better environment than a hotel room for families where they can bring up their children. Crosscare is doing a tremendous job.  In the first eight weeks, of the 29 families that are there, 14 now know where they are going in the next week or two and consequently, to say they will be there for the long term is a little unfair.  I am aware it will be site specific but half of the residents will be moved out within eight to nine weeks of first arriving at those hub facilities.<\/p> <p>  To return to some of the comments, Dr. Hearne mentioned State-owned lands being given to private developers.  I can only speak about a site we have in Shankill, which certainly is not being given to a private developer.  Senator Boyhan and I were very involved in this.  We have a concept for 540 social and affordable homes because affordability is equally a problem in terms of social houses.  That site is not being given to private developers.  It is being given to people who need a home, whether it be social or affordable.  We have to give people an opportunity to stay in their communities as well.<\/p> <p>  I fully agree with giving the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, more powers.  I am aware that has been ramped up but the new initiative where the landlord has to inform the RTB, at the same time as informing the tenant, if he or she intends to evict a tenant is a step that will not solve a problem but will help towards a solution.<\/p> <p>  The comment about lack of capacity to live a normal life in a hub is a fair one to make but it is a short-term solution.  We have to do our utmost to support any family who finds themselves in that situation but the services provided in Crosscare, whether they be baby-sitting, social services or educational facilities, were vast.  They even included cooking classes.  The clerk to the committee, Fiona Cashin, and I met some fantastic people who gave me great hope about the system.  It is rare to come across that because all we ever hear is negativity.  There was a gentleman there with his three year old child - I will not mention his name - who inspired me in terms of how he is trying to better himself.  The services being provided to him and his family have helped him greatly to get back on his feet.  It is important to recognise the help those families are getting.  He did not mention anything about a strict regime.  There were rules and regulations but to date there has not been a need to use them.<\/p> <p>  Local authorities have been given more powers and control.  I know it depends on the local authority area in which one resides.  Finances are not a problem in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  As the capital funding has been given to provide social housing upfront, it is not a problem.  However, the lack of schemes coming forward from the local authority is a problem.  A piece of land cannot be financed unless one has a scheme in front of one.  We can complain about the delays in the Department but one can still come up with a scheme.  That can all follow suit.  Money cannot be given to a piece of land without a scheme or concept on site.  It took local councillors in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown to come up with a scheme to go forward with a concept.  Many of those schemes, such as O'Devaney Gardens in Dublin City Council, are solutions that can be copied by other local authorities.  They should be encouraged to do so.<\/p> <p>  Many local authorities need additional staff and so on.  We all know the restrictions that are in place but to build the number of houses we need takes time.  We have a massive deficit in skilled workers who left this country during the recession to go to Australia or Canada.  How do we get them to return?  They need to know that this is not another boom and bust cycle and that there is longevity in the construction industry for them and their families before they will come back to this country.  Government policy is facilitating that in that what is happening is sustainable development.<\/p> <p>  We are pressed for time.  Many of the questions put are probably more relevant to the Department.

We cannot answer them all directly but will try to give a response to some of the key questions.<\/p> <p>  From our perspective, the reason this research is so important and what it raises is the impact on families as a result of their exclusion from what we call the market in terms of the use of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  They might get a house through the HAP in three or six months or two years' time but we found that there was an impact on their mental health and self-esteem as a result of trying to find private accommodation and being turned down and not getting replies from landlords.  That was having a devastating impact on them and their children.<\/p><p>We are destroying them as human beings in this period.  One day is too long in emergency accommodation.  We should not accept, as a republic, that we are putting our citizens through this.  In the analysis, we highlight there is a problem at the core of current housing<font color=\"#FF42F9\"><\/font>policy, which is the over-emphasis of and over-reliance on the private rental market.  We feel the balance is wrong.  Deputy O'Dowd is right that HAP has a role.  It can provide flexibility to people and it is very positive in terms of its ability to work when people are receiving it.  The problem is policy is too skewed towards it.  If we look at the Rebuilding Ireland plan, only 15% is to be newly constructed social housing.  The rest is various private market and predominantly private rental accommodation.  The problem is that it is exacerbating the housing crisis.  This brings us back to the need to build.  Rebuilding Ireland was welcome because it focused on the need for the State to do it.  There is a general consensus now that the State has to get out and build social housing.  There are a number of different ways it can do that.  It can do it through local authorities which are increasing their role at the moment.  We believe that should be the primary role and there should be increased capital.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked this question.  There should be about &euro;1.5 billion being spent right now for local authorities to build social housing.  It is a question of priority.  It would be a significant increase in budget.  If we want to address the housing crisis, we should be building 10,000 social housing local authority units per year.  On top of that, we should be building 20,000 affordable units.  That could be done through a semi-State housing body, either an arm's length company from local authorities or, as the Nevin Economic Research Institute has proposed, a separate company.  <br\/><br\/>The political system in the State does not have a sense of the scale of the crisis yet.  The housing and homelessness crisis will get significantly worse unless the State intervenes.  I have gone through the figures.  Rebuilding Ireland is inadequate if we look at what is coming down the pipeline.  I went through the first quarter figures for Rebuilding Ireland and in the four Dublin local authorities there are only 1,000 units on site at the moment and almost 2,000 further at various stages of planning.  At the quickest, over three years about 3,000 new social housing units will be delivered in the greater Dublin area.  It will not cover the new people who will become homeless in the next three years.  With waiting lists of 40,000 people in the greater Dublin area, we are talking about 40 years at that rate before we address the waiting list.  I highlight those figures because the scale of the response is required to meet the scale of the crisis.  Land is really important because we have significant public land banks.  We looked at the evidence on this approach by public-private partnerships in the past.  The land has been advertised to developers; it is not just being developed by local authorities.  There are ten sites in the greater Dublin area that are held by local authorities that on current plans will provide 3,000 social units and 7,000 private units.  Why are we not building a majority of social housing units?  Why are the local authorities not being supported to do that?  <br\/><br\/>I can provide statistics on the question that was asked about value for money.  Essentially what we are doing is giving between &euro;500 million and &euro;800 million to private landlords.  It is housing people but it is not providing housing through the housing assistance payment, HAP.  Over the 30-year period, that would provide 127,000 social housing units if the money was put into building rather than into the-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rory Hearne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":566,"content":"<p>I would not normally interrupt Dr. Hearne, but can I ask him what the other option is in the interim instead of that &euro;800 million that goes to private landlords for HAP or other measures?

I will address the comments on the family hubs raised by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, Senators Boyhan and O'Sullivan, the Chairman and others.  We have been accused of being emotive and disingenuous.  Our job was to go in as academics to look hard at what we saw and use the academic literature and international research to try to understand the situation and to take a long-term view of what we saw.  It is very clear the State is between a rock and a hard place.  Homeless families are between even sharper rocks and sharper hard places.  We have been absolutely clear that the family hubs provide a safer environment to live in than emergency accommodation, hotels or hostels.  We are absolutely clear about that.  That does not mean they are not problematic and that the longer a family is living in them, the more they are subject to the damage caused by institutionalising their family life, by deteriorating their capacity to parent effectively and reducing the opportunity for child well-being and development to happen as it normally would.  All the international research says not to do this.  All the international research says the longer families are in it, the more damaging it is.  We want people to hear this.  We are not being disingenuous.<\/p> <p>  We understand the pressure on the State to provide something that is not emergency hotel accommodation.  We would, like everybody else in the room, prefer that it was housing and we are stressing the need to build those houses.  In the meantime, if the State is reverting to an emergency policy response of using family hubs, it has an obligation to those families to mitigate the potential damage.  It can only do that by legislating for timeframes so families will not be in them long term.  It can only do it by having a sunset clause on the long-term use of these places by the State.  It must have operational guidelines informed not only by child protection guidelines, which are absolutely essential, but also by other guidelines on family well-being and parental autonomy.<\/p> <p>  There are lots of examples of best practice where families have to live in emergency accommodation.  There are other actors the State can draw in.  All the academics, including Irish academics, such as Paula Mayock, point to this.  IHREC has looked at it and pointed to it as well.  Things such as operational guidelines and systems of rights and redress are important.  There must also be systems whereby the residents in these places have participation rights and the power to inform the policy on how the places will be run as well as an inspection and regulatory regime.  We suggest it is the responsibility of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.<\/p> <p>  A new national homeless agency was also announced in the early feedback on the Rebuilding Ireland review.  There is obviously potential there.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs clearly has a role to play as well.  It is understandable why these places have evolved.  We spent time in them and we respect the work being done in them.  We know what are the aspirations of the families in them.  When we did the research, we also saw that the longer term reality of living in these places, even over a ten-week period, was that the families' mental health and capacity to make their lives work for them began to really deteriorate.  This is very real and we are not being disingenuous.  We are clearly saying they are better than some of the other alternatives but we need to take seriously that they really cannot be long term.  The only way we will be satisfied they will not be long term is if there are legal guarantees that they are not long term.  Legislation and a regulatory framework is required or those families run the risk of being left there for very long periods of time.  We make no apologies for the language we used and the historical examples we offered to stress the point we make.<\/p> <p>  I will make another point very quickly because I know we are constrained by time.  Deputy Pat Casey and Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett raised the issue of the rights-based approach.  I have offered one example of a rights-based approach and the need for a regulatory framework with legislative guidelines for the operation of the family hubs.  We are talking about a broader constitutional campaign on the right to housing.  We are asking whether it would make a real difference.  I think the difference it would make would be subtle.  It is not a panacea.  It would not solve anything overnight but in terms of the power imbalance that exists, it is worth having.  Beth Watts's research is very clear.  Not only does it have the capacity to shift the power narrative and the discourse I talked about, but when there are competing policy objectives, the right to housing as a clear policy priority in the context of competing objectives can take away vetoes that exist to the right to housing.<\/p><p>If you give the right to housing, you at least equalise those two competing rights.  You make it different.  It also raises issues of rights, voice and participation.  The other issue it raises, that does not get enough attention but I think it is important, concerns the context of the fiscal deficit and expenditure thresholds that are now being used as an international veto on expenditure on increasing the budget for social housing bills.  There was examples during the crisis where countries that had strong constitutional rights provisions for social policy in their constitutions were able legally to contest some of the fiscal rules that were given to them by the European Union.  Germany, Portugal and Latvia did it.  Having these provisions in our Constitution over the longer term gives us more national power as a sovereign to contest some of the fiscal frameworks that are stopping us from doing what we might otherwise want to do as a nation.  I think that is a very powerful argument that is probably not getting enough examination in the debate to date.  There are many reasons to pursue a right to housing in the Constitution.  As I have said, it is not a panacea and nobody should argue that it is the answer.  It is part of a suite of actions that are needed, but it certainly gives some tools that might be very useful both in the short and long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#K01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I apologise for having to cut Dr. Mary Murphy short, but if she would not mind, she could send responses to the questions that she did not get the opportunity to answer to the committee secretariat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#L00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505896200,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I have them all written down and we will be able to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Mary Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":579,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee, I thank Dr. Mary Murphy and Dr. Rory Hearne for coming before us this morning.

Given that there is a time pressure, I might deal with two issues.  First, I will provide the committee with a quick update on the actions we in the Department have been progressing in terms of addressing homelessness and second with the issues reflected in the report.<\/p> <p>  Members will be aware that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, arranged for a housing summit in August.  I will give the committee a quick update on what happened at that summit and I will provide the committee with a note after the meeting today in respect of the summit.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the actions that have been under way in respect of homelessness, members will be aware and have discussed today the budget provided for housing.  A sum of &euro;1.3 billion has been provided by the Government this year for social housing delivery, including longer-term accommodation for homeless families.  Last year, 3,000 households left homelessness and moved into sustainable tenancies.  In the first quarter of this year we have seen 900 additional households supported in exiting homelessness.  In spite of this very significant progress in supporting households to secure longer-term housing solutions, the level of new presentations remains challenging and the number of families accessing homeless accommodation has increased in the past year.  August will show a slight decrease in the number of families homeless in the Dublin region.  In terms of the commitment to use only commercial hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation, which we have discussed previously, for families in exceptional circumstances, more than 1,000 families have now exited such emergency accommodation since Rebuilding Ireland was published last year.  Five hundred families have been prevented from entering hotels.  In terms of the 647 families who were in hotels in the Dublin region at the end of May 2017, we have been working very hard with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE, to exit these families from hotels and more than 280 of these families had existed hotels and moved into more appropriate accommodation by the end of August.  We will be working in the coming period to exit the remaining families out of the hotels.<\/p> <p>  Members will have heard a great deal about hubs.  I will not go into detail on them but we can discuss them after my statement.  A sum of &euro;25 million has been made available for family hubs and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy recently announced a further allocation of &euro;20 million.  This is for the capital costs around the hubs and the very much needed wrap-around supports that we discussed earlier this morning, which we are putting in place in the hubs.  It is important to note that in excess of 1,000 homeless housing assistance payments have been put in place in Dublin since January 2017 arising from the recent housing summit.<\/p><p>Deputy Boyd Barrett and the Chairman have been very supportive of the place-finder service.  Arising from the housing summit, the HAP place-finder service is now also being rolled out nationally to each of the 31 local authorities to target HAP-supported rental properties for the households in emergency accommodation which we heard about this morning.  We will also have 200 additional beds in place in Dublin by the end of the year, which is on top of the 2,500 emergency beds in place nationally.  We have also heard this morning some discussion of the inter-agency group established by the Minister.  The group will be key to addressing some of the issues we heard about in family hubs around medical and psychological supports.<\/p><p> Turning briefly to the report, the Government has been very focused in terms of Rebuilding Ireland and the key issues raised in the report on addressing what is well understood as the key cause of the significant challenges in the housing sector, namely, undersupply.  The Rebuilding Ireland plan and the strategy for the rental sector published in December 2016 set out a range of measures to accelerate supply.  These include: the use of public land; changes to the regulatory and planning processes; funding for housing-related infrastructure; schemes to get vacant properties back into use; and a significantly increased social-housing programme, which we can discuss shortly.  In addition, the Minister announced recently a change to social housing building policy which will see the housing budget being reoriented to direct-build programmes for local authorities and housing bodies.  As a result, the current target for 2018 of 3,000 newly-built homes will increase by almost 30% to 3,800 such units.<\/p><p> HAP is a key delivery mechanism in the context of Rebuilding Ireland and an immediate and flexible form of housing support for households with a long-term housing need.  Any household assessed as eligible for social housing is immediately eligible for housing support through the HAP scheme.  HAP recipients can avail of full-time work and retain their housing support with an adjustment in their differential rent.  Under rent supplement, these households would have lost their housing support.  There are currently 27,100 active HAP tenancies with a total of 12,695 such tenancies being set up in 2017 to date.  These numbers indicate that Rebuilding Ireland's target of 15,000 tenancies to be supported by the scheme in 2017 will be met.  These tenancies involve more than 20,000 separate landlords and agents.<\/p><p> The evidence of the success of the HAP scheme suggests that many households want what HAP has to offer, namely, flexible housing support with access to long-term policies at a rent that is based on their ability to pay and the security of knowing they can work full time without losing their household support.  Comments made in the report on landlords being uninterested in the scheme certainly do not tally with the overall experience of the scheme's operation.  HAP addresses many long-standing issues raised by landlord groups and housing academics on the operation of rent supplement.  HAP scheme payments are made to the landlord on the tenant's behalf, which is to say that all payments are made electronically directly to the landlord.  In essence, the landlord does not have to collect the rent.  It is important to recognise that in developing the HAP scheme, every effort has been made to provide a strong level of long-term support while allowing for far greater flexibility of support, including speed of access to the scheme comparable to rent supplement.  All parties to the administration of the scheme are committed to providing prospective HAP tenants with the capacity to secure good quality, appropriate accommodation in the private market in the areas in which they want to live.<\/p><p> I move now to deal quickly with hubs.  In respect of the comments of Dr. Hearne and Dr. Murphy, it is important to be very clear that family hubs are designed to be an important first response for families who become homeless and who have no alternative other than commercial hotels.  Family hubs provide more appropriate and suitable accommodation for families than commercial hotels.  They are not a long-term housing solution as families will move into houses and apartments that will be provided under social housing supports as supply becomes available.  Housing authorities are working hard to ensure the progression of homeless families into independent tenancies as quickly as possible.  Indeed, since opening in June 2017, more than 50% of the families accommodated in the Mater Dei family hub, referred to by the Chairman earlier, have transitioned to more permanent homes.  Family hubs provide a more secure and stable placement for families on an ongoing basis, unlike the insecurity of hotel accommodation, especially during peak periods and holidays.  These custom-developed facilities offer family living arrangements with a greater level of stability than is possible in hotel accommodation while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Such arrangements facilitate more co-ordinated needs assessment and support planning, including on-site access to required services such as welfare, health and housing services, cooking and laundry facilities and appropriate family supports.<\/p><p> The Department recognises that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to meeting housing needs.  Households are different and their housing needs are different and will change over time.  If meeting housing need were simple, we would have no vacant social or private units in any local authority area.  We would have no households refusing offers of social housing on multiple occasions and we would not be striving to introduce greater choice and autonomy in the housing allocation process through initiatives like choice-based letting.  Achieving a balanced mix of solutions must remain a priority, even in the midst of the current housing issues we face.  The introduction of HAP is a major step forward in introducing flexibility to meet housing need.  Many of the households in HAP today will move to other forms of social-housing support over their lifetimes as their needs change and as more units become available.  Many will move out of social-housing supports as their need lessens.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for inviting us here today.  My colleagues, Mr. Brian Kenny and Mr. Thomas Gallagher, and I are more than happy to take any questions the members have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Hurley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Hurley.

I thank the committee for its invitation to the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, or DRHE, to attend this meeting to discuss the report.  My submission outlines the background to the DRHE's participation in the research of Dr. Murphy and Dr. Hearne.  I will respond to the policy recommendations for which the DRHE has responsibility, namely, the development of family hubs, initiatives aimed at preventing homelessness, the homeless HAP initiative, social-housing allocation policy relating to homeless persons and service-user participation.  Central to the business of the DRHE is a commitment to evidence-informed decision-making.  To this end, the DRHE has a dedicated research unit staffed with trained researchers who are tasked with the production of verified quality and comprehensive research and data.  This information is used to inform the development of operations and policy decisions around the DRHE's response to growing rates of homelessness.  Our national PASS office is the primary data source which has enabled us to track and report on the increase in family homelessness in the Dublin region.<\/p> <p>  Family homelessness became a noticeable issue towards the end of 2014.  In line with other major cities, hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation was used to deal with the sudden influx of families.  While the allocation of social housing to homeless households in the Dublin region increased, the rate was not sufficient to reduce or stabilise the number of housing homeless presentations.  It was not until the homeless HAP pilot began to take off in 2016 that the numbers entering homeless services began to stabilise with homeless presentations being prevented from entering homelessness as a result of using homeless HAP.  My submission outlines the numbers in homelessness moving to tenancies in the Dublin region and the types of tenure.<\/p> <p>  I turn to the rationale for the development of family hubs.  While the development of hubs has been unprecedented internationally, the decision to proceed was based on evidence that on-site support in temporary accommodation services was a more effective model of service delivery.  Emergency accommodation dispersed across the region, serviced by visiting support and support planning, has increased since the provision of the hubs.  In quarter 1 of 2017, we had 2,350 cases with support planning in place.  In quarter 2, following the introduction of the hubs, we have gone up to 2,550.  In addition, research conducted by the DRHE in 2015 identified similar issues to those identified in the report before the committee.  It highlighted the need for improved physical design of spaces for families that operated to respect autonomy and facilitate moves to tenancies within the shortest possible timeframe.  As such, the DRHE began planning for the development of hubs containing the range of services outlined in my report.  It should be noted that the national quality standards and departmental guidelines were being developed and actively used to inform the development of services prior to the publication of the report of Dr. Murphy and Dr. Hearne.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the national quality standards and the departmental guidelines were developed and were actively used to inform the development of services prior to the publication of the report compiled by Dr. Hearne and Dr. Murphy.  The guidelines include inspection, evaluation, redress and participation, all issues which were raised by Dr. Murphy and Dr. Hearne.  There is broad recognition that hubs are more favourable than hotels and are an important first response to families who become homeless and have no alternative other than commercial hotels.  They are not long-term housing solutions, however.  As Dublin is the first region to adopt hubs as an emergency accommodation mechanism, the research unit of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive - I am joined today by the head of research - will develop an evaluation methodology using the national quality standards framework as a reference point to monitor and inform best practice in their operation.<\/p><p> I want to outline briefly the features that are in the hubs.  This issue was raised by Dr. Murphy.  All family hubs are retrofitted to adhere to current building standards.  Strict quality controls are in place to ensure all facilities are fully regulated with regard to fire and disabled access.  There are space standards in place.  The hubs are operated by professional staff.  They are subject to service level agreements with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive.  All families retain their homeless priority on the social housing list.  All hubs are subject to good neighbour, good visitor and child protection policies.  We have a community liaison officer in place who is tasked with ensuring everyone who accesses these services is linked with local community services.  All hubs have access to key workers for support planning.  As I mentioned earlier, the effect of this is that support planning is now in place for more families than heretofore.  There is an exit strategy.  Nobody is being held in family hubs against his or her will.  Everyone has a right to move on and to exit into HAP or any other form of social housing he or she wishes to use.  There is assistance with travel costs.  Leap cards are available to people in hubs.  Free child care places are provided.<\/p><p> Preventing homelessness in the first instance and supporting people to retain their homes is one of the main priorities of central government, statutory services and State-funded homeless services.  The four local authorities and Threshold, through the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, work in collaboration on the tenancy protection service.  Since the launch of that service in June 2014, some 3,160 households have had their tenancies protected.  In addition, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive appointed prevention officers in February of this year.  They work with families as they present to assist them to remain in their current accommodation or to move on to alternative appropriate accommodation as quickly as possible through our place-finder service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Eileen Gleeson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":590,"content":"<p>Does Ms Gleeson mind if I move on to questions at this point?

I want to make it clear that families taking up HAP tenancies are not taken off the housing waiting list.  They remain on the transfer list.  Tenancy sustainment is a big part of our role.  We have a huge range of visiting supports for people who move on to tenancies.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive has been investing in the development of prevention of services and will continue to do so.  We can verify the allocation mechanism for our social housing.  It is transparent.  Allocations to local authorities or approved housing bodies continue to account for significant numbers of tenancies.  Overall, the infrastructure is now in place to continue to develop hubs and to ensure we capture learning and feed it back to ensure services work as effectively as possible.

When we are discussing hubs, it is important to note the concern that not all of the hubs will have the level of service and quality of Mater Dei, which many of us have visited.  I refer particularly to the hubs that will be in refurbished commercial units.  I think that concern is part of what is driving this conversation.  There is also a fear that the significant level of public pressure that has developed on foot of the housing of large numbers of families and children in commercial hotels will diminish as more and more families move into hubs and, as a result, families could end up being in hubs longer than we might want, even if that is not what is intended.  I want to make our concerns in this regard clear.<\/p> <p>  I would like to ask Ms Gleeson about the quality standards framework and the quality standards office that the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and the lead authorities have been working on.  Can she tell the committee what level of resourcing will be required?  What staff levels will be required?  I am aware that a three-year rollout programme is being developed and discussed with the Department.  It is all very well to have very good quality standards on paper.  I am fully supportive of the work that the Dublin Region Homeless Executive wants to be done.  We need to know what the Minister needs to provide in next month's budget to make the work that the executive has been doing in recent times a reality.<\/p> <p>  I disagree with Ms Gleeson in one regard.  HAP families are taken off the principal housing waiting lists.  They are not featuring in the figures.  In all but one local authority, they do not have access to the main allocation system.  Ms Gleeson is right when she says they have access to transfers, but that is a very fundamental difference.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for the officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  How many families are in hubs now?  What is the timeframe for the future rollout of a number of families into hubs?  Some commercial sites are currently being refurbished into hubs.  Obviously, that is taking beds out of the emergency system.  How many beds have been taken out as a result of that?  How many adults and children are still in commercial hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation?  The idea underpinning hubs is that there will be a reduction in the number of families in commercial hotels as the number of families in hubs increases.  My fear is that because of the increasing number of presentations, we will have the same number of families in hotels, albeit new ones, as well as the families in hubs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#N00700","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

First, can the departmental officials tell us where the Department is at with the resourcing of the quality standards framework office?  Second, the crucial problem with HAP in all local authorities other than South Dublin County Council is that it leads to families being taken off the principal choice-based letting allocation system.  One local authority has made a change to ensure families do not lose their crucial places on the allocation system.  Will the Department seriously consider changing the HAP rules to allow all local authorities to do what South Dublin County Council is doing?  Such a move would resolve the central problem with the current approach to HAP, which was adding six years to the wait for a council house in south Dublin, in addition to the 11-year waiting time that exists anyway.  I think the Department should recommend this very simple change, which does not require legislation, to all local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#N00900","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I welcome the clarity in the figures.  I also welcome the extremely active and welcome response of the agencies and the Department.  I will concentrate on questions.  I presume the witnesses are aware of Louth County Council's successful initiative which involves compulsorily purchasing empty homes at an average cost of less than &euro;100,000 per household, including all legal and reconstruction costs.  Over 30 homes have been brought back into full family use within a year.  Will the Department or the agencies accelerate this extremely helpful programme?  I reckon it should be possible to bring at least 2,000 additional social homes into commission within a year.<\/p> <p>  I am very concerned about the second issue I would like to raise.  The CSO seems to disagree profoundly with Fingal County Council on the number of empty homes in the Fingal area.  The CSO is very clear on what defines an empty home or an empty property.  Fingal County Council disagrees profoundly with that.  According to the CSO, there are approximately 36,000 empty homes in Dublin.  A gain could be made by bringing 3,000 of them back into commission by means of an empty homes tax or some other approach.  Can we clarify whether these properties are vacant?  The CSO has suggested that as it surveyed homes in Dublin in 2016, it found that one in every ten homes was vacant.  If it transpires that there are families in these homes, it will have been a huge error.  Perhaps Fingal County Council has made an error.  This goes to the heart of the credibility of the CSO statistics themselves, never mind the Garda breath tests.  I know the CSO figures are not wrong by 185,000.

By the way, it was very helpful that many of the witnesses were here at the first session because these two issues totally overlap.  The witnesses might comment on the sunset clause set out by Dr. Hearne and Dr. Murphy with regard to the ending of hubs in December 2019 and the practicalities of that.  Would they share that ambition?<\/p> <p>  On hotels, we had great fanfare when the previous Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, was in here about Rebuilding Ireland.  He emphatically told us there would be no hotels in a year or so.  That has not happened and we cannot go back on it.  However, what is the objective of the Department in terms of a date and a timeframe for the total cessation of anyone being accommodated in hotel accommodation?  Could we have a date and an ambition for, and no vagueness on, that?  When is it intended to do that?<\/p> <p>  I welcome the shift back to direct building.  That is important.  The Minister talks about the new inter-agency homeless group.  Who is on that group?  What is its remit and its format?  How will it actively set about its work?  The witnesses might share that with us in the next week or two.  Whenever they have a moment, I would like to hear more about it.<\/p> <p>  My fourth point concerns the use of public lands.  I have raised time and again the lack of verifiable data on public lands.  I want to zone in on local authority lands.  We know from the Department's own local government auditors, who examine internally within the Custom House the returns for the 31 local authorities, that they have found substantial shortcomings in them.  I mention particularly D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council because that is the one I know.  I looked at the last audit report today.  It is on the Department's website, which states that there is a shortcoming here and that it wants a complete inventory of the lands within the local authority.  I have written to the Department about it.  I do not know what is going on here.  The last audit carried out, which is published online, for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is that of 2015-2016.  That is really important.  We need hard facts and hard data on sites.  If we are serious about availing of and building on local authority lands, in particular, although I would not rule out any other State lands, we need a detailed inventory.  I would like that to be prioritised if at all possible.<\/p> <p>  I know it is pre-budget so they may not wish to comment on it, but is there any intention to look at increasing the housing assistance payment or the rent supplement limits given current market rents?

First, I acknowledge the work that the Department has done in terms of what it has achieved, such as 3,000 exiting homelessness.  Equally, however, we must acknowledge that the cumulative effect of homelessness is continuing to rise.  While 3,000 exit, another 3,000 plus replace them.<\/p> <p>  On the use of hotels as emergency accommodation, is there evidence to show that we are expanding outside Dublin and using hotels in the neighbouring counties to address the homelessness crisis in Dublin?  I am getting anecdotal evidence from my county that is in fact the case and that we are now moving people out of Dublin into, for example, rural areas in County Wicklow.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the policy shift to direct building housing by the local authority.  However, are we just moving the same funding from one source of supply to another source of supply?  Will it deliver additional housing units or is it just that the method by which they will be delivered has changed?<\/p> <p>  Why did we create the transfer list in the first place?

It is on the issue of hubs.  I want to briefly read into the record some quotes because the quotes in the report are really interesting and important and it is important the voice of the people in the hubs is heard.  The researchers were told by various parents that they felt their parenting was being checked all the time, that they got warnings, that the hubs felt like institutions, that they did not need their authority taken away from them in front of their children, that they were taking the parenting role from the parent and that when someone spoke to them like this, they feel they are on the bottom.<\/p> <p>  The hub at Clonliffe Road has been mentioned more than once in this discussion.  My first question is whether the witnesses feel there is a possibility of so-called good, showcase hubs being promoted whereas the reality in other hubs is quite different.  On the question of a sunset clause, would Ms Gleeson and Ms Hurley comment on reports and information that we have that the State is in negotiation with owners of buildings to get those buildings for hubs and what is being discussed is five-year leases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#O00300","speaker":"1432"},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I agree with previous speakers on the housing assistance payment.  Things need to be clarified.  The HAP forms go to the landlord and then to Cork, because it has left local authorities.  I have massive issues with that.  All the HAP applications should be left with the 31 local authorities.  When put on the HAP, there was a question on the form asking if the applicant wanted to stay on the housing list.  That was on the form but many people did not understand it and did not fill it in.  There was massive confusion and that needs to be sorted.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is the cap.  Many people are becoming homeless because of the cap.  They are not qualifying.  We all want to welcome the &euro;45 million going into the hubs in Dublin.  That is fine and it is welcome.  Everyone needs a home.  However, it is necessary to qualify to get the benefit of rent control.  A list was made recently in respect of rent control.  Carlow-Kilkenny is my area.  Most of us do not qualify.  That is unreal.  We are putting hubs in the cities, which is fine and I have no problem with the &euro;45 million going into that.  However, we need to examine the rural areas and say that they should be put into the rent control categories.  What is happening is resulting in a divide.  Rural areas are being forgotten and the focus is on the hubs, Dublin and the cities.  The Department needs to look at other areas.<\/p> <p>  I have massive issues with the housing list.  As the witnesses know, many people do not qualify for the housing list if they already have a home.  However, if their home is repossessed and the house is sold, it takes a long time to get that sorted.  If the person's name is still on that house, although he or she is not in it because the bank has taken it or it is up for sale and the person is renting somewhere else, he or she is not able to go on the housing list because his or her name is on another house.<\/p> <p>  We are making people homeless.  We have the cap and they do not qualify to go on the housing list.  We have people whose houses, through no fault of their own, are being repossessed by the bank.  The process is so long that they are not qualifying to go on the housing list.  Furthermore, they are not qualifying for rent allowance because the Department is now taking away the rent allowance that used to help those who did not qualify to go on the housing list.  I have massive issues with that.<\/p> <p>  We were delighted to have the Minister in Carlow over a month ago.  I was not at the meeting, although I am highlighting it.  He announced more than 100 houses.  Some of them are co-operative houses and some of them are local authority houses and I welcome that.  However, the problem is that a sod has not been turned in a month and there is no timescale.  We knew about these projects a year ago but the Minister announced them a month ago.  We cannot get a timescale.  What I am saying is that all the money we are told is there is not coming through to local authorities.  That is why local authorities are not able to do the work they have to do.  The powers need to be given back to the local authorities.  They need to build more housing and we need to ensure that happens as I do not think it is happening.<\/p> <p>  To return to the rental accommodation scheme, which is similar to the housing assistance payment-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#O00400","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":604,"content":"<p>If the Senator does not mind, I will bring her back in.

Have the local authorities advised the Minister that a State company must be established, perhaps with local authorities, to build more social and affordable housing?

It is crucial that we establish such a company to address our social and affordable housing needs.  <\/p><p> In terms of CPOs, I have talked about compulsory purchase orders to Mr. Tony Flynn and Mr. Brendan Kenny on many occasions.

That means the list of 5,000 will be longer, even with the current plans, than it is now at the end of the next year or the year after.  Is the Department tracking the amount of new applications?

What is the latest thinking on defining affordable housing?  At the end of last year the Minister issued a circular saying that the &euro;300,000 limit must be varied because the market figures are much higher.  That means affordable housing will mean more than &euro;300,000.  A huge number of people cannot afford to pay &euro;300,000 for a home.  Therefore, going above the sum of &euro;300,000 makes the words \"affordable housing\" meaningless.  What proportion of money will we get back for LIHAF funding?  We understand in D&uacute;n Laoghaire that for &euro;15 million LIHAF funding for Cherrywood we will get 1% of the Cherrywood development.  It is shocking if that is true.<\/p> <p>  Does the Department plan to engage with NAMA given the current discussions and the Taoiseach stating that using NAMA's assets and capacities is long overdue?

Yes, there seems to be a divergence in numbers.  The Minister has established a vacant house unit in his Department.  We are working on the vacant house strategy at the moment so many matters will be clarified.  One thing is certain there are not the amount of vacant units that people think exist.  Obviously the Department will try to maximise the use of vacant units through various social housing schemes.  For example, the repair and leasing scheme, the buy and renew scheme and also making vacant units available for private use.  <\/p> <p>  Senator Boyhan raised a number of queries.  He said it was critical to establish an inter-agency group to address the homeless issue and provide joined-up services.  We are all aware that homeless people have complex needs.  An inter-agency group has been established and Mr. John Murphy, the former Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has been appointed to Chair the group.  The Minister and I have met him.  Plus the inter-agency group will hold its first meeting on 5 October.  The meeting will involve engagement with a range of stakeholders that deliver services to homeless people. <\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned sunset clauses and hubs.  Our overall ambition is to move people out of hubs as quickly as possible and there is evidence of a 50% turnover in the number of families who resided at the Mater Dei facility.  Some cases are a little more complex than others and it can be hard to move people on.<\/p><p>Members can rest assured that we will be working to get people out of the hubs as quickly as possible.  Ms Gleeson and her team have put various initiatives in place and key workers and place finders to assist families.  I know Deputy Boyd Barrett has raised the place finder service on a number of occasions.  In the four Dublin authorities the DRHE provided a place finding service but the Minister, Deputy Murphy, has committed to a physical place finding service in each of the areas and across the 31 local authority areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017092000002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary Hurley","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505896200,"counter":613,"content":"<p>I am sorry but I have to cut Ms Hurley off as another committee is coming in.

The measure of any democracy is the manner in which the needs of the most vulnerable are considered and met.  What I propose to do is not to read through the opening statement which members have before them but to outline in summary form the issues I have addressed so as to provide sufficient time for me to answer questions on what is in the audit report.<\/p> <p>  It is my view that when a child is taken into the care of the State, the State is saying it can do a better job than the parents, and if the State fails the child a second time, that can have devastating consequences for the child involved.  What the audit provides is a unique window into what happens when parents fail children, when the State fails children and children are allowed to drift rudderless.  Child abuse can often be invisible to families and their communities.  What the audit does is to shine a light on unpalatable truths for society about how life is lived by some of its members.  The audit also indicates that the prevalence of domestic abuse - it may not necessarily be physical violence - it is sad to say, has not abated.<\/p> <p>  The audit was commissioned by the Garda Commissioner in the aftermath of two cases which were the subject of much discussion in the public domain involving the removal of children in Athlone and in Tallaght.  I received commendable levels of co-operation from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the conduct of the audit.  The audit is unique in its comprehensiveness as a systemic review because it is the first audit on a worldwide basis to look at the exercise of emergency child protection powers by a police force.<\/p><p>It provides us with very valuable insights.  <\/p><p> In terms of the international approach, I have spent virtually every weekend over two years looking at this at a practical and theoretical level.  I had the audit peer reviewed, which is something I normally would not do.  Given the significance of the audit, I wanted to make sure it was internationally validated.  To give the committee a sense of what people have said internationally, I will cite Professor Laura Hoyano from Oxford who said it breaks new ground in empirical techniques in the field.  I have gone through the complete document.  She talks about the audit employing very sound empirical methodology and says it was carried out with admirable thoroughness, is very well written and the findings are all borne out by the data reported.  The other reviewer talks about it being an outstanding piece of work and an extremely well written and careful report.  In terms of the report standing up internationally, I am told it is the largest worldwide audit on the exercise by a police force of its emergency child protection powers.  In that case, the findings are more important and more significant.  <\/p><p> The overwhelming finding was that garda&iacute; commit great efforts to treating children sensitively and compassionately when they exercise their section 12 powers.  The audit demonstrated numerous instances of Garda members staying long beyond their rostered hours to organise the care of a child removed under section 12.  One of the principle objectives of the audit was to examine the proportionality, appropriateness and legality of section 12 removals.  The audit found that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercise their powers following a period of careful consideration of the circumstances and available evidence.  The most frequent circumstance encountered by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na requiring section 12 removals is some form of failure by a parent.  Garda&iacute; demonstrated a significant degree of critical sophistication when exercising their section 12 powers.  In all of the cases examined, the audit found appropriately restrained use of section 12 powers.  <\/p><p> The audit found no evidence that racial profiling influences the exercise of section 12 powers.  That said, this finding must be tempered by the finding that certain ethnocultural demographic information does not appear to be routinely documented on the PULSE system.  I found the PULSE system not to be reliable in terms of the data that was documented.  I outlined the methodology for the audit because I tried to examine the PULSE data relative to an independent method of collecting data, which was conducting a survey.  The methodology for the audit involved first a forensic examination of the PULSE data.  With the focus on 2014 and 2015, the years in which the Roma and Athlone cases occurred, I looked at over 500,000 fields of PULSE data with a number of colleagues, one of whom, Cian O'Connor, is present in the Gallery.  That shows the extent of the scale of the audit.  Having then drafted and circulated a questionnaire to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who exercised their powers in 2014, it was possible to compare the results from the questionnaire against the data gathered on PULSE.  That was very instructive in shining a light on inadequacies in the PULSE system.  It is commendable that I got a full response rate from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the 2014-2015 period, which makes any finding even stronger.  I then randomly selected cases from September 2015 to get a contemporary understanding of how the section 12 power was being exercised.  We then interviewed a large number of garda&iacute; throughout the country.  It was an opportunity to look at the environment faced by children when subject to section 12 powers, while very strongly of the view that no child should have to spend a lengthy period of time in a hospital or Garda station, because we associate Garda stations with criminality.  Finally I undertook some focus groups with senior and junior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The committee can see the multiple methods employed: examining 5,000 fields of PULSE data, full questionnaires from 2014-2015, followed by a random audit of September 2015, followed by interviewing the garda&iacute; to get an understanding of why they exercise their powers, and then focus groups to further drill down into that information.  That is the methodology.  <\/p><p> One key finding is there is no routine gathering of ethnic data.  In the aftermath of the audit, I had correspondence from Pavee Point expressing strong support for the recommendation in the audit on the need to have an ethnic identifier in order that we know definitively what the position is relating to children subject to section 12 powers.  I reiterate there was no evidence of racial profiling from my extensive review.  In the future, what we need to do is definitively have an ethnic identifier.<\/p><p> One of the biggest challenges facing Irish society is the adverse consequences for the welfare of many children posed by alcohol abuse.  This is something I addressed before the committee on the last occasion.  Drug and alcohol abuse by parents has a very damaging effect on their ability to consistently parent their child.  Failure on the part of Irish society to comprehensively address the alcohol problem as a major threat to the proper functioning of individuals and communities leaves the child protection system dealing with insurmountable consequences.  Anyone who reads chapter three of this report will be struck by how prevalent a feature is alcohol abuse.  It is a call to action on the part of the Government.  There has been a certain degree of delay in legislating in this area.  I wonder if that is influenced by vested interests in the area.  When one looks at this report it is very clear it is a call to action to deal with this issue.  <\/p><p> I have been watching some media over the last number of days.  We talk about it in an adult context but it has absolutely devastating consequences for children.  We, as a society, need to address the issue robustly.  Allied to that is that the audit shines a light on a truth with which Irish society is somewhat uncomfortable, which is that some parents for various reasons fail their children.  It is then the responsibility of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to protect those children.  That is why I strongly argue that the section 12 power is an essential tool in the broader child protection infrastructure.  The audit found inadequacies in the operation of the Garda PULSE system.  The Garda PULSE system was not in a position to provide a clear and accurate picture of the use of section 12 powers by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has confirmed that systemic reform of PULSE is under way and this process of reform is clearly to be welcomed.  It is important that when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercises what is an exceptional power without warrant and without court oversight that the process is accurately documented on the system.  The audit suggests a template for how the PULSE system should be redrawn, ensuring these data are entered accurately.  The audit found little evidence of discrete training on child protection.  We found a deep-seated culture of privileging on-the-job training and learning over and possibly to the detriment of formal training.  As Irish society changes, it is of enormous importance that our garda&iacute; are fully trained on the changing nature of Irish society.<\/p><p>This is not confined to issues relating to children but applies generally, so that we understand the changing nature of Irish society and that policing reacts to that changing nature.<\/p><p> It is also essential that agencies operating under the umbrella of child protection services can share information relating to vulnerable children and their families.  We found in seeking the data that confidentiality is sometimes used as an argument for not sharing information.  That can be a bogus barrier.  The audit found poor inter-agency communication and co-operation.  It found inter-agency co-operation overwhelmingly inadequate.  It is essential that children do not slip through the net and get lost; it is essential to pull them back from the brink.  There must be much greater co-operation between agencies.  This requires fundamental reform not just of the policing system, but also of the child protection system.  I will turn to that in the recommendations.  The key recommendation relates to co-location.  We must start co-locating agencies so they can co-operate with each other rather than inhabit silos.  This report demonstrates poor inter-agency co-operation, and this is common to other reports.  That co-operation exists, if at all, within the higher echelons of the individual organisations and bears little reality at the coalface.<\/p><p> The other issue that emerged was mental health.  Next to alcohol abuse, mental health issues feature prominently.  The system fails many children experiencing psychological or mental health difficulties.  The failure to recognise mental health issues at an early stage can have a profound impact on the family.  Warning signs must be treated with sufficient seriousness and referrals must be timely and appropriate.  If there is no seamless co-operation between agencies, a child's diagnosis gets delayed and that can have profound consequences for the child.  The critical theme that emerged repeatedly throughout the audit is that notification is not communication.  The fact that one fills out a form and passes it on does not mean that one has satisfied the duty to co-operate.  It must be far more robust.  We examined a number of models.  I visited a state-of-the-art centre in the Bronx which has introduced a cutting edge method of dealing with this.  I also looked at the English model in Oxfordshire and the multi-agency safeguarding hub, MASH, in Manchester.  There is also the role model in Belfast, a number of miles up the road.  We can embrace a number of models of co-location.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has issued an implementation plan for the report and I understand she intends to visit some of these centres.  The key reform this report points to is co-location.  That involves fundamentally changing our system.<\/p><p> Another issue to emerge is the lack of out-of-hours service provision.  It was the subject of considerable criticism.  Child protection is a 24-7 function, not a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. function.  The audit pointed out that many children suffered because a service was not available.  Children had to be criminalised or pathologised to avail of the necessary welfare and support services.  I acknowledge the fact that a new out-of-hours service has been established since 2015 but my view is that it continues to be systemically inadequate.  We need a service available throughout the country that is accessible to every child.  The response to the audit has been that the service is available where the demand exists, but that has the potential to create geographical injustice.  A child living in a less populated area is entitled to the same service as a child living in a more populated area.  If we are committed to the principle of equality and treating all our children equally, one is entitled to get the same service regardless of where one lives, who one is or the social stratum one comes from.<\/p><p> The audit found very positive evidence on the operation of the specialist child protection units in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That supports my thesis on inter-agency co-operation and co-location.  When one locates agencies together, one builds up trust.  That is what we must seek for the future.  Nothing predicts like the past.  Those who are not aware of history are bound to repeat it.  One of the key messages to emanate from the almost 100 reports published over the past 20 years is the lack of inter-agency co-operation.  I am hoping this will be the last report in which this issue will have to be highlighted.  What is required now is fundamental reform.  When a child is the victim of abuse or neglect, it is incumbent on State agencies or statutory services to provide a timely and proportionate response.  We see that the system fails children with emotional or behavioural problems.  Those children are perhaps most in need and that is why we must prioritise them.  Intervention, when it arrives, must not be too late to vindicate the right of the child to have his or her welfare secured.<\/p><p> Many challenges remain to be resolved before we can say we live in a society where our children's rights are fully vindicated.  It is always a work in progress but it demands new perspectives, such as what I have outlined on co-location, renewed efforts and real energy.  A system designed to protect children must do that.  The system must be accountable, consistent and always strive to minimise the risk to the welfare of the child.  The right service at the right time is crucial.  We must get it right for every family and child.  I always conclude by saying that the manner in which society treats its vulnerable citizens reflects not only its qualities, but also its sense of social justice, its commitment to the future and its ambition to enhance the human condition for the next generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":622,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, Dr. Shannon.

We should contextualise this.  We are still dealing with the scars of the past in terms of how we dealt with children and the lack of child protection.  In that sense, it is appropriate to say that we are privileged to have something that does not happen very often in this State, a world class project that is ahead of anywhere else.  That should be registered.  If we have an analysis conducted which is peer reviewed and unrivalled anywhere in the world, we must take what that body of work says very seriously.  I was struck by the similarities in some of the points regarding training and PULSE with what gets the headlines for the Garda, such as the breath tests.  We have seen the headlines about how inadequate PULSE is, but this is child protection which in many ways is even more serious.  Some of the trends Dr. Shannon has highlighted in the report feed into that background.<\/p> <p>  I have many questions so I will probably intervene again.  Dr. Shannon highlights PULSE very well and the problem it poses.  He says there is a number of significant anomalies in the information and documentation.  Perhaps he will go into more detail on what that means.  The statements in the report are quite damning, for example, that PULSE is unable to provide a consistent and accurate picture of section 12 use.  That is very serious.  The report states that the practice and working ideologies of child protection fall well short of international best practice and refers to numerous gaps, flaws and variations in data practice.<\/p><p>I ask that that be explained further.  It is eight months since the report was published.  What progress has been made on this issue?  When one reads the report, the recommendations made for dealing with some of these issues are not just general suggestions of reviewing policies or reviewing guidelines.  The witness has actually gone to the trouble of designing a new PULSE<b><\/b>system to capture the information that his scientific, forensic study says needs to be captured.  Has the Garda implemented that new PULSE draft to capture the type of information that the witness has told it is necessary?<br\/><br\/>The witness highlighted the area of training, which was striking.  The figures were stark.  Some 53% said that they had no training at all and 77% said that they did not have sufficient training in child protection.  The point the witness made was that this reflected a deeper systemic problem of inadequate training inside the Garda and that on-the-job training was elevated above the training in Templemore.  The attitude of, &quot;Don't worry what they told you in college, this is the way we do that here&quot;, seems to be a feature of many of the reports that have been done.  I would appreciate more detail on that.<br\/><br\/>We are often - correctly, in my view - identified as criticising the Garda, but the good thing in this report is that the individual garda&iacute; have come out of this incredibly well and have dealt with their responsibility in child protection, as individuals, as best they could in very difficult circumstances.  Perhaps that is something that we can highlight.  The system is deficient, but the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have responded excellently.  I will not repeat these points.<br\/><br\/>I would like to know a little bit more about the level of co-operation the witness got.  One the one hand it is striking that he got 100% co-operation.  Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan got seven replies to the map<b><\/b>tests.  The witness obviously has some influence that he does not have.  On the other hand there is a contradiction, because the witness was looking for information and was hoping to complete this in January.  He had to write a couple of times and go through much of his work more than once to get this information.  Was there a frustration there?<br\/><br\/>The witness has identified really serious problems here.  The report came out eight months ago.  What has actually been done in terms of his suggestions?  We need to look at this as a committee.  Given that the problems are there, and given that the witness had a level of co-operation from the Garda, would it be fair to say that there was a worse response from Tusla than the Garda?  There are two sides in this equation, and we often pinpoint the Garda, but Tusla seems to have been pretty poor in this as well.  Perhaps that could be expanded upon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#C00300","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will bundle the issues she has raised into two categories.  The first is around PULSE and the second is around training.<\/p> <p>  In terms of co-operation, my only experience is in relation to child protection.  I have to be careful in saying this.  I did not deal with any other division apart from meeting the Garda intercultural and racial office.  I met those to get an understanding of what was happening in terms of ethnicity and training in that area.  In terms of the child protection unit, the two people I dealt with, Detective Superintendent Declan Daly and Inspector Lynch, provided outstanding co-operation.  I want to put that on the record.  It must have been frustrating because I am the type of person who just does not let go when I am looking for a piece of information.<\/p> <p>  That links into the next question, concerning PULSE.  We were provided with a huge amount of data.  To put it in context, I had a full room of material that was generated.  I had a very small team, and this was probably the most cost-effective scheme ever undertaken.  It consisted of Cian, myself, Hilary Coveney and a psychiatrist, who was really helpful in terms of trying to ascertain her understanding of what it feels like to be a child subject to section 12.  The consequences from a mental health perspective enabled us to analyse that issue.<\/p> <p>  When it came to PULSE it was quite clear that there was a problem with it.  To elaborate on the Deputy's point, if we turn to pages 55 to 56 of the report, we can see that we had looked at the PULSE system.  I had devised a system whereby we looked at all the PULSE data and worked back to reconstruct a picture of every child subject to section 12, and I cannot emphasise enough how difficult and time-consuming that was.  However, by doing that we were able to identify fairly conclusively the deficiencies within the PULSE system.  As a result of that process, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na changed what was the public figure of 557 valid instances in 2004 to 560.  We were able to determine that the figures were not accurate because of the fact that some had been wrongly classified.  I put together a template to make sure that this cannot happen again.  Appendix six sets out all the data required to ensure we have a complete picture.  As I said at the outset, when the State takes a child away from its parents, it is exercising the greatest power it has, and when it is done without a court warrant, we must have a comprehensive paper trail detailing why that happened.  One of the most important pieces of paper to emanate from this audit is the recasting of PULSE to ensure there is a degree of transparency within the process.  I found that in all the cases I looked at there was an appropriately restrained use of section 12 powers, and it is important to say that.<\/p> <p>  This ties into the Deputy's later question regarding other agencies.  The rank and file garda&iacute; do a very good job, in my view, and we were struck by that as we travelled around the country.  This was not just a passive audit.  We did not just sit there and look at a piece of work.  We travelled the length and breadth of the country to talk to individual garda&iacute; about what it felt like to exercise section 12 powers.  One of the consequences not reported in the public domain is that garda&iacute; are now even more reluctant to exercise section 12 powers.  We need to make sure that garda&iacute; are confident, when a child is at risk, to exercise section 12 powers.  In the west, one garda said to me that where before he was doubly cautious, he is now triply cautious.  That is a pity.  My view is that hundreds of children are protected because we have this power, and until such time as we have a 24-7 out of hours social work service and co-locating agencies, this is an essential tool in broader child protection infrastructure.  It is not just a question of looking at this issue in isolation but rather looking at it across all the agencies.  That is why it needs a whole of Government response.  It is not just one Department.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, in fairness to her, has published an implementation plan.  This needs to be fully monitored in terms of its implementation.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of training, I travelled to Templemore and met all the appropriate people there.  I reviewed the documentation, and it is my considered view that the documentation is not adequate to reflect that we now have a referendum placing children at the centre of our Constitution and that we now have much more robust child protection systems.  It is important.  I recognise that there was a moratorium on the recruitment of garda&iacute; for a period, but we now need robust training.<\/p><p>Training is hugely important.  As Deputy Daly said, it is not just about on-the-job training.  As legislation changes, the requirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na change, and they are changing all the time.  We expect more from our garda&iacute; and we need to make sure they are properly trained.  A body of work needs to be undertaken.  I received a letter over the summer inviting me to participate in some of that training.  I am more than happy to assist but there must be a complete review as to how that should happen.<br\/><br\/>Coming back to the PULSE system, and the Deputy referenced a letter in January, what I have tried to do in a transparent fashion is outline what happened.  We received all the information in December.  Once I had the opportunity over a large part of the Christmas period to examine the documentation, it was apparent to me that there were anomalies.  There were 31 cases that I could not locate having undertaken this process so I decided to write back to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ask for an explanation as to the reason these anomalies might exist.  In terms of what happened, I got the entire set of data again.  That involved starting <i>de novo<\/i>a complete further review of the PULSE system.

He spoke earlier about the children's referendum and putting children's rights at the core of our Constitution but that was not reflected by the practical considerations for children across the State who are left in a very vulnerable position.  As Dr. Shannon said, he revealed many unpalatable truths across Irish society.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions, the first of which relates to the PULSE system and follows on from Deputy Daly's comments.  In Dr. Shannon's view, is it possible to rectify PULSE as it is currently constructed in terms of its foundation and so on?  Throughout the report and in his presentation today, it appears there are core systemic problems with PULSE.  What is Dr. Shannon's gut view?  Does he believe it can become best practice around section 12 cases and child protection because it seems to be failing children in that vulnerable scenario?  If it is not there to capture the data, it is not achieving its purpose.<\/p> <p>  My other question is on Tusla.  Dr. Shannon mentioned the mystification and the lack of feedback and follow-through by Tusla officials.  Has that been rectified or has there been any follow-through by Tusla in his interaction with it?  I would say that is a concern for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are left in a vacuum where they do not know what has been the follow-through.  I know anecdotally that in certain instances, Tusla has not acted as it should have when garda&iacute; referred cases on to it.  If garda&iacute; are left in that vacuum and there is not a cycle and follow-through, even when a section 12 power has been used appropriately, that is a serious concern.  Has there been follow-through in the interim period before we see best practice in co-location occurring?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Shannon referred to alcohol being one of the main issues around child protection.  We have a number of items of legislation coming before the Oireachtas but what legislative measures would he wish to see prioritised or initiated that are not currently on the legislative priority list?  We have the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill and other legislation but on a legislative basis what specifically would help in terms of the alcohol issue?<\/p> <p>  I have some concerns about Dr. Shannon's reference to the reluctance by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to use section 12 powers and how they have gone from a double to a triple reluctance in that regard.  That is very worrying.  We should have a framework that gives confidence to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to act when they know a serious situation is occurring and there is a deficit in training and child protection.  At least they will know how to follow best practice and utilise a particular code but if they are left in a vacuum in respect of a lack of education and training, there will be a reluctance and doubt on their behalf on when to use it or act appropriately.  Have there been changes in the training in child protection and the deficit Dr. Shannon mentioned in his report? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#E00800","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":634,"content":"<p>I will address the questions one by one.  The first one was on confidence in the PULSE system.  PULSE documents information as it arises.  It is hugely important that we have confidence in the integrity of the information placed on the PULSE system.  That can only happen where we have mandatory fields where every garda must fill in set fields of data.  That has to be a mandatory requirement because that gives us an on-the-spot understanding as to the event as it unfolds.  That is the reason I have outlined in appendix 6 a very detailed framework as to how that can be undertaken.  If a system like that existed and it had to be filled in by every garda, I would have confidence that it would give us an accurate picture.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the PULSE system as it currently exists, there are very rich narratives by some garda&iacute; and then far less detail by other garda&iacute;.  The concern is around accountability and whether there is a reluctance to put in a detailed narrative because of issues in respect of accountability and a fear of being held to account if they say too much.  That is understandable but we need to have a system now that mitigates against that.  That is what I am suggesting.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the issue of Tusla and the mystification, I had a certain degree of sympathy for many garda&iacute;.  If I am asked for the solution, it comes back to co-location.  We need agencies working seamlessly together and sometimes confidentiality is used.  I characterised it as being a bogus barrier because while data protection is often raised as an issue, data protection may not necessarily be a barrier if one is not disclosing the identity of the parties.  What we need to do is have some reflexive learning and that reflexive learning can only occur where there is feedback as to whether a section 12 power was correctly exercised.<\/p> <p>  Regarding alcohol, it has been one of the single biggest factors.  I have had the experience in that I chaired the review of the cases of the 196 children who died in State care.  That is another broad systemic review.  There are common themes running through both of those.  One is poor inter-agency co-operation and the second is alcohol abuse.  We know the issues.  We now need to robustly tackle the issues.<\/p> <p>  I was listening to Kenneth Egan's account on \"Claire Byrne Live\" on Monday night, which I though was particularly compelling in terms of what we need to do.  We have been talking about the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill for some time.  We now need positive action because of the fact that this has a real impact on children.  Children are not passive bystanders in all of this but we sometimes see them as passive bystanders.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the reluctance to exercise a section 12 power, I have found the garda&iacute; do extraordinarily well in very difficult circumstances.<\/p><p>Sometimes it is not popular to say this, but credit where credit is due, the audit found that rank and file garda&iacute; do an outstanding job in protecting very vulnerable children.  That needs to be said.  We need much more robust systems to ensure that the paperwork exists to back up this very important child protection safety mechanism.  That is how I would respond to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I congratulate Dr. Shannon on the report.  It is a template for how reports should be produced for the State.  He set out his methodology and what he was asked to do.  Most importantly he set out 72 examples of how section 12 comes into effect and how garda&iacute; are asked to exercise their power in this respect.  He also set out conclusions and recommendations.  I want to repeat what the Chairman and Deputy Daly said about section 12.  When one thinks about it, it is an extraordinary power.  When we put somebody through Templemore, he or she is out very quickly and we then give that person the power to take a child away from a parent.  I agree with what Dr. Shannon has said.  It is an astonishing power.  I think he will agree that it is a power that the State must have because of the examples he has set out in his report.<\/p> <p>  What Dr. Shannon has said about garda&iacute; doing an excellent job in exceptionally difficult circumstances is important.  Many of the examples he has set out are of situations in which it would not be that difficult to make one's mind up, for example a situation where a garda comes to a house and sees a child in a destitute condition while the parents are nowhere to be seen, so the garda has to exercise section 12.  There must be examples, however, which are more borderline.  I would be interested to hear of those borderline examples in due course.  The problem in that situation is that if a garda gets it wrong and something subsequently happens to the child, the State turns around and criticises that garda.  Does Dr. Shannon think that anything more needs to be done to give such garda&iacute; more encouragement to know that they should not be too hesitant about exercising section 12?  Of course, at the same time, one does not want them overdoing it.  That is the first issue I would like Dr. Shannon to consider.<\/p> <p>  Second, this report obviously arose from a request from the Ombudsman for Children arising from case of the Roma child.  Dr. Shannon mentioned in his report - and I think it is good news - that there is no evidence of racial profiling in respect of section 12, but he also went on to say that there would be a benefit in recording ethnocultural information on the PULSE system.  I am interested to know why he thinks that is important.  Has he derived ethnocultural information from the PULSE system?  Is it partly to do with people of different cultures who have come here and have different attitudes as to how children should be reared or looked after?<\/p> <p>  I note that Dr. Shannon sets out the specific details to be recorded on the PULSE system in appendix 6.  That is helpful.  Rather than the report simply saying that information needs to be put in he has said exactly what needs to be done.  Is he satisfied that all of that information is necessary?  What is the benefit of it?  I want to probe that a bit because garda&iacute; are obviously putting a lot of information on PULSE.  They could spend their day sitting around and putting information on PULSE.  What is the benefit of it?  What is it used for?  Is Dr. Shannon telling us that if that information was on PULSE we would have much more information in respect of the exercise of section 12 and that would be to the long-term benefit of being able to deal with it as an issue?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I will echo what Dr. Shannon and others have said.  He talks about the consistency with which he has seen alcohol abuse being a problem in the reports he has written.  Every time this committee deals with issues such as domestic abuse, mental health or violence in the street, alcohol and drug abuse come up as enormous contributors.  People who are perfectly placid, normal people get into problems and difficulties because of alcohol and drug abuse.  That is a much bigger question which we will have to deal with, but does Dr. Shannon believe that there is anything further we should be doing as a State to warn people about the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#F00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Callaghan.  It is important to come back to the reluctance of some garda&iacute; to exercise their powers, which was the Deputy's first question.  One of the issues which was not discussed at the time is the nature of the power.  It is a subjective power.  When a garda arrives at the house, generally chaos greets him or her.  If one reads through some of the examples, the treatment meted out to some of our children is shocking beyond words.  The garda must ask him or herself what they should do.  If one puts oneself into the same position, it is not an objective power.  At the time of the Athlone case and the Tallaght case, this issue was not discussed.  From a legal perspective that is hugely important because the garda has to make up his or her mind having regard to what he or she believes is a fact.  That links into the Deputy's later question on why this information needs to be documented because we need a contemporaneous record of what the garda was feeling at the time so that we can then assess whether that subjective power was properly exercised.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy's question was on providing reassurance to garda&iacute;.  I have tried to look at this and have come up with a solution.  My recommendation in the report is that a laminated card, which I have prepared, be sent to every garda throughout the country.  This card is in appendix 4.  It could be condensed even further but this could be provided to every Garda station and every garda.  It is not high-level to the extent of other reports but I have tried to make it as practical as possible.  If the lead person who has responsibility for training in this area decided to supply every garda with a copy of the laminated card - which outlines what a section 12 power is and what needs to be considered - then as a garda is heading off to what he or she believes may be a situation which will require the exercise of section 12, he or she would have an <i>aide-memoire<\/i>.The garda could read through it very quickly to see whether he or she thinks it meets the threshold.  It is a very practical suggestion which should be implemented.  Coming back to Deputy O'Callaghan's question, that would give confidence to garda&iacute; that they are properly exercising their powers.  <br\/><br\/>The Deputy raised a really important point on the ethnocultural data.  The audit had two key findings and it is important to come back to them.  The overwhelming finding is that garda&iacute; commit great efforts to treating children sensitively and compassionately when a child has been removed under section 12.  The second finding is that no evidence could be found that racial profiling influences the exercise of section 12 powers.  However, in the context of the changing nature of Irish society, the public needs to have full reassurance on that.  We need to start documenting the information.  It is quite a complicated issue.  If one looks at some of the figures, it would appear to be that certain ethnic minorities are overly represented but there may be a reason for that and sometimes the public explanation is too simplistic.  I have tried to outline why it is so much more complicated and nuanced on page 109 of the report.  I state: <\/p><blockquote>this statistical trend does not in itself establish a practice of racial profiling in relation to section 12 ...  In the context of the operation of the child protection system in ethno-culturally diverse areas, recent literature indicates there may be other factors that can explain at least some of this over-representation.  For example, part of this over-representation may be attributable to different cultural norms in relation to the disciplining of children.  While all cases examined by the audit involving removal of children from Nigerian and Romanian families appear to have been justified, part of this over-representation may also be accounted for in a higher level of policing of those communities.  However, on this latter point, it should be emphasised that the audit did not find <i>any<\/i>evidence of a distinct policy or practice of policing the family lives of immigrant communities more heavily.<\/blockquote> <p>That brings me back to a key point, that of training.  We have to train our garda&iacute; because of the issue of unconscious bias.  We all have some element of bias and we have to guard against that.  That can only happen if there is robust training, not just on child protection but also on ethnocultural issues.  That has to be a priority.  What is the benefit of the information?  It is a subjective power and, in the interests of transparency, it is my view that the State has no greater power than for a garda to walk into a family and to remove a child.  That warrants a proportionate response, which is the comprehensive documentation of the circumstances that led the child to be removed and placed in the care system.  That is why I suggest that there be a fairly comprehensive record.  The other reason that led me to that conclusion is the fact that the data which appeared on PULSE showed that some garda&iacute; went to exceptional lengths.<\/p><p>Some narratives were akin to a mini-article on why they exercised their section 12 powers, while, in other cases, it was a mere line.  We want consistency.  This is an extraordinary power which is unparalleled in any other area of the law.  We want to make sure that when the Garda exercises this power, it is justified.<\/p><p> Coming back to the point Deputy Daly raised, if it is a child protection issue, the proper avenue to deal with that is through the courts system.  We want to ensure we are not bypassing the courts system in the interest of expediency.  That is why we need to have a pretty comprehensive picture as to why the Garda might exercise these powers.  That may take longer, but this power is truly much more exceptional than any other power that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercises.  It is for that reason it is necessary.<\/p><p> I share the view of Deputies O'Callaghan and Chambers on the issue of alcohol abuse.  Deputy Chambers also raised the issue of gambling on the previous occasion.  I often struggle with the alcohol issue because I believe there is a strong vested interest in this area.  What politicians need to do is take on those vested interests and to say that child protection has to take precedence over big business.  I wonder at times at the delay in introducing legislation to tackle this issue which is concerning and has consequences.  Anyone reading chapter 3 of the report will be left in no doubt that it has resulted in shattered lives for children.  Those childhoods cannot be regained.  The time for action is now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":639,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Shannon for his presentation.  I am glad to continue our engagement following on from the Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  I said at that stage that his report and audit is an extraordinary piece of public service and a real addition to our work and the work of both Departments.  I also stated at the time that it highlights the need for fundamental reform of our child protection systems.  This audit focused on a discrete area relating to section 12.  However, all these issues need to be revisited regarding section 13 of the Child Care Act 1991 and a much broader range of issues because we have a deeply flawed child protection system.  With section 12, there is clear evidence of the frustration of many garda&iacute; in dealing with those services.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note individual garda&iacute; have shown a high standard of commitment and compassion, which is to their credit.  It is also important to note, however, that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as an institution, is not beyond reproach in this regard.  The issue of PULSE and data has been dealt with.  However, it is worth emphasising that it is not an abstract or technical issue.  In page 43 of Dr. Shannon's report, he stated, \"Particulars with regard to prior or subsequent history on PULSE for children were not included in 31 instances.\"  As far as I understand it, when a child is removed under section 12, the only record the Garda has at the time of that incident is what is entered on PULSE.  What that says to me is that there are 31 children for whom we cannot pick up the thread.  I may be misunderstanding this but it seems to me there is a gap which potentially is putting children who were at serious risk of abuse at further risk and creating a situation where the Garda, social services and Tusla are unable to pick up that thread.  That is a significant concern and highlights the seriousness of the deficiencies.  While Dr. Shannon has recommended improvements, the PULSE system is clearly not fit for purpose from a child protection point of view.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Shannon detailed the ethno-cultural data.  It is vitally important to get that issue right.  The issue of racial profiling could become one of significant debate.  In Britain in recent years, there has been significant criticism of the over-representation of black people in stop-and-search instances, with black people six times more likely than white individuals to be stopped.  I am glad Dr. Shannon found no evidence of racial profiling.  However, if we are to ensure lessons can be learned from other jurisdictions, we need to have proper information on the data entered into PULSE.<\/p> <p>  One of the most significant conclusions Dr. Shannon made was how inappropriate it was to bring children who were taken from situations of abuse and neglect to police stations or hospitals and to keep them there for several hours.  What is the safest place to where these children can be brought?  What should be the proper procedure for the Garda when it removes a child?  It relates to the whole area of inter-agency co-operation and co-location.  One of the most disappointing and frustrating findings in the report was how garda&iacute; were contacted by Tusla late on a Friday evening informing them of child protection situations and leaving them to pick up the pieces over the weekend.  That is dreadful and obviously inter-agency co-operation needs to be improved significantly.  What is the building block for co-location?  Should it be primary health care centres, family resource centres or Garda stations?<\/p> <p>  The Minister of Children and Youth Affairs and her Department produced an implementation plan to deal with the child protection failings in Tusla.  Is there an equivalent implementation plan that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has put in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#G00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":640,"content":"<p>On the omission of 31 instances, the issue is accountability.  If we are not accurately documenting what is on the PULSE system and if we do not record the incident as it occurs, that raises questions as to whether we have sufficient transparency and accountability.  What I believe may have happened is that these instances were filed elsewhere.  However, the reality is that there is not a proper paper record.  I agree with the point made by Deputy O'Callaghan, namely, when this power is exercised, there needs to be a paper trail.  It caused me concern that there was not a proper paper trail for those 31 instances.  I have been given explanations.  However, I come from the show me the data school rather than the explanation.  I have been told that perhaps these ended up being filed elsewhere.  However, with such an exceptional power being exercised by the State, unless there is a comprehensive paper trail as to why it was used, then it raises significant issues.<\/p> <p>  That is why we need a PULSE system that accurately records the narrative for every child in a consistent fashion.  It is just not a case of it being recorded in one area but consistently throughout the country.  That ties into the training of garda&iacute; on how to enter data into the PULSE system and ensuring consistency in how those narratives are entered in respect of all cases.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the lessons to be learned, it comes back to training.  The audit found training was inadequate.  Unless we have proper training on the issue of child protection and the threshold required to exercise those powers in section 12, then it is going to be extremely problematic.  That is something on which we are going to have to redouble our efforts.<\/p> <p>  I absolutely agree with the Deputy on placing children in a police station or in a hospital.  Children associate police stations with having done something wrong and criminality.  That is not to take away from the fact that the garda&iacute; who exercised these powers were enormously compassionate.  I was really struck by their sense of public service.<\/p><p>Garda&iacute; see themselves as first responders and they displayed a degree of humanity which was hugely impressive.<\/p><p> A hospital bed is no place for a child to be placed.  We talk at the moment about having a health crisis yet we are placing children in valuable hospital beds which are needed by people who are genuinely sick.  We need to look at that issue again.  Children associate hospitals with being sick and that has a detrimental effect.  We had a lengthy discussion on this with the psychiatrist, Dr. Imelda Ryan, who is very experienced in this area.  Her view is that this is a hugely traumatic incident.  It is not just the legal issue.  Sometimes we get paralysed by talking about the legal niceties, but this has a huge human cost for children.  When one takes a child in such traumatic circumstances, the consequences may not only be short term but may in fact be long-term in effect.  That is why we need to come up with a new model.<\/p><p> There are a number of models we could follow.  I mentioned three.  There is the role model in the North, the MASH model in Oxfordshire and Manchester, and the Bronx model of child advocacy centres where everybody works together and the child is taken to a very child-friendly place.  I have seen these centres where one has a room that is child friendly and very different from a police station where one has prisoner traffic coming through.  We need a neutral venue.  The member raised some interesting suggestions around family resource centres.  Even the Tusla main office could have a very nice child-friendly room to which one could take a child.  It is not beyond us or something that requires the expenditure of a huge amount of money but it would make a real difference for children.<\/p><p> The graphs demonstrate that children can end up spending significant periods of time in these settings.  When I travelled to one of the rural stations, a garda told me that when the child was subject to section 12, he ended up having to travel with his colleague because one has to travel with another person.  We must look at the consequences of that for policing.  If it is a small rural station and two garda&iacute; have to travel with the child, something has to suffer.  That may very well be that there will not be a checkpoint that evening.  It is something that has a knock-on effect elsewhere.  Using garda&iacute; to perform a child protection function is not without consequences.  It impacts on other areas of policing.  Sometimes we forget that.<\/p><p> The issue the member raised around getting a call on a Friday evening is a worrying one.  It emerged in the case that a garda got a call at 4.45 p.m. on a Friday to be told a child needed to be cared for.  We must be careful here.  We do not know and need a complete audit to know why that happened.  If it is a child protection issue which has been festering during the week, it should be dealt with as a child protection issue.  We have a child protection system under the Child Care Act which means that if one is concerned, one seeks a number of more proportionate orders, including a supervision order.  One can apply to the District Court for a supervision order or, if one is sufficiently concerned, an interim care order followed by a care order.  We must ensure that due process is followed and that child protection issues are dealt with in a child protection context.  That means action occurs in a child protection case when the threshold is reached.  That will need to be monitored.<\/p><p> In terms of implementation, I have been told by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the recommendations have been fully accepted.  My understanding is that an implementation plan exists but I have not seen it.  That is all I can say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for coming in.

Hopefully, it will not suffer the fate of many of the reports which are prepared in this country and then allowed to collect dust without being acted upon.  Given that Deputy Clare Daly and I have spent over five years complaining about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is great to hear that the rank and file on the ground have had such a positive attitude in this area.  They deserve even more credit when one takes into account the fact that training leaves so much to be desired and that the lack of resources is an ongoing issue.  On top of that, the rank and file have had to deal with very poor management, which issue has been very much at the core of our policing problems.<\/p> <p>  The report is eight months old.  Dr. Shannon says garda&iacute; have accepted it lock, stock and barrel but what is happening?  Eight months is a long time when we are discussing children who are at risk.  Dr. Shannon highlights the need for proper data collection and management through a proper PULSE system or an alternative.  He says that would introduce transparency and accountability.  The fact that nothing has really been done about PULSE for a long time is very worrying.  It is two years since the Garda Inspectorate told the State in 2015 that the PULSE system was not fit for purpose and should be stood down but nothing has happened.  It is eight months since Dr. Shannon's report came out and I wonder if he is getting any feedback.  There are so many problems with the PULSE system across the board that it beggars belief that it is still in place.  It has been poorly updated.  It was invented by Accenture which currently has 11 contracts with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is taking in serious money.  Nevertheless, it is standing over a failed system.  Has Dr. Shannon received a real response about where PULSE is going and what is being done about the lack of proper data collection and management around information relating to section 12?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Shannon said the audit found evidence of the repeated removal under section 12 of some children from the same family circumstances.  While it is great that children are being rescued when they need to be rescued, is Dr. Shannon saying that not much is changing thereafter and that there are not enough positive results in what happens for those children who need help?  We are now into the area of Tusla.  While section 12 is very much linked to policing, we cannot unlink it from the role of Tusla given that these children are very often transferred to its care.  Is Dr. Shannon happy with the performance of Tusla?  He might think it is a bit strong, but is Tusla fit for purpose?<\/p> <p>  I do not want to bore Dr. Shannon with my questions, but he made the point that the out-of-hours service was still pathetic and a big problem.  He also pointed out that in a lot of cases, particularly having regard to the out-of-hours service, the only option is a private provider.  His report points out that the private provider tends to be selective and is probably becoming more so about the children it takes into its care.  In other words, the private operator may see a child it has seen before and decide the child is too much hardship for it and that there are better things it could do with its time.<\/p><p>Given that it is a private entity, we cannot really tell it what to do.  The State entity has responsibilities for every child but it is probably difficult to say to private sector providers that they have no choice but to take the child.  They are able to say that they do not have to take the child.  What happens the child then?  Would one not think that State reliance on the private sector to deal with children with problems and in difficulty is not good enough?<\/p><p> I will leave it at that.  There are so many answers in Dr. Shannon's reports and there is so much there for us.  He really has answered most of the questions on the area.  I hope he gets the credit he deserves for this wonderful report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#H00200","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":644,"content":"<p>Deputy Wallace raised some interesting questions.  I will start with the last question.  I share his view on State reliance on private providers.  There is a heavy reliance on private providers.  I am not making any criticisms of the private providers but child protection is the responsibility of the State.  If there is a gap in our capacity to deliver on child protection, the gap needs to be filled by the State and not private providers.  The fact is that children with emotional or behavioural problems sometimes need intervention on an emergency basis.  What I found troubling is that on occasion such children have been refused the service because of their behaviour, which throws sand in the face of our commitment to treat all of the children of the nation equally.  This is not a criticism of private providers and I found no evidence of wrongdoing on their part but, in terms of our reliance on private providers in this area, it is not desirable that the vast majority of cases my colleagues and I examined placed a heavy reliance on private providers.  This comes back to having a child protection system that functions 24-7, 365 days a year.  That is what we need.<\/p> <p>  I have confidence in Tusla.  There are issues that Tusla needs to address and the Deputy has outlined them.  I agree with his analysis of the out-of-hours service.  There may be differences between myself and Tusla on what is our vision.  However, my vision for an out-of-hours service is that every child in this country should have access to an out-of-hours service regardless of where he or she lives.  Tusla has stated publicly that there is a full service in four counties.  My view is that the service needs to be available throughout the country.  Otherwise it becomes a geographical injustice in that the service one receives is dependent on the area in which one lives.  I believe that this is not in keeping with the aspirations of the Irish people when they voted in a referendum to protect all our children and not just those in highly populated or more densely populated areas.  I agree with the Deputy's analysis in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On the repeated removals, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has called for a full audit of the child protection system.  I want to be careful in terms of drawing conclusions.  This was a Garda audit.  It involved me examining the section 12 powers.  I do not want to overly extend myself in making conclusions.  I have based the conclusions on the evidence available.  However, I found a number of cases where children who had been subject to section 12 powers were returned to the family only to be subjected to section 12 again within a relatively short period of time.  There could be a number of reasons for it.  One could be whether the risk assessment was robust enough.  Thinking of one case in particular, the garda who articulated this to me was very concerned that the child had been returned and wondered why it happened.  It comes back to the issue raised by Deputy Jack Chambers around mystification.  We need to ensure that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na understand why a child is being returned.  That can be done on an anonymous basis.  We need to learn from the experiences and the practices to see if things can be done more robustly.<\/p> <p>  On the PULSE system, I had a very positive experience with the unit with which I dealt.  I am not saying this is representative.  I need to be honest.  The two people I dealt with were Detective Superintendent Daly and Inspector Michael Lynch, who are very good at producing the information.  I do not know if that is representative.  However, I found that the PULSE system is inadequate.  There is no doubt.  Whether that is replicated throughout the system or is symptomatic of broader problems with the PULSE system, what I found is that if I had relied on the PULSE data as a basis for this research I would have struggled to make conclusions and I wonder whether the conclusions I would have arrived at would have been accurate.  I was able to cross-check the PULSE data against the other data I had collected and interrogate those PULSE data.  What I found was that the PULSE system is not reliable.  We need a system that is robust and it needs to be properly documented.  I am not too concerned about what we call it but it needs to be there.  As I said, a parent whose child has been taken into care needs to know why that happened.  Parents have constitutional rights.  If we intervene in family life and do not provide a justification for it, we risk being vulnerable to constitutional challenge for interfering unjustly in the right to respect for private and family life.  That is why it is important, when I answered Deputy O'Callaghan's question, that we have a robust paper trail as to why the section 12 power was exercised.<\/p> <p>  In terms of my report, which was published at the end of May, I have not received any implementation plan.  I am told that there is one.  I presume that this committee will have an opportunity to deal with this issue in another form.  I hope that is helpful. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":645,"content":"<p>Before bringing in Deputy Daly, I have a couple of questions myself and then we might have short, specific single points to wrap it up.  Did Dr. Shannon have a specific period to address in terms of section 12?  A significant part of the work references 2014.  In his opening remarks he speaks also about the period going into 2015.  Was there a specific period in time and was that his determination or something that was preset in terms of reference?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Shannon has indicated that the report was published in May but the sign-off was in January, as the document states, but he concluded, published and presented it.  To whom did he present the report?  I presume it was to the Office of the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Will Dr. Shannon elaborate on that and let us know to whom the report was presented?  Our awareness of it arose out of a previous presentation on Dr. Shannon's own behalf.  It is clear that its importance and relevance, particularly the whole section relating to the PULSE section, was apparent to the members of this committee.  We welcome the opportunity to tease that out with him today.<\/p> <p>  Apart from the answers he has given, Dr. Shannon is aware or is being told that an implementation plan has been prepared or is in preparation.  Does he have any other evidence that anything has changed in terms of his role as special rapporteur?  Has there been even anecdotal feedback from people such as someone in a child carer position or from NGOs in this regard?  Is there any evidence that actions are being taken on foot of his recommendations given that it is now September?<\/p> <p>  There were 595 reported incidents in 2014.  I think a small number of those would be repeats.  That is what I have noted from the report.  However, the greater number - more than 500 - were individual cases.  It has been referenced by colleagues here, but 31 children are unaccounted for on the PULSE system since being taken from their parents or guardians under section 12.  I say that both in terms of their pre-history - before the section 12 being exercised - and since.<\/p><p>Dr. Shannon states in his report that no subsequent history was noted of them being removed by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the case of that particular cohort, have their stories or circumstances been followed up in any particular way?  Has Dr. Shannon initiated inquiries through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about these cases?  From reading the report, it strikes me that these children are missing.  I do not mean to be alarmist in using that language but section 12 was exercised and, to the best of our knowledge, these children's current whereabouts have not been recorded on the PULSE system and are, therefore, not identifiable.<\/p><p> Thirty-one children is a significant number.  In my view, one child is too many but 31 is incredible.  Has Dr. Shannon any information to indicate that the PULSE system on these cases has been updated?  Did he have the opportunity to identify why this particular group of 31 children was not included in the system?  Is there a common denominator in their cases?  Were they particular to an area, a region or a city?  Was there another common denominator regarding their personal profiles?  Why did 31 children have no prior or subsequent historical notes recorded?<\/p><p> Is there anything else that Dr. Shannon would like to add in respect of this part of his report?  He laid a powerful emphasis on the importance of inter-agency co-operation and comprehensive training in child protection as an integral part of the training for new Garda members coming through Templemore College.  He indicated he has engaged as a potential participant in that regard.  Is that something he expects will be part of the programme of training in the near future if it is not already?  What about training the large number of existing members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the whole area of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#J00300","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":647,"content":"<p>The review of PULSE was from 2008 to the end of 2015, with a focus on 2014 and 2015.  The reason I selected 2014 and 2015 was that these were six months prior to the Athlone and Tallaght incidents and six months subsequent to them.  It was to get an understanding as to how the power operated prior to its invocation and the powers exercised by the Ombudsman and her subsequent report to see whether the system had changed.  It involved a forensic review of between 5,000 and 6,000 cases.  I looked at all cases from the time we started keeping records.  It was an opportunity to look in summary fashion from 2008 and in detail during the critical period in question.<\/p> <p>  What comes from this audit is a reassurance to the public that when garda&iacute; exercise their powers, they do so proportionally and there is no evidence of racial profiling.  That is what I wanted to determine.  However, what the audit unearthed was problems with PULSE, with training and with the subsequent removal of children.<\/p> <p>  The report was presented to the Garda Commissioner in March 2017.  In terms of it being a contemporary picture, I continued to update the report with new data right up until the time of submission.  This is a pretty contemporary picture as to how the system operates.<\/p> <p>  In terms of changes, I have met Detective Superintendent Daly and Inspector Lynch on several occasions.  They are committed to the child protection system.  That does not take away from the systemic difficulties which need to be addressed.  My experience of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na child protection unit has been positive .  Tusla has an implementation plan and it has invited me to present to its board at the end of September.<\/p> <p>  The net conclusion from this audit is that agencies need to work together.  It is not good enough to inhabit our silos.  Child protection is everybody's and every agency's responsibility.  That is why the co-location model needs the broad fundamental reform that follows from this report.  I share Deputy Wallace's view and I am not naive about reports gathering dust.  I hope this report does not gather dust and the big picture of reform it advocates, namely, co-location, is implemented.  That will involve real change with agencies having to concede territorial ground in terms of their own individual professions.  What struck me about the Bronx model was that after a time it became seamless.  What initially looks challenging actually produces results for children.  When doing the cost-benefit analysis of the Bronx system, I was told by the New York City Police Department, NYPD, that it makes a saving of $1,000 per case.  This means it is less expensive because one is pooling the resources of the agencies.  I would liken it to what happened when creating specialist units in the health system.  Why can we not have centres of excellence for children?<\/p> <p>  The 31 instances caused me some concern.  In my correspondence of January 2016, I highlighted 31 instances in an attached table in which additional data and other instances relating to the children were not included in the data for section 12 children.  In these cases, when a search was undertaken for the particular PULSE field relating to the specific section 12 incident in 2014, it did not feature in the section 12 children all incidents worksheet.  There were no other PULSE entries relating to the child in that worksheet.<\/p> <p>  The explanation that has been advanced is that these cases may have been misclassified.  Nonetheless, when one exercises such an exceptional power, it is important that it is done carefully and that regard is had to the fact that there is the potential of trampling on parents' constitutional rights.  It is also important it is treated not just as a paper exercise but as a record of one discharging one's statutory and constitutional responsibilities.<\/p> <p>  I passionately agree with the Chairman on continuing professional development.  It is important we train our garda&iacute; and that this training does not stop once they leave Templemore.  My vision for a force that exercises such exceptional powers is that there should be mandatory continuing professional development for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The legislative landscape is changing dramatically.  Accordingly, we must ensure that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na understand these new powers and responsibilities imposed upon them.  That can only be achieved through training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":648,"content":"<p>Just for clarification on the cases of 31 children, does Dr. Shannon have any concerns as to their current status?<\/p><p>Maybe he did not have the opportunity to examine whether there was any common denominator or any similarity in their respective make-up as individuals, or maybe nothing was apparent to Dr. Shannon.

The fact that Dr. Shannon does not know the answer is not an indictment of him but of the lack of follow-up within the Garda.

The committee is well aware of the work of the Heritage Council since its establishment on a statutory basis in 1995.  The committee recently had a discussion with the CEO of the Heritage Council on its ongoing work.  I submitted an opening statement, which deals with my career in education and my involvement in community and social activities.  My involvement in heritage stretches back over 40 years.  I first joined Laois Heritage Society shortly after its formation in 1975, and since the late 1970s I have acted in various roles in promoting heritage in Laois, including being chairman, vice chairman and president of the society.  Since 2012, I have been a board member of the Heritage Council.  In December 2016, I was appointed acting chairman of the council by my fellow members and I have acted in that role since then.  I was nominated by the Minister as chairman of the Heritage Council at the end of June 2017.<\/p> <p>  I will develop some points I made in my submission on the approach I wish to take in my role as chairman of the Heritage Council.  I see it as intrinsic to the role of chairman that leadership is collegial and co-operative, that the board and executive work closely together to attain objectives, and that our dealings with each other and our network of organisations, including county heritage officers, is supportive, open and transparent.  It is vital the Heritage Council nurtures relationships with other organisations and bodies, including local and central government and all of the organisations, committees and individuals throughout the country that are vital to preserving and promoting our heritage.<\/p> <p>  The Heritage Council's draft strategic plan will shortly go out to consultation.  Next year, the council is to lead the Irish section of the European year of cultural heritage.  It is vital we nurture a sense of belonging in all the people who live here.  I suggest Brexit may well cause us to re-examine and reaffirm our identity.  Our identity is attained by asking of ourselves who we are, and then asking the further question who do others think we are.  It is vital for us to re-examine and reaffirm our sense of where we live and who we are.<\/p> <p>  A vital part of the work of the Heritage Council is working with communities, and this is facilitated by our grant system and through our county heritage officers.  The council has had vibrant engagement with schools at primary level for a number of years and it is my firm intention to extend this to secondary schools, particularly with imaginative projects involving individuals and class groups.  Various groups are linked with and assisted by the council, including the Landmark Trust, the discovery programme and the national biodiversity programme.  Part of the role of the council is to give advice and support to the Government on heritage-related topics.  To further this, closer working links should be fostered with the Arts Council and other cultural bodies.  Our arts, culture and heritage are the soul of the nation and working together is the way forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017092000002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Parsons"},{"type":"speech","time":1505910600,"counter":675,"content":"<p>Gabhaim mo bhu&iacute;ochas leis an bhfinn&eacute; as sin.

I read his submission and his curriculum vitae, which is wonderful because he has come from an educational background.  He went through education at night and worked his way up to vocational education.  It is a wonderful route to come this way from the ground up into what he does now.<\/p> <p>  Does Mr. Parsons consider that working with communities is a major part of what he does?  What is his opinion on the dissipation of our communities, and the fact we are being told every day by the press, radio and television that they are falling apart and they have many problems, beginning with the post office and ending with emigration?  Where does he see the Heritage Council in all of this?  He mentions it a lot.<\/p> <p>  Does Mr. Parsons think he might make solid links with education at second level as opposed to, say, the Arts Council?  It has its job to do.  If I were to look at heritage week in Ireland every year it is better than the theatre festival in so far as it happens.  I say this not in a comparable way because it happens in every street, town, village, lane, road, church, lawn and field in Ireland.  It is extraordinary.  There is more of an educational link.  Mr. Parsons has planned for definite disciplined links in second level education, as opposed to the Arts Council, because it has its own work to do.  It still has not addressed the issue that music as a subject in the leaving certificate examinations is not given 25 points while mathematics is.  What are Mr. Parsons's views on such issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017092000002#B00400","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505910600,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I will begin with the Senator's final question.  As far as links with second level education are concerned, the second level principals' association nominated me in 2012 to go on the board in the first place.  It sent me as an emissary to try to get heritage more closely linked with second level education.  I was a founder member and later the chairman of the arts, heritage and cultural committee of the principals' association.  Every year, we have creative engagement in more than 100 of the 700 second level schools.  Separately, in counties Laois and Offaly I initiated a heritage programme in primary and second level schools, which is being considered as a pilot by the Heritage Council.  It covers Laois, Offaly and north Tipperary at present.  We intend to expand it to County Kildare and if it works well we will expand it nationally.<\/p> <p>  The Senator's other question was on community.  I have always believed in the importance of community, being a vocational school principal where the school operates night and day.  We had approximately 1,000 night students in the school so it was always a central hub of the community.  My eyes were opened fully with the reaching out programme and how the community responded in its own way to the commemoration of 1916 in 2016 and adopted it themselves.  The community is amazing.  During heritage week, I was invited to an event in Geashill in County Offaly.  The community was commemorating the battle of Geashill, of which I had never heard, which took place in 1699.  I arrived there to find a community hall packed with 200 people.  The chairman of Offaly County Council addressed it.  The Royal Irish Academy confirmed the book written was \"kosher\", if I may use that expression.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017092000002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Parsons"},{"type":"speech","time":1505910600,"counter":678,"content":"<p>Yes, it is a great book.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017092000002#B00600","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505910600,"counter":679,"content":"<p>It was all there.

Obviously, the country has a wonderful heritage which is to be found in nearly every field and area.  I come from County Meath which we nearly consider to be the heritage capital of the country.  The River Boyne flows through the county and its banks are littered with internationally recognised heritage locations such as Tara, Newgrange, the site of the Battle of the Boyne, Slane Castle and the Hill of Slane.  There are also hundreds of smaller, really interesting heritage items such as crosses, raths, forts, old houses and so on, most of which are hidden from the people.  Most are on the banks of the river which is not accessible by public roads.  One of the ways to open them up to Irish people and potential tourists is the creation of a heritage greenway from the source of the River Boyne to the estuary, which would take in three counties and a number of large towns along the way.  Is there any way the Heritage Council could work with community groups in seeking to open up these heritage spaces which are invisible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017092000002#C00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505910600,"counter":682,"content":"<p>We would love to do that and there is a way to do it.

In fact, I spoke at its launch a year or two ago.  That is exactly the type of initiative we can reach.  The heritage sector does not necessarily need an awful lot of money, although I will be roundly castigated when I appear back at base after saying that.  Of course, we need money, but we need to be able to link up with local communities, even on a county basis.  We really have great links with heritage officers and very good relations with the county councils.  If a scheme such as the one mentioned by the Deputy is proposed, the Heritage Council would certainly back it, first with expertise and probably with a small amount of seed funding to see how it would develop, before looking for more money because I think it is a very good idea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017092000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Parsons"},{"type":"speech","time":1505910600,"counter":683,"content":"<p>Another issue has struck us.  We had a wonderful opportunity a few months ago to visit the storehouse of the National Museum of Ireland in Swords.  We were blown away by the number of artefacts, which, to a certain extent, lie hidden from many.  Obviously, there are cycles in artefacts being displayed and not being displayed.  For example, there were a mediaeval sword and tiles from the floor of Trim Castle.  We do not have a county museum in Meath.  Many counties do have one, but many others do not.  One of the objectives of many of us on the committee is to make the wonderful, valuable heritage items we have more accessible to people throughout the country.  It would be a lovely project to ensure each county had a viable county museum, full to the brim with historical and heritage artefacts from centuries gone by.  That would help to educate the local community about the wealth of their own space but also to bring people into the area.

In County Laois we have gone down the same trail several times and there are difficulties.  We follow with great interest what is happening with the courthouse in Portlaoise.  We want to locate a museum in the building.  The National Museum of Ireland assures us that if it is safe to hand artefacts to local museums, it would be delighted to do so.  The difficulty is that bodies such as county councils are required to be involved.  Of course, there will be many volunteers, but a few paid people are needed as buildings and security must be maintained.  However, it is something the Heritage Council would absolutely embrace.  Therefore, we would love to receive a proposal from the committee in that regard because it would spur us on.<\/p> <p>  As I said, we are setting out our strategic plan for the next few years.  We look for ways in which we can promote the heritage of the country and having a museum is a great way.  We were told not to stick to County Laois alone but to promote counties Laois and Offaly, not only for their monastic wonders but also for the little thing called the first plantation of Ireland.

To a certain extent, it looks like that Moore Street will remain inert in its current state for another two or three years until all of the rigmarole in the courts is complete.

First, of course the Heritage Council, like an awful lot of bodies in this country, suffered during the recession and, in our case, dramatically.  Funnily, I did not start by talking about money and I did not mention money in either of the submissions because I feel, even before money, we are talking about harnessing people.  That is what I believe.  Often the money that the Heritage Council uses is seed money.  Often it is in small amounts, but it works.  Often the money is going out in grants to different communities that have an idea or to different individuals and that is very important.  Of course we are looking for more money.  I could not go back to Kilkenny if I did not say that we would welcome more money.  However, we would welcome more money tied, if one likes, with when our strategic plan comes back.  Obviously we want money for the European Year of Cultural Heritage, which would be impossible to run without it.  Therefore, we expect money separately for that.  However, we would only be looking for more money that is tied to actual proposals we have for initiatives we believe have worth and meaning and contribute.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned built heritage and natural heritage.  There is also cultural heritage.  \"Heritage\" is the greatest word.  I remember, when I was first appointed to the Heritage Council, digging out an old dictionary and wondering what we are looking at here at all.  I had a 1970-something dictionary, as an old school master would have.  I looked this thing up and discovered it had no relationship whatever to what I thought it was about, so I hunted further.  The further I hunt, the more I find it is an expanding term.  In essence, however, it is what we are handed down.  It is the value handed down to us from previous generations that we want to conserve and keep for the future, and of course that involves money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017092000002#D01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Parsons"},{"type":"speech","time":1505910600,"counter":715,"content":"<p>To come back to Mr. Parsons's contribution around young people, as a former teacher, and the opportunity for all ages to enjoy and learn about heritage, the OPW initiative with the Government is very welcome.

At 15 or 16 years of age, students probably do not want to know about anything.  Perhaps in transition year we would get their attention, but the leaving certificate and so on is such a pressure.  Before the pace speeds up we should reach into the first and second year students, who are so enthusiastic.  That is what we did in Laois-Offaly with our programme.  We get the most amazing things.  I remember a model of the Main Street in Tullamore in 1785 with a balloon floating above it.  At the time, the balloon was one of the first balloons launched.  It came down and burned the whole Main Street of Tullamore, which is why Tullamore has a lovely wide Main Street now.  It was thanks to the burning of Tullamore by this balloon that came down.  A class of young students had constructed a model of the 18th century street and the balloon hovering above it.

It has many other problems.  The reason I asked the question is because there is a place for the Heritage Council to influence the Department of Education and Skills in the development of disciplines such as our heritage as a discipline within the curriculum, as opposed to somebody possibly coming in three or four times a year, which is also brilliant, or a very creative teacher.  We now have mindfulness because everybody was roaring about it for months.  Sometimes the council could have a great influence on second level education whereby a subject such as heritage in all its polymorphic terms could be something that young people could study up.  It seems to be alive in primary schools and third level education and outside the classroom but for some reason, it does not become a knowledge discipline in its own right.

The Four Courts were destroyed in 1922.  When I was an undergraduate, I used to say that the Four Courts were burnt but as my lecturer reminded me, \"no-one knows exactly what happened.\"  Anyway, the Four Courts were destroyed.  It was like burning a hole in the memory of the entire island because like all colonising powers, when the British were here, they were very good at controlling history and that, of course, meant that they tended to centralise everything so they centralised everything in the Four Courts just in time for our Civil War.  Since then, under the first chair, Eoin MacNeill, the work of the commission was, essentially, to put out the fire in the head of the Irish people - in other words, to try to find what was left.  As bits and pieces of paper and parchment rained down over the greater Dublin area in the wake of 1922, the first thing was for people to bring in the burnt bits and pieces.  In fact, we are engaged in a project at the moment with the National Archives to recover the burnt bits, as it were.  Since then, there is a great opportunity for us and Ireland in what we have been trying to do because what the British had assembled was the official record and now we are left with the unofficial record and that includes the voices of the poor; the marginalised; women, whose voices have been increasingly recovered; and all sorts of other groups who would not have got a hearing at all if all our stuff had remained.<\/p> <p>  I have been working on manuscripts in this area for over 20 years.  My work in UCD is concerned with taking care of the National Folklore Collection; the massive collections of the Irish Franciscans, including the Annals of the Four Masters; and some of the earliest and most important material relating to the Irish language.  That is where I come from and what I want to do with the Irish Manuscripts Commission.  To finish my initial statement, the Irish Manuscripts Commission is an act of retrieval.  What we are trying to do is get our memories back.  The commission has been working away and produces about four or five volumes per year online and in print, essentially to give back the first draft of history to people.  <\/p> <p>  I will close by saying that I think this is really important now because the commemorative cycle started with 1916, which we could all get behind, but we are entering the Civil War period and civil wars are terrible and awful.  Countries like Spain have tried to deal with civil wars.  The initial Spanish response to the civil war was one side won and tried to wipe the memory of the other.  Then one entered a period of Spanish history where socialists tried to retrieve the anti-Franco side.  What the Spanish ended up doing is what I propose we do, namely, simply putting all the evidence out there, contextualising it and letting people make up their own minds on what is out there and try to get past all the pain, hurt and feeling we have about the Civil War period.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017092000002#E01800","nonspeaker":"Professor John McCafferty"},{"type":"speech","time":1505910600,"counter":740,"content":"<p>M&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG22017092000002#F00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1505910600,"counter":741,"content":"<p>I would like to make an observation.

In my view the Book of Kells is not a particularly valuable manuscript in one way because the text therein is a book of gospels and they are two a penny.  It is a rather nice manuscript but the most revealing manuscripts in Irish history are those that contain the collective memory of the people.  In that instance, I could name a few.  The Annals of the Four Masters are incredibly important because at the point at which Gaelic civilisation is collapsing in the wake of plantation - I am not as upbeat about plantation as Mr. Parsons might have been - the annals preserve the collective memory of Gaelic society.  In addition, Seathr&uacute;n C&eacute;itinn's Foras Feasa ar &Eacute;irinn is probably one of the most important of all Irish manuscripts because it essentially invents modern Irish.  He is the Shakespeare of modern Irish.  He gives modern Irish its form, verve and calibre.<\/p> <p>  To return to the Senator's distinction between the official and unofficial memory, the most important thing about the manuscripts is their relationship to one other.  In other words, like people, one person of him or herself is of little consequence but people in their webs and networks are what make groups and collectivities of people, such as this nation, important.  That really is where preciousness lies.  One could say the laundry list of a 19th century Irish strong farmer could be conceived to be as important as, for instance, the Lord Lieutenant's invitation list.

I spent the summer in Connemara: there are no monoglot speakers left.

There are several ways forward, including digital access.  However, while digital access is fine, people do not only listen to CDs or to live streaming; they still go to live concerts.  Some of these documents are very delicate and vulnerable and so on.  The provision of high-quality facsimiles is possibly one way around the issue.  For example, the original diary of the flight of the earls in 1607 is in UCD.  The National Library wished to display it and so we made a facsimile.  It was so indistinguishable I could not tell it was not the real document and I am an expert in the field.  I would have had real trouble distinguishing between the two.  There are creative solutions and partnership solutions to those kind of issues.  The Chairman is correct that the early manuscripts in particular are tied to specific places.  They are the work of the hands of those places.  After all, to produce a manuscript such as the Book of Kells, one has to kill approximately 2,000 cattle and 2,000 cattle do not come cheap.

My view, and the view of my colleagues, on that was that what was required was highly visible enforcement in order that people felt there was a chance of getting caught and that the penalty had to be high enough to ensure people would not want to get caught.  We need highly visible enforcement of what we have got.  We should see how that works and after that, reducing the limit would be good.  Men have told us that highly visible enforcement is required, and international evidence shows that it works as well.  At the same time we have a 20 mg limit now for professional drivers and people like that, which is basically a level of zero.  However, nothing works if people have a perception that they are not going to get caught.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017092000002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Declan Bedford"},{"type":"speech","time":1505913000,"counter":793,"content":"<p>Are there measures that can be taken from a technology point of view?

He felt that the system was being abused but at the same time, no one can give us figures to say that people have gone back on the road and been caught again within the same legislation.  As Dr. Bedford said himself, perhaps people are not too sure if one glass is okay or not.  They might learn their lesson.  Why give them a hard penalty the first time when they might be innocent of the fact?

There is one other advantage of having an occasional breath checks apart from that in the afternoon or at other times because it creates awareness.  People will say that they are testing for drinking and driving.  Many people would be reassured by that.  They will say that if they are doing it in the daytime, they will definitely be doing it at the night-time as well.  Several years ago I spoke to garda&iacute; at the introduction of the random breath testing and said it was a matter of getting the message out there, without causing grief.  If garda&iacute; set up a road traffic check point on the verge of a motorway on a Monday morning and had a big sign, stating random breath testing check and they took all their equipment, all the cars are sneaking by the first time before they have set up.  They are thanking God they had passed it.  All you would have to do is take it down straight away and those who would see it would thank God the had arrived too late.  They did not have to stop anybody but the message is getting out.  I know they have done that elsewhere.  The message is getting out that garda&iacute; are doing checks in the morning and a person would want to watch what they drink on Sunday night.

I will start, as requested, by introducing myself and setting out my background as it relates to the role of Chairman of Drogheda Port Company.<\/p> <p>  I live within the hinterland of the port in County Meath, although a product of Dublin 12 and an alumnus of Drimnagh Castle CBS.  My first permanent job was in Dublin Port and Docks Board in 1980 and I have been in or associated with the port industry ever since.  I spent 30 years in what is now Dublin Port Company in a variety of roles including as head of internal audit and later as finance manager.  One of the more interesting projects I had the good fortune to be involved with was an Irish Aid funded training project in partnership with other Irish ports and with the United Nations Conference for Trade and Development, UNCTAD. <\/p> <p>  I left Dublin Port Company in 2010 and took up a scholarship in a doctoral programme in the School of Law and Government in Dublin City University.  My research interests were in the field of comparative political economy and my case work focused on policy making across international container ports.  I completed my PhD in 2014 and continued to work with UNCTAD as an instructor on its port manager training programme and as a consultant in their port performance benchmarking project across their member ports.  This opportunity to engage with port managers across many cultural, historical, political and economic contexts gave me a basis to examine critically how we in Ireland approach the port sector as managers and policy makers.  This comparative information remains a key resource for me in facing into the challenges for Drogheda Port and harbour in the coming years.<\/p><p>I will use my remaining time to set out my thoughts on the role of chairman in Drogheda Port Company.  My experience with Drogheda Port Company since 2013 has been a very positive one.  The economic downturn of 2008 had a significant impact on the port finances and I give credit here to the staff and management of the company who took radical measures to survive as a commercial entity.  The fruits of those actions have matured and the business is now trading at prudent profit levels consistent with continuous investment in port infrastructure.  Comparing the financial performance with similar ports internationally it stands quite well.  While the operating margin is on an upward trend on a turnover of &euro;3.8 million, it is still below the average for its peers and this reflects the recovery position of the business.  <br\/><br\/>The question of economic sustainability is critical to regional ports.  The commercial port is at an environmentally important location 7 km west of the River Boyne entrance.  It is a port with an annual volume of more than 1.2 million tonnes trading within the Drogheda Harbour.  To do so in a manner that is sensitive to the environment and the community we work in requires imagination and consultation.  The port supports around 1,000 jobs and is home to several industries that rely on the port for raw material imports and for their exports.  Therefore, balanced and considered planning is required in how the commercial port evolves.  My personal goal here is to engage actively in the consultative process we will launch shortly to develop a sustainable master plan.  This plan will set out the long-term vision for the development of the commercial port within Drogheda Harbour, including its relationship with the town.  I hope that this two-way communication will stand to all of us associated with the region in the years ahead. <br\/><br\/>One of the early priorities during my time on the board was the transition from State ownership to local authority ownership.  I participated in that process as chairman of an <i>ad hoc<\/i>committee.  The company has engaged with the Department and the council management to undertake the due diligence required for an effective share transfer.  We have finished our work and await the completion of the necessary transfer documentation.  We will continue to work constructively with the current and future shareholders to bring this matter to an early conclusion.  This matter is not in our hands at present as there are other ports in our category that are also working through the ports&rsquo; policy impacts.  Good governance is a topic I have worked on with colleagues in many international settings.  My goal is to support the continued efforts by the board and management to function in a manner appropriate to a State-owned enterprise, no matter the level of the State-owning institution. <br\/><br\/>I am honoured to sit here in this setting as chairman designate of Drogheda Port Company.  I will do my utmost to meet the obligations of the role and to make the best of the experiences I have of the industry internationally.  I thank the committee for its time and hope my comments have helped it.  I am more than willing to answer any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017092000002#E01900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Hiney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505913000,"counter":860,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Hiney.

One example would be a birdwatch hide along the estuary.  There are protected species along the Boyne and the river has been pretty much neglected over the years.

Ports nowadays are very keen to be good corporate citizens.  I worked recently with a team in the Philippines on ports which focused on the relationship between the environment and the community, in particular in the context of cruise and tourism traffic.  It is clear that there are opportunities now as cruise and water-based tourism grows internationally.  It is growing beyond the stereotypical image we have of the rich cruise passenger coming on the very large cruise ship from the United States or wherever else.  There is now a growing trend towards ecotourism and adventure-based tourism and the River Boyne is an opportunity but it cannot be exploited.  What one also finds with ports, cruises and tourism is that the ports are a part of the picture.  If it was containers the port would be driving the agenda but with tourism and cruise passengers, for example, it is very much a case of working with the local community because the port itself is one aspect of the business.  Cork is a very successful operator when it comes to cruise tourism in Cobh.

A huge part of it is listening.  One needs to create a forum in a structured manner in order to hear the different views.  It has been done quite successfully by other ports in this country.  In the context of its development, Dublin Port held quite an extensive and wide ranging consultation.  It is much larger than Drogheda and has greater resources to do that but in our own way we want to do the same thing.  We want to communicate.  The shares will transfer from the Minister to Louth County Council at some point and the shareholder under the Act is the chief executive of Louth County Council.

In terms of what goes through the port, how much is destined for Britain, mainland Europe and countries outside the EU?  What are the dependency levels in that regard?

I have no particular wisdom on the matter.  If there is a hard border then there certainly will be extra steps in the process of moving cargo in and out.  Our niche market is in dry bulk imports and some dry bulk exports.  This involves particular ships coming in with one load, some from the UK but mostly from northern Europe.  I am talking here about transhipments of animal feed and so on, into Ireland, to supply the agrifood business in the north east of the country.  One aspect of Brexit that would be a concern that I can identify rather than just speculate on is based on the fact that we compete with a small port on the other side of the Border - hard or soft, virtual or otherwise - in Warrenpoint.  The association representing UK ports is lobbying for special status for ports because of Brexit to enable them to deal with the transactional issues that would arise in a border scenario.  They already have competitive advantages in terms of their planning rules and the ability of the state to invest in their ports.  We would be concerned that Drogheda Port Company will suffer a further competitive disadvantage.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy rightly says, it is a small to medium sized enterprise.  We expect to grow.  If one looks at container ports like Dublin and Cork, one will see sustained growth because they reflect merchandise goods moving in and out of the country.  We deal with niche markets in terms of dry bulk, which has its own different dynamic and is a function, for example, of the agricultural industry and the demand in that sector.  We also have cement exports and other ore-type exports that function well.  It is very hard to tell what will happen.  One can see some of the players in the market, not necessarily to do with Drogheda Port, making moves to have warehousing facilities and legal entities in both the UK and Ireland.  Presumably they are hedging their risk and preparing for whatever happens.  We are in a high exporting and high trading economy.  We need to be able to move our goods and people in and out of the country efficiently.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017092000002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Hiney"},{"type":"speech","time":1505913000,"counter":903,"content":"<p>Is Dr. Hiney saying that existing customers are already making-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017092000002#H00900","speaker":"1278"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505913000,"counter":904,"content":"<p>I have an anecdote for the Deputy.

The Chairman is correct to point out that I said in my opening remarks that it is a sensitive and beautiful part of the country.  We cannot just move the port anywhere.

If we want to get larger vessels in, we have to talk about training walls and deepening the entrance to the harbour.

Yes, I agree about the northern access route and I understand that even longer ago there was a similar proposal on the south side.  That is probably long gone from any files or archives but it was to create that ring circuit of Drogheda town.  Marine access, however, is an equally important public good to any port and we have an issue to address in the future in terms of the impact storms have on the entrance to the harbour.  The Chairman would know that Mornington Beach, for example, is now extended almost all the way out on the training well.  In terms of what will happen next, the sand goes around the corner into the mouth of the river, so we have to plan.  That is not just about the commercial port, it is about access to the harbour, to the river.  It is about the environment in terms of the impact it would have on local ecology and so on, so we need to explore those issues as well.<\/p> <p>  May I take the opportunity to come back on the governance point - perhaps I misunderstood the Chairman's question earlier - as distinct from consultation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017092000002#J01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Joseph Hiney"},{"type":"speech","time":1505913000,"counter":927,"content":"<p>Of course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2017092000002#J01500","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505913000,"counter":928,"content":"<p>Clearly, the governance structure that applies between the board of directors now and the current Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is replicated in the legislation in the way we will deal with Louth County Council.

I am not clear yet on the way that part of the legislation will be implemented in practice but it is a conversation we need to have with the council in the future.
