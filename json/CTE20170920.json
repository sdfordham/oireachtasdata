I thank the Chairperson for the opportunity to appear before the committee.  I will discuss those three issues within the broader context of how the economy is doing.  I will also speak about the budget.<\/p> <p>  The most recent national accounts were published at the end of last week.  The headline figures are that there has been real GDP growth of 5.5% in the first half of 2017.  Every sector grew on an annual basis in both the first and second quarter with the exception of financial and insurance activities.  The construction sector expanded by a fifth in the first half of 2017 compared to the same period last year.  Our forecasts are now for GDP to increase by between 4.5% and 5% in 2017.  Perhaps more interesting that GDP is the new measure of modified domestic demand which the Central Statistics Office, CSO, have developed.  It gives a more accurate measure of activity in the domestic economy by stripping out intellectual property investment and purchases of aircraft by leasing firms.<\/p><p>Modified domestic demand grew by 2.4% in the first half of this year, which is slightly below what my expectations were, given how strong employment growth has been.  The relatively strong growth should continue into 2018 as, in our view, the economy continues to approach its potential and, on the back of this, unemployment should fall below 6%.  Employment growth should continue at a strong pace in 2018.  Clearly, the outlook for 2019 is much more uncertain, not least because of Brexit, but also because of other factors such as the potential for interest rate increases by the European Central Bank, which would dampen domestic demand in the Irish economy.<br\/><br\/>The public finances are improving.  The general Government deficit will be close to zero in 2018 and 2019 on current forecasts, but it must be borne in mind that the gross debt level remains elevated and is greater than 100% if expressed in the new GNI* metric, though that metric is itself problematic.  Our view - and this is currently one of the debates between some of the institutions such as the OECD, the ESRI and others - is that there is limited evidence of overheating in the economy.  Total employment and the employment rate are still below pre-crisis peaks.  The employment rate is indeed below the EU average, despite the assumption that the Irish economy is rocketing along and doing really well.  It is doing really well compared with how it was doing, but its employment rate is below the EU average and significantly below the top performers such as Sweden.  The unemployment rate is also still relatively high; it is higher than in such countries as Germany, the UK and the US.  The recent growth in consumption that we saw in 2016 follows almost a decade of stagnation and therefore partially reflects a working through of pent-up demand.  At the same time, consumer price inflation is only 0.4%, while average hourly earnings are growing at just 1.6% year on year, again after years of stagnation.  Underlying investment is admittedly growing strongly but is doing so from a very low base, while consumer credit is less than half its 2009 peak.<br\/><br\/>Some of the more traditional metrics used to attempt to understand whether an economy is overheating include the current account balance.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to measure the real current account balance at present.  Technically, it is in surplus.  The current account*, which is the new metric, is in deficit but there is a lot going in and out of that which perhaps does not reflect the real economy and its sustainability.<br\/><br\/>Property prices are growing very quickly but, again, are less than three quarters of their peak value, and the recent price growth should be understood as essentially a market failure in the housing market, with supply running well below projected long-run demand, something that is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.<br\/><br\/>The committee invited me to comment on income taxation, labour market participation and demographics.  Regarding income taxation, according to OECD data, the total employee tax wedge - that is, income tax, USC and employee PRSI - for a single person as a percentage of gross wage earnings is 19.2%.  This is the lowest in the EU 15 and less than half that of Belgium and Germany.  It is also lower than that of the United States.  Ireland is also the lowest tax country if we compare the same person's tax wedge as a percentage of total labour costs.  This would include employer PRSI.  If we compare <i>per capita<\/i>receipts from taxes on labour in Ireland with <i>per capita<\/i>receipts in the other high-income EU countries - I am talking again about income tax, USC and PRSI - we find that receipts in Ireland are almost &euro;2,000 lower.  It is the low level of social contributions, namely, PRSI, that really explains this difference.  The OECD also compares earnings from 50% to 250% of average incomes for a range of family types and finds that Ireland is a consistently low-tax jurisdiction.  The graphs I have provided in the supplementary materials show that labour taxation in Ireland is very progressive.  However, given the high level of gross income inequality - that is, market income inequality - in Ireland, this is only sufficient to move Ireland to the middle of the EU pack in terms of net income inequality.  If we were to reduce that progressivity, we would become one of the more unequal countries.  Finally, this progressivity is mainly attributable to the structure of the income tax.  The USC is only modestly progressive, although it does have the advantage of being immune to almost all tax expenditures, most of which are regressive in nature.  Pension tax relief, for example, tends to accrue to the top 20% of earners.<br\/><br\/>Regarding labour force participation and demographics, the most recent cross-country data from the OECD, which is for 2015, shows that Ireland had a labour force participation rate of 70.1% for persons aged 15 to 64.<\/p><p>This was below the EU average of 72.7% and significantly below the UK&rsquo;s 77.6%.  Ireland is more than 11 percentage points below Sweden and 17 percentage points below Iceland.<br\/><br\/>One notable barrier to labour force participation in Ireland is the extremely high cost of child care.  This is particularly relevant in the case of second earners and lone parents and mainly effects female labour force participation.  The implication for budget 2019 and beyond is clear.  It is necessary to increase State spending on child care subsidies and to reduce the cost of child care.  Budget 2018 was a very important start, but we are still far from best practice in terms of the quantum of State supports for child care.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has very favourable demographics compared with most other advanced economies.  Our working age ratio of 65.2% is broadly in line with that of the EU as a whole.  The important difference is that we have a much larger young person ratio than the EU and a much smaller elderly population.  This means the Irish economy has a higher growth potential than that of the EU, which is very positive.  On the other hand, Ireland&rsquo;s relatively small elderly population, which at 12% is just two thirds of the EU average of 18%, makes our long-run fiscal position appear stronger than it really is.  This position will deteriorate over time as the population ages.  Elderly people require additional spending on health and social protection and are generally out of the workforce.  Finally, our fertility rate of 1.9 is well above the EU average of 1.5.  This is positive in terms of long-term economic growth.  However, this fertility rate also implies deteriorating demographics over time in the absence of inward migration, as 2.1 is the replacement rate.<br\/><br\/>In respect of fiscal policy, the remaining fiscal space available is less than &euro;500 million in 2018.  This is concerning given the severity of the housing crisis and the evident need for additional State support in this area.  In addition, our analysis shows that Ireland underspends on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis compared with other high-income EU countries - those with a GDP <i>per capita <\/i>of &euro;30,000 or more - in a number of areas.  Notably, we estimate that the State underspends in a number of areas fundamental to long-run economic growth, specifically education, infrastructure and research and development, where the cumulative underspend is in the order of &euro;2.5 billion to &euro;3 billion.  There is a particularly large underspend on primary education, especially in the area of ancillary supports, and on tertiary education.  In this context we argue that long-run economic growth, employment and equity goals can best be achieved by prioritising use of the available fiscal space to increase public capital investment levels, increase spending on education, and increase direct spending and subsidies for research and development.  Here, we are going beyond budget 2018 and talking about the period to 2021.<br\/><br\/>On the other hand, measured on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis, combined taxes and social contributions in Ireland are significantly lower than in comparator high-income EU countries.  Taxes and social contributions are combined by the OECD because they are compulsory payments.  The OECD sees social contributions as taxes in effect.  Ireland is particularly low when it comes to taxing stocks of capital, for example, property taxes, inheritance tax or wealth tax, and when it comes to social contributions from employers.  Overall, there is no evidence that the Irish tax system is onerous compared with other high-income European states.  In light of this, and in the context of substantial areas of underspend, the case for further tax cuts is extremely weak.  Indeed there is a strong argument for increasing taxes in certain areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McDonnell.

Our view is that it is a start.  State spending on child care is well below what it would be in the Nordic countries.<\/p><p>In the countries that have such high labour force participation rates, particularly for women, second earners and lone parents, the barriers for entering the labour force and staying in the labour force are much lower.  I view that as year one and we gradually ramp that up over time.

One should consider moving it to being something akin to primary school teachers, who are salaried over a year and it can be a genuine profession, leading to a higher quality workforce in the long run.  To give the best bang for buck, the best returns economically are in within education.  Within education, the best bang for buck is the earlier the better.  Therefore, pre-primary care and pre-primary education are extremely important for the development of human capital.  It is a terrible phrase, but it is one used in the economics literature.  The biggest barrier to human capital, of course, is poverty, but early childhood care and education are also extremely important.  In our view, that should almost be top of the priority list for budget 2019 and beyond.<\/p><p> The marginal tax rate kicks in at quite a low rate when compared internationally.  However, the effective tax rate for someone on average earnings is well below what it is elsewhere - the graphs are included in the supplementary materials.  Comparing personal average tax rates and labour income for a single earner, for example, we are below the EU 15 all the way up to 250%, which is as far as the OECD does it.

There is also a table entitled, \"Comparison: Income Tax plus Employee Social Security Contributions in 2016 as a Percentage of Gross Wage Earnings\", which looks at the single personal average earnings for Ireland, the other EU 15 countries, the United States and the OECD as a whole.  The total payment is 19.2% according to the OECD, which is the lowest in the EU 15.  For example, the United Kingdom has 23.3%.  The EU 15 average is over 30%.  Even countries like the United States have a higher level of tax.  It is simply not factually correct to say there is an onerous burden on the average earner.  The reason for that is the system of tax credits, which keeps the effective tax rate really low.  Even though the marginal rate kicks in quite early, the effective tax rate that people are actually paying is quite low for most of the distribution.  The tax wedge as a percentage of labour costs is lower again because employer PRSI is so low in Ireland compared with comparator countries.  It is important to bear that in mind.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has issues relating to costs.  We have high costs in a number of areas such as child care, rent, groceries and so on.

I could go through the list of such taxes, including VAT on the consumption of goods, parking charges, high bus fares and the cost of rent.  Many people believe property tax is a regressive charge because it does not take income into account.  Does Dr. McDonnell accept that people are right to resist things like property tax?

The easiest question to answer is the one about fiscal space.  I agree that it is miserable.  It is not nearly sufficient to deal with all the problems that will arise over the next year.  Part of the problem with the fiscal space is that the Commission's methodology for calculating it - which is bunkum, as any serious economist knows - is reducing it by over &euro;1 billion in the context of next month's budget.  The Commission's view is that we have been overheating ever since we had an unemployment rate of 10.3%.  Its model is not designed for Ireland at all.  It is essentially taking some of our fiscal space away from us.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked me to be specific about the taxes I am proposing.  He spoke about different property taxes and the range of hidden charges.  His point about the range of hidden taxes and charges is absolutely correct.  The taxes that people rarely notice are VAT and excise duty.  Maybe people notice excise duty when they see how much cheaper certain things are in other countries.  Ireland over-taxes, and is a high-tax country, in the area of consumption taxes.  On average, such taxes are higher in Ireland, on a per-person basis, than they are in the other ten high-income countries.  This point does not necessarily apply to VAT, but is particularly relevant to excise duty.  Our excise rates are extremely high by comparison with other countries.  We have a range of regressive charges.  The television licence is a flat charge.  That is the most regressive structure one can have.  It is probably our most regressive tax or charge.  Everyone has to pay it, in effect.<\/p> <p>  It is true that the property tax is not progressive in the same way as income tax or the USC.  I believe this conclusion was reached in research from the ESRI.<\/p><p>It is a tax on an asset, not necessarily a wealth tax <i>per se<\/i>, and it has certain problematic elements such as where a person with a very low income pays a high level of property tax.  The best way to deal with such situations is to provide relief by way of a charge on the property which would only become due on sale or transfer.  It would accrue over time and, when it is being inherited or sold, the State would get what is owed to it first.  Over a lifetime, the State would get the same amount of property tax but it would not cause hardship issues for low-income households.The determination of what hardship was could be left to a democratic decision but I have not carried out any research into that point.<br\/><br\/>The Nevin Institute has published papers on a financial transaction tax, FTT, and on a wealth tax.  A wealth tax on all assets over &euro;1 million, without reliefs, would generate a yield of around &euro;0.3 billion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Is that at 1%?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#H00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Yes.  It does not sound like a lot but the current long-term return on capital is approximately 4%, meaning it is tax of 25% of that amount.  It would only affect the top 1% or 2% of households.  A wealth tax operates from a different base from income tax and wealth inequality is much more pronounced.  Many economists take the view that the best way to deal with intergenerational wealth inequality is inheritance and gift tax, which we call capital acquisitions tax.  We tax the person who gets the money rather than the inheritance itself and that is a better system than the one in the UK.  The problem is the system of reliefs is so inordinately generous for particular types of assets that many people can have an inheritance worth millions without paying a penny in tax.<\/p> <p>  I was asked whether I could be specific about the different types of taxes.  I stated that we have an overall revenue problem and we are not so much a low-tax country as a low-revenue country.  The big difference is social security contributions, which in Ireland are PRSI.  Employer PRSI makes up 80% of the gap to the high-income EU average and that is the elephant in the room.  It is often called a social wage because in many countries it goes towards benefits for workers.  If the benefits went towards something such as child care subsidies it would be for the benefit of employers in the long run, as it would increase the size of the labour force.  If it went to the retraining and upskilling of workers it would lead to a more productive workforce.  Child care subsidies also lead to a more productive workforce by keeping women in the workforce and, as we know, women are more educated than men.  Moreover, when they fall out of the workforce they often never fully come back.<\/p> <p>  Genuine reform will be necessary in regard to the sufficiency of revenue as there is a pensions time bomb, health care is going to increase year on year and we have an infrastructure deficit, which has been well flagged and of which the committee is cognisant.  Our research and development deficit, compared to the top performers, is &euro;0.5 billion per year.  The literature on economics suggests one has to have a functioning innovation system to develop top companies but we ignore that completely and our spending is two thirds of that in Sweden and elsewhere.  Such countries have the idea of the \"entrepreneurial state\" but we do not have that.<\/p><p>We discuss increasing employer PRSI and the property tax - there can be other types of property tax, for example, on stocks &ndash; and perhaps reducing consumption taxes.  We are not just about increasing taxes - the distributive impact is important; for example, taxes on pollutants could be increased and used to subsidise renewable energies - but also about reforming the taxation and revenue systems and public spending to bring us into line with the best performing countries in the world in terms of policy.  We are a long way off that.  In our summer and autumn quarterlies and some of our working papers, we have tried to show what those countries do and describe what needs to be done to get us there.<\/p><p> The fiscal space is extremely small this year, but we view this as a five-to-ten-year issue and beyond.  Improvements can be made year on year.  Unfortunately, we cannot solve everything in one year, but at least we can make a start.

Should we not leave the choice as to how that human capital is developed to parents?<\/p> <p>  I agree with Dr. McDonnell, in that this is some of the most important and valuable work that we are doing, but there is a slight dichotomy.  On one hand, Dr. McDonnell is saying that child care is too expensive, which is the case for many people.  On the other hand, he is saying that this is the most important work that anyone can do and we should be paying child care workers the same that we pay primary school teachers.  If Dr. McDonnell does not have the figures, he can revert to me with them, but what is the average pay of a child care worker and what is the average hourly pay of a primary school teacher?  If we are to value this work and increase the pay of child care workers to that of primary school teachers, what would it cost and how would we afford it?  I am fully supportive of that idea.<\/p> <p>  How would Dr. McDonnell have voted in Dublin City Council last night if he had had a call on increasing the property tax?  It was a \"Yes\" or \"No\" vote, so I would love if he could give me a \"Yes\" or \"No\" response.<\/p> <p>  The ESRI appeared before us and, interestingly, pushed for a switch to a site value tax.

If we are talking about human capital, the single most important thing we can do is prevent childhood poverty.  That means family income supports and other supports.

I see no reason the two could not be combined or blended without necessarily being merged completely.  The classic idea from the 19th century was, of course, the land tax from Henry George.  The economics literature is clear that all of those taxes are extremely positive in terms of the economic benefits, particularly compared with some other taxes.  They are not necessarily progressive because they are not based on income.  When taxes are based on wealth, they generally are progressive.  The site valuation tax has the advantage of not necessarily disincentivising development.  On the other hand, the property tax perhaps reflects the real value and may be more progressive in terms of its actual effect.  Personally, I think both taxes are good ideas.  One would not necessarily have both of them in place.  To get rid of a property tax and replace it with a site valuation tax would, I suspect, be politically very difficult.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McDonnell and invite Mr. Berney to read his opening statement, after which the remaining members can ask questions of both witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#K00500","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting us here today.  While the statement we submitted to the committee touches on the issues we were asked to address, members will notice that it contains no reference to the Lansdowne Road agreement or the proposal for a new public sector pay agreement.  There is a very good reason for that.  As politicians, the committee members will appreciate that the trade union movement is a democratic organisation and the process of approving the public sector pay agreement only concluded earlier this week.  It would have been premature for us to include comments on the agreement in our submission prior to it having been accepted by our affiliate organisations.  It was accepted by a large majority of the public services committee on Monday.  In accepting the agreement, the public services committee of ICTU notes that there are still some issues that are hangovers from the crisis era and that there are matters to be addressed around the issue of public pay.<\/p><p>Most notable in this regard is the question of new entrant pay and pay equalisation.  The headlines have focused on teachers, but there are new entrant pay scales in all parts of the public service and there is still pay inequality in many parts of the public service.  We should focus on trying to eliminate this over the coming period.  There is also, of course, the question of retention and recruitment in critical areas of the public service which need to be addressed as part of the public service pay agreement.  However, the agreement has been accepted by a large majority of the public services committee and we are looking forward now to implementing the agreement and making sure that the issues to which I have just referred are addressed within that context because they are very important issues.<br\/><br\/>My remaining remarks are really in the context of the pre-budget submission that Congress has produced.  I understand that all Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Senators, as well as councillors, have received a copy of our pre-budget submission, so my comments are made within that context.  From our perspective, people deserve to see an inclusive, equality-proofed budget that places the welfare and betterment of the majority at its very core.  We have a responsibility to make sure budget 2018 is the first in a series of transformative budgets that will prioritise higher living standards and quality of life underpinned by a programme of investment in infrastructure and improvement to services.  For budget 2018, Congress has three key priorities.  We must begin the process of tackling the housing and homelessness crisis.  That must be our absolute priority.  We must end the reduced VAT rate for the tourism sector, which has cost some &euro;2.2 billion in lost revenue to date, and invest in public services such as education, health and child care in order to lower living costs.  I will come back in a moment to the question Deputy Ryan asked earlier about the cost of privately provided child care as opposed to pay for teachers and so on.<br\/><br\/>On the question of housing and homelessness, failure to tackle the housing crisis properly in budget 2018 would see Ireland pay a high price in terms of future social cohesion, damage to future growth prospects and increased living costs for working people.  Although housing and homelessness are acute problems in themselves, they are very much labour market problems as well because they inhibit people's participation rates in the labour force if they do not have access to affordable housing.  Congress proposes that local authorities across the country take the lead in the provision of social housing as the only long-term sustainable response to the crisis.  Unfortunately, we abandoned the housing market to private developers and let profit become the key driver of housing provision.  However, the market has failed and, as classical economics tells us that government must step in in the case of market failure, the Government must now step in and declare a national housing emergency and act accordingly.  Local authorities, as we said, should take the lead in a major house-building programme with funding of at least &euro;1 billion from Government, providing at least 10,000 social housing units a year by late 2018.  Given this is an emergency, compulsory purchase orders must be utilised as a matter of urgency - there has been conjecture around the constitutionality of that, but we do not believe the Constitution is an impediment - to ensure available serviced land is put to good use, while the introduction of the vacant site levy should be brought forward from January 2019.  We simply cannot afford a return to the developer-led and developer-shaped policies of previous years, despite recent attempts from the private sector to extract more tax breaks and subsidies in order to build houses.  I notice Deputy Ryan said that IBEC was here yesterday.  There is a subgroup of IBEC that represents property developers.  If the committee reads its pre-budget submission, it will be shocked to see what it is seeking.  Essentially, it wants a tax-free environment.  If that were to be the approach to incentivising developers, it would make the situation far worse.  We question the value of the help-to-buy scheme and think that money would be far better used by giving the funding to local authorities for housing construction.  In the short and medium term, thousands of lives and life chances are being damaged beyond repair by the housing crisis.  This itself is cause enough to act.  However, the crisis will also discourage inward investment, drive up living costs for working people and have an adverse impact on the labour market.  Budget 2018 is an opportunity to deliver a game-changer on this critical issue.<br\/><br\/>One of the issues we were asked to talk about is the tourism sector's VAT subsidy.  Congress continues to argue for an end to the special reduced rate of VAT enjoyed by the hospitality and tourism sector.  This is a <i>de facto<\/i>subsidy that has already cost the State &euro;2.2 billion in taxes forgone.<\/p><p>There is no justification for this ongoing subsidy to a highly profitable and predominantly low wage sector.  This is a sector that refuses to participate in the joint labour committee system the Government has established for wage setting in sectors.  It refuses to participate in the process.<\/p><p> There is no evidence of any significant new job creation or that the consumer has benefited in any way.  ICTU regards the subsidy as being used simply to take profits.  There is no other use for it that we can see.  In fact all the evidence suggests that the reduced rate operates as a subsidy to very profitable corporations, which is a waste of valuable resources when set against areas of obvious need such as homelessness.  Ending this unjustified and wasteful subsidy will create additional fiscal space which can then be used for much more urgent priorities in education, child care and infrastructure.<\/p><p> A question was asked earlier about where we can get new taxes.  In the last table of our pre-budget submission, congress has set out where new taxes can be raised.  This is one of the places where a significant amount of money could be raised without any real risk.<\/p><p> We want to emphasise the importance of investment.  Workers deserve a much improved social wage paid for through general taxation or social insurance.  Congress is calling for additional investment in public services, including education, health and child care, in a bid to lower living costs and to boost a social wage for working people.  We know that Brexit carries huge risks for the Irish economy.  The best way to respond to Brexit and other threats to our collective prosperity is to invest in the things we need.  We need to invest in skills to retrain and upskill workers especially in sectors most vulnerable to Brexit and to climate change.  Deputy Ryan and others are aware of the need to invest in adjustment transition for workers who are affected by vulnerable industries with regard to Ireland's climate change obligations.  We need to invest in infrastructure such as public and other transport hubs to meet the challenge of diversifying trade flows.  Investment is also needed in the areas of research, innovation, marketing and organisational capacity to develop new products and services and locate new markets and alliances.  We also need to invest in core economic and social infrastructure to help make Ireland a country with high levels of well-being, equality and economic efficiency.<\/p><p> Plans for tax cuts in the budget should be abandoned.  Ireland has massive infrastructure deficits in housing, transport, broadband, renewable energy and water treatment that require immediate attention.  Such investments must take priority over tax cuts.<\/p><p> Public capital investment should be doubled over the next three years and the rainy day fund should be used now rather than later to address vital areas of infrastructure deficit.  Ireland has a young and growing population, and bottlenecks will only get worse if we fail to invest now.<\/p><p> The trade union movement stands in solidarity with the most vulnerable people in society, including pensioners, young people and others who are dependent on social welfare, income support and social transfers.  Social welfare payments should be restored by more than the expected cost of living increases in 2018.  I am happy to take any questions from members on the congress pre-budget submission and I have brought spare copies with me if the committee needs them.<\/p><p> Deputy Ryan asked about the wages of child care workers in the private sector and those of a primary teacher.  I cannot be absolutely certain as I do not have exact figures, but I will find them for the Deputy.  Congress published a paper on this issue not too long ago.  From memory, child care workers in the private sector earn, on average, between &euro;12 and &euro;15 per hour.  A primary school teacher would earn somewhere between &euro;25 and &euro;30 per hour, as far as I am aware.  The question is that the policy direction has decided to subsidise private child care provision.  Money is given to private child care providers, yet there has been no examination of the possibility of providing child care services within the State sector.  In Scandinavian countries, for instance, children go to primary school much earlier than children in Ireland.  They go into a different setting than a classroom where child care is provided and there is an educational dimension within that setting.  There is no reason at all why, with a small infrastructural spend, Ireland could not produce child care settings in the public sector in primary schools.  This would not be for the purpose of sending children to school.  Obviously their early developmental education would be much different from that which they would encounter when they attend primary school.  Directly intervening in the sector with public sector child care provision is one way of dealing with a problem that has been completely ignored and not given proper consideration in this State, as far as I can see.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Berney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Berney.

I thank Mr. Berney for his comments and I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for his resistance.<\/p> <p>  I shall make a couple of responses.  Budgetary oversight is interesting; we met representatives of IBEC yesterday and have listened to different participants.  The meetings have left me with a strong sense of the challenges that politicians face in terms of making decisions because everyone has made valid arguments with some interesting contrasts.  First, ICTU made a presentation and mentioned the abolition of the VAT rate.  Last Monday, Fianna F&aacute;il held a party think-in at which Professor Alan Ahearne made a presentation.  He made the point that the abolition of the VAT rate would double or increase it by 50%.  The difficulty with removing a tax is one might have to re-impose it.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Berney about the questionable treatment of workers.  However, I disagree with his belief that increasing the VAT rate and returning it to its original rate would more than likely be passed on to consumers when they go out for a bite to eat or stay in hotels.  I would like to hear his response to that.  <\/p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Berney when he said: \"Local authorities should take the lead in a major housebuilding programme with funding of at least &euro;1 billion from government, providing at least 10,000 social housing units a year by late 2018.\"  Does he live in the real world?  I would love to see such a development.  My own local authority of South Dublin County Council will complete ten social houses this year.  Therefore, ICTU's request is unrealistic.  I wish it were realistic.  I am disappointed with ICTU making such a generalisation.  I would like to have seen something more concrete, please pardon the pun, in terms of ways to deal effectively with the housing crisis.  The figure is totally impractical.  I wish I could wave a magic wand and provide 10,000 social housing units by the end of next year.  The figure produced by ICTU is unrealistic and I am disappointed with the organisation.  <\/p> <p>  One of my colleagues has suggested that close to &euro;1 billion for the housing assistance payment, HAP, has been provided in the budget.  That is a huge payment but it is one of the prices that we must pay.  <\/p> <p>  Neither of the witnesses has said anything about the vulnerable middle classes.  Dr. McDonnell mentioned USC cuts.  I represent the constituency of Dublin South-West.  It represents a good microcosm of the country because it has middle class, working class, working-middle class people and people who are seriously disadvantaged.  The constituency also has a really struggling middle class for whom September is the new Christmas in terms of child care costs and back to school allowances.  They are the people who budget from month to month.  If there is an unexpected cost in a month, let us say the car, fridge or washing machine breaks down and needs a part that has not been budgeted for, these people are thrown into a financial crisis.  Therefore, a targeted tax reduction such as the USC would be welcome.<\/p> <p>  There is a lack of appreciation for people who must budget on a monthly basis.  Recently I tabled parliamentary questions on motor taxation.  If one pays one's motor tax monthly one is penalised.  That situation may not seem much to people who can afford to pay their motor tax for a year.  If one budgets from month to month one can pay up to an extra &euro;100 or &euro;150 per year, which means at least &euro;10 a month.  I agree with NERI that the  property tax, and Fianna F&aacute;il has said it for years, should reflect a person's ability to pay.  I like the idea of the offsetting effect.  In other words, the State ends up accruing the same amount of income from the tax.  <\/p> <p>  I reiterate that the struggling middle class must budget from month to month and exist on a financial knife edge.  Any little break we can give them would be greatly appreciated.  I ask the organisations to factor that into their calculations.<\/p> <p>  Consumption taxes were mentioned such as excise tax.  How can one reduce the excise tax on alcohol?  There is a political debate on alcohol at present so a call to reduce the excise tax is completely unrealistic.<\/p><p> I shall conclude by discussing child care.  I agree that the State has kept child care at arm's length from preschool for some unknown reason.  I would co-locate preschool facilities.  In the past few years we have embarked on a massive school building programme.  Not including preschool facilities is a missed opportunity.  School facilities could have been a one-stop shop for parents.  Of course, primary school teachers are qualified to teach preschool children.  I suggest that we increase the skills level in the sector.  Unfortunately, as preschool education operates in the private sector, it means the cost of preschool will increase.  I would appreciate any comments that the witnesses can make on these issues.  The increased grant has, anecdotally, led to increased charges being imposed by some child care providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#N00200","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I urge the Deputy to move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#O00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>That is okay.

Our proposals were not meant to be fanciful or unachievable.  From our perspective, we face a situation where there is a limited amount of fiscal space and, therefore, we must prioritise how best to spend the available money.  ICTU has tried to identify priorities in its pre-budget submission.  Congress has thousands of members like those described by Deputy Lahart.  We have tried to improve their incomes through the collective bargaining process.  Hopefully, those who are employed in the public sector will benefit from the increases they will get through the wage increase that forms part of the public service pay agreement.  ICTU has launched a campaign to increase pay in the private sector as well.  We are trying to ensure, as best we can, that the traditional and most effective way of increasing wealth through collective bargaining is maximised.<\/p> <p>  ICTU has tried to emphasise that the scale of the problem is so great that we need a new response to address the homelessness and housing crisis.  The only way to do this is to present the challenge accurately.  That is why we have clearly stated that we need 10,000 new houses per year.  I accept that we will not magic them out of nowhere.  ICTU emphasised the problem in order to draw attention to finding solutions.  That is why I made the point that local authorities must take a lead.  There are significant gaps in the capacity of local authorities to do so.  That does not mean we cannot look at ways to provide adequate resources to local authorities to meet the challenge.  We must tackle the problem in some shape or form.  The local authorities are best placed to understand the problem.  For example, land that is not currently in use and is lying idle should be used to meet the housing need.  ICTU believes that local authorities should take the lead in tackling the housing crisis.  The purpose of the pre-budget submission by ICTU is to highlight the extent of the challenge we face.  ICTU wants to focus attention on the political and policy-making systems in order to find ways to meet the challenge.  Congress, as an organisation, can only point to the challenge and suggest ways to meet the challenge, which is what we have tried to do.  Ultimately, the solution comes down to the political choices that are made by the people in these Houses on how to spend the available resources.  We believe that the Government, in the 2018 budget, should, instead of cutting taxes, use whatever money is available to invest in the key infrastructural deficits that exist in the economy and our society.  It is our view that this is the best way to spend the money.  We are not unsympathetic to the point made by Deputy Lahart.<\/p> <p>  I shall respond to the question of dispensing with the 9% VAT rate in the hospitality sector.  The Deputy said that the initiative would lead to the tax being doubled.  That cost does not necessarily have to be passed on to consumers.  ICTU has seen evidence that suggests that the hospitality sector has increased its profits due to the increased money generated by the reduced rate of VAT.  Those in the sector can simply reduce their profits rather than pass the cost on to consumers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#O00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Berney"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Berney.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#O01000","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Deputy Lahart made the point that it is difficult to reimpose a tax.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#O01100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":57,"content":"<p>That is not really my view.

One of the things that speaks to is that we should be very cautious about engaging in tax cuts, particularly when the economy is on an upswing.  Actually the best time to cut taxes is during a recession, provided one has built up a sufficient surplus to be able to do that, to keep demand going in the economy and to keep things on a steady ship.  With employment growing and the economy doing well, what one wants to avoid doing is overheating the economy.  Given that we all acknowledge that there is a problem in the housing sector, the response to that, whether it is private or public, will be to ramp up house building and construction.  We have seen that construction is already starting to expand quite quickly.  What one does not do is to supplement it by cutting taxes at the same time because one runs the risk of overheating, such as what has happened in virtually every country in the world at different points.  When people think about having all of this money, they suggest spending it and improving things now.  Our emphasis is always on investment.  What I mean by that is investing in something now to gain something even in 20 years' time when it comes to child care or education or in the near future when it comes to infrastructure and perhaps never at all, as it is a gamble when one invests in research and development.  However, one cannot win if one does not try.<\/p> <p>  One point, that was perhaps taken up incorrectly, was that I did not actually mean to give the impression that we think that excise taxes should be cut necessarily.  I agree the bad items should be taxed, whether it is alcohol, cigarettes, sugar, carbon and so on.  I was simply making the point that it is actually the one area where we are a high tax country.  It might be a good thing that we take those things seriously as problems, betting, of course being another example.<\/p> <p>  I agree absolutely that in the longer term it would be better to co-locate and to roll preschool education in with primary education.  It will take us a long time to get to that point, but to do it will require fiscal resources and ramping up.  It would be wonderful to get a commitment from this D&aacute;il to deal with this preschool issue, as well as housing, by putting in place a plan for it to happen during the next five to ten years.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the vulnerable middle classes, my first port of call is to say that their tax burden, as it were, is actually quite low compared with other high income countries.  Perhaps that may be slightly simplistic.  The labour taxes are low, but the employee contribution is not necessarily low.  Perhaps reorienting the distribution of who pays labour taxation from the employee to the employer would help the hard pressed worker.  We know that the countries that have a high level of employer PRSI do not seem to have a dearth of employed workers but tend to be the countries with the highest employment rates in the world.  Of course, it is more complicated than that.  Measures, such as reducing child care costs, improved infrastructure, which means lower public transport costs, better roads and rural broadband are all things that will help the economy and will help reduce costs. <\/p> <p>  Dealing with the housing crisis will push down the cost of rental in the long run and also will push down property prices as well.  All of those measures will benefit the younger generation coming through, which of course, is the suffering generation, the people who did not get jobs in their twenties in 2008 and beyond and are now suffering from higher costs in many ways.  That is the generation that has really suffered.  What we can do for them is ensure that we have strong infrastructure and that we are Brexit-proofed by investing in education infrastructure or in research and development.  There are certain sectors to which we will need to provide specific help to assist them, such as agrifood, but overall that would be the strategy that we would employ in terms of helping the hard-pressed middle earner.  We are very cognisant of the issue but in our view the strategy we are proposing would help them more in the medium to long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#P00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. McDonnell.

I wish to address a number of questions to Mr. Berney.<\/p><p>In regard to VAT in the hospitality sector, I note that ICTU really seemed to focus on the fact that the lower rate of VAT did not give anything back to workers.  Mr. Berney feels that his members have not benefited and are still being paid low wages when the sector is making profits.  That seems like quite a hostile approach.  It does not appear that ICTU has factored in the impact of Brexit on the hospitality sector, which is unknown.  It seems premature to revert to the prior rate and increase it without properly considering the impact of Brexit.  We could potentially lose jobs in the hospitality sector if the VAT rate were to go back up.  Has ICTU considered that?  <\/p><p> In terms of the rainy day fund, Mr. Berney says that we should spend it now and not save, but obviously this is a committee that has oversight of the budget and every household should put aside, if they can, savings in their budget.  It seems a prudent thing for a country to put aside some funds to protect itself in the event that the unforeseen happens.  I have to disagree with Mr. Berney on that point.<\/p><p> In regard to the housing help to buy scheme, Mr. Berney makes the point that the allocation of money to that scheme should be taken from it and reallocated to the local authorities.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has stated that money is no object in terms of building homes and that the local authorities have access to as much money as they need.  In that vein, the help to buy scheme was not referred to in terms of reducing it, or eliminating it.  What are his views on the Minister's suggestion that money for local authority housing is no object?<\/p><p> I will now address questions to Dr. McDonnell on the growth of GDP.  Obviously Government and politicians are fixated on the GDP growth rate, but my question is whether the welfare of the country is improving.  In the past number of years, we have seen an increasing number of people commuting longer distances to work, having to spend longer times on the train or in the car, resulting in increased stress levels and mental health issues.  The number of jobs has increased, but many are low paid or part-time jobs with zero contract hours offering no stability or security.  Now we are discussing the reintroduction of bed-sits to deal with our housing crisis.  We are very focused on GDP, GNP, GNI* and the measures of how the economy is doing, but there is little focus on the welfare of our people and our country.  I would like to hear Dr. McDonnell's views on that point.<\/p><p> Dr. McDonnell stated that we rank 25th in the OECD in terms of public expenditure on research and development.  We put money into tax relief for expenditure on research and development in the private sector.  Is it Dr. McDonnell's view or the view of the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, that we should redirect that money to public research and development?  Would the country and the people be better served if we did that?  Does that policy warrant a review?<\/p><p> I am glad that Dr. McDonnell referred to child care.  Many child care workers in the country are on the minimum wage and do not earn &euro;12 to &euro;15 an hour.  It has to be the only job where one can do a four year higher level degree and then earn the minimum wage.  We have major problems.  It is not a coincidence that it is a sector and a job that is predominantly done by women.  The country needs to get to grips with the fact that women are not treated equally.  In the year 2017, we are still moving around the subject of inequality, pay inequality, women's access to the workplace, and the low level of labour force participation predominantly among women, who have to take time out from work.  <\/p><p> I am very glad that Dr. McDonnell states that we should invest in child care.  I agree wholeheartedly.  It should have happened years ago.  We are so far behind, and we need to get moving on that.  I would like to hear the views of both Dr. McDonnell and Mr. Berney on shared parental leave.  We have maternity leave, but only the woman can take that leave.  It often makes financial sense for the household to do that, but it can mean six months and more out of the workplace.  The woman goes back to work but is very often been passed over by a colleagues who has been at work.  That is not to say anything against the person who has stayed at work, but we do not attribute enough value to the work in the home and we do not give the family the choice as to who can take time out.  It is my strong view that shared parental leave, where the parents make the choice as to who takes the time and when he or she will take it, would go a long way towards addressing the inequality that women face in the workplace today.<\/p><p> When we are talking about housing and homelessness, we very much focus on the acute issues of homelessness, people on the streets or in emergency accommodation.  I have a different experience as a person in my 30s.  Many of my friends cannot get on the property ladder and have no prospect of getting on the property ladder.  First, they cannot save the deposit, particularly if they are living in Dublin, and that is a problem for many people, but also because they are on contracts of six or 12 month duration and have no job security, the banks will not look at their applications.  What can we do?  The banking sector is operating on archaic and old regulations and old risk models.  They have not come up to speed with the way that work is now organised.  A job is not as secure as it once was.<\/p><p>Not everybody has a permanent, pensionable job and the days of such jobs are numbered.  What can we do for people in their 30s and 40s who are struggling to get access to finance?  On the USC, I take Dr. McDonnell's point that we should increase taxes but people want a break.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#P00300","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":64,"content":"<p>The Deputy's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#R00200","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>There are conversations about whether we should reduce the USC or widen the tax bands.

I know they do not agree wholeheartedly with reducing taxes but we have choices to make.  Do they think the USC is the best thing to address, rather than tax bands?<\/p> <p>  My final questions is on the sugar tax.  Companies have become very smart by using alternatives to sugar to sweeten their drinks.  A tax that may have been able to take in &euro;100 million in revenue would now only take &euro;40 million.  There is also a cross-Border problem.  What can we do to close off any loophole in that respect, to avoid implementing a tax and then being obliged to spend two or three years fixing the problem?  As with the rent pressure zones, there are loopholes and people are getting around them.  Landlords cannot increase rent by more than 4% so they are kicking tenants out to sell the house or revamp it for a family member to move into.  They then do not do that and just get new tenants.  Where we can see loopholes happening in advance, should we not close them off?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#R00300","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1505894400,"counter":66,"content":"<p>Deputy Josepha Madigan resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":67,"content":"<p>The question on the VAT rate referred to ending a subsidy, and that is what it is.  There is no evidence to suggest there would be job losses in the sector.  Employment in the sector has increased and will continue to increase significantly, though there is a Brexit risk associated with currency fluctuations.  I do not look at the currency markets every day but there has been a slight improvement in the position of sterling recently.  We can see no justification whatsoever for continuing the subsidy as it is simply profit-taking.<\/p> <p>  There was a question on earnings in child care.  The &euro;12 which I referenced is the average based on a survey we did and which I can supply to the Deputy.  The Deputy is correct that there is an appallingly low level of income in that sector and the trade unions are doing their best to provide the benefits of collective bargaining to workers in the sector.  We will continue to do that and through those efforts we can, hopefully, make a difference.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is also correct about young people struggling to get onto the property ladder through access to finance and our members talk to us all the time about the issue.  I am not sure what the answer is and there is no silver bullet for the problem but, in the past, local authorities provided housing finance to young people and couples who could not get mortgages through the private sector, and maybe we could look at that again.  It is all about resources and in the past hour or so we have identified measures which would probably entail spending all the country's income.  Unfortunately, we do not have it.  We have to prioritise so that we can, in the small fiscal space we have, make a difference.  As Dr. McDonnell said, however, there are major things on which we need to make a start, such as child care and the infrastructural deficit.  I agree that parental leave should be shared and it should be for a family to decide how to use it, rather than it be given to one parent over the other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Berney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I completely agree on the point about shared leave.  Having to take a career break is one of the most important factors in the gender pay gap.<\/p><p>That this is not shared leave is essentially discriminatory and shows a mid-20th century attitude to child care responsibilities.<\/p><p> As has been pointed out, those working in the child care sector, almost all of whom are women, are extremely badly paid.  The longer-term solution is to professionalise and systematise and to have the State provide the vast bulk of resources for the sector to ensure it becomes more formalised.  The State must deal with child care in the same way that it deals with primary and secondary education, including in terms of budgeting.  <\/p><p> On the issue of the research and development tax expenditures versus direct subsidies or funding of higher level institutes to carry out their own research, the OECD examined this issue in the case of Ireland.  Among the issues it noted was that public research and development expenditure in Ireland is extremely low, as is research and development expenditure at national level, that is, public and private expenditure combined.  It also noted that research and development tax expenditure is very costly and recommended that the direction of fiscal reform in this area be moved towards subsidies.  We do not do enough of this in Ireland and we do not provide sufficient support to the fourth level sector in the area of research and development.<\/p><p> The concept of national innovation systems and an entrepreneurial state is all about the triple helix, as it is known, of higher level education, the state and the private sector working together and co-ordinating.  Part of this could simply be the State taking equity stakes in high potential startups coming out of universities and research institutes.  We spend two thirds of what the top performing countries spend in this area.  This will lead to lower levels of productivity growth, a lower quality of life for everyone and less employment growth in the long run. <\/p><p> Another important aspect of this is the regional element because the universities not only in Dublin, but also in Cork, Limerick and Galway, are employment generation and innovation hubs in particular areas.  We are obviously aware of the capital plans for the period until 2040.  We view research and development as a form of capital.  While it is important to keep research and development separate from capital, it achieves the same effects as capital and boosts productivity in the long run.  That should be very much part of the plan.<\/p><p> While GDP growth is very high, it is meaningless at the moment.  It is an accounting artefact for reasons that are well understood.  The concept of modified domestic demand is a little bit better and the rate of growth under this measure has been strong in recent years, although not as strong as GDP growth.<\/p><p> As to whether welfare has been improving, deprivation rates are much higher than they were at the start of the crisis.  In 2015, the deprivation rate was 25.5% of households - more than one quarter - and the at-risk of poverty rate stood at 16.9%.  Professor John FitzGerald pointed this out.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":70,"content":"<p>What is the at-risk of poverty rate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#S00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>The latest figure, which was for 2015, is 16.9%.

The deprivation rate stood at approximately 10% before the crash and now stands at approximately 25%, having peaked at over 30% in 2013.  It remains very high, however, and indicates that many households are suffering, particularly those at the bottom of the income distribution scale.  The unemployment crisis was the main driver of this.  One of the things that will help a great deal will be employment growth.  Employment is considerably lower than it was at the height of the boom.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Chambers is correct that we have not been investing in infrastructure in recent years and investment was disproportionately hit.<\/p><p>It means that as employment grows, public transport infrastructure is creaking.  Coming on a train from Maynooth into Dublin one finds it difficult to breathe.  It is arguably unsafe.  Because of house prices in Dublin, people are having to move out to Meath, Louth and Wicklow, which means longer commutes and spending more time away from their families, which is psychologically devastating and corrosive in the long run.  These problems can be dealt with but it is the focus on things like infrastructure that will be very important.<br\/><br\/>I was asked about the great debate on increasing the standard rate versus reducing the USC.  Of course, it depends on what reforms one makes to USC.  There is only about &euro;333 million.  I made the point that increasing the standard rate cut-off point by &euro;1,000 would mean a full-year cost of marginally over &euro;200 million according to the Department of Finance's tax strategy group.  One could reduce the 2.5% rate to 1.5% at &euro;164 million, which would be approximately half the fiscal space.  With a break-down of 2:1 tax and spend, one is talking about net space of a little over &euro;100 million for taxes with, obviously, more arising from tax increases on excise that are likely to happen.  What one can do for households is really about shaving at the edges.  In our opinion, it is better to focus on things like child care.  From a progressivity point of view, reducing the universal social charge probably would be preferable.  As was pointed out, a lot of households will not benefit at all from an increase in the standard rate.  Again, in terms of the tax burden <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>other countries, low-income workers in Ireland pay very low effective rates, but middle earners also pay very low effective rates compared with other high-income EU member states.  It is kind of a rotten choice as I look at it.<br\/><br\/>I do not really have any solution in terms of the sugar tax.  The soft drinks companies have already changed the sugar content.  One cannot even buy some of the drinks that used to exist in 2016.  If it is in fact true that aspartame is not as damaging as sugar, the tax is already doing what it is supposed to do.  Excise is not technically supposed to bring in revenue, it is technically supposed to reduce bad behaviour and poor choices.  If the yield ultimately goes to zero, it will supposedly have done its job.  It is the same with alcohol and cigarettes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":75,"content":"<p>It is all about moderation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#T00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":76,"content":"<p>It is all about moderation, yes, so the State will always get a cut.  If they are getting away with it by changing their behaviour in a way that is positive for human health, I am fine with that.<\/p> <p>  I do not have a particular macro solution on the issue of affordable housing.  One of the things that will lead to more affordable housing in the long run is dealing with the mismatch between demand and supply.  Simply building more houses will cause house prices to come down.  They will come more into line with earnings for middle earners as that ratio improves, albeit I take the point about short-term contracts, which situation may improve as the labour market tightens.  We still have not reached our potential with job vacancy rates remaining poor in Ireland compared with other countries.  Workers will be able to negotiate better conditions as the market tightens and that will help.  Those policies in terms of building houses and the labour market taking care of itself will both assist in what the member is talking about.<\/p> <p>  Introducing some fiscal instrument to support those households may or may not be a good idea.  It would certainly be difficult to force banks to lend money to those households.  Presumably, the banks' models are based on probability of capacity to pay over the next 25 to 30 years.  Clearly, if they see a contract of six to 12 months, they would have an issue.<\/p><p>I do not necessarily have a solution to that problem other than to say that building houses will drop rental costs as well.  Part of the issue is that rental costs are so much higher than mortgage costs.  People want to buy houses, which is simply fuelling house prices, which will continue to increase over the next two years at least, unfortunately, and probably at a double digit rate.  The solution is getting the public and private sectors to build houses - the Deputy spoke about welfare - in areas close to urban centres, such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway city centres.  That should be the focus in terms of public policy.

It is probably fruitless to look at cross-country comparisons because the marginal tax rate is one of thousands of factors that affect employment rates within countries.  It is more useful to look at a single country over time.  In the United States, there have been fairly dramatic increases and decreases in the marginal tax rate over more than a century.  Over that time, there has been no relationship between marginal tax rates and economic growth or employment growth.  In fact, the golden era of the United States between 1945 and 1973 was the period when marginal tax rates were at their highest.  That is a fact, but it does not mean there is a causative relationship.  The literature suggests that whether a country has a tax burden of 20%, as it is in the United States, or of 50% to 55%, as it is in Denmark, makes very little overall difference to economic growth in the long run.<\/p><p>While the composition is obviously important, other factors, including the productivity of the economy, are much more relevant.

Ultimately, the marginal rate for self-employed above &euro;100,000 is the highest rate.  Personally, I find the debate on marginal tax rates to be somewhat problematic.  The effective tax rate is much more relevant.  From what I have seen, what is more important is effective tax rates at the bottom of the income distribution where there is a choice about labour market entry at all.  I have not seen the evidence about whether I will work if my marginal tax rate is 47% or 48% and I am on &euro;80,000 or &euro;90,000.  People tend to talk about a guy in a pub who said he would not move back to Ireland because of this.  I have not seen econometric evidence that suggests it is relevant although I would be very interested in seeing it.<\/p> <p>  Again, cross-country comparisons are extremely problematic because even the 28 member states of the EU are very different from each other.  The only way one can do any kind of analysis is of a single country over time where the institutional structure and the structure of the labour force are similar.  One could do state by state where relevant.  We have seen very good research on the minimum wage, for example.  That is the level at which one has to do it or one will otherwise fail the like-with-like test required in any scientific analysis.  As a final point, I note that while I say the marginal tax rate is not hugely important, it would be wrong to say it is of no relevance at all.  Clearly, all taxes have some impact on the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#Y00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Deputy Calleary has five minutes.

Dr. McDonnell said something in the early stage of his presentation about one of the bigger issues facing the economy, namely, the notion of interest rate increases.  In his engagement with Deputy Lahart, Dr. McDonnell spoke about families being under pressure and on the verge of poverty.  Deputy Lahart set out the experience we have all had.  How significant would a 1% increase in interest rates next year be on the figures Dr. McDonnell quoted for families at risk of poverty and on our general consumption trends and patterns?<\/p> <p>  I agree absolutely on child care.  A child can be four and a half or five when he or she moves to primary school but the education system and the way we value education is entirely different.  We need to do a great deal more.  If we implement a system of full payment and justify payment for child care workers in recognition of their degrees, will Mr. Berney's ICTU not then lob in a relativity claim for national school teachers to keep them separate?  We will then end up in this spiral we always do where we are watching over our shoulders.  I do not mean that in a smart aleck way, but when one looks at costings, one must look at all the knock-on effects.<\/p> <p>  On a similar note, Mr. Berney spoke about the public service pay agreement.  We have major difficulties at the moment in our health service in nursing, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy because we cannot fill vacancies.  The nature of our agreements are that everyone gets the same increase and we do not have the flexibility required at local management level to redesign contracts.  It is not even the pay element of contracts, it is also career breaks and so on.  There are entire nursing classes going to the UK after getting a degree here because our system does not allow career breaks or recognition of past work.<\/p><p>Is there not a point to be made in this regard?  Yes, there is the old-style agreement.  However, we need greater flexibility to respond to challenges.  Health care is the obvious one at present.  There is so much pressure.<\/p><p> On the VAT issue, Deputy Pearse Doherty is correct.  We have been forced to spend weekends in Dublin recently and the gouging of Dublin hotel prices that is going on is a disgrace.  There has been a drop of 140,000 in the number of UK visitors.  The west coast tourism market in particular depends on UK visitors.  The fall in numbers cannot just be dismissed as a matter of having to watch sterling or other currencies.  It is a very real figure.  Many areas depend on that market.  Even if it is not profit-taking, it is the market that keeps businesses and employment going.  That is the argument on the VAT issue.  Perhaps we need to separate it out between accommodation and food, as Deputy Pearse Doherty suggested.  There may be time to have a discussion about regionalising tax rates on consumption.  Dr. McDonnell pointed out that consumption taxes here are actually incredibly high.  Perhaps we should stop looking at the entire island and start looking at regions that need a particular boost.  This ties in with the discussion we were having yesterday about the sustainability of regional economies.<\/p><p> ICTU wants a housing emergency declared.  We all know what we are dealing with on a daily basis.  If we declare a housing emergency in the morning, what will that actually mean?  The difficulty is that we need to build houses.

If he takes the time to look at the submission ICTU made to the Joint Committee on the Future of Healthcare, he will see that we place major emphasis on the need for reform in the health sector and the need for portability of skills.  There are things nurses currently do which other grades could perhaps do.  There are things doctors do that may be more appropriate to nurses.  There is a whole process of organisational reform that could happen within the health service to address some of the problems to which the Deputy referred.  He talked about nurses leaving <i>en masse<\/i>to go to the UK.  There is an argument that we are not providing sufficient university places to train nurses.

There is a range of solutions, including reforms to the health service such as those I have talked about, to give nurses more responsibility and do some of the things to which the Deputy referred.  It is also necessary to look at how we train nurses and to consider whether we are training enough nurses and doctors to respond to the needs of the health service.  The public service pay agreement has charged the Public Service Pay Commission with looking at the retention and recruitment issue in the health service in order to identify the bottlenecks and consider how the problems can be resolved.  That work is going to be done as a priority and we should have a report on it before the end of the year.  That will address some of the issues raised by the Deputy.  The unions will make submission in the normal way to the commission.  I look forward to that report.<\/p><p>On the question of the VAT rate, the simple point we are trying to make is that we currently provide a very generous VAT rate to the hospitality sector.  We have a crisis in other parts of our economy, where that money could be better spent.  We strongly believe that the money provided through that subsidy could be better spent elsewhere.  We do not necessarily see the risk.  If we increased the VAT rate tomorrow, I do not see evidence that hotels and hospitality venues would close down across the west of Ireland.  While there has been a drop in visitor numbers from the UK, the numbers from the United States have increased in the same period with one group replacing the other.  That is according to statistics from the tourism industry.  It was on \"Morning Ireland\" just the other morning.  In the crisis that we are currently facing across a lot of our public services, there are better uses for the money that is being provided to the hospitality sector through the subsidy of the lower VAT rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#Z00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Berney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":153,"content":"<p>Would Mr. Berney not agree that it is an incentive or stimulus, particularly with sterling weakened at the moment and in terms of Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#AA00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":154,"content":"<p>If it were being used to reduce hotel room rates or prices in the sector for potential visitors, it might be possible to make that argument but there is no evidence of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#AA00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Berney"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Berney.

It would have a very damaging effect on the Irish economy.  The Department of Finance stability programme update in April or May gave an estimate as to how much a 1% increase would cost in terms of jobs and economic growth.  Given our very high private debt levels, an increase in interest rates would be a straight-up negative shock to the Irish economy, in my view, although it would perhaps bring some benefits to the banks.  There is nothing we can do about it, unfortunately.  The expectation is that interest rates will start to increase in 2019.  One thing that might work against this is if Brexit has a more devastating effect than is anticipated.  That might dampen growth and employment growth in the euro area, leading the ECB to postpone an interest rate increase.  In that case, however, we are wishing for one bad thing in order to avoid another bad thing.  Interest rates are going to go up.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that the Irish economy has been benefitting over the last few years from low oil prices and low interest rates.  They have supported the Irish economy and that support is going to go away.  The high rates of growth we are seeing at the moment should be understood as a temporary phenomenon.  We should not get carried away with thinking that we have moved completely past the crisis.  We do still have that burden in terms of households and businesses.  That is all the more reason to be prudent now.  To the extent that we are talking about fiscal policy, we should focus on things that will boost productivity rather than boosting income flows in the short term.  That would be my perspective.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Calleary made an interesting point about regionalisation of VAT.  It might then be prudent to have a system of regional authorities, perhaps not the 30 or so local authorities but a smaller number, such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and two or three others, with a certain degree of fiscal power over commercial rates, property tax and even VAT.  They might be allowed to set their own local economic plans.  I suppose it would empower county councillors to have a proper executive and legislature.  Without having that structure in place, however, regional VAT rates could be arbitrary.  Would we be talking about special zones for particular counties?  We could have issues in the adjoining county if, for example, there was a lower VAT rate in Longford than in Westmeath.  Would Dublin have one rate and the rest of the country another?  That could just push people out into Kildare and Meath for their shopping.  We need to be very careful about this.<\/p><p>If different parts of the country had different fiscal powers in different areas, that would be one thing, but having regional VAT rates could have unintended consequences.  However, I am certainly cognisant that the economy outside the M50 is not performing as strongly as is the case in Dublin.  It should be noted that when a recovery happens, it tends to happen in the dominant economic zones first and then tends to spread out.  We have not fully seen that yet but we are seeing unemployment rates, for example, falling across the board now.  That should continue for another year and a half.  It does not fully answer the Deputy's question about regionalising VAT.  However, it is an interesting idea and over the next 12 or 18 months we intend looking at regionalisation of fiscal policy, for example, to see if it is viable.  However, I do not have the answer yet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#AA00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tom McDonnell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I would like to thank the witnesses and-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#BB00200","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>May I ask-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#BB00300","speaker":"1361"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I asked the Deputy earlier and he said \"No\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#BB00400","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Further to what Dr. McDonnell just said, last week Fingal County Council increased its local property tax by reducing the 15% discount to 10%.

Ireland is particularly generous with some of the reliefs associated with inheritance tax.  Obviously, it is not very popular, but there is very different treatment of different assets.

Perhaps blending the reliefs might be a better solution.<\/p> <p>  We are also concerned that 80% of the pension tax relief goes to the top 20% of income earners.  Obviously, it is extremely regressive and it is not necessarily achieving its goal of ensuring that everybody has an adequate pension in old age, which presumably is the official goal at least.  To my mind, it would be better to use that money to increase the basic pension for everyone in the long term.  That would be one example.<\/p> <p>  Broadly speaking, we have a fairly jaundiced view of most tax expenditures.  Essentially, they are hidden subsidies to particular sectors.  Often they outlive their usefulness.  We believe that all tax expenditures should have sunset clauses attached and that they should be reviewed automatically every three years at least.  This does not mean that they should be abolished.  Some tax expenditures serve a very useful function.  The research and development tax expenditure was mentioned earlier.  I know some people have criticised it, but providing incentives to engage in research and development is a good thing.  Other examples could be given of positive tax expenditures.

A couple of years ago a former colleague of mine on the Commission on Taxation did a lot of good work in that area.  Many of the tax expenditures have already been closed off.

Again, a core point is that there should always be a sunset clause.

I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to appear before the committee and the opportunity to outline our views on a future tax strategy for the Irish indigenous sector aimed at strengthening and growing the country's tax base while building resilience into our economic model.  There are important factors against which we present this proposal: an increasing demand for expenditure on services to meet the needs of an expanding and ageing population; external political and economic risks that could impact Ireland's small economy, as highlighted by many international bodies as well as the Departments of Finance and the Taoiseach in their national risk assessment report; a highly concentrated tax base with very little buffering in the face of any unforeseen global or domestic disruptions; and a significant reliance on foreign-owned multinationals.<\/p> <p>  Foreign-owned multinationals account for 80% of Ireland's corporate tax base, and US multinationals account for 70% of employment in IDA-supported companies.  The foreign-dominated pharmaceutical sector on its own accounts for almost 40% of the value of manufacturing production in Ireland.  We have an Irish economy that is approximately one third smaller when the main effects of multinational activity are removed, using the new GNI* economic measurement as opposed to GDP.  Our debt ratio, using the GNI* measurement, is the fourth highest in the OECD, according to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council last week.<\/p> <p>  To deal with this backdrop of risks and vulnerabilities we need a diversified and resilient tax base that is capable of withstanding shocks.  However, our current base has become increasingly reliant on taxes on labour and on corporation tax paid by foreign multinationals, as the committee can see in the diagram we have provided.  Several international bodies have highlighted these dependencies to us.  The European Commission country report on Ireland this year said, \"The stability of tax revenues in the medium term is a concern for public finances ...  [T]he increasing reliance on buoyant corporate tax receipts to finance permanent increases in current expenditure is a concern.\"  It stressed that \"Ireland is a small and ... open economy [and] its public finances remain vulnerable to external shocks and changes in economic outlook\".  The IMF has also been instructive regarding what Ireland must do.  It recommends that our policies focus on rebuilding fiscal buffers and strengthening resilience.  It said measures to strengthen human capital and reinforce competitiveness, particularly for domestic enterprises, are key to supporting sustained growth and reducing regional disparities.<\/p> <p>  While Ireland cannot control external shocks, what it can control, it must.  The Government's report on Irish trade, Ireland Connected, stresses that the key to sustaining jobs and incomes is Ireland's ability to succeed in international markets.  Our national plans have placed a firm focus on exports as key to our economic growth.  New EU free trade agreements, an expanding eurozone economy and rapid growth in services as a share of world trade represent real opportunities for Ireland.  However, we need tax policy and tax administration changes if we are to realise the plan.  While Ireland's exporting story has been one of success, there is an acceptance that it is highly dependent on exports from foreign companies and that our indigenous export model is skewed in many respects.  Although there are \"superstar\" Irish performers that are globally focused, Irish manufacturing companies remain narrowly concentrated.<\/p> <p>  In parallel with our high-performing FDI sector, Ireland now needs an innovative, export-led indigenous sector.  We rightly have a comprehensive roadmap for FDI.  However, a detailed and long-term roadmap is also urgently needed for the indigenous sector.<\/p><p>The thorough and strategic approach that we have adopted on FDI must be applied for the benefit of Irish indigenous companies and entrepreneurs if we are not just to protect our tax base but to grow it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#DD00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Olivia Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Before I commence I wish to say that this is the piece of work we did and it is effectively the strategy we are proposing for the indigenous sector.  This is the Government's strategy for tax and foreign direct investment, FDI.  Fundamentally, we are saying that we want to see an equivalent of that for the Irish indigenous sector and this is our suggestion for what that might look like.<\/p> <p>  Detailed analysis from the Irish Tax Institute's new report highlights a range of mismatches in tax policy that are hindering efforts to grasp global trade opportunities and meet the challenges Ireland faces.  While our 12.5% corporation tax rate is valued by many Irish businesses, we have a pattern of sustained high rates across a range of other taxes that are critical for growth and we have some tax reliefs that are either not available or not accessible to Irish SMEs.  The right tools, supported by the right policies are essential.  This urgent need to change tax policy is reflected in independent research we did with Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes where 84% of the companies to whom it spoke believe that tax policies relating to the future of the Irish indigenous sector need to be addressed in this year's budget.  We must take a strategically-focused approach to Irish business and address barriers in the tax environment.  Policies that focus on the country's access to highly-skilled talent, expertise, innovation and R&amp;D, as well as capital investment and finance, are critical to the plan.<\/p> <p>  The first challenge for releasing the necessary dynamism that the IMF has stressed as critical, is the high capital tax environment.  We know that Irish SMEs are more reliant on bank finance than those in other EU member states and that they need to diversify into other equity sources of finance.  The Government has recognised the need to develop appropriate alternative funding mechanisms to support companies over the coming years.  This makes the capital gains tax environment critical.  However, the high capital gains tax rate is restricting external investment in Irish businesses and creating \"reluctant\" business owners who may hold onto businesses beyond the point where they have the capacity to grow them to the scale required in a new global exporting environment.  Unless addressed, that will hinder the structural changes needed for a new and more resilient export model, including the national ambition to \"increase the number of our Irish-owned companies of scale by 30%\".  In fact, the 33% CGT rate is the fourth highest rate in the OECD and ten percentage points above the median OECD CGT rate.  It is also high when one compares it with Germany, which has a rate of 25%, and also an excellent record of business investment.<\/p> <p>  We do have a targeted \"entrepreneur relief\" which reduces the high CGT burden on business sales to a limited degree and is especially important given the serious competition from the UK regime, as highlighted earlier this month by the UK Institute for Fiscal Studies.  Ireland&rsquo;s CGT regime is not competitive when compared with the UK and the entrepreneur relief which should mitigate our high rates locks out important angel investors, who are willing to invest money, experience and industry expertise in ambitious young companies.  Business angel investment in Ireland is low compared with other countries such as the UK, Spain, France, Germany and Sweden, which are doing this well.<\/p> <p>  There has been much talk about our personal tax regime in the context of an export strategy.  We need the best human capital and talent to build management expertise, innovation and R&amp;D capability and to drive export-led expansion.  However, challenges abound here too.  In addition to having high personal tax rates, Ireland does not currently have a workable share option scheme that allows SMEs to attract and reward highly skilled and hard-found talented employees.  SMEs must compete with larger companies for talent and 38% of them do not believe they can compete with the larger companies when recruiting for the best candidate.  A new share option scheme would help them attract the talent they need.<\/p> <p>  On R&amp;D and innovation, which is the second pillar, in the work and research carried out, especially post-Brexit, innovation and new product development are deemed essential to export growth.  Only 1% of small firms and 16% of medium firms consider themselves to be R&amp;D active, which is a low number in the context of our national ambitions.  Innovation in younger companies has flat-lined since 2009.  The 1% figure is a concern in the context of IMF findings which show that SMEs are the drivers of change in innovation.<\/p><p>Ireland has an attractive R&amp;D tax credit regime, but some administration barriers are weighing on its success in terms of the low take-up among SMEs.  Irish Tax Institute research shows that 75% of companies are aware of the R&amp;D tax credit and 20% have availed of it.  However, of those who availed of it, almost half said that the process was difficult to prepare for and administer and only 35% of companies surveyed said that they intend to use it in the next 18 months, although that would rise to 62% if there was more clarity around the criteria for qualification.<\/p><p> In summary, we appreciate that fiscal constraints limit the funds available in this year's budget and that not all the essential policy changes can be addressed this year.  In light of the urgency of Brexit and the need to capture markets we would like to see some changes that might assist in the talent and innovation area.  These include a less punitive capital tax environment; a workable share options regime; some reduction in the personal tax burden and; and, an improvement to the foreign earnings deduction regime.<\/p><p> In the longer term, which in some ways is almost more important, we would like to see the announcement of a new tax roadmap for the Irish indigenous sector, alongside the roadmap for FDI so that we give Ireland the best possible growth opportunity into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#EE00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Cora O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Brien and Ms Buckley for their presentations.

What do the witnesses consider to be the fairest and most progressive way of doing that?  I am conscious that if we reduce, for example, the 5% rate of USC to 4.5% we will hit 1.3 million people.

In budget after budget, we have debate and conflict surrounding the small amount of money available to respond to major demands for increases in expenditure on capital, social services, housing and health.  We also have a small amount available for tax cuts to relieve people of the burden of taxation on labour.  We need to focus on a plan for growing the tax base.  In a country with a population of 4.7 million, there is only limited scope for broadening the tax base from domestic sources.  Some 40% of Exchequer returns come from labour, while a further &euro;10 billion is collected from PRSI, although technically PRSI does not qualify as a tax.  These are significant sums which are collected on the back of labour and work.  VAT generates another substantial amount of State income.<br\/><br\/>Unless we want to increase taxes, which is a very difficult decision, the only way to broaden the tax base is to achieve growth outside the country by taking advantage of external opportunities.  One of the areas on which our study focused was services, the largest area of growth in world trade and an area in which Ireland is particularly good.  Trade in services is growing at 10%.  While we have the potential to take advantage of this growth, we also have significant skill shortages in this area.  For example, one State-owned website, <i>TechlifeIreland.com<\/i>, currently features 3,000 job vacancies.  We must avail of the advantages that present themselves.  Growing the tax base means asking what we can do outside our population of 4.7 million people.<br\/><br\/>In the context of the Brexit debate, one of the questions being asked is why a country would remove itself from the European market and the seamless transit it offers for goods, services and people.  We can take advantage of the value this market offers.  On the economic front, recent positive figures show growth returning to the eurozone economy.  The question is how we can take advantage of this and grow our tax base.  The way to do this is through exports but this requires us to have entrepreneur and business friendly tax policies as we face into a budget with tight constraints. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#GG00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Olivia Buckley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I will address some of the other questions Deputy Chambers asked.  On the share options scheme, the main difficulty with share options is that income tax is charged on options when they are exercised, which is likely to be before the person has sold the shares.  As such, the person will not have money to pay the tax.  A capital gains tax also applies.  Both these taxes are high.<\/p> <p>  Share options are generally provided in small companies.  For example, a person may wish to forgo a high salary in a large company to take a chance on an innovative company achieving growth.  Offering such persons share options to work for the company is an important way of attracting talent to small and innovative companies.  While share options must be taxed, in other countries, for example, Sweden, they are taxed at the point at which the person sells the shares and has cash to pay the tax.  In such circumstances, the sale is subject to capital gains tax.  We would like to see a share options scheme as small companies, in particular, need one. <\/p> <p>  On personal tax, a debate is taking place on whether to use the &euro;200 million available to reduce the universal social charge or widen tax bands.  We are trying to move forward from the budget to budget approach.  There are different proposals on the table, all of which are intended to relieve the tax burden but only by a little as there is not much fiscal space available.  Our focus is on growing the fiscal space to ensure we have more money to play with in future as we seek to make the necessary reforms to the personal tax regime.<\/p><p> The decision to reduce the corporate tax rate to 12.5% was one of the best things we have ever done in terms of tax strategy and in providing certainty and assurance.  The current rate is generating corporate tax receipts at equivalent ratios to countries with much higher rates.  It is also the right thing to do for a small and open economy.  The debate about corporate, personal and capital tax must take place against the backdrop of the type of economy we have.  Our message is very much that we should start with the overall economic objectives and needs and work back to tax policy, rather than taking each tax head in isolation and arguing it should be set at this or that rate.  I agree the corporate tax rate is very sustainable and certain. <\/p><p> Corporate tax is volatile in all countries.  While Ireland has a high dependency on foreign multinational companies - these companies are very welcome and the money they provide helped us through the crisis - one of the reasons we produced the report was to seek to achieve greater balance and sustainability by generating more revenue from the domestic sector.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Cora O'Brien","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I also asked a question about combining the universal social charge with PRSI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#HH00200","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":184,"content":"<p>That would be a substantial undertaking and one which would certainly simplify the tax system.

There are a number of angles to this.  A lot of work is going on in terms of the feedback from our membership.  There has been a huge amount of Brexit briefings and advisory work.<\/p><p>Companies are seeking advice on what sort of plans they need to be make for customs union arrangements, what this implies and what it costs.  Much of the research has been done in the vacuum of not knowing the final details but our companies and their advisers are certainly very focused on it.  We will be in London next week to meet our sister institute, the Chartered Institute of Taxation, CIOT, along with its Belfast members.  We had meetings in Belfast and Dublin earlier in the summer.  There is no doubt that the focus is on the mechanics, namely, on what may happen and how.<\/p><p> The broader issue of whether companies are Brexit-ready goes back perhaps to our export strategy.  A number of worrying statistics came out in the past couple of months.  When we conducted our research into behaviour and attitudes, we looked at export-prone companies, that is, companies in export-driven sectors.  There are three worrying statistics here.  Most companies are still focused on the domestic market as their real priority.  Over half of the companies we looked at were exporting to the UK.  However, those that are not already doing so do not, for obvious reasons relating to Brexit, see huge potential to do so in the next 18 months.  Fewer than half are exporting beyond the UK market and do not see themselves doing so in the next 18 months.  There is an underlying cautiousness, fear and lack of confidence, a sense of constrained circumstances - whether they involve finance, capacity or sales staff - and a sense of an inability to enter export markets in the eurozone in particular.  We know that the eurozone has been prioritised by Enterprise Ireland as one of the areas in which we can really take advantage.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation is also looking at Europe's free trade agreements with countries such as Japan and Canada to see what advantage we can take from these.  There is, however, an underlying sense of worry.<\/p><p> Diversification is the real answer to Brexit.  Quite apart from dealing with the mechanics of Brexit, I am not so sure that we are Brexit-ready when it comes to diversification to markets in other countries.  The chief executive of Enterprise Ireland spoke on \"Morning Ireland\" recently from the latter's showcase event.  I do not have the statistics from the Enterprise Ireland survey to hand, but one of the areas she highlighted was the research showing that companies were not as Brexit-ready as they might like in the broader terms of looking at the world.  Our export figures show that most of our exports in both services and goods, that is, approximately 85% to 90%, are carried out by multinational companies.  This means that only 10% of our overall exports are driven by the indigenous sector.  We do not have the same level of statistics for services, but looking at goods and products we can see that we have some really good superstars, companies that have conquered the world, and we are very proud of them.  However, only 11% of them are exporting more than 20 products to more than 20 countries and they account for almost 50% of the value.  The fact that our indigenous sector is reduced down to 10%, with 11% of those accounting for 50% of our exports, shows how limited we really are.  The median number of countries our companies export to is actually five and the median number of products exported is four.  Nine out of ten products exported by our indigenous companies are food products and one of these - chilled boned beef - accounts for 23% of our exports.<\/p><p> Ms O'Brien has already dealt with the area of innovation, diversification and research and development, which has flatlined in small companies.  Very small and medium-sized companies consider themselves to be innovation-active.  We have a great deal going for us but we also have much work to do.  No stone must be left unturned.<\/p><p> In the context of our tax policies as supported by our tax administration system - which will Ms O'Brien might want to expand upon - if the members wish to be Brexit-proofed as policymakers, they will have to look at every line of possibility in terms of what we can do for SMEs and how we might - with the relevant policies in place to support this - transform Ireland into a really ambitious country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#JJ01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Olivia Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>The tax administration issue is really about support services for small businesses.

We live in a world where I believe capital has too much power.  In the negotiated position of the various factors of production, and because capital can move so fast and is so transferable, it has huge power over labour.  Natural capital does not move so it is completely undermined in the current economic system that we have.  Everything is designed to support the interests of capital and we forget about the labour and natural capital or costs. A lot of the political problems currently happening around the world are, I believe, because labour rates are not increasing.  The share of income going to capital versus labour is historically completely out of kilter, not just in Ireland but across the board.  Would the witnesses agree with that view as a broader macroeconomic assessment?  Any time, therefore, we have people coming in to say we have to reduce the burden on capital I believe that this is not the world we are in with regard to the big challenge.  Let us say we went from 33% down to 25%, which makes rational sense to promote the indigenous economy, where would we get that &euro;200 million from?

I will make some general comments on why we have focused on this area and Ms O'Brien might wish to add something on the technicalities.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of reasons for this focus in our report.  As Ms O'Brien outlined, we find ourselves with the fourth highest rate of capital gains tax in the OECD with a median percentage of 23%.  Countries like Germany and the UK have much lower rates.  We view ourselves as an open economy where a cold wind has a significant economic effect, given the nature and scale of our economy.<\/p> <p>  An issue was raised acutely by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in the UK last week.  It outlined that the mobility of capital and people is a risk for Ireland, given that we are a small country neighbouring the UK with Newry less than one hour up the road from here.<\/p> <p>  Ms O'Brien has researched another issue relating to capital taxes, so I will let her pick up on this point after I have finished.  We have a national ambition.  Multiple extensive and thorough reports on Brexit were commissioned and well written by many people.  There were reports from the then Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and Ireland Connected on the Brexit challenges facing Ireland.  One of the major elements that these reports examined was the need to scale up our companies.  If one is going to expand and drive into export markets, one needs to scale up.  The figures set out in one of those reports - I believe it was Ireland Connected's report - indicated that we needed to scale up our companies by 30%.  That requires investment at a time when we as a country have a greater dependency on bank finance than anyone else.  Interest rates have been raised as an issue in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Other countries have far more competitive regimes than ours in terms of attracting angel and third-party investors to companies.  We are low compared with the UK, Spain, France, Germany and Sweden.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the debate on capital or labour, we consider what strategic direction is required, what other countries have used, how competitively do we stand on capital taxation and what do we need to grow our companies not just for the sake of growing them, but to give our people the best chance economically.  Going back to the beginning of our argument, this is all about people having world class services and giving children the best chance at education.  We need the best hospitals and health services and we want housing, but we must look to Exchequer returns and see what can be accumulated that will allow us to do all of that for our people.  This debate is not for the sake of the accumulation of capital and wealth, rather it is about how to give a country of just 4.7 million people the best chance and deciding what role the capital environment will play in that.<\/p><p>It plays an important part in other people's strategies and in the scaling of their companies.  As a country, we must ask ourselves what a competitive environment is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#NN00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Olivia Buckley","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":227,"content":"<p>We are considering this matter from two points of view, namely, what will help small businesses to grow and become more dynamic and what will generate more tax for the Exchequer.

As we sit here discussing issues such as what is the best way to cut &euro;200 million in personal income taxes, as Fianna F&aacute;il members have asked a number of people, there are 456 patients lying on trolleys.  Many of them are in pain, some of them are extremely elderly and some are very vulnerable.  As we came here this morning 3,000 children woke up in emergency accommodation, accompanied by 5,000 adults.  Rough sleepers were moved along from doorways.  We use feeble words such as, \"We need to challenge or address the crisis in health or housing\", yet the debate is completely occupied by reduction in personal income tax rates.  I must be unique among the other political parties because nobody comes to my office to ask for a reduction in personal income tax rates, although many people tell me they are under pressure because of the costs of child care, education, health and so forth.  The institute has also been a party to that debate.  That is its role.  How can the institute suggest that we should reduce the tax rates or marginal tax rates at a point when it is so familiar with the other crises that exist and with the fact that the pot is not bottomless?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#PP00700","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":251,"content":"<p>I will try to step back a little from that.

What is driving ours and where we need to get our money is exports.  There is also foreign direct investment, which we cannot forget in the debate.  There is huge movement in and out of the country by a very mobile labour market.  There has not been enough research carried out on what is the right income tax policy for a very small open economy.  I would welcome some economic analysis.  We cannot do that as we are not an economic body, but we would definitely support the right income tax policy for Ireland for the next five years.

Ms Freeman has just recently joined the organisation and is still coming to terms with the volume of paperwork, so I will do most of the talking.  I thank the committee for inviting us here today and for taking the time to look at these very important matters.<\/p> <p>  As the committee members will know, Chambers Ireland is the largest business organisation in the State.  With over 45 member chambers in our network, we represent businesses in every region and economic sector in Ireland.  We are very much generalist and represent all types of business without breaking them down into specific sub-sectors.  This geographic representation gives us a unique understanding of the challenges facing businesses throughout Ireland.  In particular, we know and understand the threats to those doing business and providing much-needed jobs in towns and villages.  We also understand the opportunities and believe Government can play a major role in minimising the threats and turning the opportunities into realities.<\/p> <p>  Moving straight on to the first area we were asked to address, the 9% rate of VAT in the hospitality sector has contributed significantly to the growth of tourism and jobs in the last few years.  Tourists are also arriving from increasingly diversified markets.  We welcome recent announcements about new direct air links and affordable fares, which will undoubtedly contribute to this area.  However, in spite of 4.2% growth in arrivals in the first six months of 2017, there was a concerning fall of 6.4% in visitor numbers from Great Britain during that period.  The tourism and hospitality sector has particular regional importance, providing much-needed employment in rural Ireland and Border areas.  The fall in tourist numbers from Great Britain was predicted following Brexit.  The fall in the value of sterling has made Ireland less attractive financially while also potentially improving the competitiveness of UK tourist offerings for Irish and other eurozone visitors.  There is also a competitiveness aspect this debate.  Some 17 out of 19 eurozone countries have tourism VAT rates of 10% or less, making our current rate competitive against that cohort.  Taking those matters into consideration, together with the uncertainty surrounding the nature of and timeframes for Brexit, we believe that the 9% VAT rate should remain in place.  To increase it to our standard rate of 13.5% would be detrimental to the sector.<\/p> <p>  On the vacant site levy and local property tax, Chambers Ireland has long called for a broad-based system of property taxation.  The chief attributes required for such a system to be acceptable would include a local tax to fund local services and local development needs; fairly applied taxation, in that everyone should contribute something; taxation that is structured to broaden the revenue base of local government leading, in turn, to a reduction in the pressure on the business community via rates and other charges; and that the tax should be equitable.  Having established the local property tax and a high compliance ratio, we are concerned that the objectives above are being watered down with property values still locked at 2013 levels and many exemptions now in place.<\/p> <p>  We appreciate the difficulties significant increases in house prices cause when computing liabilities.  However the bands and rates of taxation applied could, for example, be adapted.  In addition, local authorities have flexibility to vary LPT payable through the local adjustment factor by an amount of plus or minus 15%.  While it falls within the remit of local councils to determine the use of this factor, there is an opportunity for appropriate use of this flexibility to raise funds for local services and development which otherwise could not be delivered or would have to be funded by increases in business rates.  We have called on councils to assess the opportunity in each of their areas to raise additional funds.  In the long term, Government should consider the development of a land tax that is based on the value of a parcel of land as a replacement for LPT.  As the value of a piece of land increases, the rate of tax increases.  Such an approach to land management would encourage improved use of land and not penalise improvements in the way LPT does.  With regard to the vacant site levy which is due to be levied from January 2019, we have recommended that it be brought forward to January 2018 as one of several measures that could be employed to encourage housing development.  <\/p> <p>  Turning to our pre-budget submission, we conducted an extensive consultation process with our network about the concerns of the business community, feedback from which forms the basis of our submission.  We recognise that there is limited fiscal space and we strongly encourage Government to continue to urge the EU to review and update the fiscal space calculations to reflect economic circumstances, the nature of investments proposed and relative borrowing costs.<\/p><p>There has been a very strong message from our network that investment in infrastructure needs to be the absolute priority in budget 2018 with a preference that other matters such as small business focus and tax reform are addressed by making commitments under the multi-annual framework model for future budgets.  A significant component of the rationale for this was the importance of maximising our competitiveness in light of Brexit uncertainty.  Our submission is fully laid out on our website.<\/p><p> The key elements are in three separate areas: infrastructure, small business focus and tax reform.  The feedback was that investment in infrastructure should take precedence.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe's commitment to an additional &euro;4.1 billion in capital spending between 2018 and 2021 is welcome as is the commitment to link capital plans to the national planning framework, NPF.  We believe the NPF is hugely important.  <\/p><p> One of the key areas we need that investment to target is housing.  Our current issues in housing are a huge threat to Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.  We welcome the attention it is receiving but it is vitally important to implement the latest plans with a huge sense of urgency.  Transport is a crucial area for investment.  Greater connectivity between our regions and improving inter-city transport should be prioritised.  The Government must deliver the national planning framework, the next draft of which is due at the end of September, and we need to ensure that spending on infrastructure ties in strategically with that.  A recent Indecon Cork and Limerick Chambers research report found an M20 motorway would create over 5,000 jobs, help create a seamless Atlantic corridor and enable much greater connectivity between the regions.  Our ports infrastructure and connectivity to those ports also needs to be upgraded particularly to help open up more direct access to EU markets in light of Brexit.<\/p><p> It is essential to roll out the national broadband plan as soon as possible.  Businesses cannot function without quality high speed broadband.  It affects a company&rsquo;s ability to do business, hampers access to new markets and renders it increasingly difficult to do business with the Government, for example, applying for Government tenders, dealing with Revenue and filing annual returns with the Companies Registration Office.  Download and upload speeds also need to be future-proofed to ensure competitiveness with other jurisdictions.  <\/p><p> In the area of energy, our priority is ensuring a dependable and sustainable supply.  We also have to be ready for a welcome increase in population of 1 million people over the next 25 years as the CSO has predicted.  We need to prioritise continual investment in our grid infrastructure and address climate change issues.  We have more detailed information in our full pre-budget submission.  We need to know how it is proposed to fund a sustainable water supply across the country from general taxation, to ensure reliable funding and to open up the opportunity to raise external funding for vital projects.  <\/p><p> In the area of education, Ireland continues to have the youngest population in Europe with one-third of the population under the age of 25.  We must aspire to be the best there is with a best practice education system encompassing everything from early child care to college education and beyond.  In the area of adult education and upskilling in business, with unemployment heading for 6% and below, which is a great story, there is a need to reallocate funding from unemployment programmes to schemes specifically geared at upskilling those already in employment.  This will increase our competitive capability internationally and augment the ability of existing businesses to grow.<\/p><p> We need to continue investment in accessible, affordable, high quality child care services and to meet our commitments outlined in the national women&rsquo;s strategy. <\/p><p> I will now turn to the other two sections.  Recognising that we would like to see the concept of the multi-annual framework model being used here and limiting the surprises in a budget, the small business focus should continue to be the retention of the 9% VAT rate, the implementation of an employee share ownership scheme tailored to the needs of SMEs and establishing grant support for SMEs undertaking innovative research and development.  In addition, there should be Brexit supports including financial commitment to back up announced proposals to expand our networks overseas and additional supports for a wide range of businesses to expand our export horizons with the necessary training and skills. <\/p><p> On tax reform, we need to reduce the marginal rate of tax below 50%.  We need a competitive capital gains tax regime with the UK.  We need to continue commitments we have made in the past to supporting the self-employed, entrepreneurs and small businesses in areas such as the USC surcharge, income tax credit, parity for the self-employed in maternity and paternity benefits and a tax credit on employers PRSI for micro-enterprises <\/p><p> We greatly welcome the committee&rsquo;s interest in these areas and are happy to respond to its questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#SS00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":273,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Talbot for his opening statement.

The question for us is what will happen if we are even 4.5% less competitive?  We must also consider that depreciation in the value of sterling might potentially put people off coming to eurozone areas.  It is not just an Irish problem.  There is a risk of Irish consumers heading to the UK.  There are several risks that could undermine the amount of revenue we collect that would be taxed, whether the rate is 9% or 13.5%.<\/p> <p>  The other issue that came through very strongly from our network was the regional-rural impacts that could arise from this.  Our geographic mandate means we are very focused on towns, villages and communities across the country.  We have some way to go before we get the tourism and the recovery fully out to all those areas.  I mentioned things such as the national planning framework.  It is really important to ensure we target investment so people can understand where they fit into the national planning framework.  Are they one of the cities that will be developed or are they a rural area that needs to link into it?  We feel the retention of the 9% rate is important to retain jobs particularly in regional and rural areas.  <\/p> <p>  On the other question about the lack of diversification, there are several ways of looking at it.  There is diversification in what they do and diversification in the markets in which they sell.  We are all hoping to see further supports and hopefully EU support for further supports to assist companies to diversify the markets they are selling into.  We focus on things such as the need to upgrade ports infrastructures to facilitate Irish exporters with more direct access into EU markets from our ports rather than having to, for example, go across the UK.  With regard to the diversification of the products and services companies, we are a very innovative nation and we have lots of things going on.

The Chairman talked about the presentation from ICTU and its very strong proposal that the VAT rate should be increased.  Part of that is coming from the fact that it is still perceived as a very low paying sector and that the benefit in the reduction of VAT has not been passed on to employees or, if it has, it is marginal.  I would like to hear Mr. Talbot's views on that.  It is very difficult to maintain the VAT rate at 9% when there are hoteliers in Dublin charging &euro;600 for a room without breakfast.  There is a regional aspect to it.  In the west of Ireland, which I represent, it is vastly different to Dublin.  How do we deal with that?  It seems as though there are huge profits being made in some urban centres, with the benefit not being passed on to the employees and the price reductions not being passed on to the consumer.<\/p> <p>  In terms of preparedness for Brexit, how prepared does Mr. Talbot think his members are?  Are there any things we should be taking into consideration for the budget for next year and for the committee's work into the future in terms of helping Chambers Ireland members?  <\/p> <p>  Mr. Talbot spoke about the need for investment in transport, broadband and infrastructure.  In the west of Ireland, there is a massive infrastructure deficit and broadband is a huge issue.  It appears that lots of the resources available are being pumped into infrastructure projects in urban areas.  While we need that because we have populations migrating east - if they are not emigrating - it is creating huge problems for us in the west of Ireland.<\/p><p>What are Mr. Talbot's thoughts in terms of regional balance for this budget?  Are we in the west of Ireland getting our fair share of the investment in infrastructure as opposed to the rest of the country?  In terms of job creation, there are now people commuting exceptionally long distances.  They are spending a lot of time in their cars and on trains, increasing the time away from their families.  It is having a devastating impact on family life, on mental health and on all those other factors.  What are the members of Chambers Ireland saying about that?  From where are they getting their pool of people?  Obviously the housing issue is definitely having an impact on that, but the fact that our investment in infrastructure and capital is so weighted towards the urban centres means that we are not giving the regions a fair chance at providing that employment and assisting them to keep people in those areas.  <\/p><p> My final question is on climate change.  I know Mr. Talbot has touched on this and on the need to address these issues.  This country is looking at substantial fines.  How prepared is the business community to adapt to any budgetary measures which might be introduced in order to tackle emissions targets?  Has Mr. Talbot's organisation done any work on how industry and businesses might cope with the huge fines we may face?  How receptive are they to doing their fair share in terms of reducing emissions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#UU00400","speaker":"1336","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":279,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

They are now working much more closely together and are seeing the value of getting together to get higher levels of investment into an area.<\/p> <p>  To address the Deputy's specific queries, on the low-pay sector there is a question mark between when the rate of unemployment was at 15% and now, when it is down to 6%.  We certainly now need to be looking at the quality of jobs that are coming through.  If we go back to looking at the 9% rate of tax and when it should be changed, we continue to believe that now is not the right time.  I did not really mention it earlier but I specifically mentioned international competitiveness in my presentation.  Approximately 10% seems to be the normal rate for tourism businesses in Europe.  We feel that 9% is right in that sector at the moment.  It is creating employment and with the unemployment level coming to 6% other challenges in the economy will be created.  We may start to see wage pressure coming through for example.  I think we are seeing that because we are reaching full employment.  We believe that is positive.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of Dublin hotels being able to charge the rates they can charge at the moment, we have spoken to tour operators and and such businesses.  They say that if one is trying to get a tour coming into Ireland and visiting the east and west coasts, it is still important to get people into Dublin, but it is vitally important that they come to Ireland and we get them over the far side.  It is also vitally important that when cruise ships come calling to ports other than Dublin that there are attractions which can get people off the boat and spending money locally.  There are a whole lot of areas in which we need to remain competitive in the tourism sector.  I am not sure how the obvious shortage of supply that is facilitating hotel prices in Dublin can be dealt with.  <\/p> <p>  I keep coming back to two things.  First, our focus as an organisation this year is that infrastructure must be the priority.  We have said that we are prepared to forgo some of our other typically standard projects, such as tax reform, small business supports and so on, to make sure that we are spending money on infrastructure around the country.  I know it is a little bit further south than the Deputy's constituency, but I specifically mentioned the Cork to Limerick motorway and that then joins up all the way up to Gort, Tuam and Galway.  It is really opening up the Deputy's area.  We are pushing very hard for that sort of infrastructure building.  I also specifically mentioned how important we believe the national planning framework is in order for us to have a proper debate about how we support regional and rural development and not just to allow Dublin to keep growing at the rate at which it has traditionally grown.  We really believe that national planning framework is vitally important in starting to address some of the many issues.  We do not feel that it will be too easy to address them in budget 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#VV00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":282,"content":"<p>Before Mr. Talbot moves off that point, he has spoken about the motorway from Gort into Tuam and then on to Dublin.<\/p><p>One could draw a line from Tuam up to Mullingar and one would cut off the entire north west.

We are also very focused on the far north west, the Letterkenny and Donegal area, for example.

We are very focused on these things but I thank the Deputy for pointing out that there is more we can do and we would love to do more in that regard.<\/p> <p>  If the Deputy is happy for me to move on to other points, on the whole area of climate change, we have not looked overly closely at the impact of fines and how the business community will deal with them.  We believe our members are very open to dealing with climate change.  There is a sense of frustration among our members at times at the length of time it can take to get really important planning approvals in respect of energy, the national grid and those sorts of things.  Our members would be very supportive of efforts by organisations to put in proper infrastructure which would help us meet our climate change targets.  To go into the detail of our pre-budget submission again, we have many recommendations on areas such as electric vehicles, the electrification of the public transport fleet and the Government using Government procurement and the e-tender platform to facilitate and encourage more environmentally friendly purchasing by Government itself.

Moving on to where the witnesses have spoken about land tax, what is their thinking in that regard?  Do they think that the local property tax is not a just system in the sense that major property across the country is not taxed?  On that issue, there is a planned re-evaluation, possibly for 2019, which will lead to major increases for households in urban areas, certainly in parts of Dublin.  I note the views of some commentators, including our colleague, Senator McDowell, for example, who sent us a briefing recently.  It is probably related to the next election.  He is hoping that some of us may be able to vote for him as a Senator.  He made the proposal that perhaps there should be some kind of regional valuations system.<\/p> <p>  To be fair we have been trying to broaden the tax base as much as possible and this committee is very interested in doing so but the property tax is becoming the local government tax, as other people have said.  Obviously Mr. Talbot's organisation has a heavy involvement in this area in the context of rates and it members have a huge interest as business people, as well as as householders, in respect of what happens with them.  Has Chambers Ireland given any attention to the efficiency of councils?  Many people have been taken aback by how lethargic local councils sometimes are in respect of moving on the housing crisis, for example, or moving on other major issues.  Councils are very often involved in many kinds of local development issues, but sometimes people think they should stick to the knitting, which is providing the basic essential services for households and businesses.<\/p><p>I wonder whether Mr. Talbot can see trouble ahead with regard to the local property tax, which was not the subject of huge political campaigns when it was introduced.  I suppose it went straight to Revenue and the Department of Social Protection.  That is one of the major things I want to ask about.<br\/><br\/>Reference has been made to the 9% rate.  A rate of 23% is imposed on a range of businesses.  We are fixated on this, to some extent.  Many people feel that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is making a very valid point.  The key point that was made earlier by the witnesses from the Nevin Economic Research Institute, whom Mr. Talbot may have heard, was that tax expenditure should be the subject of an absolute timeframe.  They referred to sunset clauses etc.  Are we going to have this debate about VAT <i>ad infinitum<\/i>into the future?<br\/><br\/>I noted what Mr. Talbot had to say about the situation with regard to water.

At national level, we have not focused particularly on the proposal to have a directly elected Dublin mayor.  We have allowed the four main chambers in the Dublin area to have that debate.  I do not feel I am sufficiently well briefed to go into that issue.<\/p> <p>  I would like to return to the issue of a land tax.  We feel that the taxation of land is a very efficient way to go about raising tax and broadening the tax base.  It is also about the efficient use of land, which ties back into the national planning framework.  It is great to see factories in deeply residential areas like Baldoyle Industrial Park, which is close to the Deputy's constituency, being rebuilt and regenerated.  As my son goes to school in Kilbarrack, I am aware that it is a hugely residential area.  We need to make sure we have the right mix of accessible jobs and accessible public transport in order that people do not have to travel too far.  We need to make sure we make the best use of the DART, the Luas lines that are being built and, in due course, the metro north system.<\/p> <p>  The point I would like to make about how land is taxed is that there is a danger that the property tax will start to look like how the residential property tax looked at the end of the 1980s and in the early 1990s.  As valuations increased, it became politically difficult and something had to change.  We ended up giving up on property tax.  It took several years to get something back on the table.  We need to consider whether we should look at how a commercial site value tax and a residential site value tax might integrate together.  Would such an integrated tax act as a substitute for commercial rates as well?  As I said in my presentation, we are concerned that the current local property tax system has stagnated.  In 2018 or 2019, a big decision will have to be made on whether to let the existing rules go through or, as I suggested in my presentation, to change the 0.18% and 0.25% bands to make the figures a little more acceptable to ordinary taxpayers who are working hard to pay their bills and do not expect huge increases in these taxes.<\/p> <p>  We suggest there is still a great deal of work to be done here.  We believe the introduction of a land tax would be a better way of taxing than the current system of commercial rates based on the historical valuation system and on the striking of rates by councils.  Ultimately, the rate that is struck by a council is a balancing figure after it has added up all the other income it is not getting.  In the intervening period, there is an opportunity to increase the valuation in 2019, to adapt the rates or to look at the effective use of the 15% variation system, or all three.  I know that last week, for example, Fingal County Council moved back from the full 15% reduction and pulled it back to 10%.<\/p><p>At a time when there is a housing crisis and many other things are going on, often specific to certain areas, there is an opportunity for councillors to realise they are not taking full advantage of a pool of funding that is available.  We believe an opportunity exists in that regard.  At its core, we would rather see an efficient land tax introduced.  Not only would that create a broad base of taxation, but it would also lead to more efficient use of land.  We would then be able to return to issues like the density of population in areas where infrastructure has been developed.  Our network's view is that in the interests of the efficient use of infrastructure, there needs to be more carefully managed and controlled skyrise development.<\/p><p> I would like to respond to a couple of other questions.  As I listened to the commentary of the Nevin Economic Research Institute, I felt there was a lot of stuff we agreed on.  We are not particularly keen for the debate on the 9% rate to continue forever and a day.  When it was brought in, it was meant to be a timebound thing.  We have come through the financial crisis and our own fiscal stability issues.  Now we have the Brexit crisis.  The strong word coming through from our network - we have four chambers in Dublin and 42 chambers outside Dublin - is that this rate is having a significant impact on regional and rural jobs.  The members of our network are asking us to continue to call strongly for the 9% rate to be maintained.  I think people recognise that this debate will continue.  Perhaps, in due course, we should consider whether the 23% and 13.5% VAT rates are the right rates to have as we seek to get a more balanced and broader tax base.  Are those rates competitive from a global perspective?  Irish people pay many other taxes.  If one wants to buy a car, one has to pay VRT, which rarely gets a mention these days.  When other parties and stakeholders look at our excise duties, they say they are too high.  We have not really focused on any of that.  I think there is a general acceptance that the rate will need to be balanced at some point.  It is a question of timing.  We do not believe it should happen now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2017092000002#XX00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ian Talbot","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Talbot and Ms Freeman for attending today's meeting, making their presentations, engaging with the committee and providing their pre-budget submissions.

The measure of any democracy is the manner in which the needs of the most vulnerable are considered and met.  What I propose to do is not to read through the opening statement which members have before them but to outline in summary form the issues I have addressed so as to provide sufficient time for me to answer questions on what is in the audit report.<\/p> <p>  It is my view that when a child is taken into the care of the State, the State is saying it can do a better job than the parents, and if the State fails the child a second time, that can have devastating consequences for the child involved.  What the audit provides is a unique window into what happens when parents fail children, when the State fails children and children are allowed to drift rudderless.  Child abuse can often be invisible to families and their communities.  What the audit does is to shine a light on unpalatable truths for society about how life is lived by some of its members.  The audit also indicates that the prevalence of domestic abuse - it may not necessarily be physical violence - it is sad to say, has not abated.<\/p> <p>  The audit was commissioned by the Garda Commissioner in the aftermath of two cases which were the subject of much discussion in the public domain involving the removal of children in Athlone and in Tallaght.  I received commendable levels of co-operation from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the conduct of the audit.  The audit is unique in its comprehensiveness as a systemic review because it is the first audit on a worldwide basis to look at the exercise of emergency child protection powers by a police force.<\/p><p>It provides us with very valuable insights.  <\/p><p> In terms of the international approach, I have spent virtually every weekend over two years looking at this at a practical and theoretical level.  I had the audit peer reviewed, which is something I normally would not do.  Given the significance of the audit, I wanted to make sure it was internationally validated.  To give the committee a sense of what people have said internationally, I will cite Professor Laura Hoyano from Oxford who said it breaks new ground in empirical techniques in the field.  I have gone through the complete document.  She talks about the audit employing very sound empirical methodology and says it was carried out with admirable thoroughness, is very well written and the findings are all borne out by the data reported.  The other reviewer talks about it being an outstanding piece of work and an extremely well written and careful report.  In terms of the report standing up internationally, I am told it is the largest worldwide audit on the exercise by a police force of its emergency child protection powers.  In that case, the findings are more important and more significant.  <\/p><p> The overwhelming finding was that garda&iacute; commit great efforts to treating children sensitively and compassionately when they exercise their section 12 powers.  The audit demonstrated numerous instances of Garda members staying long beyond their rostered hours to organise the care of a child removed under section 12.  One of the principle objectives of the audit was to examine the proportionality, appropriateness and legality of section 12 removals.  The audit found that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercise their powers following a period of careful consideration of the circumstances and available evidence.  The most frequent circumstance encountered by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na requiring section 12 removals is some form of failure by a parent.  Garda&iacute; demonstrated a significant degree of critical sophistication when exercising their section 12 powers.  In all of the cases examined, the audit found appropriately restrained use of section 12 powers.  <\/p><p> The audit found no evidence that racial profiling influences the exercise of section 12 powers.  That said, this finding must be tempered by the finding that certain ethnocultural demographic information does not appear to be routinely documented on the PULSE system.  I found the PULSE system not to be reliable in terms of the data that was documented.  I outlined the methodology for the audit because I tried to examine the PULSE data relative to an independent method of collecting data, which was conducting a survey.  The methodology for the audit involved first a forensic examination of the PULSE data.  With the focus on 2014 and 2015, the years in which the Roma and Athlone cases occurred, I looked at over 500,000 fields of PULSE data with a number of colleagues, one of whom, Cian O'Connor, is present in the Gallery.  That shows the extent of the scale of the audit.  Having then drafted and circulated a questionnaire to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who exercised their powers in 2014, it was possible to compare the results from the questionnaire against the data gathered on PULSE.  That was very instructive in shining a light on inadequacies in the PULSE system.  It is commendable that I got a full response rate from members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the 2014-2015 period, which makes any finding even stronger.  I then randomly selected cases from September 2015 to get a contemporary understanding of how the section 12 power was being exercised.  We then interviewed a large number of garda&iacute; throughout the country.  It was an opportunity to look at the environment faced by children when subject to section 12 powers, while very strongly of the view that no child should have to spend a lengthy period of time in a hospital or Garda station, because we associate Garda stations with criminality.  Finally I undertook some focus groups with senior and junior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The committee can see the multiple methods employed: examining 5,000 fields of PULSE data, full questionnaires from 2014-2015, followed by a random audit of September 2015, followed by interviewing the garda&iacute; to get an understanding of why they exercise their powers, and then focus groups to further drill down into that information.  That is the methodology.  <\/p><p> One key finding is there is no routine gathering of ethnic data.  In the aftermath of the audit, I had correspondence from Pavee Point expressing strong support for the recommendation in the audit on the need to have an ethnic identifier in order that we know definitively what the position is relating to children subject to section 12 powers.  I reiterate there was no evidence of racial profiling from my extensive review.  In the future, what we need to do is definitively have an ethnic identifier.<\/p><p> One of the biggest challenges facing Irish society is the adverse consequences for the welfare of many children posed by alcohol abuse.  This is something I addressed before the committee on the last occasion.  Drug and alcohol abuse by parents has a very damaging effect on their ability to consistently parent their child.  Failure on the part of Irish society to comprehensively address the alcohol problem as a major threat to the proper functioning of individuals and communities leaves the child protection system dealing with insurmountable consequences.  Anyone who reads chapter three of this report will be struck by how prevalent a feature is alcohol abuse.  It is a call to action on the part of the Government.  There has been a certain degree of delay in legislating in this area.  I wonder if that is influenced by vested interests in the area.  When one looks at this report it is very clear it is a call to action to deal with this issue.  <\/p><p> I have been watching some media over the last number of days.  We talk about it in an adult context but it has absolutely devastating consequences for children.  We, as a society, need to address the issue robustly.  Allied to that is that the audit shines a light on a truth with which Irish society is somewhat uncomfortable, which is that some parents for various reasons fail their children.  It is then the responsibility of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to protect those children.  That is why I strongly argue that the section 12 power is an essential tool in the broader child protection infrastructure.  The audit found inadequacies in the operation of the Garda PULSE system.  The Garda PULSE system was not in a position to provide a clear and accurate picture of the use of section 12 powers by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has confirmed that systemic reform of PULSE is under way and this process of reform is clearly to be welcomed.  It is important that when An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercises what is an exceptional power without warrant and without court oversight that the process is accurately documented on the system.  The audit suggests a template for how the PULSE system should be redrawn, ensuring these data are entered accurately.  The audit found little evidence of discrete training on child protection.  We found a deep-seated culture of privileging on-the-job training and learning over and possibly to the detriment of formal training.  As Irish society changes, it is of enormous importance that our garda&iacute; are fully trained on the changing nature of Irish society.<\/p><p>This is not confined to issues relating to children but applies generally, so that we understand the changing nature of Irish society and that policing reacts to that changing nature.<\/p><p> It is also essential that agencies operating under the umbrella of child protection services can share information relating to vulnerable children and their families.  We found in seeking the data that confidentiality is sometimes used as an argument for not sharing information.  That can be a bogus barrier.  The audit found poor inter-agency communication and co-operation.  It found inter-agency co-operation overwhelmingly inadequate.  It is essential that children do not slip through the net and get lost; it is essential to pull them back from the brink.  There must be much greater co-operation between agencies.  This requires fundamental reform not just of the policing system, but also of the child protection system.  I will turn to that in the recommendations.  The key recommendation relates to co-location.  We must start co-locating agencies so they can co-operate with each other rather than inhabit silos.  This report demonstrates poor inter-agency co-operation, and this is common to other reports.  That co-operation exists, if at all, within the higher echelons of the individual organisations and bears little reality at the coalface.<\/p><p> The other issue that emerged was mental health.  Next to alcohol abuse, mental health issues feature prominently.  The system fails many children experiencing psychological or mental health difficulties.  The failure to recognise mental health issues at an early stage can have a profound impact on the family.  Warning signs must be treated with sufficient seriousness and referrals must be timely and appropriate.  If there is no seamless co-operation between agencies, a child's diagnosis gets delayed and that can have profound consequences for the child.  The critical theme that emerged repeatedly throughout the audit is that notification is not communication.  The fact that one fills out a form and passes it on does not mean that one has satisfied the duty to co-operate.  It must be far more robust.  We examined a number of models.  I visited a state-of-the-art centre in the Bronx which has introduced a cutting edge method of dealing with this.  I also looked at the English model in Oxfordshire and the multi-agency safeguarding hub, MASH, in Manchester.  There is also the role model in Belfast, a number of miles up the road.  We can embrace a number of models of co-location.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, has issued an implementation plan for the report and I understand she intends to visit some of these centres.  The key reform this report points to is co-location.  That involves fundamentally changing our system.<\/p><p> Another issue to emerge is the lack of out-of-hours service provision.  It was the subject of considerable criticism.  Child protection is a 24-7 function, not a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. function.  The audit pointed out that many children suffered because a service was not available.  Children had to be criminalised or pathologised to avail of the necessary welfare and support services.  I acknowledge the fact that a new out-of-hours service has been established since 2015 but my view is that it continues to be systemically inadequate.  We need a service available throughout the country that is accessible to every child.  The response to the audit has been that the service is available where the demand exists, but that has the potential to create geographical injustice.  A child living in a less populated area is entitled to the same service as a child living in a more populated area.  If we are committed to the principle of equality and treating all our children equally, one is entitled to get the same service regardless of where one lives, who one is or the social stratum one comes from.<\/p><p> The audit found very positive evidence on the operation of the specialist child protection units in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That supports my thesis on inter-agency co-operation and co-location.  When one locates agencies together, one builds up trust.  That is what we must seek for the future.  Nothing predicts like the past.  Those who are not aware of history are bound to repeat it.  One of the key messages to emanate from the almost 100 reports published over the past 20 years is the lack of inter-agency co-operation.  I am hoping this will be the last report in which this issue will have to be highlighted.  What is required now is fundamental reform.  When a child is the victim of abuse or neglect, it is incumbent on State agencies or statutory services to provide a timely and proportionate response.  We see that the system fails children with emotional or behavioural problems.  Those children are perhaps most in need and that is why we must prioritise them.  Intervention, when it arrives, must not be too late to vindicate the right of the child to have his or her welfare secured.<\/p><p> Many challenges remain to be resolved before we can say we live in a society where our children's rights are fully vindicated.  It is always a work in progress but it demands new perspectives, such as what I have outlined on co-location, renewed efforts and real energy.  A system designed to protect children must do that.  The system must be accountable, consistent and always strive to minimise the risk to the welfare of the child.  The right service at the right time is crucial.  We must get it right for every family and child.  I always conclude by saying that the manner in which society treats its vulnerable citizens reflects not only its qualities, but also its sense of social justice, its commitment to the future and its ambition to enhance the human condition for the next generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":302,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, Dr. Shannon.

We should contextualise this.  We are still dealing with the scars of the past in terms of how we dealt with children and the lack of child protection.  In that sense, it is appropriate to say that we are privileged to have something that does not happen very often in this State, a world class project that is ahead of anywhere else.  That should be registered.  If we have an analysis conducted which is peer reviewed and unrivalled anywhere in the world, we must take what that body of work says very seriously.  I was struck by the similarities in some of the points regarding training and PULSE with what gets the headlines for the Garda, such as the breath tests.  We have seen the headlines about how inadequate PULSE is, but this is child protection which in many ways is even more serious.  Some of the trends Dr. Shannon has highlighted in the report feed into that background.<\/p> <p>  I have many questions so I will probably intervene again.  Dr. Shannon highlights PULSE very well and the problem it poses.  He says there is a number of significant anomalies in the information and documentation.  Perhaps he will go into more detail on what that means.  The statements in the report are quite damning, for example, that PULSE is unable to provide a consistent and accurate picture of section 12 use.  That is very serious.  The report states that the practice and working ideologies of child protection fall well short of international best practice and refers to numerous gaps, flaws and variations in data practice.<\/p><p>I ask that that be explained further.  It is eight months since the report was published.  What progress has been made on this issue?  When one reads the report, the recommendations made for dealing with some of these issues are not just general suggestions of reviewing policies or reviewing guidelines.  The witness has actually gone to the trouble of designing a new PULSE<b><\/b>system to capture the information that his scientific, forensic study says needs to be captured.  Has the Garda implemented that new PULSE draft to capture the type of information that the witness has told it is necessary?<br\/><br\/>The witness highlighted the area of training, which was striking.  The figures were stark.  Some 53% said that they had no training at all and 77% said that they did not have sufficient training in child protection.  The point the witness made was that this reflected a deeper systemic problem of inadequate training inside the Garda and that on-the-job training was elevated above the training in Templemore.  The attitude of, &quot;Don't worry what they told you in college, this is the way we do that here&quot;, seems to be a feature of many of the reports that have been done.  I would appreciate more detail on that.<br\/><br\/>We are often - correctly, in my view - identified as criticising the Garda, but the good thing in this report is that the individual garda&iacute; have come out of this incredibly well and have dealt with their responsibility in child protection, as individuals, as best they could in very difficult circumstances.  Perhaps that is something that we can highlight.  The system is deficient, but the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have responded excellently.  I will not repeat these points.<br\/><br\/>I would like to know a little bit more about the level of co-operation the witness got.  One the one hand it is striking that he got 100% co-operation.  Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan got seven replies to the map<b><\/b>tests.  The witness obviously has some influence that he does not have.  On the other hand there is a contradiction, because the witness was looking for information and was hoping to complete this in January.  He had to write a couple of times and go through much of his work more than once to get this information.  Was there a frustration there?<br\/><br\/>The witness has identified really serious problems here.  The report came out eight months ago.  What has actually been done in terms of his suggestions?  We need to look at this as a committee.  Given that the problems are there, and given that the witness had a level of co-operation from the Garda, would it be fair to say that there was a worse response from Tusla than the Garda?  There are two sides in this equation, and we often pinpoint the Garda, but Tusla seems to have been pretty poor in this as well.  Perhaps that could be expanded upon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#C00300","speaker":"1259","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will bundle the issues she has raised into two categories.  The first is around PULSE and the second is around training.<\/p> <p>  In terms of co-operation, my only experience is in relation to child protection.  I have to be careful in saying this.  I did not deal with any other division apart from meeting the Garda intercultural and racial office.  I met those to get an understanding of what was happening in terms of ethnicity and training in that area.  In terms of the child protection unit, the two people I dealt with, Detective Superintendent Declan Daly and Inspector Lynch, provided outstanding co-operation.  I want to put that on the record.  It must have been frustrating because I am the type of person who just does not let go when I am looking for a piece of information.<\/p> <p>  That links into the next question, concerning PULSE.  We were provided with a huge amount of data.  To put it in context, I had a full room of material that was generated.  I had a very small team, and this was probably the most cost-effective scheme ever undertaken.  It consisted of Cian, myself, Hilary Coveney and a psychiatrist, who was really helpful in terms of trying to ascertain her understanding of what it feels like to be a child subject to section 12.  The consequences from a mental health perspective enabled us to analyse that issue.<\/p> <p>  When it came to PULSE it was quite clear that there was a problem with it.  To elaborate on the Deputy's point, if we turn to pages 55 to 56 of the report, we can see that we had looked at the PULSE system.  I had devised a system whereby we looked at all the PULSE data and worked back to reconstruct a picture of every child subject to section 12, and I cannot emphasise enough how difficult and time-consuming that was.  However, by doing that we were able to identify fairly conclusively the deficiencies within the PULSE system.  As a result of that process, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na changed what was the public figure of 557 valid instances in 2004 to 560.  We were able to determine that the figures were not accurate because of the fact that some had been wrongly classified.  I put together a template to make sure that this cannot happen again.  Appendix six sets out all the data required to ensure we have a complete picture.  As I said at the outset, when the State takes a child away from its parents, it is exercising the greatest power it has, and when it is done without a court warrant, we must have a comprehensive paper trail detailing why that happened.  One of the most important pieces of paper to emanate from this audit is the recasting of PULSE to ensure there is a degree of transparency within the process.  I found that in all the cases I looked at there was an appropriately restrained use of section 12 powers, and it is important to say that.<\/p> <p>  This ties into the Deputy's later question regarding other agencies.  The rank and file garda&iacute; do a very good job, in my view, and we were struck by that as we travelled around the country.  This was not just a passive audit.  We did not just sit there and look at a piece of work.  We travelled the length and breadth of the country to talk to individual garda&iacute; about what it felt like to exercise section 12 powers.  One of the consequences not reported in the public domain is that garda&iacute; are now even more reluctant to exercise section 12 powers.  We need to make sure that garda&iacute; are confident, when a child is at risk, to exercise section 12 powers.  In the west, one garda said to me that where before he was doubly cautious, he is now triply cautious.  That is a pity.  My view is that hundreds of children are protected because we have this power, and until such time as we have a 24-7 out of hours social work service and co-locating agencies, this is an essential tool in broader child protection infrastructure.  It is not just a question of looking at this issue in isolation but rather looking at it across all the agencies.  That is why it needs a whole of Government response.  It is not just one Department.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, in fairness to her, has published an implementation plan.  This needs to be fully monitored in terms of its implementation.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of training, I travelled to Templemore and met all the appropriate people there.  I reviewed the documentation, and it is my considered view that the documentation is not adequate to reflect that we now have a referendum placing children at the centre of our Constitution and that we now have much more robust child protection systems.  It is important.  I recognise that there was a moratorium on the recruitment of garda&iacute; for a period, but we now need robust training.<\/p><p>Training is hugely important.  As Deputy Daly said, it is not just about on-the-job training.  As legislation changes, the requirements of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na change, and they are changing all the time.  We expect more from our garda&iacute; and we need to make sure they are properly trained.  A body of work needs to be undertaken.  I received a letter over the summer inviting me to participate in some of that training.  I am more than happy to assist but there must be a complete review as to how that should happen.<br\/><br\/>Coming back to the PULSE system, and the Deputy referenced a letter in January, what I have tried to do in a transparent fashion is outline what happened.  We received all the information in December.  Once I had the opportunity over a large part of the Christmas period to examine the documentation, it was apparent to me that there were anomalies.  There were 31 cases that I could not locate having undertaken this process so I decided to write back to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ask for an explanation as to the reason these anomalies might exist.  In terms of what happened, I got the entire set of data again.  That involved starting <i>de novo<\/i>a complete further review of the PULSE system.  That is why I am very confident that the conclusions I have reached are fairly solid and conclusive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Shannon.

He spoke earlier about the children's referendum and putting children's rights at the core of our Constitution but that was not reflected by the practical considerations for children across the State who are left in a very vulnerable position.  As Dr. Shannon said, he revealed many unpalatable truths across Irish society.<\/p> <p>  I have a few questions, the first of which relates to the PULSE system and follows on from Deputy Daly's comments.  In Dr. Shannon's view, is it possible to rectify PULSE as it is currently constructed in terms of its foundation and so on?  Throughout the report and in his presentation today, it appears there are core systemic problems with PULSE.  What is Dr. Shannon's gut view?  Does he believe it can become best practice around section 12 cases and child protection because it seems to be failing children in that vulnerable scenario?  If it is not there to capture the data, it is not achieving its purpose.<\/p> <p>  My other question is on Tusla.  Dr. Shannon mentioned the mystification and the lack of feedback and follow-through by Tusla officials.  Has that been rectified or has there been any follow-through by Tusla in his interaction with it?  I would say that is a concern for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are left in a vacuum where they do not know what has been the follow-through.  I know anecdotally that in certain instances, Tusla has not acted as it should have when garda&iacute; referred cases on to it.  If garda&iacute; are left in that vacuum and there is not a cycle and follow-through, even when a section 12 power has been used appropriately, that is a serious concern.  Has there been follow-through in the interim period before we see best practice in co-location occurring?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Shannon referred to alcohol being one of the main issues around child protection.  We have a number of items of legislation coming before the Oireachtas but what legislative measures would he wish to see prioritised or initiated that are not currently on the legislative priority list?  We have the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill and other legislation but on a legislative basis what specifically would help in terms of the alcohol issue?<\/p> <p>  I have some concerns about Dr. Shannon's reference to the reluctance by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to use section 12 powers and how they have gone from a double to a triple reluctance in that regard.  That is very worrying.  We should have a framework that gives confidence to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to act when they know a serious situation is occurring and there is a deficit in training and child protection.  At least they will know how to follow best practice and utilise a particular code but if they are left in a vacuum in respect of a lack of education and training, there will be a reluctance and doubt on their behalf on when to use it or act appropriately.  Have there been changes in the training in child protection and the deficit Dr. Shannon mentioned in his report? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#E00800","speaker":"1255"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I will address the questions one by one.  The first one was on confidence in the PULSE system.  PULSE documents information as it arises.  It is hugely important that we have confidence in the integrity of the information placed on the PULSE system.  That can only happen where we have mandatory fields where every garda must fill in set fields of data.  That has to be a mandatory requirement because that gives us an on-the-spot understanding as to the event as it unfolds.  That is the reason I have outlined in appendix 6 a very detailed framework as to how that can be undertaken.  If a system like that existed and it had to be filled in by every garda, I would have confidence that it would give us an accurate picture.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the PULSE system as it currently exists, there are very rich narratives by some garda&iacute; and then far less detail by other garda&iacute;.  The concern is around accountability and whether there is a reluctance to put in a detailed narrative because of issues in respect of accountability and a fear of being held to account if they say too much.  That is understandable but we need to have a system now that mitigates against that.  That is what I am suggesting.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the issue of Tusla and the mystification, I had a certain degree of sympathy for many garda&iacute;.  If I am asked for the solution, it comes back to co-location.  We need agencies working seamlessly together and sometimes confidentiality is used.  I characterised it as being a bogus barrier because while data protection is often raised as an issue, data protection may not necessarily be a barrier if one is not disclosing the identity of the parties.  What we need to do is have some reflexive learning and that reflexive learning can only occur where there is feedback as to whether a section 12 power was correctly exercised.<\/p> <p>  Regarding alcohol, it has been one of the single biggest factors.  I have had the experience in that I chaired the review of the cases of the 196 children who died in State care.  That is another broad systemic review.  There are common themes running through both of those.  One is poor inter-agency co-operation and the second is alcohol abuse.  We know the issues.  We now need to robustly tackle the issues.<\/p> <p>  I was listening to Kenneth Egan's account on \"Claire Byrne Live\" on Monday night, which I though was particularly compelling in terms of what we need to do.  We have been talking about the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill for some time.  We now need positive action because of the fact that this has a real impact on children.  Children are not passive bystanders in all of this but we sometimes see them as passive bystanders.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the reluctance to exercise a section 12 power, I have found the garda&iacute; do extraordinarily well in very difficult circumstances.<\/p><p>Sometimes it is not popular to say this, but credit where credit is due, the audit found that rank and file garda&iacute; do an outstanding job in protecting very vulnerable children.  That needs to be said.  We need much more robust systems to ensure that the paperwork exists to back up this very important child protection safety mechanism.  That is how I would respond to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I congratulate Dr. Shannon on the report.  It is a template for how reports should be produced for the State.  He set out his methodology and what he was asked to do.  Most importantly he set out 72 examples of how section 12 comes into effect and how garda&iacute; are asked to exercise their power in this respect.  He also set out conclusions and recommendations.  I want to repeat what the Chairman and Deputy Daly said about section 12.  When one thinks about it, it is an extraordinary power.  When we put somebody through Templemore, he or she is out very quickly and we then give that person the power to take a child away from a parent.  I agree with what Dr. Shannon has said.  It is an astonishing power.  I think he will agree that it is a power that the State must have because of the examples he has set out in his report.<\/p> <p>  What Dr. Shannon has said about garda&iacute; doing an excellent job in exceptionally difficult circumstances is important.  Many of the examples he has set out are of situations in which it would not be that difficult to make one's mind up, for example a situation where a garda comes to a house and sees a child in a destitute condition while the parents are nowhere to be seen, so the garda has to exercise section 12.  There must be examples, however, which are more borderline.  I would be interested to hear of those borderline examples in due course.  The problem in that situation is that if a garda gets it wrong and something subsequently happens to the child, the State turns around and criticises that garda.  Does Dr. Shannon think that anything more needs to be done to give such garda&iacute; more encouragement to know that they should not be too hesitant about exercising section 12?  Of course, at the same time, one does not want them overdoing it.  That is the first issue I would like Dr. Shannon to consider.<\/p> <p>  Second, this report obviously arose from a request from the Ombudsman for Children arising from case of the Roma child.  Dr. Shannon mentioned in his report - and I think it is good news - that there is no evidence of racial profiling in respect of section 12, but he also went on to say that there would be a benefit in recording ethnocultural information on the PULSE system.  I am interested to know why he thinks that is important.  Has he derived ethnocultural information from the PULSE system?  Is it partly to do with people of different cultures who have come here and have different attitudes as to how children should be reared or looked after?<\/p> <p>  I note that Dr. Shannon sets out the specific details to be recorded on the PULSE system in appendix 6.  That is helpful.  Rather than the report simply saying that information needs to be put in he has said exactly what needs to be done.  Is he satisfied that all of that information is necessary?  What is the benefit of it?  I want to probe that a bit because garda&iacute; are obviously putting a lot of information on PULSE.  They could spend their day sitting around and putting information on PULSE.  What is the benefit of it?  What is it used for?  Is Dr. Shannon telling us that if that information was on PULSE we would have much more information in respect of the exercise of section 12 and that would be to the long-term benefit of being able to deal with it as an issue?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I will echo what Dr. Shannon and others have said.  He talks about the consistency with which he has seen alcohol abuse being a problem in the reports he has written.  Every time this committee deals with issues such as domestic abuse, mental health or violence in the street, alcohol and drug abuse come up as enormous contributors.  People who are perfectly placid, normal people get into problems and difficulties because of alcohol and drug abuse.  That is a much bigger question which we will have to deal with, but does Dr. Shannon believe that there is anything further we should be doing as a State to warn people about the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#F00200","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Callaghan.  It is important to come back to the reluctance of some garda&iacute; to exercise their powers, which was the Deputy's first question.  One of the issues which was not discussed at the time is the nature of the power.  It is a subjective power.  When a garda arrives at the house, generally chaos greets him or her.  If one reads through some of the examples, the treatment meted out to some of our children is shocking beyond words.  The garda must ask him or herself what they should do.  If one puts oneself into the same position, it is not an objective power.  At the time of the Athlone case and the Tallaght case, this issue was not discussed.  From a legal perspective that is hugely important because the garda has to make up his or her mind having regard to what he or she believes is a fact.  That links into the Deputy's later question on why this information needs to be documented because we need a contemporaneous record of what the garda was feeling at the time so that we can then assess whether that subjective power was properly exercised.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy's question was on providing reassurance to garda&iacute;.  I have tried to look at this and have come up with a solution.  My recommendation in the report is that a laminated card, which I have prepared, be sent to every garda throughout the country.  This card is in appendix 4.  It could be condensed even further but this could be provided to every Garda station and every garda.  It is not high-level to the extent of other reports but I have tried to make it as practical as possible.  If the lead person who has responsibility for training in this area decided to supply every garda with a copy of the laminated card - which outlines what a section 12 power is and what needs to be considered - then as a garda is heading off to what he or she believes may be a situation which will require the exercise of section 12, he or she would have an <i>aide-memoire<\/i>.The garda could read through it very quickly to see whether he or she thinks it meets the threshold.  It is a very practical suggestion which should be implemented.  Coming back to Deputy O'Callaghan's question, that would give confidence to garda&iacute; that they are properly exercising their powers.  <br\/><br\/>The Deputy raised a really important point on the ethnocultural data.  The audit had two key findings and it is important to come back to them.  The overwhelming finding is that garda&iacute; commit great efforts to treating children sensitively and compassionately when a child has been removed under section 12.  The second finding is that no evidence could be found that racial profiling influences the exercise of section 12 powers.  However, in the context of the changing nature of Irish society, the public needs to have full reassurance on that.  We need to start documenting the information.  It is quite a complicated issue.  If one looks at some of the figures, it would appear to be that certain ethnic minorities are overly represented but there may be a reason for that and sometimes the public explanation is too simplistic.  I have tried to outline why it is so much more complicated and nuanced on page 109 of the report.  I state: <\/p><blockquote>this statistical trend does not in itself establish a practice of racial profiling in relation to section 12 ...  In the context of the operation of the child protection system in ethno-culturally diverse areas, recent literature indicates there may be other factors that can explain at least some of this over-representation.  For example, part of this over-representation may be attributable to different cultural norms in relation to the disciplining of children.  While all cases examined by the audit involving removal of children from Nigerian and Romanian families appear to have been justified, part of this over-representation may also be accounted for in a higher level of policing of those communities.  However, on this latter point, it should be emphasised that the audit did not find <i>any<\/i>evidence of a distinct policy or practice of policing the family lives of immigrant communities more heavily.<\/blockquote> <p>That brings me back to a key point, that of training.  We have to train our garda&iacute; because of the issue of unconscious bias.  We all have some element of bias and we have to guard against that.  That can only happen if there is robust training, not just on child protection but also on ethnocultural issues.  That has to be a priority.  What is the benefit of the information?  It is a subjective power and, in the interests of transparency, it is my view that the State has no greater power than for a garda to walk into a family and to remove a child.  That warrants a proportionate response, which is the comprehensive documentation of the circumstances that led the child to be removed and placed in the care system.  That is why I suggest that there be a fairly comprehensive record.  The other reason that led me to that conclusion is the fact that the data which appeared on PULSE showed that some garda&iacute; went to exceptional lengths.<\/p><p>Some narratives were akin to a mini-article on why they exercised their section 12 powers, while, in other cases, it was a mere line.  We want consistency.  This is an extraordinary power which is unparalleled in any other area of the law.  We want to make sure that when the Garda exercises this power, it is justified.<\/p><p> Coming back to the point Deputy Daly raised, if it is a child protection issue, the proper avenue to deal with that is through the courts system.  We want to ensure we are not bypassing the courts system in the interest of expediency.  That is why we need to have a pretty comprehensive picture as to why the Garda might exercise these powers.  That may take longer, but this power is truly much more exceptional than any other power that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercises.  It is for that reason it is necessary.<\/p><p> I share the view of Deputies O'Callaghan and Chambers on the issue of alcohol abuse.  Deputy Chambers also raised the issue of gambling on the previous occasion.  I often struggle with the alcohol issue because I believe there is a strong vested interest in this area.  What politicians need to do is take on those vested interests and to say that child protection has to take precedence over big business.  I wonder at times at the delay in introducing legislation to tackle this issue which is concerning and has consequences.  Anyone reading chapter 3 of the report will be left in no doubt that it has resulted in shattered lives for children.  Those childhoods cannot be regained.  The time for action is now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Shannon for his presentation.  I am glad to continue our engagement following on from the Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  I said at that stage that his report and audit is an extraordinary piece of public service and a real addition to our work and the work of both Departments.  I also stated at the time that it highlights the need for fundamental reform of our child protection systems.  This audit focused on a discrete area relating to section 12.  However, all these issues need to be revisited regarding section 13 of the Child Care Act 1991 and a much broader range of issues because we have a deeply flawed child protection system.  With section 12, there is clear evidence of the frustration of many garda&iacute; in dealing with those services.<\/p> <p>  It is important to note individual garda&iacute; have shown a high standard of commitment and compassion, which is to their credit.  It is also important to note, however, that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as an institution, is not beyond reproach in this regard.  The issue of PULSE and data has been dealt with.  However, it is worth emphasising that it is not an abstract or technical issue.  In page 43 of Dr. Shannon's report, he stated, \"Particulars with regard to prior or subsequent history on PULSE for children were not included in 31 instances.\"  As far as I understand it, when a child is removed under section 12, the only record the Garda has at the time of that incident is what is entered on PULSE.  What that says to me is that there are 31 children for whom we cannot pick up the thread.  I may be misunderstanding this but it seems to me there is a gap which potentially is putting children who were at serious risk of abuse at further risk and creating a situation where the Garda, social services and Tusla are unable to pick up that thread.  That is a significant concern and highlights the seriousness of the deficiencies.  While Dr. Shannon has recommended improvements, the PULSE system is clearly not fit for purpose from a child protection point of view.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Shannon detailed the ethno-cultural data.  It is vitally important to get that issue right.  The issue of racial profiling could become one of significant debate.  In Britain in recent years, there has been significant criticism of the over-representation of black people in stop-and-search instances, with black people six times more likely than white individuals to be stopped.  I am glad Dr. Shannon found no evidence of racial profiling.  However, if we are to ensure lessons can be learned from other jurisdictions, we need to have proper information on the data entered into PULSE.<\/p> <p>  One of the most significant conclusions Dr. Shannon made was how inappropriate it was to bring children who were taken from situations of abuse and neglect to police stations or hospitals and to keep them there for several hours.  What is the safest place to where these children can be brought?  What should be the proper procedure for the Garda when it removes a child?  It relates to the whole area of inter-agency co-operation and co-location.  One of the most disappointing and frustrating findings in the report was how garda&iacute; were contacted by Tusla late on a Friday evening informing them of child protection situations and leaving them to pick up the pieces over the weekend.  That is dreadful and obviously inter-agency co-operation needs to be improved significantly.  What is the building block for co-location?  Should it be primary health care centres, family resource centres or Garda stations?<\/p> <p>  The Minister of Children and Youth Affairs and her Department produced an implementation plan to deal with the child protection failings in Tusla.  Is there an equivalent implementation plan that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has put in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#G00200","speaker":"1287"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":320,"content":"<p>On the omission of 31 instances, the issue is accountability.  If we are not accurately documenting what is on the PULSE system and if we do not record the incident as it occurs, that raises questions as to whether we have sufficient transparency and accountability.  What I believe may have happened is that these instances were filed elsewhere.  However, the reality is that there is not a proper paper record.  I agree with the point made by Deputy O'Callaghan, namely, when this power is exercised, there needs to be a paper trail.  It caused me concern that there was not a proper paper trail for those 31 instances.  I have been given explanations.  However, I come from the show me the data school rather than the explanation.  I have been told that perhaps these ended up being filed elsewhere.  However, with such an exceptional power being exercised by the State, unless there is a comprehensive paper trail as to why it was used, then it raises significant issues.<\/p> <p>  That is why we need a PULSE system that accurately records the narrative for every child in a consistent fashion.  It is just not a case of it being recorded in one area but consistently throughout the country.  That ties into the training of garda&iacute; on how to enter data into the PULSE system and ensuring consistency in how those narratives are entered in respect of all cases.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the lessons to be learned, it comes back to training.  The audit found training was inadequate.  Unless we have proper training on the issue of child protection and the threshold required to exercise those powers in section 12, then it is going to be extremely problematic.  That is something on which we are going to have to redouble our efforts.<\/p> <p>  I absolutely agree with the Deputy on placing children in a police station or in a hospital.  Children associate police stations with having done something wrong and criminality.  That is not to take away from the fact that the garda&iacute; who exercised these powers were enormously compassionate.  I was really struck by their sense of public service.<\/p><p>Garda&iacute; see themselves as first responders and they displayed a degree of humanity which was hugely impressive.<\/p><p> A hospital bed is no place for a child to be placed.  We talk at the moment about having a health crisis yet we are placing children in valuable hospital beds which are needed by people who are genuinely sick.  We need to look at that issue again.  Children associate hospitals with being sick and that has a detrimental effect.  We had a lengthy discussion on this with the psychiatrist, Dr. Imelda Ryan, who is very experienced in this area.  Her view is that this is a hugely traumatic incident.  It is not just the legal issue.  Sometimes we get paralysed by talking about the legal niceties, but this has a huge human cost for children.  When one takes a child in such traumatic circumstances, the consequences may not only be short term but may in fact be long-term in effect.  That is why we need to come up with a new model.<\/p><p> There are a number of models we could follow.  I mentioned three.  There is the role model in the North, the MASH model in Oxfordshire and Manchester, and the Bronx model of child advocacy centres where everybody works together and the child is taken to a very child-friendly place.  I have seen these centres where one has a room that is child friendly and very different from a police station where one has prisoner traffic coming through.  We need a neutral venue.  The member raised some interesting suggestions around family resource centres.  Even the Tusla main office could have a very nice child-friendly room to which one could take a child.  It is not beyond us or something that requires the expenditure of a huge amount of money but it would make a real difference for children.<\/p><p> The graphs demonstrate that children can end up spending significant periods of time in these settings.  When I travelled to one of the rural stations, a garda told me that when the child was subject to section 12, he ended up having to travel with his colleague because one has to travel with another person.  We must look at the consequences of that for policing.  If it is a small rural station and two garda&iacute; have to travel with the child, something has to suffer.  That may very well be that there will not be a checkpoint that evening.  It is something that has a knock-on effect elsewhere.  Using garda&iacute; to perform a child protection function is not without consequences.  It impacts on other areas of policing.  Sometimes we forget that.<\/p><p> The issue the member raised around getting a call on a Friday evening is a worrying one.  It emerged in the case that a garda got a call at 4.45 p.m. on a Friday to be told a child needed to be cared for.  We must be careful here.  We do not know and need a complete audit to know why that happened.  If it is a child protection issue which has been festering during the week, it should be dealt with as a child protection issue.  We have a child protection system under the Child Care Act which means that if one is concerned, one seeks a number of more proportionate orders, including a supervision order.  One can apply to the District Court for a supervision order or, if one is sufficiently concerned, an interim care order followed by a care order.  We must ensure that due process is followed and that child protection issues are dealt with in a child protection context.  That means action occurs in a child protection case when the threshold is reached.  That will need to be monitored.<\/p><p> In terms of implementation, I have been told by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that the recommendations have been fully accepted.  My understanding is that an implementation plan exists but I have not seen it.  That is all I can say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I thank the witness for coming in.  He is probably bored of being told how wonderful his report is, but if I do not compliment it, he will be giving out about me.  It is incredibly comprehensive and covers so much that is relevant.  Hopefully, it will not suffer the fate of many of the reports which are prepared in this country and then allowed to collect dust without being acted upon.  Given that Deputy Clare Daly and I have spent over five years complaining about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is great to hear that the rank and file on the ground have had such a positive attitude in this area.  They deserve even more credit when one takes into account the fact that training leaves so much to be desired and that the lack of resources is an ongoing issue.  On top of that, the rank and file have had to deal with very poor management, which issue has been very much at the core of our policing problems.<\/p> <p>  The report is eight months old.  Dr. Shannon says garda&iacute; have accepted it lock, stock and barrel but what is happening?  Eight months is a long time when we are discussing children who are at risk.  Dr. Shannon highlights the need for proper data collection and management through a proper PULSE system or an alternative.  He says that would introduce transparency and accountability.  The fact that nothing has really been done about PULSE for a long time is very worrying.  It is two years since the Garda Inspectorate told the State in 2015 that the PULSE system was not fit for purpose and should be stood down but nothing has happened.  It is eight months since Dr. Shannon's report came out and I wonder if he is getting any feedback.  There are so many problems with the PULSE system across the board that it beggars belief that it is still in place.  It has been poorly updated.  It was invented by Accenture which currently has 11 contracts with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is taking in serious money.  Nevertheless, it is standing over a failed system.  Has Dr. Shannon received a real response about where PULSE is going and what is being done about the lack of proper data collection and management around information relating to section 12?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Shannon said the audit found evidence of the repeated removal under section 12 of some children from the same family circumstances.  While it is great that children are being rescued when they need to be rescued, is Dr. Shannon saying that not much is changing thereafter and that there are not enough positive results in what happens for those children who need help?  We are now into the area of Tusla.  While section 12 is very much linked to policing, we cannot unlink it from the role of Tusla given that these children are very often transferred to its care.  Is Dr. Shannon happy with the performance of Tusla?  He might think it is a bit strong, but is Tusla fit for purpose?<\/p> <p>  I do not want to bore Dr. Shannon with my questions, but he made the point that the out-of-hours service was still pathetic and a big problem.  He also pointed out that in a lot of cases, particularly having regard to the out-of-hours service, the only option is a private provider.  His report points out that the private provider tends to be selective and is probably becoming more so about the children it takes into its care.  In other words, the private operator may see a child it has seen before and decide the child is too much hardship for it and that there are better things it could do with its time.<\/p><p>Given that it is a private entity, we cannot really tell it what to do.  The State entity has responsibilities for every child but it is probably difficult to say to private sector providers that they have no choice but to take the child.  They are able to say that they do not have to take the child.  What happens the child then?  Would one not think that State reliance on the private sector to deal with children with problems and in difficulty is not good enough?<\/p><p> I will leave it at that.  There are so many answers in Dr. Shannon's reports and there is so much there for us.  He really has answered most of the questions on the area.  I hope he gets the credit he deserves for this wonderful report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#H00200","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Deputy Wallace raised some interesting questions.  I will start with the last question.  I share his view on State reliance on private providers.  There is a heavy reliance on private providers.  I am not making any criticisms of the private providers but child protection is the responsibility of the State.  If there is a gap in our capacity to deliver on child protection, the gap needs to be filled by the State and not private providers.  The fact is that children with emotional or behavioural problems sometimes need intervention on an emergency basis.  What I found troubling is that on occasion such children have been refused the service because of their behaviour, which throws sand in the face of our commitment to treat all of the children of the nation equally.  This is not a criticism of private providers and I found no evidence of wrongdoing on their part but, in terms of our reliance on private providers in this area, it is not desirable that the vast majority of cases my colleagues and I examined placed a heavy reliance on private providers.  This comes back to having a child protection system that functions 24-7, 365 days a year.  That is what we need.<\/p> <p>  I have confidence in Tusla.  There are issues that Tusla needs to address and the Deputy has outlined them.  I agree with his analysis of the out-of-hours service.  There may be differences between myself and Tusla on what is our vision.  However, my vision for an out-of-hours service is that every child in this country should have access to an out-of-hours service regardless of where he or she lives.  Tusla has stated publicly that there is a full service in four counties.  My view is that the service needs to be available throughout the country.  Otherwise it becomes a geographical injustice in that the service one receives is dependent on the area in which one lives.  I believe that this is not in keeping with the aspirations of the Irish people when they voted in a referendum to protect all our children and not just those in highly populated or more densely populated areas.  I agree with the Deputy's analysis in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On the repeated removals, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has called for a full audit of the child protection system.  I want to be careful in terms of drawing conclusions.  This was a Garda audit.  It involved me examining the section 12 powers.  I do not want to overly extend myself in making conclusions.  I have based the conclusions on the evidence available.  However, I found a number of cases where children who had been subject to section 12 powers were returned to the family only to be subjected to section 12 again within a relatively short period of time.  There could be a number of reasons for it.  One could be whether the risk assessment was robust enough.  Thinking of one case in particular, the garda who articulated this to me was very concerned that the child had been returned and wondered why it happened.  It comes back to the issue raised by Deputy Jack Chambers around mystification.  We need to ensure that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na understand why a child is being returned.  That can be done on an anonymous basis.  We need to learn from the experiences and the practices to see if things can be done more robustly.<\/p> <p>  On the PULSE system, I had a very positive experience with the unit with which I dealt.  I am not saying this is representative.  I need to be honest.  The two people I dealt with were Detective Superintendent Daly and Inspector Michael Lynch, who are very good at producing the information.  I do not know if that is representative.  However, I found that the PULSE system is inadequate.  There is no doubt.  Whether that is replicated throughout the system or is symptomatic of broader problems with the PULSE system, what I found is that if I had relied on the PULSE data as a basis for this research I would have struggled to make conclusions and I wonder whether the conclusions I would have arrived at would have been accurate.  I was able to cross-check the PULSE data against the other data I had collected and interrogate those PULSE data.  What I found was that the PULSE system is not reliable.  We need a system that is robust and it needs to be properly documented.  I am not too concerned about what we call it but it needs to be there.  As I said, a parent whose child has been taken into care needs to know why that happened.  Parents have constitutional rights.  If we intervene in family life and do not provide a justification for it, we risk being vulnerable to constitutional challenge for interfering unjustly in the right to respect for private and family life.  That is why it is important, when I answered Deputy O'Callaghan's question, that we have a robust paper trail as to why the section 12 power was exercised.<\/p> <p>  In terms of my report, which was published at the end of May, I have not received any implementation plan.  I am told that there is one.  I presume that this committee will have an opportunity to deal with this issue in another form.  I hope that is helpful. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":325,"content":"<p>Before bringing in Deputy Daly, I have a couple of questions myself and then we might have short, specific single points to wrap it up.  Did Dr. Shannon have a specific period to address in terms of section 12?  A significant part of the work references 2014.  In his opening remarks he speaks also about the period going into 2015.  Was there a specific period in time and was that his determination or something that was preset in terms of reference?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Shannon has indicated that the report was published in May but the sign-off was in January, as the document states, but he concluded, published and presented it.  To whom did he present the report?  I presume it was to the Office of the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Will Dr. Shannon elaborate on that and let us know to whom the report was presented?  Our awareness of it arose out of a previous presentation on Dr. Shannon's own behalf.  It is clear that its importance and relevance, particularly the whole section relating to the PULSE section, was apparent to the members of this committee.  We welcome the opportunity to tease that out with him today.<\/p> <p>  Apart from the answers he has given, Dr. Shannon is aware or is being told that an implementation plan has been prepared or is in preparation.  Does he have any other evidence that anything has changed in terms of his role as special rapporteur?  Has there been even anecdotal feedback from people such as someone in a child carer position or from NGOs in this regard?  Is there any evidence that actions are being taken on foot of his recommendations given that it is now September?<\/p> <p>  There were 595 reported incidents in 2014.  I think a small number of those would be repeats.  That is what I have noted from the report.  However, the greater number - more than 500 - were individual cases.  It has been referenced by colleagues here, but 31 children are unaccounted for on the PULSE system since being taken from their parents or guardians under section 12.  I say that both in terms of their pre-history - before the section 12 being exercised - and since.<\/p><p>Dr. Shannon states in his report that no subsequent history was noted of them being removed by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the case of that particular cohort, have their stories or circumstances been followed up in any particular way?  Has Dr. Shannon initiated inquiries through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about these cases?  From reading the report, it strikes me that these children are missing.  I do not mean to be alarmist in using that language but section 12 was exercised and, to the best of our knowledge, these children's current whereabouts have not been recorded on the PULSE system and are, therefore, not identifiable.<\/p><p> Thirty-one children is a significant number.  In my view, one child is too many but 31 is incredible.  Has Dr. Shannon any information to indicate that the PULSE system on these cases has been updated?  Did he have the opportunity to identify why this particular group of 31 children was not included in the system?  Is there a common denominator in their cases?  Were they particular to an area, a region or a city?  Was there another common denominator regarding their personal profiles?  Why did 31 children have no prior or subsequent historical notes recorded?<\/p><p> Is there anything else that Dr. Shannon would like to add in respect of this part of his report?  He laid a powerful emphasis on the importance of inter-agency co-operation and comprehensive training in child protection as an integral part of the training for new Garda members coming through Templemore College.  He indicated he has engaged as a potential participant in that regard.  Is that something he expects will be part of the programme of training in the near future if it is not already?  What about training the large number of existing members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the whole area of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#J00300","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1505894400,"counter":327,"content":"<p>The review of PULSE was from 2008 to the end of 2015, with a focus on 2014 and 2015.  The reason I selected 2014 and 2015 was that these were six months prior to the Athlone and Tallaght incidents and six months subsequent to them.  It was to get an understanding as to how the power operated prior to its invocation and the powers exercised by the Ombudsman and her subsequent report to see whether the system had changed.  It involved a forensic review of between 5,000 and 6,000 cases.  I looked at all cases from the time we started keeping records.  It was an opportunity to look in summary fashion from 2008 and in detail during the critical period in question.<\/p> <p>  What comes from this audit is a reassurance to the public that when garda&iacute; exercise their powers, they do so proportionally and there is no evidence of racial profiling.  That is what I wanted to determine.  However, what the audit unearthed was problems with PULSE, with training and with the subsequent removal of children.<\/p> <p>  The report was presented to the Garda Commissioner in March 2017.  In terms of it being a contemporary picture, I continued to update the report with new data right up until the time of submission.  This is a pretty contemporary picture as to how the system operates.<\/p> <p>  In terms of changes, I have met Detective Superintendent Daly and Inspector Lynch on several occasions.  They are committed to the child protection system.  That does not take away from the systemic difficulties which need to be addressed.  My experience of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na child protection unit has been positive .  Tusla has an implementation plan and it has invited me to present to its board at the end of September.<\/p> <p>  The net conclusion from this audit is that agencies need to work together.  It is not good enough to inhabit our silos.  Child protection is everybody's and every agency's responsibility.  That is why the co-location model needs the broad fundamental reform that follows from this report.  I share Deputy Wallace's view and I am not naive about reports gathering dust.  I hope this report does not gather dust and the big picture of reform it advocates, namely, co-location, is implemented.  That will involve real change with agencies having to concede territorial ground in terms of their own individual professions.  What struck me about the Bronx model was that after a time it became seamless.  What initially looks challenging actually produces results for children.  When doing the cost-benefit analysis of the Bronx system, I was told by the New York City Police Department, NYPD, that it makes a saving of $1,000 per case.  This means it is less expensive because one is pooling the resources of the agencies.  I would liken it to what happened when creating specialist units in the health system.  Why can we not have centres of excellence for children?<\/p> <p>  The 31 instances caused me some concern.  In my correspondence of January 2016, I highlighted 31 instances in an attached table in which additional data and other instances relating to the children were not included in the data for section 12 children.  In these cases, when a search was undertaken for the particular PULSE field relating to the specific section 12 incident in 2014, it did not feature in the section 12 children all incidents worksheet.  There were no other PULSE entries relating to the child in that worksheet.<\/p> <p>  The explanation that has been advanced is that these cases may have been misclassified.  Nonetheless, when one exercises such an exceptional power, it is important that it is done carefully and that regard is had to the fact that there is the potential of trampling on parents' constitutional rights.  It is also important it is treated not just as a paper exercise but as a record of one discharging one's statutory and constitutional responsibilities.<\/p> <p>  I passionately agree with the Chairman on continuing professional development.  It is important we train our garda&iacute; and that this training does not stop once they leave Templemore.  My vision for a force that exercises such exceptional powers is that there should be mandatory continuing professional development for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The legislative landscape is changing dramatically.  Accordingly, we must ensure that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na understand these new powers and responsibilities imposed upon them.  That can only be achieved through training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":328,"content":"<p>Just for clarification on the cases of 31 children, does Dr. Shannon have any concerns as to their current status?<\/p><p>Maybe he did not have the opportunity to examine whether there was any common denominator or any similarity in their respective make-up as individuals, or maybe nothing was apparent to Dr. Shannon.

I found that, in all cases which were examined, the powers were exercised proportionately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2017092000002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Geoffrey Shannon"},{"type":"speech","time":1505894400,"counter":331,"content":"<p>People often say, \"I have never seen anything like that\", but we have really seen nothing like this report, in Ireland or the world.  It would be criminally negligent if its recommendations were not implemented.  Dr. Shannon's statement that he would not have been able to do this by relying on the data in PULSE alone is utterly damning and sums up the systemic problems we have seen in other aspects of policing with which this committee has been dealing.  I can picture Dr. Shannon in the room with all the files and without his obsessiveness we would not have got here.

If we cannot ask the Garda representatives about this matter, could we write to them to ask questions?  We spoke about co-location and the fact that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, is moving but a number of the suggestions for PULSE could have been brought in in January, such as laminated cards, risk principles, guidelines and the suggestion for the changeover in car seats.  The fact that Dr. Shannon does not know the answer is not an indictment of him but of the lack of follow-up within the Garda.  We need to know about the annual review and we should put on the record that the study showed it to be an exceptional power, only exercised once in the lifetime of an average garda.  It is not too onerous to have the level of data reporting which he outlined.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Wallace made a point about outsourcing and third party providers.  Dr. Shannon raised serious legal questions about the legality of the Garda transferring somebody to Five Rivers or a third party provider.  There may not be a lawful basis for this so has there been any feedback from Government about correcting the anomaly?  If there has not been an answer, it would be very poor.  <\/p> <p>  My last question is about the Policing Authority.  We have been to the fore in saying the Policing Authority has been disappointing and is not sufficiently equipped to challenge garda&iacute;.  Has Dr. Shannon given his report to the Policing Authority?  What feedback did he get?
