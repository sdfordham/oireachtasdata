It will also fund the significant expansion of the ECCE Programme.<\/p>  <p>  At present, children qualify for the free pre-school provision under this Programme when they are within the qualifying age range which is 3 years and 2 months to 4 years and 7 months in the September of the relevant year.  The recent Budget decisions, mean that children can access the ECCE Programme from the time they are 3 years of age until they start primary school.  <\/p>  <p>  This extended provision, when fully rolled out, will mean that children will have access to free education - either in pre-school or primary school - from the age of three.

This timeframe will allow pre-school providers to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional demand. <\/p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Programme is also implemented by my Department and  supports disadvantaged parents, parents in low paid employment and parents in training or education, by enabling those who qualify to avail of reduced childcare costs at participating community\/not-for-profit childcare services. <\/p>  <p>  Due to economic constraints, Budget 2012 closed the CCS programme to new applications from community\/not-for-profit childcare services wishing to enter the programme and to the expansion of services by existing providers. Under Budget 2016, I lifted these restrictions and provided &euro;16 million in additional funding to further expand the CCS programme, to include its roll-out to private childcare providers, in a targeted manner. This additional investment will create a further 8,000 places in areas identified as being in significant need of CCS provision. <\/p>  <p>  To meet the increased demand for childcare that will result from this very significant investment, Budget 2016 also provides funding for a number of measures to improve the quality of childcare and to build capacity in the sector.

Work on the Affordable Childcare Programme will begin immediately, so that it can be in place in 2017. This single programme will replace the existing CCS, along with the Training and Employment Childcare programmes, comprising the After-School Childcare, Childcare Education and Training Support, and Community Employment Childcare. It will provide a new simplified subsidy programme, available through both community\/not-for-profit and private childcare providers. As more investment is made available over the coming years, it can be directed to families through this subsidised programme.

While overall progress in relation to the actions in the Ryan Implementation Plan was good, it was noted that 5 of the 99 actions were not yet complete, namely actions 1, 65, 75, 76 and 96.  Actions 65, 75 and 76 relate to the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) as follows:<\/p>  <p> - Action 65 - a longitudinal study over ten years was to be undertaken which would follow young people who leave care, in order to map their transition into adulthood; <\/p>  <p> - Action 75 - a professionally managed national archive was to be developed as a central repository for the records for all children in care; and<\/p>  <p> - Action 76 - records created in non-statutory agencies should be secured in the national archive. <\/p>  <p>  These actions have not been implemented to date due to the resource implications and the challenging economic environment we faced.

From September 2016, I am expanding this Programme to allow children enrol in free pre-school from the time they are 3 years of age and to remain there until they start primary school.  This extended free pre-school provision was first recommended by the Expert Advisory Group on the Early Years Strategy in 2013. It was also one of a series of recommendations of the recent Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare, which I established in January last.  The Group consulted widely with a range of stakeholders, including the early years sector, during the course of its work. <\/p>  <p>  Under this extended Programme, there will be three opportunities for eligible children to enrol during the pre-school year: children who reach the age of 3 between April and August will have the opportunity to enrol in September; children who reach the age of 3 between September and December will have the opportunity to enrol in January; and children who reach the age of 3 between January and March will have the opportunity to enrol in April. As a result of this extension, the number of children benefiting from the Programme is expected to rise from around 67,000 to 127,000 in a given programme year. For the 2016\/17 programme year, it is estimated that 89,500 children will be eligible to enrol in the Programme from September 2016, 22,000 from January 2017 and 15,500 from April 2017.<\/p>  <p>  In order to provide the early years sector with the time to build capacity to meet this increased demand, a decision was taken to introduce this new measure from September 2016. As the increased demand for Programme is not expected to peak until January and April 2017, this timeframe should allow pre-school providers to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional demand. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that there is already additional capacity in the early years sector to cope with some of the increased demand. Indeed, the Annual Survey of Early Years Services, which was conducted in December 2014, estimates that there are more than 24,000 vacancies in early years services across the country with almost 13,000 of these vacancies in sessional services. I am also aware that every year a significant number of new pre-school providers apply to participate in this Programme. The increased demand for, and additional investment in, free pre-school provision going forward should encourage a greater numbers of applicants. <\/p>  <p>  The restoration of capitation rates to pre-2012 levels from September 2016 should also encourage a greater number of new applicants and encourage existing pre-school providers to expand.<\/p>  <p>  I am clear that more capacity will be required and that the implementation of this extended programme of free pre-school provision may pose a challenge for pre-school providers. Officials at my Department are already working closely with the City and County Childcare Committees and the Voluntary Childcare Organisations to develop a range of measures, which will assist with meeting this challenge. Further information on these measures will be available shortly.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has recently completed the development of an on-line management platform - the Programmes Implementation Platform  - to provide for the administration of a range of childcare programmes including the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme.  The objectives of this development are to reduce paperwork and duplication of effort, to simplify administration and to enhance the service experience of pre-school providers and the other stakeholders involved, including City or County Childcare Committees. The IT system also provides more efficient work practices, greater visibility and control of funds and assists greatly with prompt payment of pre-school providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200078#WRA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Refuges","counter":20,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200078#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":21,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[42643\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200078#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he has met with Respond Housing Association regarding the closure of a refuge centre (details supplied) in Dublin 24 on 12 December 2015.","asker":"1193","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":22,"content":"<p>I facilitated a meeting with Respond on 3 November, at its request, to get an account of the nature of the service provided, the reasons behind the decision to close the service, and to get a better understanding of Respond&rsquo;s previous interaction with state bodies in relation to the Centre referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The Centre, in the main, provides second stage residential accommodation for persons whose emergency needs arising from domestic violence have been met.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, in discharging its statutory responsibility, funds emergency refuge services for adults and children fleeing domestic violence, as well as providing a range of ongoing community supports.

However, it must be acknowledged that the HIQA report also outlines a number of clear improvements since the previous inspection.  These include for example: the commissioning of new residential units from March 2015; the employment of new residential care staff; the progress being made toward a new offending behaviour programme; significant improvements in handling of child protection concerns and complaints oversight, and  the focus on mental health needs of children under the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that more work is necessary on a number of issues identified by HIQA, in particular that of single separation of children.  On this issue, the report found that management were actively engaging with staff teams on the use of single separation, and that the policy for authorisations of separation had significantly improved.  However, ongoing work is required to address the issues related to its use and this is reflected in the updated action plan which has been drawn up by the Oberstown campus and agreed with HIQA on foot of recommendations made in the inspection report.

The project is supported in this work by my Department, the One Foundation and Atlantic Philanthropies.  <\/p>  <p>  The aims and objectives of the project are to:<\/p>  <p> - Provide information to the public on child care proceedings in the courts;<\/p>  <p> - Conduct research on these proceedings in order to promote debate and inform policy-makers;<\/p>  <p> - Make recommendations to address any short-comings in the child care system identified by the research;<\/p>  <p> - Assist in the implementation of these recommendations; and<\/p>  <p> - Promote confidence in the child care system.<\/p>  <p>  The project pursues its aims and objectives by attending the courts where child care cases are heard in order to report on those proceedings while protecting the anonymity of the children and their families.  The CCLRP publishes reports of child care cases for the public and all relevant stake-holders, collects and analyses data from the proceedings, publishes reports on the nature and outcomes of the child care proceedings and seeks to promote a public debate on the issues raised through seminars and conferences.  One such conference took place in April of this year in the form of an International Conference on Child Protection and the Law, which considered some of the findings up to that point, and heard from international contributors in relation to alternative models of care and child protection.<\/p>  <p>  Child care cases, heard mainly in the District Courts, involve applications by the Child and Family Agency for orders to protect children, including supervision orders, emergency and interim care orders and full care orders.

The programme contributes &euro;40 per week for an after-school place or &euro;80 per week in situations where the childcare service provides a pick-up service that collects the child from school.

Eligibility for the CETS programme is determined by the Department of Education and Skills. <\/p>  <p> - The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare, including after-school care, at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents.<\/p>  <p>  Progress has already been made to begin implementation of the specific measures related to after-school childcare that I announced as part of Budget 2016.

Children under 16 who present as being homeless to emergency services are taken into care.  Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care, or provided a service under section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991 (accommodation for homeless children).  Young people who were formerly in the care of the State and presently in receipt of aftercare services have their accommodation needs identified as part of this support.<\/p><p>The accommodation needs of children who are in the care of their parents where the family is homeless are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the statutory role of Tusla - the Child and Family Agency is to ensure the protection and welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care.  A child can only be received into the care of the Child and Family Agency where there are welfare or protection concerns.  Homelessness as part of a family group is not, in and of itself, a basis for seeking to receive a child into care. <\/p><p>In cases where there are welfare or protection concerns in relation to children in families presenting as homeless, the reporting of such concerns to the Child and Family Agency is governed by <i>Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children<\/i>(2011).

In parallel to the legislation, the existing <i>Children First: National Guidance<\/i>is currently being revised and updated. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will also be aware, on the 4th of December 2014, Minister Kelly hosted a special summit on homelessness to reaffirm the Government's commitment to end involuntary long-term homelessness, including that of families with children, by the end of 2016.  A number of actions arising from the summit were formalised into an action plan to address homelessness, and substantial progress has been made in implementing that plan.  Overall progress is overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.

Additionally, I have been informed that Tusla and the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive are currently developing a joint protocol which includes guidance on working with families where child protection concerns arise within emergency homeless accommodation.

A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes. In addition in early 2015, I established an Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education.  The work of the group was focused on identifying policy objectives to guide future investment in this area.  This report was published in July 2015 and informed the estimates process for Budget 2016.  Budget 2016 provides for an additional &euro;85 million investment in 2016.<\/p><p>My Department is also leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2017).  The ABC Programme is co-funded by my Department and The Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme aims to  improve the outcomes for children, young people and existing service by drawing on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched.  It is overseen by an inter-departmental project team.<\/p><p>My Department also provides targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through a range of schemes totalling &euro;49.93m of funding.

With this in mind, I requested that an Inter-Departmental Group, led by my Department be established, with a brief to bring forward recommendations to address this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Group concluded its work and the recommendations of this Group were fully accepted and funded by Government. I announced, as part of Budget 2016, the necessary funding to implement the new model of supports for children with a disability with costs for these supports estimated to be &euro;15m in 2016 and with full year costs estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards. This funding will be allocated on the basis of the needs of children and not on the basis of geographic location. Therefore, the proportion of this funding, which will be allocated to Donegal in any given Programme year cannot be determined.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that this Group has identified a practical, workable model for meeting the needs of children with a disability and the allocation of funding is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to supporting such children.<\/p>  <p>  Moving forward from funding to implementation, I am very pleased to say that, on 18 November last, the model of supports was launched by myself, together with my Government colleagues, Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, TD, Minister for Education and Skills and Kathleen Lynch, TD, Minister of State at the Department of Health.<\/p>  <p>  When established, the new model will focus on the developmental level of children with disabilities, their functional ability and their needs. It will not focus on diagnosis, recognising that many children may not have a formal diagnosis at the time of presenting to pre-school. <\/p>  <p>  The model, when fully operational, will deliver seven levels of support to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE Programme. These supports move from universal (which will benefit all children), to highly targeted supports (which will benefit 1%-1.5% of children estimated to have very complex needs). Supports include: enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations, increased capitation for certain children with very complex needs, as well as access to therapeutic intervention. <\/p>  <p>  The new model will take some time to be fully established as capacity needs to be built in the early years sector, but the planned front-loading and on-going investment will result in all children with a disability having their pre-school needs met. The implementation of all seven levels of supports is the next step in the process and in that regard, two groups have been established to oversee and implement the new model.<\/p>  <p>  The first group, the Cross Sectoral Implementation Group, will oversee and monitor implementation, while the second group, the Project Group, will implement the model for roll-out by September 2016, recognising that some elements will take somewhat longer to fully implement as capacity needs to be built into the system. <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Deputy should be aware that currently the ECCE Programme makes special provision for children with a disability to access the ECCE programme. Measures include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the Programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year and this will continue to be an option for parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200079#WRB00700","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Refuges","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200079#WRB00750"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[42650\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200079#WRB00800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 12 of 21 October 2015, his progress in resolving the issue of funding of Cuan &Aacute;lainn women's refuge in Tallaght, Dublin 24.","asker":"1197","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p>I facilitated a meeting with Respond on 3 November, at its request, to get an account of the nature of the service provided, the reasons behind the decision to close Cuan &Aacute;lainn, and to get a better understanding of Respond&rsquo;s previous interaction with state bodies in relation to the Centre.<\/p>  <p>  Cuan &Aacute;lainn, in the main, provides second stage residential accommodation for persons whose emergency needs arising from domestic violence have been met.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, in discharging its statutory responsibility, funds emergency refuge services for adults and children fleeing domestic violence, as well as providing a range of ongoing community supports.

HIQA's findings are mixed, by and large showing a committed staff dealing with young people, some of whom have serious emotional and behavioural difficulties. The age profile of children in residential centres has risen over the last number of years, and now approximately half the young people resident are aged 16 and 17 years. Some of these young people will have come into care recently, while others will have experienced the breakdown of other care placements, including foster care. In some instances the young person's behaviour will have triggered the breakdown, in other instances it may be a response to repeated disrupted relationships and poor self esteem.  I want to emphasise that unlike Special Care, children are not detained in residential centres, nor were they detained in High Support Centres either. <\/p>  <p>  The majority of children's residential centres are, de facto, providing high support care.  Across the country there are 160 centres, including private and community based caring for 337 children. There are, at a minimum, two staff on duty and, when needed, this number is increased.  This shows an average of 2 young people per centre, although of course the number of children in a centre will range from 1 to approximately 4.  98% of children in residential care have an allocated social worker (329). Young people placed in community based centres who have serious emotional and behavioural problems, and who are being considered for special care, are linked with the Assessment, Consultation and Therapy Service (ACTS) multidisciplinary therapeutic team.  Further specialist supports are also routinely made available as needed and many centres have specialist skill-sets, therapeutic modalities, or links with same, in their local communities to meet the varying need of the young people in their care. Tusla managers and staff are fully aware of the emotional and mental health needs of children in care.  While the term High Support is not currently used,  high support care is provided, through Tusla placements and also, privately commissioned residential and foster placements, with access to specialist psychological and psychotherapeutic play opportunities.<\/p>  <p>  I believe the Deputy's question refers to the inspection report published by HIQA on the 5th of November 2015, where a focused inspection was carried out on a children&rsquo;s residential centre in the Dublin Mid-Leinster region. This unannounced, themed inspection, focused solely on how the needs of children who display challenging behaviour are met. The HIQA inspection report found that of the seven standards inspected in the centre, only one was fully met, five required some aspect of improvement and significant risk was identified in one standard. This latter standard outlined the risk to the safety of the young people due to their behaviour when outside the centre. <\/p>  <p>  Inspectors  found that staff worked in partnership with the social work department, parents and other professionals to try to manage these risks; however their interventions  did not have the desired effect, at the time of the inspection, to stop dangerous behaviour by the young people. The report outlines how the staff and management of the centre demonstrated a real commitment to the young people in their care, despite their challenging behaviour. However, HIQA determined that the risk taking behaviour of the young people was such that other interventions should have been put in place. <\/p>  <p>  I am fully aware of the serious challenge faced by the Department and Tusla in working with this group of young people.  Reports from the National Review Panel provide sufficient evidence of the tragic outcome for some young people who take risks with their own lives and safety. In order to improve outcomes, Tusla has established a working group to reviewing strategy for alternative care, and two of my officials are members of the group. Separately, senior managers in Tusla and officials in my Department are in discussions about how best to meet the needs of some of these young people to secure their safety and future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200079#WRB01100","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence Refuges","counter":84,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200079#WRB01150"},{"type":"question","counter":85,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[42642\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200079#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his views on a refuge centre (details supplied) in Dublin 24 that has housed 71 women and 96 children fleeing domestic violence since 2012; if he has met with Respond Housing Association, as he stated; his plans to prevent this crucial refuge from closing on 12 December 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1193","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":86,"content":"<p>I facilitated a meeting with Respond on 3 November, at its request, to get an account of the nature of the service provided, the reasons behind the decision to close the service, and to get a better understanding of Respond&rsquo;s previous interaction with state bodies in relation to the Centre referred to by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The Centre, in the main, provides second stage residential accommodation for persons whose emergency needs arising from domestic violence have been met.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, in discharging its statutory responsibility, funds emergency refuge services for adults and children fleeing domestic violence, as well as providing a range of ongoing community supports.

With this in mind, I requested that an Inter-Departmental Group, led by my Department be established, with a brief to bring forward recommendations to address this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Group concluded its work and the recommendations of this Group were fully accepted and funded by Government. I announced, as part of Budget 2016, the necessary funding to implement the new model of supports for children with a disability with costs for these supports estimated to be &euro;15m in 2016 and with full year costs estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that this Group has identified a practical, workable model for meeting the needs of children with a disability and the allocation of funding is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to supporting such children.<\/p>  <p>  Moving forward from funding to implementation, I am very pleased to say that, on 18 November last, the model of supports was launched by myself, together with my Government colleagues, Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, TD, Minister for Education and Skills and Kathleen Lynch, TD, Minister of State at the Department of Health.<\/p>  <p>  When established, the new model will focus on the developmental level of children with disabilities, their functional ability and their needs. It will not focus on diagnosis, recognising that many children may not have a formal diagnosis at the time of presenting to pre-school. <\/p>  <p>  The model, when fully operational, will deliver seven levels of support to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE Programme. These supports, which move from universal to highly targeted supports based on the needs of the child, include: enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations, increased capitation for certain children with very complex needs, as well as access to therapeutic intervention. <\/p>  <p>  The new model will take some time to be fully established as capacity needs to be built in the early years sector, but the planned front-loading and on-going investment will result in all children with a disability having their pre-school needs met. The implementation of all seven levels of supports is the next step in the process and in that regard, two groups have been established to oversee and implement the new model.<\/p>  <p>  The first group, the Cross Sectoral Implementation Group, will oversee and monitor implementation, while the second group, the Project Group, will implement the model for roll-out by September 2016, recognising that some elements will take somewhat longer to fully implement as capacity needs to be built into the system. <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Deputy should be aware that currently the ECCE Programme makes special provision for children with a disability to access the ECCE programme. Measures include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the Programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year and this will continue to be an option for parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200079#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence","counter":90,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200079#WRB01550"},{"type":"question","counter":91,"qnumday":37,"qnumall":"[42683\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200079#WRB01600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he will make prioritise the restoration of funding that was cut to domestic abuse and violence services, given the increase in Tusla - Child and Family Agency services for 2016.","asker":"1065","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":92,"content":"<p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual or gender based violence whether in the context of the family or otherwise.<\/p>  <p>  This year, Tusla provided over &euro;19 million euro in funding for the provision of domestic and sexual violence services.

This particular extension to the scheme will be available to participants for one year giving them time to increase their hours to 19 per week and qualify for the family income supplement. <\/p>  <p>  Although the part-time job incentive scheme is a small non statutory scheme, it can provide assistance to long term unemployed who can only find part-time work and who fail the &lsquo;4 in 7&rsquo; jobseeker&rsquo;s rule or do not qualify for FIS. <\/p>  <p>  Any change to the qualifying criteria for the part-time job incentive scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200079#WRB03000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":112,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200079#WRB03050"},{"type":"question","counter":113,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[43062\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200079#WRB03100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of an application for a disability allowance by a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":114,"content":"<p>The disability allowance (DA) application from the person in question was disallowed on 23 October 2015 because a deciding officer decided that he did not satisfy the medical conditions for DA purposes. <\/p>  <p>  The person concerned was advised of the option to submit further medical evidence and\/or lodge an appeal directly to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

The Regulations are under the remit of the Minister for Social Protection and prescribe the conditions for transfers to arrangements established outside the State. These are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  -  the trustees or PRSA provider have satisfied themselves that the retirement benefits to be provided under the overseas arrangement are relevant benefits by obtaining written confirmation to that effect from the trustees, custodians, managers or administrators of an overseas arrangement to which the transfer is to be made, and<\/p>  <p>  -  the trustees or PRSA provider have satisfied themselves that the overseas arrangement has been approved by an appropriate regulatory authority for the country concerned, and\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  -  the trustees or PRSA provider have received from the member of the scheme or the PRSA contributor such information in such form as may for the time being be approved by the Pensions Authority.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that moving pension funds overseas in an effort to circumvent the requirements of Irish tax legislation may fall foul of the conditions under which the pension scheme was approved by \u00a0Revenue as an exempt approved scheme or the conditions under which a PRSA product received Revenue approval.\u00a0 For this reason Revenue has additional requirements to ensure that such transfers are used to provide pension benefits. Prior to making any overseas transfer payments, the trustees or PRSA provider must be satisfied that:<\/p>  <p>  (a) the member has requested a transfer,<\/p>  <p>  (b) the overseas arrangement provides relevant benefits as defined by Section 770(1) of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, and<\/p>  <p>  (c) the overseas arrangement has been approved by the appropriate regulatory authority in the country concerned. <\/p>  <p>  In practice, the trustees or PRSA provider are required to obtain written confirmation to that effect from the administrator of the overseas arrangement to which the transfer is to be made. <\/p>  <p>  If the transfer is to another EU Member State, the overseas scheme must be operated or managed by an Institution for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORP), within the meaning of the EU Pensions Directive, and must be established in a Member State of the European Communities which has implemented the Directive in its national law. The scheme administrator must be resident in an EU Member State. A transfer which complies with the above requirements may be made without prior reference to Revenue. A transfer to a scheme which is not operated by an IORPS must be referred to Revenue in advance of the transfer taking place.<\/p>  <p>  If the transfer is to a country outside the EU, a transfer may not be made to a country other than the one in which the member is currently employed.<\/p>  <p>  All transfer payments to an arrangement for the provision of retirement benefits outside the State made from an approved occupational pension scheme or PRSA under the provisions of the Overseas Transfer Payments Regulations may be made to facilitate bona fide transactions only. A member of an Occupational Pension Scheme or a PRSA contributor who directs the trustees\/PRSA provider to transfer assets to an overseas arrangement must sign a declaration to the effect that the transfer conforms to the requirements of the Regulations and Revenue transfer rules, is for bona fide reasons and is not primarily for the purpose of circumventing pension tax legislation and Revenue rules.<\/p>  <p>  No tax charge applies in respect of the actual transfer of occupational pension funds, and, providing the transfer complies with the Regulations and Revenue rules as set out above, the transfer may be made without further tax consequences. <\/p>  <p>  Section 787G (1) Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 provides that a tax charge arises where the value of any assets in a PRSA is paid by the PRSA administrator to the PRSA holder or to any other persons. Exceptions to the application of this tax charge are contained in section 787G (3) TCA 1997. However, where a PRSA fund is transferred to an overseas arrangement, such a transfer is not covered by any of the exceptions listed under section 787G (3) TCA 1997.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that some conditions (such as the tax charge applying to PRSA transfers as outlined above) may be impacting on fund transfers being undertaken for legitimate reasons, particularly in the case of emigrants. These conditions are being reviewed. The ideal would be to ensure that overseas transfers of pension funds which are undertaken for legitimate reasons are facilitated as much as possible while also guarding against abuse of the arrangements. This is not always an easy balance to achieve. Nevertheless, it is hoped that some progress can be made in this area in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200080#WRC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":162,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200080#WRC02450"},{"type":"question","counter":163,"qnumday":62,"qnumall":"[43192\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200080#WRC02500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"given that budget 2016 will allow a &euro;550 earned income tax credit for self-employed persons and that persons receiving maintenance payments could be deemed as self-employed by the Revenue Commissioners, if he will extend this tax credit to maintenance payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1076","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":164,"content":"<p>Maintenance payments can relate to maintenance in respect of a former spouse and\/or children. The tax treatment of separated spouses depends on the circumstances which apply in each case.\u00a0 In broad terms the position with regard to the tax treatment of separated persons is as follows.<\/p>  <p>  While in general separated couples are treated for tax purposes as if unmarried, they may, where a legally binding maintenance arrangement is in place, elect to be treated for tax purposes as if the separation had not taken place.\u00a0\u00a0However, the election to be treated for tax purposes as if still married is not a right of one spouse alone but rather is a joint election of both spouses.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The general position in the case of legally enforceable maintenance agreements is that, where the couple are treated for tax purposes as if unmarried, a tax deduction for maintenance payments for the benefit of his\/her spouse is granted to the paying spouse, and the payments are taxable income in the hands of the receiving spouse. If an individual's sole income is from maintenance payments, this is taxed under the self-assessment system. \u00a0However, if the couple jointly elect to be treated for tax purposes as if the separation had not taken place, then the payer does not receive a tax deduction for the maintenance payments and the receiving spouse is not taxable on them.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  On the other hand, non-legally binding maintenance payments are not taxable in the hands of the receiving spouse and the paying spouse cannot claim a tax deduction for them. <\/p>  <p>  Maintenance payments in respect of children are not taxable in the hands of the children or the receiving spouse, and the paying spouse cannot claim a tax deduction for the payments.\u00a0 The effect of this is that the payments are treated the same way as if the taxpayer was providing for the child out of his\/her after-tax income. This is in line with the tax treatment of all other parents, where the cost of maintaining their children is not tax deductible.<\/p>  <p>  The Finance Bill 2015 provides for a new tax credit known as the Earned Income Tax Credit.\u00a0 The tax credit is available in respect of earned income other than earned income which already qualifies for the Employee (PAYE) Tax Credit. The credit will be given at 20% of qualifying earned income subject to a maximum credit of &euro;550 for 2016. <\/p>  <p>  The definition of earned income is set out in section 3 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.\u00a0 This includes income arising from the exercise of an office or employment and income arising from the carrying on of a trade or profession.<\/p>  <p>  Maintenance payments do not fall within the scope of the definition of earned income and, as such, will not be taken into account in determining an individual's entitlement to the Earned Income Tax Credit.

This figure comprises 12,866 members, 978 reserve members, and 2,012 civilians as of 31 October. <\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to provide effective, visible policing throughout the country. The number of Garda&iacute; is crucial to this but, also of importance, is ensuring that the overall composition of the Garda workforce achieves the right balance between highly trained Garda&iacute; and professional, skilled civilian staff, and that the Service harnesses the energy and skills of volunteers through the Garda Reserve.<\/p>  <p>  The optimal number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a factor of a number of different considerations, including population size and composition, crime trends, the level of civilianisation, etc. Having said that, the Government is committed to on-going seamless recruitment into the future and as the Deputy will be aware, provision has been made in Budget 2016 for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; next year bringing to 1,150 the number of new Garda&iacute; that will be recruited since the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore in September 2014. So far 295 of those new recruits are fully attested and are on the ground in communities nationwide. It is expected that a further 395 will attest by the end of 2016 which, taking account of projected retirements, will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark.  I expect recruitment to continue at or around the current levels for the next number of years having regard to factors such as the level of retirements in any one year.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they are employed in a wide range of management, administrative, technical and operational roles where they make an invaluable contribution to the delivery of effective policing services throughout the country. The increased budget allocation for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2016, in addition to providing for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute;, provides for the recruitment of additional civilian experts, in particular to develop the Garda ICT investment programme. Having regard to international experience, I believe that there is undoubtedly value in exploring the opportunities for increasing the ratio of civilians to Garda&iacute;, and for releasing Garda&iacute; from administrative and other positions to front-line duties. The process which is currently ongoing to civilianise border control functions at Dublin airport and the transfer of these responsibilities from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department is an excellent example of this.  Further work in this area will be progressed in conjunction with the Garda Commissioner in the context of the report of the Garda Inspectorate of its review under the Haddington Road Agreement. The terms of reference of that review include all aspects of the operation and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including the structure, organisation and staffing of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the deployment of members and civilian staff to relevant and appropriate roles.<\/p>  <p>  Lastly, in relation to the capacity of the Garda College, I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that the Garda College provides a range of training and development courses to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all new recruits complete their initial 32 week training programme at the College.  The physical capacity of the College extends to 496 bedrooms, 16 Classrooms and 4 Lecture Theatres. The College has the capacity to accommodate the planned intake of 600 Garda Trainees next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200081#WRD04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Station Closures","counter":245,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200082#WRE00150"},{"type":"question","counter":246,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[43105\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200082#WRE00200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stations that have been closed since March 2011.","asker":"998","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":247,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[43106\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200082#WRE00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the savings from closing Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stations, by station; how she arrived at the savings as previously indicated in a reply to a parliamentary question.","asker":"998","askee":"1009"},{"type":"question","counter":248,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[43107\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200082#WRE00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of former Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stations that have been disposed of and that will be disposed of by the end of 2015, and thereafter.","asker":"998","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":249,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 to 93, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The formulation of proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda Stations is a matter, in the first instance, for the Garda Commissioner in the context of annual policing plans, as provided for in section 22 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.<\/p>  <p>  The Garda District and Station Rationalisation Programme implemented in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na during 2012 and 2013 resulted in the closure of 39 Garda stations in 2012 and 100 Garda stations in 2013. It is understood from discussions with the Garda Commissioner that the current consolidation process is largely completed and there are no plans at present for further station closures in 2015 and 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  The Programme was based on a review of the Garda Station Network by Garda management which concluded in relation to certain stations, many of which were only open part-time and manned by a single Garda, that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.  In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  The Programme supports the provision of a modern 21st century policing service for both urban and rural areas and allows front line Garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility, and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  As a result of the Programme, communities have benefited from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which has enabled  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an improved policing service to the public. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme identified proposed savings of &euro;4,000 per annum on utilities and maintenance as a result of the closure of each station building giving rise to estimated total direct savings to the State of &euro;556,000 per annum.  While the direct savings are modest, it is important to recall that the primary objective of the Programme was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p>  <p>  The Garda Stations which have been closed were returned to, and are now under the control of, the Office of Public Works (OPW).

Data gathered from nine year old children as part of Growing Up in Ireland, the National Longitudinal Survey commissioned by my department,  showed that <font color=\"#212100\"> <\/font>based on responses from their mothers, 24% of children had been victims of bullying in the past year.  This represents a significantly lower proportion than that reported by children themselves, which was reported at 40%, suggesting either that many parents are unaware that their child has experienced bullying in the previous year, or that they may have different perspectives about what constitutes bullying.<\/p><p>The Action Plan On Bullying: Report of the Anti-Bullying Working Group to the Minister for Education and Skills was published in January 2013 clearly recognised the necessity to tackle this issue in a holistic way which saw schools as pivotal, but placed the issue within a much wider social context.  The Plan sets out twelve actions aimed at helping to prevent and tackle all forms of bullying in primary and post-primary schools. The actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising.  Good progress has been made in implementing the actions set out in the report.  New National Anti-Bullying Procedures for schools were published in September 2013 and are currently being implemented by all 4,000 primary and post primary schools in the country.  Training materials for parents, teachers and Boards of Management are also being developed and rolled out. Cyberbullying is just one aspect of bullying, but one given the rapid expansion of access to technology by young people has come much more sharply into focus.  The Stay Safe Programme, a personal safety skills programme for children is currently being updated to be available to schools during the 2015\/2016 school year. The lessons on Bullying in the revised Stay Safe Programme relate to the types of Bullying Behaviour outlined in the definition of Bullying in the Anti-Bullying Procedures.<\/p><p>Schools are strengthening collaboration and interaction with youth services and promote the active participation by pupils in youth focused services within their local communities.  DCYA supports the National Youth Health Programme which is in partnership with the HSE and the National Youth Council of Ireland.  The programme's aims are to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion\/education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings, and includes programmes aimed at exploring bullying and cyberbullying with young people.  Young people being bullied, or indeed those engaging in bullying behaviour, will sometimes need support which goes beyond that can be provided by their immediate family.  Work is currently underway with primary care teams in the HSE to pilot 'social prescribing'.  Social prescribing creates a formal means of enabling primary care services to refer young people with social, emotional or practical needs which include experience of being bullied or showing bullying behaviour to a variety of holistic, local non-clinical services.<\/p><p>The Office for Internet Safety is an Executive Office of the Department of Justice and Equality has lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children.  In the Department of Justice and Equality, the Office for Internet Safety (OIS) acts as the co-ordinator in Ireland for the EU Safer Internet Programme.  The OIS has a dedicated website which contains information and links on internet safety, it also has a series of booklets on internet safety issues which are available to parents and teachers.  In addition, it produces awareness raising materials for the Safer Internet Day which is held in February each year. In 2013 and 2014 these concentrated on the issue of cyberbullying.  As part of its work it holds an annual Safer Internet Day, which has included a rollout of a social marketing campaign specifically targeted at young people.  The resources produced by the Office for Internet Safety makes available free of charge, in hard and soft copy, information resources on combating cyberbullying and on general safety online.<\/p><p>The Law reform Commission is currently conducting a project on <i>Cyber-crime affecting personal safety, privacy and reputation, including cyber-bullying.<\/i>The project will include an analysis of the types of harmful behaviour involved in this area, in particular bullying, and the impact which cyber-bullying through social media has had.  The Commission&rsquo;s report and recommendations, when available, will also inform consideration of any future action by Government in this area.  <\/p><p>The Minister of  Communications established an Internet Content Governance Advisory Group under the chair of Dr. Brian O&rsquo;Neil in 2013 to ensure our national policy represents best practice in offering the same online protections to our citizens as those available in the offline world.  The Group&rsquo;s Report which was published in June, 2014 included wide ranging recommendations.  Many of these recommendations were administrative in nature, and are being implemented, a number of structural recommendations are currently under consideration.<\/p><p>The internet is a fluid, evolving environment, requiring policy makers, industry and relevant stakeholders to be flexible as they adapt to changing and emerging contexts.  Parents also have a very important role in talking to their children about these issues and becoming familiar with tools and resources that will enable their children to take advantage of the many great opportunities the internet offers in a safe and positive manner.  The internet does not now and will not stand still. But the work I have outlined will assist in shaping the governmental response, in the interests of all citizens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200082#WRE03500","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":295,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200082#WRE03550"},{"type":"question","counter":296,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[43161\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200082#WRE03600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if he has studied the issue of depression in young persons with particular reference to identifying early alert and subsequent support; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":297,"content":"<p>My Department collects information on the issue of depression in children through the Growing Up in Ireland Study.<\/p>  <p>  Growing Up in Ireland, The National Longitudinal Study of Children in Ireland is a study which is wholly sponsored by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Since 2007 the study has followed the progress of two groups of children: 8,000 9-year-olds and 10,000 9-month-olds across Ireland to collect a host of information to help improve our understanding of all aspects of children and their development.<\/p>  <p>  The Growing Up in Ireland Study has investigated depression and mood in the older child cohort and as the infant cohort ages, similar questions will be introduced. <\/p>  <p>  The 13 year old wave of data collection included a &lsquo;Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire&rsquo; (not a clinical measure of depression) and a Children&rsquo;s Self-Concept Scale for measuring the child&rsquo;s self-esteem.

Depending on the nature and severity the health need, services may be provided by the Childcare services, at Primary Care or at CAMHS level. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE recently adopted a Standard Operating Procedure for both in-patient and community based CAMHS.

Additional funding of &euro;12 million, was allocated by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to meet the needs of almost 1,400 young people who required continuing health-funded supports on leaving school or rehabilitative training (RT) this year, of which &euro;6 million was made available to provide services from September.<\/p>  <p>  Finding the resources and the physical capacity to meet the needs of a growing number of new service users every year is a challenging task.

For pupils who require more specialised supports, special school and special class placements are also available.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teaching and Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support, to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support, which is set out in my Department's Circular 0030\/2014.<\/p>  <p>  Circular 0030\/2014 sets out the policy of allocating SNA support for a newly enrolling Junior Infant who has a clear and obvious need for such support e.g. a child who has a significant additional care need arising from an intellectual, sensory or physical disability.  For those children where it is not yet clear whether difficulties will manifest in a classroom environment, the Circular states that, in general, it is expected that all primary school pupils having their first school experience will have been enrolled and will have commenced attending school before any application for SNA support will be made.  In relation to possible anticipated behavioural difficulties in particular, it is more appropriate to wait until the child begins school in order to see how they have been able to engage in the classroom.<\/p>  <p>  The Circular explains that provision of SNA support should not be considered as a first response for management of behaviour, and should only be provided where it is clear that behavioural management strategies have not been successful to date and where it is demonstrated how access to such support can assist with ongoing planning and intervention for the child.<\/p>  <p>  Responsibility for the management of behaviour in schools is a matter for individual schools.

I am satisfied that this process was conducted in a robust manner consistent with EU and National Procurement Guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200086#WRJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"964"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Tax Collection","counter":476,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200086#WRJ00450"},{"type":"question","counter":477,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[43145\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015120200086#WRJ00500","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to introduce a rebate scheme for truck owners who paid their motor tax at a higher rate before the Court of Appeal ruling of 21 October 2015 to allow them to recoup overpaid tax' if hauliers who were paying at this rate before 21 October 2015 are entitled to a rebate; the reason for the discrepancy in treatment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"959","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":478,"content":"<p>On the basis of advice received from the Office of the Attorney General, there is no basis for charging motor tax on articulated vehicles at the goods rate from 21 October 2015, the date of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in relation to such vehicles.
