As a third party, it is not appropriate for me to become involved in matters which are of a contractual nature between the parties involved.  The involvement of trained advisers in the preparation of GLAS plans has been central to the implementation of GLAS since its inception.  In view of this, the preparation for the roll-out of GLAS involved my Department organising specific training to ensure an adequate number of advisers would be available to prepare and submit applications on behalf of farmers.  Following the completion of this training between November 2014 and February 2015, those who attended the training sessions were required to submit approved forms and details of their educational qualifications to the Department.  They were separately required to submit completed registration forms and professional indemnity insurance details to the Department before they could be entered on the register of approved advisers.  Some 528 people are approved on the register as GLAS advisers.  This gives them access to the GLAS online application system to prepare applications for their farmer clients.<\/p>  <p>  While Teagasc has indicated to some of its clients that it cannot submit applications for them at this stage, it is always open to farmers to approach another adviser.

Any farmers who are unable to apply in the current tranche for whatever reason, for example, it might be taking too long to put the plan in place, will have an opportunity to apply in this second tranche.  I ask farmers to understand that it is not such a big deal if they cannot meet the 22 May deadline because GLAS will be opening again three and a half or four months from now.  The whole point of our current approach is to accept a tranche of applications now so that we have some time to deal with plans and applications.

It would be very difficult to do this with individual vessel owners because there are so many competing interests in the fishing industry.  This is why it is always very difficult to manage politically.  If something is given to one boat another boat will lose because this is a finite resource.  The gross tonnage and engine power kilowatt figures are as they are for our entire fleet.  For many years as part of the Common Fisheries Policy countries have been required to stay within these limits, so the capacity of their fleet to catch fish does not increase and their quota is limited on an annual basis.  The Commission's fear is if boat owners state they will not catch any more fish but want to put in a more powerful engine to make the boat safer it would create increased power capacity to tow larger nets which would create the capacity to catch more fish which is a concern for the Commission.  It is trying to insist we match the catching capacity from a power, size and tonnage point of view with the appropriate amount of fish a country should be catching for sustainable catches.  The case has been made to me by many owners that if they must steam for long distances this has implications for safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400005#C00600","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1431593400,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I know there is a trade-off and a balance must be struck, but this proposal would not increase capacity because capacity is already there with regard to tonnage and kilowatts in the national fleet.  It is a question of how it is used to maximise quality and safety at sea.  The Minister has placed much emphasis on safety, and rightly so, but this could and would improve safety for those fishermen already fishing, who have a quota and are not looking to increase it through this measure.  I understand the Commission is concerned that a more powerful engine might lead to demand for an additional quota, but everybody knows it will not be available.  This is about boats being able to catch and land good quality fish to maximise their income.  With a finite quota it is vital for the sustainability of their businesses that they can maximise their income.  There have been instances where boats, because of their size and the weather conditions this year, have only recently completed their mackerel quota.  The weather did not allow them to get out when the fish were right beside them.  They had to steam further to get them.  These issues could be addressed with balance, improving safety and earnings without impacting on quota or capacity of the overall fleet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400005#C00700","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1431593400,"counter":46,"content":"<p>It would impact on the gross tonnage and engine power kilowatt issue.

The payments audited covered the period from 2008 to 2012, inclusive, during which over &euro;9 billion was paid to farmers in Ireland under the direct payment schemes.

The Commission held its position on the 2% flat rate correction before and during its meeting and advised that it was still reviewing the information received from my Department in advance of the hearing.  During their meeting, officials from my Department outlined Ireland's fundamental objection to the flat-rate correction and argued that the risk to the fund should be a calculated amount.  My officials informed the conciliation body regarding the amount of work undertaken by my Department to identify and remove all ineligible features from the land parcel identification system, LPIS, database, the technical improvement in the LPIS system and the time and resources used by my Department to address all issues raised by the Commission.  The conciliation body acknowledged the amount of work done by my Department in the calculation of the risk and stated that it was of the opinion that the issue hinged on only a few, though important, elements of the calculations.<\/p> <p> The report of the conciliation body concluded that conciliation seemed within reach and that the Commission and my Department should continue discussing the matter with a view to an agreed settlement.  On foot of this advice, my Department has maintained regular contact with the Commission with a view to bringing the matter to a conclusion.  Further work has recently been carried out to quantify the level of risk to EU funds and this information is currently with the Commission for consideration and will be the subject of a Commission visit shortly.

We have planted a lot of trees on agricultural land, which essentially are a very valuable carbon sink.

Dairy breed animals will require different farm management systems and would typically not achieve the same conformation scores as animals from the suckler herd.  This will be reflected in the price achievable for finished product and farmers deciding to fatten these animals for slaughter should take account of all of these factors when making their production decisions.  Most farmers will understand this.<\/p>  <p>  According to the data available on my Department&rsquo;s animal identification and movements database, the number of calf births registered so far this year has increased by about 130,000 or 9% compared to 2014.  The number of calves registered in the dairy herd is just over 100,000 higher than last year.  It is a significant change.  The suckler herd is also showing an increased number of births, with about 30,000 more calves registered to date in 2015.  It is a positive story in the suckler sector which it is important to recognise.  The increase follows two years of declining numbers in the suckler herd and while the outturn for the rest of the year remains to be seen, the figures reflect the return of some confidence to the sector in recent months.  The increased output across both production systems should be seen as a positive development and the challenge for all of the sector is to deliver a solid return on the animals through continued market development and adding value to our beef output.<\/p>  <p>  Traditionally, male dairy breed calves have been prime candidates for live export to continental markets and my Department has facilitated this trade to ensure it provides an alternative market outlet for Irish farmers.  The veal market is important for a growing dairy sector.  Advances in sexed semen technology may ultimately have an impact on the production of beef from the dairy herd and we must continue to endeavour to maximise this element of beef output.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400008#F00900","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1431595200,"counter":88,"content":"<p>It is interesting to see an increase of 130,000 in the number of calf births this year in both the beef and dairy sectors.

Given the figures, one would expect concerns to arise in the future also.  That is the reason for the question on veal.  I accept that the new beef data and genomics programme which the Minister launched this month has had a positive and stimulating effect on the beef sector.  It was well flagged that such a package would be put in place.  Does the Minister believe there is an export market for red or rose veal?  Live exports are very important to the country.

We think we can put production systems in place that will allow us to add value, grow the animals here and produce more beef, but, obviously, that means we will need more markets and competition to ensure a price drop will not ensue, which is what happened last year.  To date this year, on average, the price is up by approximately 10% on last year.  It is 14% and 15% higher than at the low point last year.  Farmers are concerned that once we go above a certain number in terms of production, there is arguably overproduction, which drives prices down.  The challenge for me and the industry is to develop new markets, including in the United States, China, Japan, other parts of Europe and North Africa in order that we will have enough competition to ensure we can grow volume, as well as maintain strong value.  I am pleased to state that so far this year we are at 107% of the EU 15 price for beef, which means that we are in the premium space.

The milk purchaser must remit the collected moneys to my Department before 1 October in order that it will be in a position to pay the European Commission before 30 November.  However, new arrangements recently introduced by the Commission allow member states to facilitate the payment by milk producers of the superlevy liability in three annual instalments, without interest.  The first instalment must be collected by the milk purchaser and paid to my Department by 1 October and the two subsequent payments must be paid by similar dates in 2016 and 2017.

Under the proposed scheme, the Department will, on receipt of a formal application from a milk producer wishing to participate, raise a debt against that milk producer for the outstanding amount of superlevy due and facilitate the payment in three annual instalments.  Milk producers wishing to avail of the scheme will be asked to apply through their milk purchaser and the scheme will, at the outset, involve the establishment of a contract between the milk producer and the Department, where the value of the debt being raised and the conditions that must be complied with are set out.

She and I have spoken about badgers many times and I know where she is coming from.<\/p>  <p>  The badger removal strategy, which has been part of our TB eradication programme for some years, has been developed in response to research which has demonstrated that the eradication of the disease in cattle is not a practicable proposition until the reservoir of infection in badgers, with which it has also been found they share localised TB strains, is addressed.  This is based on a number of studies which showed that badger removal had a significant beneficial impact on the risk of future breakdowns, with areas where badgers were not removed being some 14 times at greater risk than in areas where badgers were removed. <\/p>  <p>  It is also notable that there has been a significant improvement in the disease situation in Ireland both in the cattle and badger populations since the badger removal programme was put on a more structured footing in 2004.  The incidence of TB in cattle has fallen by almost 40% since 2008 and is currently at record low levels.  It is particularly interesting that the incidence of TB in Northern Ireland, where badger removal is not prioritised, is approximately twice as high as on this side of the Border. <\/p>  <p>  The study referred to by the Deputy is ongoing and is designed to find out how exactly the disease transmission between badgers and cattle takes place with a view to building up a comprehensive picture of badger movements and helping to design a viable vaccination programme for badgers, which is my Department&rsquo;s preferred way of addressing the issue, if we can make it work.  The fact that badgers tend to avoid buildings does not mean that they do not transmit disease to cattle.  The position is that badgers can and do transmit TB to cattle via faeces, urine or latrines, and strain-typing has shown that badgers and cattle share the same strain of TB which is prevalent in the locality.   Apart from this, research has shown that, as I have stated above, the removal of badgers from a locality has resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of TB in cattle. <\/p>  <p>   My Department endeavours to ensure that the badger culling programme takes place as humanely as possible.  The restraints used in the capture of badgers are approved under section 34 of the Wildlife Act 1976 and research conducted within UCD has shown that damage or injury to captured badgers is minimal and is lower than with other capture methodologies.  The badger removal programme is based on research, is conducted humanely and only to the extent where it has been found to assist in reducing disease levels and, through the evidence of the sustained reductions in disease levels, both in cattle and badgers, has demonstrated its effectiveness.  I am confident it can be replaced by a badger vaccination programme in due course and, as far as I am concerned, the sooner the better but I need to do it on the basis of science.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400010#H00900","speaker":"991"},{"type":"speech","time":1431596400,"counter":117,"content":"<p>I suggest there could be other reasons for the improvement in the reduction in the levels of bovine TB apart from the cull of the badgers.  There is no doubt that everybody wants a cattle herd free of bovine TB.  It was interesting to read this report which was carried out by the Minister's Department, Trinity College and the National Parks and Wildlife Service over four years.  What it discovered was that badgers actively avoid areas where there are cattle, whether in a yard or out in the wild.  They have been observed on their nightly wanderings and if they come into a field where there are cattle they divert somewhere else.  In the meantime, 80% of the badgers being culled are perfectly healthy animals.  We are aware that even though there are licences to shoot them, they are culled in most horrific circumstances.  We have seen badgers caught in the trap where they are shot.  Poison has been laid.  Slurry has been left in some of the traps in order to further intensify the cruelty.  This is being carried out under licences issued by the Department.<\/p>  <p>  There is a need for a more holistic approach to bovine TB rather than blaming the badger for everything.

This has been a hugely successful programme where we have virtually halved bovine TB in Ireland.  We have less bovine TB in Ireland now than at any time since 1954 when records began.

This Bill will revoke all Government orders or secondary instruments made prior to 1821, apart from a specific list of 43 instruments being preserved.  In total the Bill expressly revokes 5,782 secondary instruments and implicitly repeals thousands of others, making it the largest ever repealing measure by express repeals in this or any other jurisdiction.  The Bill is part of a broader series of measures which have been enacted since the establishment of the statute law revision programme 13 years ago.  This Bill is clearly not the end of the process but constitutes a further milestone in the creation of a modern and accessible Statute Book and paves the way for further legislative clarity measures including the assessment of more recent legislation.  I assure the House that the statute law revision programme will be continuing its work, both on later instruments and also on reviewing Acts passed since independence in 1922.  I hope to be in a position to bring further proposals to the House in due course once that work is further advanced.

Better health care, better nutrition and greater awareness of how we are managing our own health have all contributed to this and it is something to be celebrated.  Not only are we living longer but a great many Irish people are staying healthy.  We are enjoying full and busy lives for longer than our parents or grandparents could ever have contemplated.  However, while this is something to be celebrated, longer life will unfortunately mean that more people will live long enough to develop dementia.  It is estimated that there are approximately 50,000 people with dementia in Ireland today.  These numbers are expected to increase to over 140,000 by 2041 as the number of older people in Ireland increases.  For this reason, in our programme for Government we committed to developing a national Alzheimer's and other dementias strategy to increase awareness, ensure timely diagnosis and intervention and ensure development of enhanced community-based services.<\/p><p>A research review funded by the Atlantic Philanthropies, entitled Creating Excellence in Dementia Care - A Research Review for Ireland's National Dementia Strategy, was published in January 2012.  A public consultation process to inform the development of the strategy was also conducted in 2012 and a report on the consultation was published in February 2013.  A working group representing of key stakeholders from the Department of Health, the HSE, the medical professions and the community and voluntary sectors was convened to advise on the publication of the strategy.  The working group faced a challenging task in that there was little prospect of significant additional resources becoming available.  However, an extremely generous offer by Atlantic Philanthropies to fund the implementation of key elements of the strategy has allowed us to put together a concrete implementation programme.<\/p> <p> In December 2014, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and I launched the Irish national dementia strategy, which sets out a number of principles to underpin the provision of care and supports for people with dementia.  It advises that we take account of dementia in the development and implementation of existing and future health policies.  People with dementia should be encouraged to participate in society and in their own communities as fully as possible for as long as possible.  End of life care for those with dementia should be prioritised and provided in the most appropriate setting.  All those caring for or providing services to people with dementia should be appropriately trained and supervised.  Resources should be directed to provide the best possible outcome for those with dementia, as well as for their families and carers.<\/p> <p> The strategy emphasises that most people with dementia live in their own communities and can continue to live well and to participate in those communities for far longer than many people appreciate.  A number of actions have been identified for early implementation.  Clear responsibility for dementia is to be assigned in the HSE with the establishment of a national dementia office.  Clear descriptions of care pathways and better information and guidance on services are to be made available to GPs and to people with dementia and their families and carers.  A better understanding of dementia, including modifiable risk factors, is to be promoted.  The use of existing resources is to be reviewed to ensure that they are used in the best way possible.  Research to inform the design and delivery of dementia services in Ireland should be supported and given appropriate priority.<\/p> <p> While the initial emphasis was on doing things better within existing resources, I have already mentioned the timely and very welcome boost provided by Atlantic Philanthropies which has agreed a joint initiative with the Department of Health and the HSE to implement key elements of the strategy over the period from 2014 to 2017.  The national dementia strategy implementation programme will represent a combined investment of &euro;27.5 million, with Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12 million and the HSE contributing &euro;15.5 million.  The programme will promote a greater focus on timely diagnosis of dementia and on the value of early intervention, along with the long-term objective of making people in Ireland generally more aware and understanding of the needs of people with dementia and of the contribution that those with dementia continue to make to our society.  The initiative includes the following three key elements.  First, a programme will be rolled out to provide intensive home supports and home care packages for people with dementia.  Second, additional dementia specific resources will be provided for GPs, who are the critical initial point of contact with the health system for those with dementia.  This resource material will include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points that are relevant.  The GP programme is being led by Dr. Tony Foley in Kinsale and training will be delivered in the nine community health organisations commencing in October 2015.  Third, a campaign will be pursued to raise public awareness about the issue of stigma and to promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia.  The involvement of Atlantic Philanthropies will allow us to do more of what we want to do sooner than would otherwise have been the case.  Our agreement with that organisation provides for robust monitoring, evaluation and accountability.  It will also facilitate the development of a strong evidence base to inform future policies and service design.<\/p> <p> A monitoring group chaired by the Department of Health has been established to assist with and advise on implementation of the national dementia strategy, including the national dementia strategy implementation programme.  This group includes health professionals, administrators, researchers and advocates.  In addition, the group includes a person living with dementia and a representative of those who care for people with dementia.  A draft implementation plan has been developed and was presented for discussion at the first meeting of the monitoring group on 1 April 2015.  Feedback on the plan will be considered at the group's next meeting in June 2015.<\/p> <p> The strategy acknowledges that while current health and social policy is focused on caring for people with dementia in their own homes, there will come a time for many when home care is no longer feasible or appropriate and long-term residential care is the best option.  This can be particularly acute where 24-hour care is needed or where the person with dementia is living alone.  As highlighted in the dementia services information and development centre report, A National Survey of Dementia in Long-Term Residential Care, some people need dementia specific facilities, particularly where the dementia is accompanied by behavioural and psychological symptoms such as agitation, aggression, disinhibition, wandering and sleep disturbance.  These behaviours can occur at any stage of the illness but they can pose significant challenges for staff and other patients, as well as being potentially dangerous and distressing for the person with dementia.  However, the majority of people with dementia currently reside in generic residential care facilities and a high proportion of existing nursing home residents are considered to be affected by dementia.  The national quality standards for residential care settings for older people in Ireland, which apply to nursing homes generally, were developed from this perspective.  The national dementia strategy therefore stresses the importance of residential standards generally being designed to accommodate the needs of people with dementia.  The standards require service providers to deliver a person centred and comprehensive service that promotes health, well-being and quality of life.  The nursing home resident must be the key stakeholder in service design from the outset.  Each individual should be assessed immediately before or on admission to a nursing home so that an individualised care plan can be developed and reviewed on an ongoing basis.  The care plan will set out how care is to be provided in a way that provides for the individual's wishes and health needs.  The service provider must meet residents' needs, including the needs of those with dementia.<\/p> <p> The review of the nursing home support scheme, which is due to be completed shortly, includes a general consideration of how services for the elderly are to be provided.  This will include a consideration of whether pricing for residential care can better reflect the differences in care needs that inevitably arise.  The current waiting time for people on the national placement list for funding under the nursing home support scheme improved significantly following the allocation of additional funding in two tranches this year.  The first tranche of &euro;10 million was part of an overall &euro;25 million allocated to the HSE to relieve the problem of delayed discharges from acute hospitals.  More recently the Government approved additional funding of &euro;74 million, of which &euro;44 million has been allocated to the nursing home support scheme to provide an additional 1,600 places and reduce the waiting time for approved applicants from the current 11 weeks to the previous norm of four weeks for the rest of the year.  The remaining &euro;30 million will cover the cost of additional transitional care beds through June and additional community, convalescence and district hospital beds on a permanent basis.<\/p> <p> In addition to the nursing home support scheme, the HSE supports people to leave hospital with home care services such as home help and home care packages.  Over the past number of months there has been a specific focus on the provision of home care to those in hospital requiring discharge in a timely manner.  The recipients of these home supports include many people with dementia.<\/p> <p> I regret to say that we have no cure for most forms of dementia and a diagnosis of dementia remains a challenge.  However, most people can enjoy productive, fulfilling and happy lives even after a diagnosis of dementia.  The aim of this strategy is to make sure that life is as good as possible for as long as possible for those affected by this condition.  I am determined that the strategy will be effectively implemented and that the monitoring group I have appointed will oversee this implementation to its successful completion.<\/p><p>As I have often been told, we in this country are very good at strategy.  Our weakness is implementation.  Developing implementation alongside strategy is key to how we do things in future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400011#J02100","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431598200,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to make a statement on the national dementia strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Dementia is a deeply distressing condition, both for those suffering from it and for their families.

For the strategy to become a reality, it must be implemented and must be positioned at the centre of politics and of how we approach our health service.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomed the publication of the national dementia strategy in 2014 and is committed to supporting and helping the implementation of that policy.  The Department of Health is to conduct a mid-term review of progress in 2016 and we support the call for the findings from this midterm review to be utilised to develop a revised dementia plan.  Such a revised plan must address the gaps in the current strategy, specifically, the needs of people with younger onset dementia.  The revised plan must ensure it addresses the commitment to remove age discrimination as a barrier to accessing the health system.  The strategy purports to be for everyone with dementia, but in its detail highlights services which will not apply to those under the age of 65 who suffer early onset dementia.  Similarly, there has been little focus on residential care  A recent report from Trinity College Dublin and St. James's Hospital found that only 11% of long-term residential care homes have dedicated dementia units.  It is also important that we give priority to new social and community approach to how we handle dementia and to the development of a dementia friendly community.<\/p>  <p>  There are just under 50,000 people currently living with dementia in Ireland.  The majority of people living with dementia are women , approximately 30,000 and just under 20,000 are men.  If current trends continue, this number is expected to rise to just under 70,000 by 2021 and to 132,000 by 2041.  An estimated 3,583 people - 8.6% of people with dementia - have early onset dementia, and most of these are men.  These figures do not include an additional circa 700 people who have Alzheimer type dementia associated with Down's syndrome.  Approximately 4,000 new cases of dementia arise in Ireland every year.  Local health office areas in the HSE west have the highest prevalence rates of the nine areas estimated.  Roscommon has the highest share of people with dementia, at 1.4%.<\/p>  <p>  The major increase in numbers of people with dementia in this country is likely to occur after the year 2020, with the numbers growing to between 141,000 and 147,000 by 2041.  It is estimated that the overall cost of dementia in Ireland will be in the region of &euro;1.69 billion per annum.  Some 48% of these costs are attributable to the opportunity cost of informal, mostly family support, care to those living with dementia in the community.  A further 43% of costs are accounted for by residential long-stay care, while formal health and social care services contribute to only 9% of the total costs of dementia.  A significant proportion of people with dementia are aged under 65.  It is estimated there are approximately 4,000 of these, many of whom are in their 30s or 40s.  There are 50,000 family carers in Ireland providing care to someone with dementia.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the dedication, commitment and work of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  The society makes the important point that the majority of people with dementia, over 63%, live in the community and wish to continue living in the community as a first option.  It points out that research has found that the two strongest predictors of admission to care homes are whether the older person has dementia and whether or not the family is in a position to cope and care for the onset of dementia.  The society has found that dementia-specific home care is a critical component to ensuring that people with dementia can live in the community.  It is important this House takes every stop possible to ensure people with dementia can remain in their homes.<\/p>  <p>  Experts in the field of dementia have also pointed out that the right information, support, resources and investment can help families with a member with dementia.  Timely diagnosis is identified internationally as best practice.  However, we have a shocking rate of identifying dementia and much dementia remains undiagnosed until at quite a late stage.  As the Alzheimer Society of Ireland has pointed out, without diagnosis people cannot get the information they need, cannot access the services to which they are entitled and cannot make a decision as a family about the future in respect to the dementia.  Community based dementia advisers are critical for early intervention and for helping promote the dementia awareness required in communities. This is critical in regard to how this House and society approach the onset of dementia.  Since the middle of last year, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland has funded seven dementia advisers to cover specific parts of the country.  However, this is not enough.  We need to see a greater investment and a better network set up across the country.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that dementia friendly community initiatives are developed across all communities.  I welcome the fact that in my home county of Galway, the Galway City dementia friendly initiative will see the development of key local agencies that will implement a programme of training and awareness raising actions at local level and of an initiative that will ensure we have timely claiming of supports across the community.  The initiative will provide dementia awareness training that can be rolled out across communities.  These communities will have support from resource centres, active age groups and various other community groups.  The dementia friendly initiative provides a new layer of support.  The type of supports dementia friends will provide will include supports that will ensure people with dementia get involved in community activities and organisations.  We as a society have a responsibility to take on ownership and awareness of such initiatives.<\/p>  <p> Fianna F&aacute;il is alarmed by the findings reported that only 11% of long-term residential care homes have dedicated dementia units.  The research on this area highlights the fact that at least six counties have no dementia provision whatsoever and that there are capacity issues in many of the units that cater for people with dementia.  The private sector provides the majority of residential support services.  This leaves thousands of dementia patients and their families with no option but to seek care in our hospitals.  This is inappropriate.  It is unacceptable that we rely heavily on our acute setting.  Dementia is an issue that will escalate as time goes on, because people are living longer.  The problem already exists and it is clear it will grow.  <\/p>  <p>  I was saddened by the fact the Government did not see fit to send a representative to the WHO ministerial conference on dementia.  For the first time, last March health Ministers from across the world gathered in Geneva to share policies and best practice on dealing with the increasing prevalence of dementia in our aging population.  Ireland lost out significantly by failing to send a single representative to this gathering which addressed this important issue.<\/p><p>The fact that the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, did not think it important enough to attend or to send a Government representative exposes the Government's priority in this area.  <br\/><br\/>A recent <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>article on 15 May confirmed that just one in 60 families would win with the State's new dementia strategy.  We do not have enough focused funding in this area.  I encourage the Minister to secure additional resources to roll out a more comprehensive community infrastructure in this area.  The burden of dementia is deeply distressing for those who are suffering with it and their families.  It presents a significant and growing challenge for the health system which will require best practice in terms of social and public policies and must be underpinned by resources.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400013#L00200","speaker":"1188","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431598800,"counter":144,"content":"<p>Cuirim an-fh&aacute;ilte roimh an deis caint ar an &aacute;bhar f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach seo.

T&aacute; buairt orm nach bhfuil strait&eacute;is &aacute; cur i bhfeidhm i gceart go f&oacute;ill &aacute;fach.<\/p>  <p>  I hosted a briefing by The Alzheimer Society of Ireland at the end of March which afforded those of us who attended a chance to engage with both the overarching national dementia strategy and the personal experience of caring.  I thank all those who came before Deputies, Senators and support staff on that day.  Their stories, insights and personal experiences were hugely illuminating across all of these areas.  As I said at that event, we listen today in order that we can plan for tomorrow.  That is still the case.<\/p>  <p>  There are almost 48,000 people living with dementia in Ireland today and over 60% of these individuals live in their own homes.  The concept of dementia needs to be understood as a road, as a journey, rather than just a static point, a destination.  The strategy was published in December 2014 and identifies a number of priority action areas, including better awareness and understanding; timely diagnosis and intervention; integrated services, supports and care; research and information systems; and training and education.  The strategy was published on foot of a consultative process that involved various stakeholders across the sector, including clinical and patient groups.  While it acknowledges that most people with dementia live in their communities and wish to continue to do so, more must be done to allow them to make adjustments to their homes.  Support schemes for these renovations should be extended and run beyond 2015.  Hospitals are often used to care, in the short or even the medium term, for elderly patients with dementia, despite being ill-equipped and poorly designed to provide that necessary care.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise that awareness of the condition has increased.  The number of calls to the national helpline which is run by The Alzheimer Society of Ireland increased by 20% last year.  A monitoring group, chaired by the Department of Health, is being established to assist with and advise on implementation of the strategy, including the national dementia strategy implementation programme.  Its remit is to monitor and assess progress in the implementation of the strategy.  Membership of the group includes many of the members of the advisory group established to support the development of the strategy, as well as four other members, including a representative of those living with dementia, a general practitioner, a representative of Atlantic Philanthropies and a representative of the HSE&rsquo;s national dementia strategy implementation office.  There is a particular focus on people under 65 years with dementia and the need to make hospitals dementia-friendly from admission to discharge.  This is to be welcomed.  The strategy has matched funding from the Department of Health, the HSE and Atlantic Philanthropies, with the final organisation contributing &euro;12 million of the overall &euro;27.5 million set aside.<\/p>  <p>  The national dementia strategy implementation programme will include an allocation of approximately &euro;22.1 million for the provision of intensive home supports, roughly  &euro;2.7 million for a dementia awareness programme, with funding for an education programme for GPs and primary care teams consisting of &euro;1.2 million and  &euro;1.5 million for the national dementia strategy implementation office.<\/p>  <p>  Let us look at some of the facts.  January 2015 saw the first national survey of provision for people with dementia in long-term care by the dementia services information and development centre.  Some of the areas it highlighted were as follows: 54 units, some 11%, had specialist care units for people with dementia; only 66 respite beds were available in the 54 units to cater for the needs of the 30,000 people known to be living with dementia in the community; and in HSE operated facilities only one third of nursing staff and health care attendants had been specially trained.  The Minister and I will both acknowledge how absolutely unacceptable these facts are.  Their exposure is welcome, but the fact that they reflect the current state of affairs is most concerning.<\/p>  <p>  It has been estimated that the annual cost of dementia could be in the region of &euro;1.69 billion and the average annual cost per person with dementia is some &euro;40,500.  We know that we must do the best possible for individual patients and also realise that in order to control the State spend we must support as many individuals as possible in their wish to stay in their own homes.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned about implementation of some of the elements of the strategy.  There have been reports that suggest that as few as one in 60 families who are caring for someone in their home will benefit from the national dementia strategy.  While significant sums have been pledged, most of the funds will be spent on those in need of intensive care at home.  The measures include additional home help, nursing and therapy services, house adaptations, where necessary, aids and respite care, both in the home and nursing homes.  Not everybody who has a need in this regard will benefit substantially.<\/p>  <p>  I understand Professor Suzanne Cahill, director of the dementia services centre at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, believes these services are linked with areas with \"well-known hospital overcrowding problems.\"  This, if it is the case, is a sensible approach to deal with overcrowded hospitals, but it also means that families with similar need levels are being discriminated against owing to a postcode lottery.  We also know that those with the disease at earlier ages in life are often left in the ha&rsquo;penny place.  There are no specialist services or supports for the estimated 4,000 people under 65 years with dementia in Ireland.  This issue must be addressed.  I am mindful of the recent briefing in the audiovisual room and the most wonderful insight given by a young man who is his mother's carer, a dementia sufferer in her 50s.<\/p><p> The Alzheimer Society of Ireland has been very active on the strategy and has requested that all parties, and all opinion in the House commit to the implementation of the national dementia strategy; provide ring-fenced funding for dementia; develop a follow-up strategy for dementia based on the review of the current strategy; ensure every person with dementia who requires home care has access to dementia specific care in his or her home; and ensure that everyone with dementia has access to a timely diagnosis and appropriate post-diagnosis support including, but not limited to, a dementia adviser as a minimum standard of follow-up support.  Sinn F&eacute;in fully endorses and supports these recommendations, either in opposition or in government.<\/p> <p> We need to plan effectively for the growing number suffering from dementia.  The strategy must be implemented in full.  We must examine how best to fund care and support for families and individuals affected and we must plan a follow-up strategy based on how well the current strategy has been implemented.  What is the Government planning for 2018 when the strategy will end?  We must also ensure the upskilling of GPs and reduce any stigma around the disease.  Perhaps the Minister of State has indicated what will happen after 2018, and if not, perhaps she might like to illuminate us on it in her concluding statement.<\/p> <p> The Government must continue to fund dementia research and to improve investment in care.  Carers need to be rewarded and given every support so they can help their loved one stay in familiar surroundings, if that is their choice or the safest and a manageable option.  Demographic changes and an aging population will further challenge us to come up with better treatments and care pathways to help the predicted trebling of those with dementia in the coming years.  As I have said before, we must remember, it is not just about our older loved ones.  In the years that come, it might very well be about any of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400014#M00200","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431599400,"counter":146,"content":"<p>Over the years, there has been great progress in the prevention, medication and treatment of many physical and mental illnesses.  However, two illnesses - motor neuron disease and dementia including Alzheimer's disease - have not shared in this, and they present great challenges.  Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia.  Like motor neuron disease, it is progressive and irreversible, although we hope that we will see progress on this.  It means a loss of intellectual function, chronic memory loss, language deterioration and personality change.  Like many others here, I have experienced it in my family.  I know exactly what the four aspects I mentioned mean, an I have vivid memories of my aunt, who suffered from them, and my uncle and the immediate family who were caring for her.<\/p>  <p>  The number of people living with dementia has been estimated variously at 38,000, 42,000 and 47,000.  It is scary that the female sufferers outnumber the male by two to one.  A vast majority of sufferers are cared for at home by a family member.  All too often, we see the most difficult cases, and it is reassuring to know that many people suffering from dementia continue to live well, socialise and be involved in their communities.  At events organised by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, it is reassuring to hear people with Alzheimer's disease or some form of dementia speaking of their illness and living with it.  A year or two ago, I listened to Helen Rochford Brennan from Tubbercurry talking about how she was living with dementia and making the very poignant point that memories are precious and are lost to Alzheimer's disease every day.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of the Alzheimer Society, particularly the caf&eacute;s.  I have been to two in Dublin Central, one on the Navan Road and the other in Clareville, Glasnevin, and have seen the benefit for the carers.  The society also provides social clubs and dementia advisers.  I am sure others received the letter about the scheme to support national organisations.  In June last year, the Alzheimer Society was one of 23 disability organisations which lost funding.  Because of intense lobbying, a bridging scheme was put in place until the end of this June, which is approaching quickly.  On another occasion here, I referred to the need for intellectual disability nurses to be available at accident and emergency departments for those who present with intellectual difficulties including autism, Asperger's syndrome, dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  At the best of times, accident and emergency is a very difficult and disturbing place, and it must be a nightmare for people with intellectual difficulties unless there is support for them.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland must up the tempo, given that many European countries, including Britain and France, are ahead of us.  A year ago, David Cameron said he was making dementia a priority and allocated &euro;300 million for research.  We are told that Alzheimer's disease will reach epidemic proportions within 40 years unless new therapies can be developed.  Professor Brian Lawlor, consultant psychiatrist, recently told a conference of the need to increase awareness of the illness and for more research on the cause, care and cure.  Otherwise, we will have a global health crisis.  We need to know more about how to delay the onset and progress of the illness.  We are told keeping brain, body and heart healthy and active can help to reduce the development of dementia.  There is a role for medication in delaying the progression of the illness and early detection is vital.  In my family, early detection and medication was immensely beneficial and prevented the onslaught of the illness, although there were many difficulties with the memory loss.<\/p>  <p>  It is alarming that 25% of carers are elderly, 75% are under financial strain and many find caring for somebody who suffers from Alzheimer's disease or dementia overwhelming at times.  This is where the vital respite care comes in.  I have met carers who found interaction with the HSE to be a frustrating, box-ticking exercise, for example watching television was ticked off as activity.  To spend six hours watching television is not an activity.  Others have found their engagement with the HSE much more positive.<\/p>  <p>  VHI cover for Alzheimer related illnesses, or the lack thereof, has been brought to my attention.  Sufferers are generally of advanced years and, in the majority of cases, have been paying for health cover for 40 or 50 years and have probably never made a claim.  At the point in their lives when they need it, they discover the exclusion of Alzheimer's disease.  Surely this is age discrimination.  Health insurance is a public policy matter and is subject to Government influence in general.  Given that the Minister for Health appoints the directors of the VHI, the Department of Health should have an input on this aspect.<\/p>  <p>  The home care package is much more appropriate than admitting people too early into residential care.  We accept the need for mental stimulation, which slows the rate of deterioration.  In the majority of cases, the best place for a person is at home in familiar surroundings.  I have read the criticism of the strategy's narrow focus, that it will benefit 500 particular families, and the Minister of State can take us up on this.  We know how many families need support.  The publication of the strategy is very welcome and the Alzheimer Society has been watching for it for a long time.  The question is what will happen in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Obesity, smoking and lack of exercise are recognised as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, and we are very conscious of those issues.  There is a need for joined-up thinking with the other Departments which are involved with each of the risk factors, particularly for people at a certain age.  As the Minister said, we could paper the walls of many buildings with the many strategy and policy documents, and implementation is the most important aspect.  The monitoring group, and the fact that it will not wait three years but will examine the issue in a year's time, is to be welcomed.  I am particularly happy that the group includes a person who is living with dementia and one of that person's carers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400015#N00200","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1431599400,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this very important topic that transcends politics.  It affects many families in this country and all over the world.<\/p><p>As I look around the House and the Gallery, I note we have all ages listening to this debate from schoolchildren to the elderly.<\/p> <p> Unfortunately, most families will have a member affected by dementia or Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease at some stage.  I want to contribute to this debate because I have personal experience of close family members who have suffered from dementia.  I want to put on the record my appreciation and acknowledgement of the professional health services which assisted my family and many others.<\/p> <p> I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for bringing forward this strategy and implementation plan.  It is the first strategy that will address the strong challenges dementia and Alzheimer&rsquo;s present for the individuals affected and their families.  A strategy is not worth the paper it is written on unless it is evaluated and monitored.  Accordingly, I welcome the fact a monitoring group has been established to evaluate progress under the strategy.<\/p> <p> The strategy will address several key areas, including home-care packages and supports for families affected by dementia.  It is important we keep loved ones in their family home and environment for as long as possible.  That is where they are most comfortable and stimulated most by the people they love and see every day.  This will assist them in dealing with the illness and the challenges it presents.  Another important area that will be addressed in the strategy is the resourcing of general practitioners in this area, as well as the other health professionals like practice nurses, who might identify the early signs of dementia when the person is in for a regular health check-up.  It is important GP practices, the primary contact area, are properly resourced and the staff properly trained to recognise early signs of dementia so interventions can be made at the appropriate time.<\/p> <p> Most importantly, the strategy will deal with public awareness which will help people recognise the challenges faced by people with dementia, Alzheimer&rsquo;s and brain injuries and their families.  We need to support them in as many places as possible across all sectors in society.<\/p> <p> It is important we involve all stakeholders as early as possible which includes the individuals themselves, their families, health professionals, carers and home helps, as well as the administrators and policymakers.  It is by working together that we will build capacity in our society to assist people who need help most in this area.  I especially want to commend the public health and community nurses who already work in this field, supporting families in these difficult circumstances.  Residential care is very important.  We must ensure as many resources as possible are used to keep people in their homes.<\/p> <p> I also want to acknowledge the work of bodies such as the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  Another body that is not recognised as much in this area is the Hospice Movement.  Traditionally, it has been recognised for cancer and palliative care.  However, I have seen the fabulous work of the professionals in the Hospice Movement who are now working in the area of dementia, assisting families in end-of-life situations, bringing dignity to the individuals involved and keeping people at home.  Recently in Waterford, the Hospice Movement held a day-long seminar on dementia and the challenges it presents.  I urge support be given for further seminars across the country to assist the Hospice Movement in its work.<\/p> <p> Professor John Nolan and his team at Waterford Institute of Technology are doing ground-breaking international research in diet and how it impacts on brain cells and how they deteriorate over time.  This research is at the early stage but Professor John Nolan, a young professor only in his 30s, is developing it and attracting international interest and investment.  It is focusing on how diet affects bodily function and brain nutrition, as well as how, over time, if certain supplements are included in our diet, they will help our brain cells.<\/p> <p> Day centres for the elderly are important.  I am the secretary of a community centre in my parish.  It is a key area which allows early contact, social inclusion for our elderly, as well as the possibility for early signs of dementia to be picked up.  They also provide activity, stimulus and social interaction for the elderly.  It is important these stay centres continue to be supported through subvention grants from the Health Service Executive.  Many of them would not survive if it were not for these grants and I thank the Minister of State and her Department for providing them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400015#N00300","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431600000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I am pleased that within months of just launching the national dementia strategy, we are here welcoming the actual implementation of this programme, as well as the real steps and actions it will include.  Politicians have been promising this for decades.  Today, we are really seeing progress.<\/p>  <p>  Sadly, we all know people who are living with dementia and Alzheimer&rsquo;s.  For many, their lives are changed for ever, beyond recognition of what they once were.  They should not feel isolated, alone or unsupported.  Families should not feel like they have lost a loved one when that person suffering from dementia is still alive and, in many respects, well and able.<\/p>  <p>  With the correct and sufficient provision of care and supports, people with dementia and Alzheimer's can continue to live a normal, happy and safe life in their own communities.  It is important people with dementia can continue, when possible, to live within their own communities.  This is essential for the continued happiness and well-being of both the person suffering from dementia and their families.  Often, the carer of a dementia patient is also an elderly partner.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased the national dementia strategy implementation programme will represent a substantial combined investment of &euro;27.5 million.  This will include the roll-out of a much needed programme of intensive home supports and home-care packages for people with dementia.  I urge the Minister to ensure this investment is wisely allocated and correctly used so the best possible outcome for people with dementia and Alzheimer's can be achieved.  The welcome effect of this investment should be directly felt by the people and families who to date have felt alone, unsupported and in many cases, unnoticed.<\/p>  <p>  I note this investment will go towards awareness raising, a vital point.  Too many people cast dementia off as a symptom and part of their old age, as something that is inevitable and cannot be treated or assisted with.  This should not be the case.  Help can be sought to support and help a person cope with dementia.  The problem is that so little is known about dementia.  What are the signs, at what age can it begin, are there ways of preventing it and where can one find information on it?  Does one get information from a GP or a district nurse?  Is a contact centre or assistance group better as a first call?<\/p>  <p>  Thankfully, this new programme will provide additional dementia specific resources for GPs who are the critical and initial point of contact with the health system for many people.  Training materials and guidance on local services and contact points are all vital pieces of information that need to become more widely available and well-known.<\/p>  <p>  Like all conditions, early diagnosis and intervention is key.  A timely diagnosis can make the difference in the outcome of a person's life with dementia.  This programme will thankfully promote a greater focus on timely diagnosis.  By establishing a national dementia office, we are finally giving real and fair recognition of the condition.  It will remove the stigma and offers people a point of contact.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to receiving the final implementation plan due in June and urge the Minister of State not to delay its implementation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400016#O00200","speaker":"1004"},{"type":"speech","time":1431600600,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Fitzmaurice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400017#P00100","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1431600600,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

It contains some excellent recommendations, but will it be implemented?  When I heard the figure of &euro;27.5 million mentioned, my instinctive reaction was to ask whether it would benefit people.  That is the real question and it is something of which I have yet to be convinced.  We now have a situation wherein the elderly population, which nowadays means those aged 80 and over, will rise from its current population share of 2.9% to as high as 10.2% in the coming years.  We must be prepared for such an increase.<\/p>  <p>  Over the next couple of years, the population of this island will rise to 5.3 million according to the European Commission's ageing strategy report.  Sensible planning is therefore essential and we urgently need to proceed with this strategy.  In discussing such strategies, however, we should not con people but rather ensure that everything is done properly.  <\/p>  <p>  The hypocrisy of some people in this debate when dealing with these issues must be challenged.  As an Independent Member of the Oireachtas, I will always challenge that.  For example, this morning we are talking about the dementia strategy while at the same time we have had cuts to services for adults with physical and intellectual disabilities.  Nine young adults contacted me this morning from St. Michael's House in that regard.  <\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, we learned that Tusla has cut &euro;81,000 from the budget of the Disability Equality Specialist Support Agency, which provides courses and support for families of those with disabilities.  I know it is the responsibility of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, but taking &euro;81,000 from an excellent project for adults with disabilities is unacceptable.  This is especially so in the current climate when the recovery has started.<\/p>  <p>  An even worse situation arose last week concerning a group of adults with Down's syndrome.  They have been doing an excellent educational course in Trinity College, but they are short &euro;1,000 to complete their studies.  These sums are not \"big bucks\", so we need to get our act together.  We should not exclude people with disabilities by depriving them of the services they require.  <\/p>  <p>  Dementia is characterised by a progressive cognitive impairment and is associated with the impairment of functional abilities and, in many cases, behavioural and psychological symptoms.  Many different diseases can produce the symptoms of dementia, but Alzheimer's accounts for the majority of cases and vascular dementia is the second most common sub-type.  <\/p>  <p>  Despite the strong association between dementia and old age, it is not solely a disease of the elderly.  Significant numbers within the overall dementia population are not old, including, for example, those with Down's syndrome.  I am very conscious of this as the parent of a daughter in her mid-20s with Down's syndrome.  I am also a former chairperson of the Dublin branch of Down's syndrome Ireland.  People with Down's syndrome face an increased risk in this regard, which is something we must plan for in future.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that currently there are approximately 4,000 people under the age of 65 with dementia in Ireland.  We need to plan for this situation as we can see the challenges ahead.  We must also ensure that those with disabilities receive the necessary services, so I hope the &euro;27 million will be spent wisely to provide such facilities.  It is unacceptable to cut funding for such services in any inclusive, democratic society. <\/p>  <p>  The OECD and World Bank said recently that gross income inequality is growing.  This has to be identified as a serious impediment for future economic growth.  We must deal with inequality in our society, particularly when it comes to support services.  I welcome the national dementia strategy and hope that it will be implemented because many people need the support of such services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400017#P00300","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1431600600,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Finian McGrath for sharing time with me.

There should be a premises in each town where such people could have a cup of tea and feel safe.  Community awareness of dementia through education is also required so that townspeople will take care of those affected.  In that way, an outlet can be provided for those with dementia.

I understand that &euro;15 million will be made available to the HSE for the national dementia strategy through Atlantic Philanthropies.

As the T&aacute;naiste is well aware, there are over 300,000 variable rate mortgage holders in Ireland paying, on average, 2% higher than anywhere else in Europe.  That is an extra &euro;4,000 per year that is putting an intolerable burden on many families.  If this is not addressed, it will lead to more home owners finding themselves in arrears.<\/p>  <p>  There is a German group of MPs who have been visiting the Houses for the past two days and they are in the Visitors Gallery at the moment.  They are members of the Friends of Ireland in the Bundestag and I had the pleasure of meeting them this morning.  It would not be an overestimation to say they are somewhat amazed that mortgage holders here are paying 4.5% in interest, as opposed to 2% in Germany.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, met the Governor of the Central Bank on behalf of the Government and expressed its concern at a routine meeting approximately one month ago.  The Governor indicated he would prepare a report by June.  At the time, the T&aacute;naiste said she believed a levy should be placed on banks if they did not address or reduce the variable interest rates.<\/p>  <p>  Representatives of AIB have come before the finance committee and offered a cut of 0.25%.  That is something but it is by no means enough when one considers the extent to which banks are gouging mortgage holders, as the amount they take is well above the cost of funding.  Representatives of PTSB were before the finance committee yesterday and, notwithstanding the wishes and views of members of the committee, they retorted with standard banking language, obfuscated their responsibility to the taxpayer and mortgage holders and refused to accept that they were rebuilding their balance sheets on the backs of the 70,000 mortgage holders that they have on their books with a variable interest rate.<\/p>  <p>  Today it is reported that all the Governor of the Central Bank can say to the banks is that it is advisable to reduce the variable rates to head off any political response on the issue.  That is a rather weak response from the Governor, who is somebody I respect.

Just as importantly, if she believes there should be a reduction, what will the Government do about it?  Is it just a matter of waiting until June for the report from the Governor or will the Government address the issue by imposing a levy on the banks?  They have been given adequate time and they know the concerns - they are real - of the Government.  They certainly know the concerns of this side of the House.

We had a banking collapse, which people know happened on the watch of the Deputy's party and cost the country much money.  We are in the process of recovering much of that.  Nonetheless, a strong element in the portfolio of lending built up by the banks comprises tracker mortgages on which the banks are losing money.  Part of the action of banks in their charges for standard variable rate mortgages is to seek to recover, as the Deputy suggested, costs from the losses incurred with respect to tracker mortgages.  No doubt, there may yet be action that could be taken within a European context, with the agreement of our German friends, with regard to the tracker mortgage issue that could provide some relief into the Irish banking system.  That is a wider issue and not the subject of the question.<\/p>  <p>  The standard variable rate mortgage rates are excessive in terms of cost and I have said that on a number of occasions.  In recent days, the Minister for Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank have met on mortgage issues.  I understand that at their meeting, the issue of mortgage interest rates was discussed.  There are issues for the banks both with respect to tracker and standard variable rate mortgages.  The Governor provided an update to the Minister on the ongoing research that he and his officials are carrying out on the issue of the standard variable rate charges.  The Governor and the Minister noted that the standard variable rates charged in Ireland are higher than other euro area countries and have not fallen in line with European Central Bank wholesale rates.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has submitted its research to the Department of Finance and it is expected to be dealt with in the next few days.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, and his officials will review the research ahead of meeting representatives of the six main mortgage lenders in the coming weeks.  I have advised the main banks that they need to consider their pricing policies with respect to standard variable rate mortgage holders.  If they are not inclined to listen to the difficulties that people are facing as a consequence of their pricing policies, there are other mechanisms of addressing this.<\/p><p>I have referenced that before.  Given that the Irish taxpayer bailed them out for extraordinary amounts following Fianna F&aacute;il's actions, the banks would be wise to listen to the advice in relation to their pricing policies and to provide better deals for their customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400018#Q00500","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431601800,"counter":163,"content":"<p>Sure, they are not listening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400019#R00200","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1431601800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>However, they do have a problem in relation to tracker mortgages and anyone who looks at the issue must consider all of the problems faced by the banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400019#R00300","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1431601800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for her reply and for the history lesson on the economy and how it got there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400019#R00400","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1431601800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>There was no harm in that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400019#R00500","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1431601800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Maybe we can look at a little bit of recent history.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400019#R00600","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1431601800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>It is Frankfurt's way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400019#R00700","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1431601800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>It was in case Deputy Dooley was suffering from amnesia.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400019#R00800","speaker":"1011"},{"type":"speech","time":1431601800,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I doubt that shivers are running down the spines of any bankers based on the response the T&aacute;naiste has given.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400019#R00900","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1431601800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Was that the bank guarantee?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400019#R01000","speaker":"1038"},{"type":"speech","time":1431601800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I do not think bankers feel the Government is about to impose a levy as a result of the approach they have taken in opposition to Government policy.  The T&aacute;naiste has, frankly, bought a large supply of the banks' Kool-Aid.  The notion that tracker mortgages are the root of all evil is not the case and it would be worth the T&aacute;naiste's while to look into it.  If that was the issue, one could turn to the decision that was taken at the EU Council meeting in June 2012, which the T&aacute;naiste and others hailed as seismic and a phenomenal game changer with the potential to resolve much of the legacy issues.  Within that, the overhang from the tracker mortgage issue could have been dealt with.  However, we discovered here on Tuesday that the Government never even applied to the ESM for funding under that decision as it now believes the banks are resolving the issue without recourse to the ESM.  Does the T&aacute;naiste know how the banks are doing it without recourse to the ESM?  It is on the backs of the 300,000 variable interest rate mortgage holders in the State.  The balance sheets are being repaired and the Government is preparing to sell its stake in the banks all on the backs of those 300,000 mortgage holders.  The Government needs to come clean on that.  Will the T&aacute;naiste at least reiterate the Government's previous statement to the effect that it is prepared to impose a levy on the banks if they fail to acquiesce to an appropriate rate reduction commensurate with the cost of funds today rather than in the past?

He said this against the backdrop of his visit to Portlaoise and his meeting with bereaved parents who tragically lost newborns there in recent years.  This follows his announcement last week of the establishment of a steering group to advise on the development of a national maternity strategy, which is to report by the end of the year.  Irrespective of our political views in the House, we are all deeply concerned at the series of tragic outcomes at a number of maternity units across the State, including at Portlaoise and at Cavan in my constituency.  Our thoughts are with the grieving parents and their families.  We all want to know the full facts as to why these distressing events took place and what must now be done to ensure as far as humanly possible that there are no further such incidents.<\/p>  <p>  I must ask the following in the context of what the Minister for Health said yesterday and repeated this morning at the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  It is fuelling further concern and distress at a time when we clearly have not yet got the report of the new steering group.  The Minister is being pre-emptive in suggesting the closure of any number of maternity units.  Will the T&aacute;naiste undertake to ensure that these sad, tragic and distressing outcomes are not employed to serve a programme of closures which is a long-standing objective of some within our health services?  On foot of her position in government, will the T&aacute;naiste ensure instead that all appropriate measures to address the deficiencies and needs identified out of all the reports, some of which have yet to be presented including the one on the Cavan incidents, are acted on or introduced?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400019#R04700","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1431601800,"counter":209,"content":"<p>First, I also express my sympathy with the families who lost children and who very bravely met the Minister over a prolonged period yesterday in Portlaoise.

I cannot say enough to express how sorry I am for the families and parents, in particular the mothers, involved.  Having heard the distressing news about a further death in Cavan General Hospital and considering what the mother, the parents and the family must be going through, I offer my sympathy.  <\/p> <p> Before answering Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's specific questions, we should be able to agree that the objective ought to be a health policy which focuses on the best health outcomes for mother and baby and the safe delivery of the baby.  These babies are very much wanted.  The best outcomes have to be at the core of our approach to maternity services in Ireland.  Nothing other than this as a policy will serve women and babies as well as they might be served.  It used to be said baby deaths and maternal mortality rates were exceptionally low in Ireland.  I do not know the international figures and I am not an expert in the area.  However, as almost every woman, mother and father has been shocked, I have been shocked by the repeated reports of deaths associated with maternity services.  We need to agree that the best health outcome for mother and baby is the policy we should agree. <\/p> <p> In that context, I welcome the decision by the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to have the national maternity strategy review carried out this year.  The strategy will provide the policy to underpin the women and infants health programme.  The steering group advising on the strategy met for the first time last week and I understand it had a very useful discussion.  The group is made up of people with wide experience, both in terms of personal experience and professional qualifications.  That is as it should be.  We need to agree that the core of the policy has to be one that promotes the best outcomes for mother and baby.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400019#R05000","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431602400,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has a supplementary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400020#S00200","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1431602400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>It is in total agreement that I take my second opportunity.  This has to be the case.  We cannot have a pre-emptive and prescriptive addressing of these problems and the Minister for Health's comments yesterday equated to such.  For him to suggest in the context of these tragic outcomes that maternity services at a \"number\" of so-called smaller hospitals may close is the wrong answer, one which was offered before the review group had even commenced its work.  His statement undoubtedly fits the agenda of those who are advocates of further centralisation and subscribe to the controlling obstetricians' view of child delivery.  I say \"controlling\" obstetricians rather than obstetricians in general.  I do not view expectant mothers as ill - far from it - or in need of consultant care generally.  The overwhelming number require the services and support of a midwife or midwives.  Nowhere in the eight recommendations made in the report on Portlaoise hospital is there a mention of closure.  It is within the gift of the system to address the deficiencies and needs in order to ensure a safe service for women and the child or children they are expecting.  That is absolutely what the T&aacute;naiste has said and I agree that it must at all times be the critical focus.<\/p>  <p>  I again appeal to the T&aacute;naiste because I am concerned that an agenda is being oxygenised.  She should ensure the assessment process is allowed to finish and not allow those with an agenda to seize the moment and set the scene for the closure of any number of the remaining 19 maternity units across the country.  Will she defend the right of women to access a safe service of their choice and not to be pressed against their will into heavily centralised conveyor belt child birthing settings?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400020#S00300","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1431602400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for agreeing that the best outcomes for mothers and babies are the key objective.  HIQA's Portlaoise hospital report makes eight recommendations, of which I want to pick out two.  In terms of the recommendations to the Department of Health, the third is to develop a national maternity strategy.  In terms of the recommendations to the HSE, the sixth is to develop a strong clinical network.  These are very important recommendations and, in that context, what has happened is that the Minister has developed the group to further develop the national maternity strategy.  That is the right approach because people have to sit down and look at where we are now, what are the resources and what will produce the best outcomes.  That is good and should be welcomed.<\/p>  <p>  The other recommendation is to develop strong clinical networks.  We have a long tradition in maternity services in this country which has been very good in terms of the commitment of the people who work in the services to the health of mothers and babies.  They are the obstetricians, the midwives and all others who work in the services and their commitment goes back generations.  In the case of Portlaoise hospital, what has happened - perhaps it is something that might be explored in the case of Cavan General Hospita - is that a network has been developed in the context of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  The Coombe Women and Infant University Hospital, a recognised international centre of excellence, has, as we all know, a very high number of births annually.  We know that there is a correlation, particularly when there are difficulties, between births which offer challenges to the mother or the baby and medical expertise with a high volume of experience.  We know this from other areas.  <\/p>  <p>  The relationship and protocol established by the Coombe and Portlaoise hospitals make a lot of sense and will have to be resourced.  I have had a private conversation with the Minister about the matter.  It is a good approach, but it requires resourcing.  We know in the case of Portlaoise hospital that there have been significant additional resources.  There have also been failures in the practice of what we have come to expect as a people from medical services.  Elements of it, including the management issues that arise, are under examination.  That is the right way to approach the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400020#S00400","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1431602400,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I wish to discuss the issue of children.  We have had appalling examples of mistreatment of children in the past.  We had the Magdalen laundries, the industrial schools and mother and baby homes.  We have seen abuse in families, by members of the clergy and in swimming circles.  The children involved were deprived of innocence, laughter and fun, all of which should be associated with childhood.  We have had commissions, reports and inquiries.  While life is better for the majority of children today, I can guarantee that in 20, 30 or 40 years time we will have reports, inquiries and commissions to deal with the way certain children are treated today.  I am talking about children in homeless and direct provision accommodation.<\/p><p>We are told that one third of all asylum seekers in those conditions are children.  They can be there for anything between one and seven years.  The recent first quarter report by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive was disturbing.  While there is movement out of homelessness, there is an increase in the number of people becoming homeless.  For example, there has been a 62% increase in the number of children in homeless services since June.<\/p> <p> Neither set of children is living in a natural family environment.  There are issues around safety, living in confined spaces and food, given the fact that the children are reliant on fast food with high fat content levels.  We know of the country's difficulties with obesity.  There is no space to play and there is a lack of stability, as the children are being moved from one homeless accommodation to another.  More displacement is expected because we are approaching the high tourism season.<\/p> <p> There are also issues with schools.  Either children must travel long distances to their original schools or they must move schools.  One can imagine a child entering a new school, being asked where he or she lives and replying that it is in the bed and breakfast or hotel down the road.  There is a stigma.  We are storing up severe psychological, emotional and personal developmental difficulties for these children.<\/p> <p> Recently, the Children's Rights Alliance awarded the Government a C on the question of children.  Two days ago, the European Commission repeated its call for Government action on child poverty and child care.

It is extraordinarily and exceptionally difficult for families that move into temporary accommodation such as hotels to look after their children properly.  We want families with children in homes that they can call their own and where they do not need to be in a hotel or hostel-type environment.  I agree with the Deputy that it is a very difficult situation for the children.  It is an even more difficult situation for the parents looking after them and attending to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400021#T06400","speaker":"946"},{"type":"speech","time":1431603000,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I wish to highlight a number of other aspects by referring to a home of which I know that has been providing accommodation for women who have been abused or made the difficult journey out of addiction and into recovery.  Fifteen women live in the house.  Incidentally, it is in danger of losing some of its funding.  Between the 15 women, there are 11 children who are in care.  The women are now in a position to take their children out of care and back into a family home, but they do not have accommodation.  This is another group of children who are badly affected by our housing crisis.  Perhaps the motive for those women who are on their recovery journeys out of addiction is to get their children back.  Seventeen year olds and 18 year olds are coming out of care for whom the HSE cannot access accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  I am involved with another group that works in the Dublin area with homeless women who are pregnant or have just had their babies.  The group is receiving repeated calls from maternity hospitals about taking women in, but it only has one set of premises.  One of the women who has been there for a number of months is ready to move on, but there is nowhere for her to go.  She is depriving someone with a newborn in the maternity hospital of a place with the group.  A woman from Kildare with a premature baby cannot get anyone in Kildare to accept rent supplement.  She is seeking a place in the house in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  There are 21 supported accommodation places for pregnant women or women with babies in Dublin who are homeless.  We have children in care because of homelessness.  This statistic is not being taken into account.  If we examined the cost of foster care as opposed to the cost of providing homes for people, there would probably be a cost saving.  Under the Constitution, our State guarantees protection for the family.  The family is \"indispensable to the welfare of the Nation\".  I listened to all that the T&aacute;naiste stated.  In time, those solutions will make a difference.  In the meantime, though, the reality for those in emergency accommodation like bed and breakfasts and hotels, particularly children and the other groups that I mentioned, is appalling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400021#T06500","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1431603000,"counter":282,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400021#T06600","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1431603600,"counter":283,"content":"<p>So far this year through the Department of Social Protection there have been 4,500 negotiated rent agreements in respect of which we are paying a rent supplement to new families and individuals.

As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, the Conservative Party, in its manifesto before the UK election, promised that if re-elected to government, it would scrap the Human Rights Act.  If such a development takes place, it would break the formal link between the British courts and European Court of Human Rights, and it would have very serious negative consequences for the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  As we all know, the Good Friday Agreement was endorsed in referenda in both the North and South in May 1998 and it was ratified by the British Parliament.  It is an international treaty lodged with the United Nations and both the Irish and British Governments are co-guarantors of it.  In the section of the Agreement guaranteeing the rights of minorities, the British Government specifically committed to \"complete incorporation into Northern Ireland law of the European Convention on Human Rights [...], with direct access to the courts, and remedies for breach of the Convention,  including power for the courts to overrule Assembly legislation on grounds of inconsistency\".  Can the T&aacute;naiste assure us that the Government will convey to the British Government in very strong terms that we will not tolerate any diminution in the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and that the Irish people and, I am sure, the British want to see the full implementation of it, the St. Andrews agreement and other relevant agreements that followed on from it?  Our Parliament and Government need to convey a very strong message to the British Government that there can be no unpicking of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400023#V02700","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1431604200,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I agree with the statements made during the British general election that potential changes, if implemented by the new British Government, could have significant implications for the Belfast Agreement and other agreements negotiated between the British and Irish Governments.

Therefore, any proposals that would affect key elements of the Agreement have great significance for everybody on this island but also the United Kingdom itself.  In that context, contact is ongoing between the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, the parties in the North and London, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, who has renewed her tenure of office.

The strategy has been designed to increase awareness, thereby ensuring early diagnosis and intervention.  It has also been designed to ensure enhanced and improved community-based services will be developed.  It is a stated aim of the strategy that people suffering from dementia will continue to live in their own communities and live active, healthy lives.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy lays down a number of key principles, including the need to take account of dementia in the implementation of existing and future health policies.  People suffering from dementia will be encouraged to participate in society and their own communities as fully as possible for as long as possible.  End of life care for those suffering from dementia will be prioritised and provided in the most appropriate settings.  All those caring and providing services for people suffering from dementia should be fully trained and supervised.  Resources should be directed to provide the best possible outcome for those suffering from dementia, their families and carers.  <\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to note that the HSE and the Department of Health have agreed a joint initiative with Atlantic Philanthropies in order that significant elements of the strategy can be implemented during the period 2014 to 2017.  I commend all parties involved in this initiative which will see &euro;27.5 million invested in the national dementia strategy implementation programme.  I would like to see more such initiatives in the future.  I note that a national office has been established and will be dedicated to overseeing implementation of the strategy.  A general manager and a senior project manager have been appointed.  I also note that a draft implementation plan has been developed and was recently presented for discussion at the first meeting of the monitoring group and that a final plan will be presented in June.  It is welcome that governance arrangements have been established, a monitoring group is in place and that its membership and terms of reference have been agreed.  I urge all parties involved in this process to keep up the good work and ensure the plan is implemented as soon as possible.  <\/p>  <p>  Alzheimer's disease and dementia affect families all over Ireland.  I know only too well the difficulties faced by the families and friends of those suffering from dementia.  It can be very difficult to watch a loved one suffer the effects of dementia.  I take the opportunity to mention some of the wonderful services being provided in my constituency.  The Birches Alzheimer Day Centre, Priorland Road, Dundalk was opened in June 2000 and is a great example of how a community can come together to provide worthwhile services for people suffering from Alzheimer's disease and dementia.  I must also mention the Birches Alzheimer Day Centre, Rath Abbey, Carlingford and the Drogheda day care centre at St. Laurence's Gate.  There are some brilliant support groups in operation, including the Drogheda support group and the Dundalk support group.  The Netwell Memory Clinic is available on the third Thursday of every month and part of the Alzheimer's caf&eacute; initiative.  It is an excellent service which provides a warm and welcoming space for dementia sufferers, their families and friends, as well as social and health care professionals to meet on a monthly basis to exchange ideas.  <\/p>  <p>  I praise the work done to date in the implementation of the national dementia strategy by all those involved.  I encourage them to continue their good work to ensure the plan will be fully implemented as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400025#X00200","speaker":"1068"},{"type":"speech","time":1431605400,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for her work in the provision of mental health support and identifying strategic expenditure in an area that was neglected for a very long time.  She should also be complimented on her personal commitment to dealing with the issue and her very detailed knowledge of the subject.  As is the case in any area, knowledge of a subject is of enormous help in identifying ways to deal with a problem, from which commitment follows on.  Long may the Minister of State continue her work in this area.<\/p>  <p>  All Deputies have dealt with families who have been affected by dementia.  One issue that has come to my attention recently concerns the age range of persons affected by dementia.  In some cases, very young people have been afflicted by it, by which their families are taken aback and shocked.  In that context, I must refer to the importance of identifying best practice in so far as possible, not necessarily with a view to prevention but to at least addressing the issues that seem to cause dementia.  The Minister of State identified some of them and they are important in the context of what must be done.<\/p>  <p>  It was brought to my attention some time ago that Omega 3 had been hailed as an important element in a person's diet, but it was then discovered to be carcinogenic.  As Deputies, we cannot advise on such an issue because we do not have the information required to give a considered opinion.  In that context, I ask that all relevant information that would be of help to those who wish to follow a dietary regime that is complementary to good mental and physical health be put into the public domain.  This is particularly important for those families with a history of dementia or Alzheimer's disease.  <\/p>  <p>  Mention was made of the importance of exercise.  It is important that people realise adequate exercise does mean running ten miles every morning.  We all need a reasonable amount of exercise which has been proved, beyond doubt, to be an essential part of a healthy lifestyle, with a healthy diet.  A good diet and sufficient exercise will ensure the brain and the body will remain active and work well together.  In the context of the promotion of the proposals contained in the national dementia strategy, I ask the Minister of State to ensure the best advice is made available to the general public through the widest variety of media outlets.  This will allow people to take whatever action is necessary to improve their health.  <\/p>  <p>  I compliment The Alzheimer's Society of Ireland on its work.  A long time ago I sat on a health board and a colleague was one of the first to bring Alzhiemer's disease to attention.  He spread the word in a very simple and meaningful way.  He spoke about having the illness and the fact that it would not go away.  In bringing the disease to the attention of the general public he did a great service, particularly in identifying the early stages of dementia.  This was very influential in the formation of the health policy the Minister of State has brought to the fore and is implementing.  <\/p>  <p>  A great deal more remains to be done, a point on which I know the Minister of State agrees with me.  In that context, great commitment at ministerial level is required.<\/p><p>It is crucial that a diagnosis is made at the earliest possible stage and that dementia associated illnesses are dealt with a meaningful way.  From time to time we hear about behaviour that appears to be at variance with the normal behaviour of individuals with whom we are familiar.  That seems to indicate a change in their mental attitudes which requires early attention in terms of medication or other treatment.  We have all dealt with people whose relatives have shown sudden signs of aggression or behaviour that is out of character.  It is not always easy to access suitable treatment or diagnostic services.  I hope we can put in place the measures necessary to allow us to identify at an early stage behaviour that gives rise to concern among family members.  In some cases, an early diagnosis can prevent loss of life or the onslaught of an illness.<\/p> <p> I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for the commitment she has shown on this issue.  I recognise, however, that the magnitude of the issue will continue to grow for some time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400025#X00300","speaker":"957","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431606000,"counter":445,"content":"<p>Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60% to 80% of cases.  Its onset is most common in individuals aged 65 years and older, although people in their 40s and 50s can also develop early onset Alzheimer's disease.  Although it is one of the leading causes of death, there is, unfortunately, no way to prevent it, cure it or slow its progression.  Extensive research carried out in recent years, particularly in the USA, has produced some promising medical advances and drug trials, but we have not yet seen a successful breakthrough formula.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 36 million people live with dementia worldwide.  In Ireland an estimated 50,000 people are likely to have dementia.  It is likely that the incidence of dementia will increase significantly in the future given our ageing population.  We need to plan services in a strategic and coherent manner and in so doing we can learn from countries that have well developed policies and national strategies.  The national dementia strategy is a major step forward in the delivery of services and supports and emphasises that most dementia patients can continue to live well and participate in their communities.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for her contribution to the development of the strategy.  I acknowledge her commitment and that of the Minister for Health to rolling out the strategy at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health, the HSE and Atlantic Philanthropies have pledged funding for an investment programme of intensive home supports, home care packages and dementia specific resources for GPs who are crucial as a first point of contact.  I also welcome the measures aimed at raising public awareness, addressing stigma and promoting inclusion and involvement in society.  It is important that we implement all elements of the strategy in an urgent timeframe.  In the light of the gradual improvement in the economy and Exchequer returns, it is imperative that we prioritise the roll-out of the strategy, with delivery of the action plan for GPs to access specialist services.  Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for patients.  Staff training and development programmes for carers and emergency department staff are important in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that approximately 26,000 dementia patients are living at home with the help of family carers.  Evaluations suggest the number of family care givers to dementia patients is as high as 50,000.  These care givers are central to the community care system but few of them receive financial compensation from the State by way of a carer's allowance or social welfare benefits.  It is not easy work, but it is a labour of love for the individuals concerned.  They need more recognition, support and relief for this intensive work.  Families also want to be more closely involved in the process of caring, including making decisions about the services needed to help them in their care giving roles.  In the absence of the required level of community care supports, a key element of the strategy will be a more formal partnership between family care givers and the institutional system of care.  Families face a heavy burden in providing care around the clock and preventing their relatives from being placed in long-term care institutions prematurely.  Patients are more comfortable within the home environment where this is possible.  We should strive to ensure this will continue for as long as possible, with support from community and health services.<\/p>  <p>  Evidence from other countries suggests a significant proportion, up to 25%, of older people admitted to hospitals have dementia, but we lack reliable data for the prevalence of dementia in Irish hospitals.  As dementia is often hidden in the community, it may remain undetected following admission to hospital.  Even when older people are admitted through accident and emergency departments, dementia is often overlooked in assessments.  This a cause of concern because the reasons given for admitting patients with dementia are often other age related complaints rather than the patient's social circumstances such as a breakdown of care giving arrangements.  The hospital experience can be frightening and disturbing for an individual with dementia who needs a consistent and stable environment that reinforces self-identity and personhood.  The hospital setting, with its multiple and competing stimuli, is far from ideal for patients suffering from severe cognitive impairment.  General hospital staff do not always have the necessary skills and expertise to provide dementia care.  One Irish study revealed that only 5% of junior hospital staff had received dementia care training in recent years.  Caring for patients suffering from dementia who exhibit challenging behaviour such as aggression, paranoia, hallucinations or sleep disturbance can be particularly difficult for hospital staff.<\/p><p> Once admitted to hospital, people with dementia often have worse outcomes than older people without that affliction.  Evidence suggests the length of stay of dementia patients in hospitals is longer and costlier and that patients are more likely to be discharged to a residential care setting.  These patients are also known to have a higher rate of other illnesses and higher mortality rates and they often acquire new dependencies as a result of being inactive for prolonged periods.<\/p> <p> In other countries, including Scotland, the United States and Australia, innovative approaches have been adopted towards the care and treatment of people with dementia in hospitals.  These include the development of dementia champion programmes, which include the appointment of specialist staff within the hospital with a dementia remit.  These are qualified staff who take ownership of patients with dementia in hospitals and who help raise awareness of dementia and encourage a more person-centred approach to care.  Other approaches used internationally include outreach and community based specialist dementia services which reduce the risk of hospital admission for people.  There are many reasons hospital staff should be aware of whether patients have dementia, not least the fact that patients admitted with dementia are at an increased risk of developing delirium.  A dementia champion programme in general hospitals would facilitate more awareness of dementia care in such a challenging environment.<\/p> <p> There is a need to develop better hospital patient information systems that will yield data that will more accurately reflect admissions, readmissions, length of stay and discharge of people with dementia from hospitals.  We need a major review of the care of patients with dementia in general hospitals in Ireland.  We also need more awareness of the signs of dementia, which are often not very visible.  Specific training should be provided for staff in that regard.  Staff should be upskilled in the recognition of symptoms and in the communication of this information to other staff so as to improve the provision of dementia friendly care in the hospital setting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400026#Y00200","speaker":"1050","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431606600,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I will not recycle any of the contributions made by other Members.  I commend the Minister of State on the speed with which this strategy was put together and commend her, the Department, those who worked with her and the various shareholders on confronting this condition.  I find the critique of the Minister of State's announcement today rather begrudging as until now there has been nothing of the measure of this strategy, which was promised in the programme for Government.  This is an important day for individuals affected by dementia.  We are all aware of the ongoing effect of dementia on families.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned that the stigma attached to dementia is a serious problem in this country.  It is good she has highlighted this.  We must overcome this stigma, because dementia is not a condition that is going to disappear.  People are living longer and we now have a larger population of older people.  This trend will continue and a greater part of the older population will suffer from this condition.  Dementia does not affect all people the same way and can be more extreme for some.<\/p>  <p>  This is an historic day.  The strategy is now in place, but implementation is another issue.  We all wish we were in a different place in terms of financial resources, but it is important to make a start on the journey to provide the best quality of life to the greatest number of people afflicted by this condition.  I commend the Minister of State and those around her who have brought us to this stage today.

We called for a debate on the issue some time ago, so I thank it for this response.  There is significant interest on the part of all parties in this issue and in the need for the strategy to be implemented.  We understand the challenge facing the Government in the context of resources, but the strategy should be prioritised in terms of resources.  We need commitment and determination to ensure the strategy is implemented in full.<\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the call for the findings of the midterm review to be utilised to develop the revised dementia plan.  Earlier this morning, in another context, we discussed the need to learn from assessment of what does or does not work and should continue to implement what works best when developing any strategy.  We should also try to reduce the impediments to development.  At times when developing strategies, we are inclined to compartmentalise them and separate them from the rest of the health services.  This strategy is dependent on the health services in general being able to deliver on the needs of people with dementia.<\/p>  <p>  There are approximately 47,000 people with dementia living in Ireland, most of them women.  Approximately 30,000 are women and 17,000 are men.  If the current trend continues, the number of people with dementia is expected to rise to almost 70,000 by 2021, but what is even more alarming is that we could have 130,000 dementia sufferers by 2041.  This may seem a long way down the road, but it is critical we start to plan in advance how to provide assistance and support to this huge cohort of people.  We need to plan how to provide all the services required to ensure people with dementia have support.<\/p>  <p>  When talking about strategies, a key issue is the complementary systems in place that need to be augmented and reinforced.  We talk about primary care and independent, supported and assisted living in the home.  These all need to be put in place to ensure we have continual, evolving support for the huge cohort of people we expect to have living with dementia in Ireland by 2041.  This will require a determined effort on the part of the Government, particularly in view of the fact that 2041 appears to be a long time away.  It is a natural phenomenon in the Oireachtas that priority is given on an electoral cycle and individuals here and Departments do not get recognition for longer term strategic planning.  This is an inevitable consequence of our electoral system.  Therefore, it takes bravery and determination on the part of Ministers and Departments to follow through and plant the seeds of a long-term strategy, although they may not benefit from the consequence.  I am not saying this is true in regard to everything a Minister does, but the system corrals people into planning for the short and medium term, despite the challenges to be addressed in the long-term in regard to the increase in the number of people who will be living with dementia.  The strategy is clear and highlights what needs to be done and the actions already in place.<\/p><p>When I met with the Alzheimer Society I made a suggestion for additional resource centres.  We need community centres to support people to live independently in the community for longer.  We could be imaginative in how we use the resources we already have in our communities such as GAA clubs, soccer clubs and rugby clubs, which all have fine facilities but are probably not being used in early midweek.  A lot of them have been grant-aided by the State with sports capital grants over the years and could be used as day centres where people could come and meet clinicians, specialists and peers to talk and otherwise interact.  In the next number of years there will be huge challenges to capital programmes and I do not expect day centres can be built in every parish or community.  However, they already exist in the shape of these sports centres.  If the necessary infrastructure was in place in terms of personnel to support the voluntary sector we could open up these facilities.  We have spoken about day centres, health centres and resource centres but a lot of the bricks and mortar is already in our communities and we should interact with organisations such as the GAA, soccer clubs, rugby clubs and maybe even schools to make this come about.<\/p> <p> Many more younger people will have dementia in the coming years, which is something we may not have addressed as a society.  We need to keep people as active as possible and we should support people with dementia in remaining with their families.  We should also help the families with a member who has contracted dementia.  Fear often affects a person and that person's family when there has been a diagnosis of dementia or another neurological disease.  We have to ensure there are strong supports in such cases and provide information and reassurance to people that they will not be left alone to deal with their issues.  This is outlined in the strategy.  I have referred to the suggestion that dementia awareness training be rolled out to local communities and accommodation will be needed for that, as it is for resource centres, active age groups and various other community groups.  It is in such a context that we could look at sporting organisations because there are many GAA clubs today which will not see any activity until 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. when they start their training programmes and matches.<\/p> <p> I was alarmed by the findings of the study which stated that only 11% of long-term residential care homes have dedicated dementia units.  We know that huge challenges face residential units in general with the new HIQA regulations, the fact that we have an ageing demographic profile and a projected increase in the numbers with dementia in the years ahead.  We have to be brave in how we tackle this issue.  We discussed how we deal with the existing demographic profile in the discussion on care for the elderly and we need to tackle this in a non-partisan and non-political way.  It should not be for the benefit of Deputy Billy Kelleher or the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, but of society. We need to work out how we fund and put in place the resource infrastructure to care for elderly people.  <\/p> <p> The review of the fair deal is ongoing but it is going to be a huge challenge for us and we need to be honest and upfront with ourselves about how we fund care for the elderly in the years ahead.  We have spoken about the need for increases in peoples' contributions but we cannot pretend that the State can indefinitely fund this out of current expenditure on an annual basis.  We have to be brave and set up some mechanism to ensure there is sufficient funding on a multi-annual basis so that we can plan ahead and an individual with dementia, as well as the population in general, can know what contributions they will have to make.<\/p> <p> There needs to be an assurance that whatever facilities are in place meet the required standards.  HIQA has set a benchmark and we must continue that standard of care for our elderly people.  We saw what happened to people with intellectual disabilities in &Aacute;ras Attracta and that could very easily happen in the case of older people and those with dementia.  In increasing capacity in community and residential long-stay facilities we must ensure standards are in place and an inspection process exists to ensure they are maintained.<\/p> <p> There is huge goodwill in our communities towards the idea of voluntary work, which we see even in those who volunteer to canvass for candidates in elections, such as the Minister of State or myself.  Other people get involved in meals on wheels or community associations such as Older and Bolder, and volunteerism is an important component across the whole spectrum of society.  It is a critically important component of how we structure and support society and how we support communities and individuals within the community.  There has been huge pressure on the funding programmes for voluntary organisations because there have been consistent reviews of overlapping areas to ensure that we have good administration systems and that any funding goes directly to the services for which it is intended.<\/p> <p> We need to ensure that volunteers are supported and assisted in delivering care, no more so than in the area of dementia and other neurological illnesses and diseases.  In commending the new strategy I insist that its implementation be consistently monitored and that we be brave in planning a strategy not just for a horizon of 2015 or 2016 but well beyond that, so that people in the early stages of the disease know that support and services will be available to them after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400027#Z00300","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431607200,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I welcome the new national dementia strategy announced by the Minister and I acknowledge her commitment to changing the way older people are looked after in our society.  I recognise also that it has been put together initially in a very difficult economic climate and as things improve I hope and expect that the strategy will expand and there will be more funding available to look after our people.<\/p>  <p>  We have a large number of people who will have dementia in the future.  At the moment 12% of our population are over 65 and, by the year 2046, 25% - that is one in every four - will be over 65.  Clearly, a significant number of these will have dementia issues, whether it is in the initial stages or longer-term.  The number of people with dementia will double over the next 30 years.  Internationally, in 2010 there were 36 million people with dementia but by 2030 the world estimate is 66 million.  It is a huge problem that has a personal, emotional, financial and social impact on all of us and on all society.  We need to change many things in our country to deal with it.  When I meet people with dementia, in many cases I find families or individuals who are invisible, isolated in their community and socially excluded.<\/p><p>Their families are worn out and strained, and are working 24-7 to look after them.  The lack of care the community is offering them in their homes has a major negative impact.<\/p> <p> Some two weeks ago I met a lady in her mid 70s who is dealing with her husband, who is in his 80s.  He is doubly incontinent and suffers from serious dementia, and she was offered a princely amount of 18 minutes of home care help per day, one and a half hours per week.  It is a disgrace and I condemn the policies that do not provide adequate home care to people who need it.  There have been cuts and we have been through a very difficult time, however we must prioritise home care packages.  The lady's house was in a state of bedlam and was in bits.  Her life had been shattered and she had no help, nothing at all.  I was shocked and dismayed.  I will give another example of a daughter who is looking after her mother who is suffering from dementia.  Her father, who is in his mid 70s, is also very unwell with a heart condition.  The lady, God bless her, is very active in her dementia state and is up and down the stairs all night repeatedly.  Both these carers are at their wits' end.<\/p> <p> People in Alzheimer's care centres say they do not have enough money.  In Dundalk, the budget has been reduced by 5% and this has a major negative impact on the people who are entitled to the care but do not receive it.  The same applies in Drogheda, where the members of the Drogheda Alzheimer Society are at their wits' end trying to provide better services for an increasing number of people.<\/p> <p> How do we change the situation?  While the dementia strategy is one way of starting it, there is a more fundamental principle, which the Oireachtas should establish, namely, an entitlement to home care and home help by statute, which does not exist.  We should have legislation that guarantees that people are entitled to the care, just as much as they are entitled to benefit from the fair deal if they need to go into long-term care.  We have got it the wrong way around.  We are spending billions of euro on putting people into nursing homes, while many of them should not go there until they reach a much higher stage of dependency, but do so because of the lack of community supports.  That is wrong.  The lady who is trying to look after her husband told me she would have to put him into a nursing home, although she did not want to do so.  She just needs help to look after the person she loved and who loved her all her life.<\/p> <p> We need to change the way we address this.  We need much more home support and to use modern technology.  In the Great Northern Haven apartments in Dundalk, there is an experiment whereby older people live in the apartments and have technology that notifies a carer, who is attending 24-7, if they get up at night or leave a window open or a tap on.  When they wake up in the morning they can use a laptop or iPad to communicate with a health care worker and verify that they have taken their medication.  We need to change our local authority houses to use more technology to provide support to keep people in their homes.<\/p> <p> The public health nurse is the real hero of our society.  In every case I encounter, the public health nurse is the first person who helped the person, as best they could.  Good care costs a lot of money.  The policy in Norway is to make the most of the good days.  We can make the most of the good days for our people who suffer from dementia by keeping them happy at home for as long as we can.  The last place they should go is a nursing home.  They should go there only when all other home care supports have been exhausted or failed.  We need a bill of rights for our elderly identifying the promises we will fulfil in looking after them.  There are plenty of examples from states around the world available on the Internet.  If people have statutory entitlement to community care, a bill of rights identifying how older people are treated and protocols in place for them, it will change the way things happen.<\/p> <p> I had a meeting with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda regarding putting protocols in place for people who are suffering from dementia and who are admitted to an acute hospital.  Such a person needs to be looked after specially and staff need to know how to treat them, given that many of them cannot talk or express what they feel or they are confused.  We need these protocols in place now on a national basis.  We received attention from the very top of the HSE.  The quality of care for people suffering from dementia in some of our institutions is disgraceful.  I have here dozens of complaints made to HIQA regarding the quality of care of people suffering from dementia.  In many cases, there are not enough staff on duty to look after them.  In some cases, sadly, they are treated disgracefully.  I am waiting for a Bill of mine to come up in the lottery for debate on a Friday sitting.  As backbencher, one hopes to make the lottery.  My Bill will change the 2007 Act by giving statutory powers to HIQA to go into a home immediately to investigate a complaint that a person suffering from dementia is being assaulted.  This cannot happen under the current legislation.<\/p> <p> I spent the past few hours, with the assistance of the Minister's office, dealing with a family whose family member died in disgraceful circumstances in a HSE institution.  The patient did not have dementia as such.  The family complained to HIQA that they were unhappy with the care their relative was receiving.  Nothing happened, and he subsequently died in disgraceful, shameful circumstances.  I acknowledge the Department's commitment to get to the bottom of it.<\/p> <p> This is just the beginning of the debate and I welcome the initiation of the strategy.  However, we are not at the races if we do not look after people in their communities and homes and invest much more money in it.  I accept that the degree of care the people need is a very complex issue.  This week, the country is examining how we treat our people when they come into the world, and the tragic circumstances of the deaths of many babies, six or seven, in Portlaoise.  We are also considering the appalling and disgraceful treatment of people suffering from dementia and how it can change.  The two debates are equally important and, hopefully, they will get equal time and attention from the House and the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400028#AA00400","speaker":"1069","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431607800,"counter":452,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of the national dementia strategy and acknowledge the work of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, the former Minister, Deputy Reilly and particularly the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.

Its publication in December was both necessary and welcome because, as the country&rsquo;s age profile increases, so too does the problem of dementia.  Ireland&rsquo;s population is aging as evidenced during the debates on the fair deal scheme.  There will be nearly 1 million people aged over 65 by 2031, an increase of more than 86% or an extra 20,000 people per annum.  I commend the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for their efforts on the fair deal scheme.  It is a natural consequence that dementia will become an increasing problem that needs to be planned for with proper structures and supports put in place.<\/p>  <p>  We all know of the great work done by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and Western Alzheimers in Ballindine, County Mayo.  However, demands for their services are increasing but their resources are limited, meaning they have to come up with new strategies for fund-raising.<\/p>  <p>  The increased projected figures for dementia given by NUI Galway and Trinity College Dublin are startling.  They suggest the number of people with dementia in the coming years could be as high as 94,000 by 2031 and 132,000 by 2041, three times higher than it was in 2011.  This highlights the need for this dementia strategy.  I was also surprised to learn dementia is a condition that affects younger people with almost 4,000 people under the age of 65 with the condition.  This is an exceptionally vulnerable group of people about which little is known.  They come under the radar and very few of them use community services.  That is not surprising as they do not easily fit into service systems and structures designed for older people.  This has implications for the individuals and their families because much of their care is done at home.<\/p>  <p>  An estimated 50,000 family carers are looking after someone with one of six specified symptoms of dementia.  Research shows that two thirds of all long-stay residents have dementia but many of them do not have a formal diagnosis.  This brings on high stress levels among carers which are high by international standards.<\/p>  <p>  The services in place for dementia are limited.  As Deputy Kyne said, in Galway up to 2,700 people have dementia with 1,800 people in County Mayo.  There are pockets of areas in these counties, such as in west Galway, where respite care services, for example, are not available.  There is much work to be done.  The strategy is a good start but it needs to be progressed as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The overall cost for caring for dementia patients is enormous, a point which outlines the challenge facing us.  I was surprised to learn that dementia is a very costly condition given its duration, as people can live for a long time after diagnosis, its disease burden and the level of disability associated with the illness over time.  In fact, the overall societal cost of dementia exceeds that of coronary heart disease, cancer and stroke combined.  Analysing the financial cost of dementia what is particularly striking is the fact that almost half, 48%, of the overall costs of dementia are borne by family and friends who provide the much needed care services required.  A further 43% is accounted for by care in long-stay settings, while formal health and social care services contribute only 9% of the total costs of dementia.  The average cost per person with dementia is estimated at &euro;40,500 per annum.<\/p>  <p>  It will be a significant challenge.  However, our elderly people deserve to be looked after and the services and supports need to be put in place so they and their families can have comfort in their retired years.  As we are all on the train to that stage of life, it will affect us all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400030#CC00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1431608400,"counter":455,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I welcome the Government&rsquo;s launch of the national dementia strategy which is important to the many people who suffer from this difficult disease, a disease which is also difficult for their families.  Families are often confused by it and the sufferer can also be upset.  There is a fear factor around the whole area of dementia.  We should endeavour to relieve this that by disseminating information on assistance.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on its excellent work in assisting people who suffer from Alzheimer&rsquo;s and their families.  It works across the country in the heart of all communities providing dementia specific services and advocating for the rights and needs of all people living with dementia and their carers.  Its vision is an Ireland where no one goes through dementia alone and where policies and services respond appropriately to the person with dementia and their carers at the times they need support.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the development of a national Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other dementias strategy to increase awareness, ensure timely diagnosis and intervention and develop enhanced community-based services.  The strategy sets out several principles to underpin the provision of care and supports for people with dementia.<\/p><p>These include taking account of dementia in the development and implementation of existing and future health policies, encouraging the participation of people with dementia in society and in their own communities as fully as possible for as long as possible, the prioritisation of end-of-life care in an appropriate setting for those with dementia, and appropriate training and supervision for all those caring for or providing services to people with dementia.  In addition, the strategy directs resources to provide the best possible outcome for those with dementia and their families.<\/p> <p> Dementia or old age should not control people's lives and rob them of what is so valuable to them, privacy and dignity.  Central to the strategy announced by the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, last December is something that is characteristically taken away from people living with dementia - that is, awareness.  We want to increase awareness of dementia in the community so that we can act faster and more smartly to ensure early diagnosis, treatment and all-important supports, particularly with community-based services.   <\/p> <p> It is estimated that there are approximately 50,000 people with dementia in Ireland today.  These numbers are expected to increase to more than 140,000 by 2041 as the number of older people rises.  I have also met some younger people with Alzheimer's, so it does not always respect age and consequently is not just an issue affecting the elderly.<\/p> <p> The strategy emphasises that most people with dementia live in their own communities and can continue to live well and participate in those communities for longer than many people appreciate.  The strategy distinguishes between those actions that can be progressed within existing resources and others to be addressed as more resources become available.<\/p> <p> Those identified for first implementation include that clear responsibility for dementia will be assigned within the HSE.  In this regard, a dedicated office of specialist services for older people has been established within the HSE to support the strategy's implementation.  Clear descriptions of care pathways and better information and guidance on services will be made available to GPs, as well as to people with dementia, their families and carers.<\/p> <p> A better understanding of dementia will be promoted, including modifiable risk factors.  The strategy also promotes the use of existing resources to be reviewed to ensure that they are used in the best possible way.  Research will be promoted to inform and design the delivery of dementia services in Ireland in order to be supported and given appropriate priority.<\/p> <p> The term dementia was used for generations concerning memory loss, but it is not a specific disease itself.  Dementia describes a group of symptoms affecting memory, thinking and social abilities severely enough to interfere with daily functioning.  Dementia indicates problems with at least two brain functions, such as memory loss and impaired judgment or language, and the inability to perform some daily activities such as paying bills or becoming lost while driving.<\/p> <p> Though memory loss generally occurs in dementia, memory loss alone does not mean that one has dementia.  A certain extent of memory loss is a normal part of ageing.  Many causes of dementia symptoms exist.  Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of progressive dementia.  Some causes of dementia may be reversible with treatment.<\/p> <p> The common symptoms include declining memory loss.  Short-term memory loss is the most common early symptom of dementia.  People with ordinary forgetfulness can still remember other facts associated with the thing they have forgotten.  For example, they may briefly forget the next door neighbour's name, but still know the person they are talking to is their next door neighbour.  A person with dementia will not only forget the neighbour's name but also the context.<\/p> <p> People with dementia often find it hard to complete familiar everyday tasks.  For example, a person with dementia may not know how to get dressed or how to prepare a meal.  Occasionally, everyone has trouble remembering the right word, but a person with dementia often forgets simple words or substitutes unusual words, thus making their speech or handwriting hard to understand. <\/p> <p> We may sometimes forget what day it is or where we are going, but people with dementia can become lost in familiar places, such as the road where they live.  They can forget where they are or how they got there and may not know how to return home.  They may also confuse night and day.  Those with dementia may dress inappropriately, wearing several layers on a warm day, or very few on a cold day.  They may also find it difficult to follow conversations or keep up with paying their bills. Anyone can temporarily misplace his or her wallet or keys.  A person with dementia, however, may put things in unusual places, such as an iron in the fridge or a wristwatch in a sugar bowl.  <\/p> <p> Everyone can become sad or moody from time to time.  A person with dementia may become unusually emotional and experience rapid mood swings for no apparent reason.  Alternatively, a person with dementia may show less emotion than is usual.  A person with dementia may become suspicious, irritable, depressed, apathetic, anxious or agitated, especially in situations where memory problems are causing difficulties.  At times, everyone can become tired of housework, business activities or social obligations but someone with dementia may become very passive, sitting in front of a television for hours or sleeping more than usual.  They may also appear to lose interest in hobbies.<\/p> <p> The Department of Health and the HSE have agreed a joint initiative with Atlantic Philanthropies to implement significant elements of the strategy proposed over the period 2014 to 2017.  We look forward to the roll-out of the programme.<\/p> <p> I congratulate the Minister of State once again for the work she is doing in all four areas within her remit.  In this case, the work to provide services for the elderly is being undertaken in difficult circumstances.  This is because the economy has put a lot of pressure on services to all areas. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400030#CC00300","speaker":"1056","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431609000,"counter":457,"content":"<p>Approximately 44,000 people in Ireland are currently living with some form of dementia.  That number if expected to reach nearly 104,000 by 2037.  More than 50,000 carers are also affected as each day they care for their loved ones who need that extra support.<\/p>  <p>  Dementia is the umbrella term for a variety of conditions that can cause the brain to fail.  The World Health Organisation describes dementia as a syndrome due to disease of the brain, usually of a chronic or progressive nature, in which there is impairment of multiple higher cortical functions.  Alzheimer's disease is a form of dementia that represents the majority of cases.  What Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia have in common is a high risk of behavioural disorders, including changing personalities and acting out of character.<\/p>  <p>  The World Health Organisation's definition means that functions such as memory, orientation, comprehension, emotions and judgment may be affected in a person with dementia.  It is important to remember that Alzheimer's is a medical condition and a disease of the brain.  If the brain affects thought, feelings, personality and behaviour then Alzheimer's will affect how a loved one thinks, feels and what he or she does.<\/p><p>The range of symptoms can be enormous.  People with Alzheimer's disease do not necessarily look sick.  Although it is a physical illness, it often does not affect a person's appearance until the later stages of the disease.  I welcome the work completed to date in putting a national dementia strategy into being.  The Department of Health, together with the HSE, has agreed a joint initiative with Atlantic Philanthropies to implement significant elements of the strategy over the period 2014-17.  This programme will promote a greater focus on timely diagnosis of dementia and on the value of early intervention, along with the long-term objective of making people in Ireland generally more aware and understanding of the needs of people with dementia and the contribution that those with dementia continue to make to our society.<\/p> <p> People with dementia must be encouraged to participate in society and should be enabled to stay within their communities for as long as possible.  I am delighted this Government, in conjunction with the HSE, recognised this fact in the case of Clarecastle day care centre's dementia unit.  In late February 2013, following a near ten-year campaign, operational funding and recognition was finally given to the dementia-specific unit operating in the centre.  The centre in Clarecastle is a purpose-built dementia day care facility that provides services for persons with mild and moderate dementia.  I want to put on the record my thanks to the former Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, and Mr. Bernard Gloster, the area manager in the HSE, who took on board my representations and that of the local community and the board of Clarecastle day care centre.  The dementia service in Clarecastle augments the provision of day care for elderly persons and it has operated at the site since 1999, catering for over 250 persons per week.  The Clarecastle facility services a ten-mile radius and a population of over 50,000 people.<\/p> <p> The service delivered in Clarecastle represents exceptional value for money while also offering precious respite for carers.  The dementia services delivered in Clarecastle day care centre should be further enhanced, as there is a capacity to do so.  Such a model of care should be replicated in other communities right across the country and such day care services for mild, moderate dementia patients should form a key part of the national strategy.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on her work and I look forward to the strategy being further developed and brought into being in the coming months and years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400031#DD00200","speaker":"975","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431609600,"counter":459,"content":"<p>I thank everyone who made a contribution, and this is clearly an issue in which everybody should have an interest.  I was looking at the people who came and went from the Visitors Gallery today.  Some were very small, aged between three or four years of age while others were in mid-childhood and their mid-teens.  This in addition to the young adults and those of us who have gone past all those age groups.  It is significant that what we are doing with the dementia strategy will affect each and every one us, whether it is as carers, people in our community or as people who suffer from the condition.<\/p>  <p>  I will reply to some of the contributions, as many people raised the same issues.  The &euro;27.5 million in funding is significant and it will be divided, with mostly home-based delivery.  Everybody agreed on this and we were urged to follow this route.  Most of it will be delivered in the community and home.  It will concern the raising of awareness, as everybody mentions, and there will be a significant element relating to research as well.  Most people who know me see me as an optimist by nature.  Some days, as a politician, the only way to get through the day is by being optimistic.  The type of research being done on the types of dementia will ensure that although we may never find a cure - it is a degenerative process of ageing and as we live longer, certain parts of the body break down - we will find mechanisms to slow down the progress of the condition and stop the onset.  That is why early diagnosis, which is a central part of this strategy, will be very important.<\/p>  <p>  In my city there is research in St. Finbarr's hospital on ageing and how we age.  Trinity College, Dublin, is carrying out TILDA, the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing.  Many people have mentioned the issue of people with Down's syndrome and the fact that they develop dementia at a much younger age than the rest of the population.  Within the private sector, there is research going on in pharmaceutical companies.  All the research will have a significant effect on the sort of forecasting we are looking at.  With the help of Atlantic Philanthropies, there is a development in St. James's Hospital of a centre of excellence for successful ageing.  All that intervention and focused approach, along with the dementia strategy, will have an impact.<\/p>  <p>  I listened very carefully to what Deputy O'Dowd has said.  As I listened, I thought that we all want Scandinavian-type services but we do not want to pay Scandinavian-type taxes.  In the middle of his contribution, Deputy O'Dowd mentioned Norway.  We all want that type of service but it comes with a cost.  I have met people in those circumstances as well as Deputy O'Dowd.  What politicians worth their salt have not done so?  It is not always about resources.  Kindness, compassion and listening cost very little but sometimes we do not see that.  In the instance outlined by the Deputy, there must be awareness of where to go, how that is signposted and so on.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in mentioned the reports which argue this will only benefit a small number of people.  We must remember as well that the &euro;27.5 million we are talking about, which is specifically for dementia services, does not take away a person's right to other existing services.  For example, there was a report in one of the national newspapers that only one in six families would have access to the service.  At a certain point, one might be getting a minor home help service, and that may already be available.  This is part of the jigsaw that will make up the services to be delivered.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about renovation schemes being extended beyond 2016 but that is one of the few parts that is not my area of responsibility.  I will pass his query to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who has responsibility in this respect.  General practitioners will be the gatekeepers and they will be trained.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to constantly mention Dr. Tony Foley, who was one of the pioneers in a pilot project that is still ongoing in Kinsale.  He has a complete community approach to dementia that allows people not just live in their own homes but to live in their own communities.  Deputy Kelleher argued there is no long-term planning.  Of all our initiatives, this is about long-term planning.  It is about getting the basics right and ensuring that what we put in place will serve us well into the future.  The Deputy inquired about a review, and a mid-term review is built into the strategy.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue mentioned relates to age and ageing.<\/p><p>I was glad to see that people agreed with me and I did not have to push the door very hard.  This is not about age.  More than anything else, it is about a condition that can develop at a very early stage in one's life.  Someone I knew quite well developed the condition at 42.  While I am glad to say that happens rarely, it is something that can develop at an early age.  I insisted, therefore, that this would not be about age, but about the condition.  When it comes to people developing it at an earlier age, the services will be available to them.  That is significant.  My constant mantra is that we should stop talking about age and this is the first strategy that recognises the condition rather than the age.  It has always been an issue we assumed was about us as we aged.  In fact, it is not.  For instance, people with Down's syndrome develop dementia at a much younger age than others.  As such, the insistence must be that whether it is someone with a disability or a person in the full of their health, the condition will be treated in the same way as it is for people in later life.<\/p> <p> I thank every Member who contributed.  We can ensure in planning for dementia that the forecasts we have been given do not materialise.  They will only be avoided if we are careful about how we plan for our future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400032#EE00200","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Debate","time":1431610200,"counter":461,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400033#FF00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Private Rented Accommodation Costs and Controls","time":1431610200,"counter":462,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400033#FF00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1431610200,"counter":463,"content":"<p>As the Minister is detained, does Deputy Eamonn Maloney wish to defer his matter?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400033#FF00400","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1431610200,"counter":464,"content":"<p>I would appreciate it if I could defer the issue I have raised on private rented accommodation until next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400033#FF00500","speaker":"1038"},{"type":"speech","time":1431610200,"counter":465,"content":"<p>That is fine.

Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, informed ACCORD, the Catholic Marriage and Preparation Counselling Service, that &euro;378,000 was being withdrawn from its funding for 2015.  Bizarrely, the Tusla letter informed ACCORD that its decision to cut the funding is retrospective and took effect from 1 January 2015, notwithstanding that the letter is dated 7 May 2015.  These are very strange goings on.  I am glad the Minister is here as Tusla cited the delay in the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy James Reilly, approving the budget for the retrospectivity of the cut.  Where was the Minister and why did he not sign off on the funding?  This is scandalous carry on.  Other agencies have also been affected.<\/p>  <p>  This has occurred against the background of a staggering donation of $8 million from Atlantic Philanthropies.  I wonder what is happening there.  On the website of Atlantic Philanthropies, it states that its explicit aim is to fund groups \"to work inside the machinery of Government\" to advance its ideological agenda.  It is a bold statement on its website.  That agenda is in direct opposition to ACCORD's stated view on the upcoming referendum.  This is unprecedented and makes the controversy surrounding former advisor Frank Flannery and access to Fine Gael and government corridors look like a goldfish bowl by comparison.  It is unreal that Atlantic has that statement on its website.  The funding is coming from outside organisations.  I welcome the funding Atlantic Philanthropies has given to certain community projects, but this funding is completely off the radar and in support of agencies to interfere in a referendum process here.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister knows, ACCORD has seven centres nationally and in 2013 provided 50,959 counselling hours to 9,867 clients and 727 marriage preparation courses to 7,631 couples.  At the same time, 32,139 children participated in its schools programme.  Wonderful work has been done.  While planning its work for this year and continuing its outreach services, it is told halfway through the year that its funding has been slashed.  I did not think the Minister would be here, but I note that he said in October that the Department was going to boost Tusla's funding by &euro;26 million.  Does he know what he is doing or where he is?  Does he know he is out of the Department of Health and in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs?  Is he a spinning top?  Does he know what a hames he made of health and does he want to do the same with the Child and Family Agency?  Does he know the importance of that area?  He is the same Minister who said after the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was introduced that he would cut the funding of hospitals that did not participate and carry out the procedures he wanted.  Is that not threatening, bullying and intimidating behaviour intended to get his way at all costs?<\/p>  <p>  I put it to the Minister that this attack could not have come at a worse time for the Government's \"Yes\" campaign and is a despicable attack on an agency.  What is the message it sends to Catholic agencies and others which are doing tremendous work if the referendum is passed?  They will have to go whistle for their money and will get nothing.  The Government will not give it to them.  The Minister said Tusla was to get an increase of &euro;26 million, yet it is imposing cuts on this and many other agencies.  I brought up Atlantic Philanthropies because I am very worried.  I asked the T&aacute;naiste this morning about the electoral commission because Atlantic Philanthropies have funded groups like the Irish Council for Civil Liberties to the tune of &euro;7 million, Amnesty International Ireland to the tune of &euro;5 million, Tusla to the tune of &euro;8 million and GLEN to the tune of &euro;4 million.  That amounts to &euro;24 million.  All of these quangos and Government agents are doing the work of the \"Yes\" campaign in the referendum.  It is interference and a despicable attack on a sovereign state which undermines what democracy is about: a free and unhindered vote of the people.  The chickens have come home to roost and the genie is out of the bottle.<\/p><p> The Minister needs to stand up, measure up and restore this funding.  The Minister and his Government colleagues need to put some manners on these organisations.  These quangos are doing the work of the Government, at its bidding, because people are expecting promotions on State boards.  They are protecting everything else and they are all interlinked.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400033#FF01500","speaker":"1090","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431610800,"counter":476,"content":"<p>Deputy McGrath will have another two minutes after the Minister's reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400034#GG00200","speaker":"1085"},{"type":"speech","time":1431610800,"counter":477,"content":"<p>I hope I get a decent answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400034#GG00300","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1431610800,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to address this issue and I would like to clarify issues around the funding of ACCORD by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400034#GG00400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1431610800,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I cannot hear the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400034#GG00500","speaker":"1090"},{"type":"speech","time":1431610800,"counter":480,"content":"<p>There has been much comment on this issue over the past 24 hours and much of it ill-informed.  This Government is delivering the most comprehensive reform of policy and provision for children, young people and families in the history of the State and our commitment to continuing that work remains strong and resolute.  Indeed, I must make my apologies to the House as I was delayed because I was in the other House, the Seanad, dealing with a new Bill which will end the practice of placing children and people under 18 years of age in adult prisons, either for detention or on remand.  The reform continues.  This Government is committed to strengthening and developing our child care, protection and welfare services.  The Government has provided Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, with significant additional funding in 2015 to enable it deliver on its mandate, as Deputy McGrath has rightly pointed out.<\/p><p>Tusla has a total budget of &euro;643 million in 2015, made up of &euro;631 million in current funding and &euro;12 million in capital.  This increase of &euro;34 million is a 5.3% increase on funding for the agency in 2014.  This level of funding demonstrates clearly that despite the overall national budgetary constraints, this Government is strongly supporting the delivery of critically important reforms needed to support Ireland's children and families.  Of course, this comes on the back of the worst recession this country has ever experienced.  This additional funding will help drive key priorities in the reform of children and family services.  Despite the increase in funding, Tusla has calculated that it still needs to make significant savings in 2015 and the announcement of a funding reduction to ACCORD is but one of a wide range of funding change announcements by Tusla over the past days.  It should be remembered that Tusla funds in the region of 700 organisations around the country.<\/p><p>The establishment of Tusla has presented an opportunity to explore new approaches to meet the needs of the most disadvantaged children and families.  Through a comprehensive scoping exercise across all services, Tusla has begun the process of identifying where the resources can be used to best effect and in a manner consistent with its mandate.  Tusla is undertaking a restructuring of its existing funding allocation to ensure priority is given to counselling services that best support and promote the development, welfare and protection of children and effective functioning of families.<\/p><p>ACCORD provides a range of services in a number of areas.  It provides marriage and relationship counselling services for people who are experiencing difficulties in their relationships.  Quite separately, it provides marriage preparation courses for people who are getting married in the Catholic Church.  In 2014, ACCORD received &euro;1.992 million in core funding from Tusla and in 2015 it will receive funding in excess of &euro;1.6 million.<\/p><p>Tusla will spend approximately &euro;6 million this year on counselling services, including the provision of significant funding to ACCORD, which amounts to more than a quarter of the available funding.  Tusla has determined that marriage preparation courses, which are paid for by couples, does not form part of its core mission.  I am informed by Tusla that it does not provide funding to any other dedicated marriage preparation courses.  Tusla is targeting available funding at its core mission, which is supporting and promoting the development, welfare and protection of children and the effective functioning of families.  <\/p><p>The chief executive of Tusla, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, has made clear that the funding decisions of his executive, which were approved by the Tusla board, were in no way related to the marriage equality referendum.  Anyone who suggests that the reduction in funding for ACCORD is in any way related to the referendum should remember that other organisations who support a Yes vote in the referendum have been the subject of reductions as well.  I would draw the attention of Deputies to a letter from the chief executive of Barnardos in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.<\/p><p>At all times, Tusla has endeavoured to ensure, where funding adjustments are being applied, that they will not affect front-line services, overlap of services will be reduced, backroom functions will be streamlined and that the services received will be of the utmost quality as outlined in Tusla's business plan for 2015.  I want to assure the House that, in furtherance of Government policy for child and family services, Tusla is working with service providers on managing their budgets and the delivery of services to children and families across the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400034#GG00600","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1431610800,"counter":481,"content":"<p>The Minister did not answer the questions.

The financial strain placed on families, particularly young families, by having to pay &euro;2,000 per month for two children to be kept in child care facilities is, as the Minister knows, unfair on parents.  It creates difficulties for families' budgets, given the other cuts people have had to take in recent years because of the country's economic problems.  For example, they must pay property taxes, water charges and USC.  The high cost of child care has made it financially unfeasible for both parents to work.  It makes more sense for one of them to give up work to look after their children, even though they desire to return to the workforce.  As the Minister is aware, a study entitled, The Baby Brain Drain, concluded that 3,000 new mothers left the workforce annually, giving rise to a figure of &euro;68 million in recruitment and training costs.  This is having a detrimental effect on the economy.  We must keep women in the workforce, contributing to the tax coffers, but doing so is uneconomic for them.<\/p>  <p>  My colleagues and I in Renua Ireland have devised a policy.  With the economic position improving, we must consider providing a tax credit for parents and cr&egrave;che operators to help the hard-pressed, squeezed middle.  Many families are being sandwiched by costs and cuts.<\/p>  <p>  The inflexibility of maternity leave arrangements needs to be examined.  We propose that six months of maternity leave be taken by both parents, with three months being taken by each, with the leave being renamed as \"parental leave\".<\/p>  <p>  The local property tax was to provide money to improve communities, but that has not happened.  In 2013 the Commission on Taxation recommended the introduction of a site valuation charge.  This would have ring-fenced money and ensured the availability of more affordable child care facilities in communities, thereby relieving families of an unfair burden.  I plead with the Minister to consider this suggestion on behalf of families.  Many talented women are denied an opportunity to contribute to and play their part in the workforce because of exorbitant cr&egrave;che fees.  Will the Minister outline his plan of action?  He is in discussions with the Minister for Finance and has set up a cross-departmental group that will make recommendations by the summer on how to deal with this issue.  A second year of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme has been mooted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400035#HH03400","speaker":"1182"},{"type":"speech","time":1431611400,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I am pleased to answer the Deputy and outline the Government's position on child care.  I thank him for his question.<\/p>  <p>  High quality and well structured investment in the early years of a child's life is widely recognised as being one of the most strategic investments we can make with public funding.  Children are at a critical stage in their development in their early years and we have a golden opportunity to set them on the right path for their future - for all of our futures - by investing wisely in them at that stage.  They are not the only beneficiaries.  When they are given opportunities to develop to their full potential, we all benefit - parents, families, communities, wider society and the economy.  It is because the Government recognised the critical importance of investment in children's early years that we worked hard to protect expenditure in this area, despite the dire economic circumstances that we had inherited.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs invests more than &euro;250 million in child care each year.  This is before spending on children by other Departments is taken into consideration.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is well aware that Ireland's investment in this area is lower than in many other OECD countries and that parents face considerable difficulties in accessing quality and affordable child care.  It is constrained in its ability to increase this investment significantly, as the recovery in the public finances is not yet complete and resources remain limited.  Furthermore, I am strongly committed to ensuring every euro we invest in children is invested wisely.  This is the area in which we get the greatest return for every euro we invest.<\/p>  <p>  A number of programmes are in place to support parents with child care costs, the most significant of which in terms of State investment is the ECCE programme.  This universal programme provides for one free preschool year for all eligible children before commencing primary school.  More than &euro;170 million is invested in the programme annually, reducing the child care costs of parents by more than &euro;2,300 per child.  Approximately 67,000 children benefit from the guaranteed investment for which the programme provides.<\/p>  <p>  The community child care subvention programme funds community not-for-profit child care services to allow them to provide quality child care at reduced rates for disadvantaged and low income working parents.  More than 25,000 children benefit from this programme annually.<\/p>  <p>  A number of further initiatives have been introduced under the training and employment child care programmes to support parents who are participating in training or educational courses in order to return to the workforce.  They include the child care education and training support programme which provides subsidised child care places for qualifying trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  The after school child care programme provides after school care for primary school children for certain categories of working parents for one year.  Last year it was enhanced in a number of ways, including by providing funding for a pick-up service at no extra cost to parents where providers were in a position to do so.<\/p><p>Community employment schemes often provide the first opportunity for parents to engage in the workforce.  The community employment child care programme subsidises the cost of child care for participating parents.  Following a number of enhancements, the programme now includes an after-school child-care option at a weekly cost of &euro;15 for parents of primary school children, as well as a part-time day-care option for up to ten weeks during school holidays.<\/p> <p> The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has been working closely with the Department of Social Protection to ensure that these initiatives provide the maximum benefit to parents in an economy that is now delivering an increased number of work opportunities.<\/p> <p> The current level of State investment in child care, at more than &euro;250 million per year, is very substantial.  To ensure that all the benefits of child care investments are fully realised, public investment in child care must be evidence-based and strategically co-ordinated.<\/p> <p> In order to develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to child care investment, I have established an interdepartmental group to examine and develop options for future investment in child care, both in the early years and for children of school-going age.  The work of the group will be informed by documented best practice and current policy commitments, and through consultation with relevant stakeholders.<\/p> <p> On 31 March, an open policy debate was attended by 40 invited representatives including parents, child care providers, academics, child-care committees, and non-governmental organisations.  A range of views on future policy directions were put forward, and a number of options for future investment were examined and discussed.  A report of the debate is currently being compiled and will be published in due course.<\/p> <p> An online consultation process was also provided for stakeholders with an interest in the field, including policy-makers, practitioners, providers, advocates and academics, as well as one specifically for parents and guardians.  Almost 400 submissions were made by stakeholders and nearly 1,000 submissions were made by parents and guardians.  These submissions will feed into the deliberations of the interdepartmental group.  I take this opportunity to thank all who made submissions for doing so.<\/p> <p> I have asked the group to consider a wide range of options, which must be rigorously analysed and properly costed, to develop sensible solutions to the challenges families face, rather than an expensive shopping list of \"like to haves\".  I have asked that the final report of the group be submitted to me by the summer - next month in fact - to inform Government deliberations on this important area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400035#HH03500","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1431612000,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

It is a mentoring service with 30 highly qualified mentors who will visit and support providers with ongoing advice on how to improve quality and care in the work they do.

I favour giving parents a choice and affording Government the opportunity to have an input into standards and quality of the placements available, much as the ECCE programme works now.<\/p><p>We need more investment in child care and I will strongly fight for that.

I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who regrets she is unable to be present for the debate due to previous official commitments.  I will, of course, bring the views of the Deputies to her attention and that of the other relevant Ministers before the meeting next week.  I will ensure the transcript of the debate is read.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has participated in an UN-led resettlement programme since 2000.  This programme is co-ordinated by the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration in the Department of Justice and Equality.  Prior to Ireland's participation in this UN programme, Ireland had offered resettlement to groups of refugees, including Hungarians, Chileans, Vietnamese, Bosnians and Kosovars, since the 1950s.<\/p>  <p>  Since the beginning of the UNHCR-led resettlement programme in 2000, 1,198 vulnerable persons from 27 different countries of origin have been resettled here.  In general, the refugees resettled in Ireland come from Africa or Asia.  The largest communities are from countries such as Burma, Iran, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan and Syria.  Ireland is working closely with the UNHCR to respond to the plight of the most vulnerable persons displaced by these conflicts and has played its part in the international community resettlement effort and will continue to do so in the context of the EU response to the Mediterranean refugee crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The total number of persons displaced by the Syrian conflict admitted to Ireland under the resettlement programme from 2013 to date is 138.  This includes 31 Afghans and four Iraqi Palestinians admitted from Damascus in 2013, 90 Syrian refugees admitted from Jordan and Lebanon in 2014 and 13 Syrian refugees who arrived from Jordan in April 2015.  Prior to yesterday's announcement, the Minister had already committed to resettling 100 refugees in 2015 and 120 refugees in 2016.  The focus was on refugees caught up in the conflict in the Middle East, notably Iraq and Syria, including a number of refugees who have urgent medical needs.<\/p>  <p>  The EU agenda on migration, published yesterday, includes specific proposals on the resettlement of migrants in Europe under which Ireland was expected to receive 272 people by the end of 2016.  Rather than waiting until the Commission's proposals are discussed formally by home affairs Ministers in June, the Minister announced yesterday that the Government has agreed in principle to resettle an additional 300 vulnerable people as our contribution to this European initiative.  In addition, Ireland has operated a Syrian humanitarian application programme under which 114 people arrived in Ireland this year to join family already here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400037#KK00200","speaker":"1078"},{"type":"speech","time":1431612600,"counter":550,"content":"<p>It is good that Ireland is taking in some people.  It has been one of the better countries at providing aid in some crises in which people are suffering badly.  Rather than just examining the symptoms and trying to help in whatever way we can, it is surely time that we took on board the serious causes of the serious crises around the globe.  As I stated before, the migrants did not just appear out of thin air.<\/p>  <p>  Militarisation of much of the Middle East and other parts of the world has a lot to do with the efforts of so many hundreds of thousands of migrants to get across the Mediterranean.  We need to take this on board.  I appeal to the Government to think again about the fact that we allow arms and munitions to come through Shannon Airport.  This helps to cause so much of the misery.  War is responsible for a considerable proportion of the displacement.  Ireland could play a very positive role by standing up and saying no country, including the United States, should be allowed to bring any arms and munitions or troops through Ireland to any war front because war does not create peace, it creates destruction.  I appeal to the Government to take a fresh look at how we are allowing Shannon Airport to be used.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400037#KK00300","speaker":"956"},{"type":"speech","time":1431612600,"counter":551,"content":"<p>We must stand back and consider the horrendous circumstances that force individuals and families to make the treacherous journey to try to seek a better life in Europe.

It is beyond belief.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, I am very glad the Government is resettling people but I am sorry more people are not being resettled.  I hope more from the next batch will be resettled.  However, the key issue here is not about resettling refugees.  It should be about preventing them from being turned into refugees in the first place.  People are being driven from their own countries where their families are and in which they speak their own language.  They are left with no future where they should be living, surrounded by the people and life circumstances that they know best.  Does the Minister of State believe they really want to come here?  Their migration is because of economic pillaging or military devastation.  I echo the point that we are complicit in this by allowing Shannon Airport to be part of this process.  There is no doubt in my mind that the US military that have transited through Shannon Airport and engaged in activities such as those in Syria and Libya are partly the reason so many people are now ending up in this devastating situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015051400037#KK00400","speaker":"1192"},{"type":"speech","time":1431612600,"counter":552,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for raising the resettlement programme and many other issues, including that of Shannon Airport.

Ireland is involved in a number of initiatives at European level to try to prevent the displacement of people.

As the Deputies stated, families are faced with repeated displacement due to conflict and have very limited access to basic services.  Ireland will continue to assist people affected by conflict and persecution.  This year, it will provide nearly &euro;80 million in funding to support communities affected by humanitarian crises, including in Syria, Yemen, northern Nigeria, the Central African Republic, South Sudan and other conflict-affected areas.
