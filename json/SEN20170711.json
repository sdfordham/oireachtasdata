That is a year in which families in Donegal have had to endure more concern and more alarm as their homes are literally falling apart around them.  There is not a week that goes by, particularly recently since the report has been published, in which I have not spoken to families, by either meeting them at their homes or speaking to them on the phone, who have taken me through the concerns they have.  They are totally devastated.<\/p> <p>The report proves very clearly that there was a failure of State regulation and building control.  If we look at the eight recommendations, they all focus on the need to make serious improvements in this area.  We are now a year behind schedule in terms of the report.

I am sorry that I could not wait any longer.  We have some appointments booked up as well.<\/p> <p>I thank Senator Mac Lochlainn for raising this important issue - I recognise it as such.  I thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn's colleagues in Donegal and Mayo as well.  Colleagues across parties and in both Houses have been raising this issue with me directly during the past year since I took up this role, as have many others as well.  The issue concerns many people and all sides want it to be sorted out.<\/p> <p>I wish to acknowledge the difficult and distressing situations that certain home owners in Donegal and Mayo are facing on account of damage to the structural integrity of their homes.  I have seen some of these damaged homes first-hand and I have met the home owners in Donegal and Mayo, so I understand clearly the difficulties they face.  I understand the hassle it has caused to their lives as well as the financial and health impacts in recent years since they have had to deal with this.<\/p> <p>I firmly believe that the parties responsible for poor workmanship and the supply of defective materials should face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate actions to provide remedies for the affected home owners in these cases and in other cases also.  The expert panel on concrete blocks was established by my Department in 2016 to investigate problems that have emerged in the concrete block work of certain dwellings in counties Donegal and Mayo.<\/p> <p>I will outline the terms of reference of the panel.  The first term was to identify, in so far as it is possible, the numbers of private dwellings that appear to be affected by defects in the block work in the counties of Donegal and Mayo.  We now have a rough idea of numbers.  We know the minimum numbers and also what the maximum would be in both counties.  It is important that we have collected that data.  The second term was to carry out a desktop study, which would include a consultation process with affected home owners, public representatives, local authorities, product manufacturers, building professionals, testing laboratories, industry stakeholders and other relevant parties, to establish the nature of the problem in the affected dwellings.  That work is being carried out now.  It is useful to help us provide the solutions that are needed as well.  The next term was to outline a range of technical options for remediation and the means by which those technical options could be applied.  Again, we have that information.  Finally, the group was to submit a report within six months.<\/p> <p>I received the report of the expert panel on 6 June 2017.  It is comprehensive and addresses all areas of the terms of reference.  I published the report one week later on 13 June 2017.  The report has eight recommendations.  My Department has already taken action to implement recommendations one and two as priorities.  Recommendation one relates to the testing and categorisation protocol.  The Department met the National Standards Authority of Ireland recently to discuss the establishment of a technical committee to scope and fast-track the development of a standardised protocol.  That is the first recommendation because it is most important to get the protocol right.  I have dealt with these schemes in the past and it is important that part is dealt with; it will take away some of the grey area for home owners also.<\/p> <p>Recommendation two relates to competent professional oversight.  My Department has been in contact with Engineers Ireland with regard to the establishment of a register of competent engineers for home owner affected parties' reference.  Engineers Ireland provided assurance that the organisation will collaborate with the Department, NSAI and others on measures to establish such a register.  Again, that is highly important and we will do it as quickly as we can.  We are not delaying on these recommendations in any way.<\/p> <p>I fully appreciate and understand the urgency of this matter to the affected home owners and I will continue to monitor progress closely.  We will meet the residents in both counties soon.  In light of the information contained in the report, my Department and I are currently considering what further actions may be required to assist the parties directly involved in reaching a satisfactory resolution to the problems that have emerged in the two counties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017071100002#D00300","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1499779800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I will allow Senator Conway-Walsh to raise a matter about her own county, Mayo.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017071100002#E00100","speaker":"1381"},{"type":"speech","time":1499779800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>The Minister will know there are 345 homes affected in County Mayo.

We must face up to the fact that these home owners were let down.  They were sold materials that were not fit for purpose.  That was clearly stated in the report.

This issue is in connection with the mid-term review of the national capital investment plan.  It is an issue I feel very strongly about.  The review took place in the month of April.  More particularly, at that time I held a public information meeting in the Great National South Court Hotel, Raheen, in Limerick city, on Tuesday, 18 April to encourage people to make submissions on the M20, which is the Limerick to Cork motorway.  I regard it as the single most important piece of infrastructure Ireland needs.  I would go so far as to say that without it, we cannot have balanced regional development.  Dublin is bursting at the seams, so to speak.  It is doing exceptionally well, but I am of the view that Dublin can only take so much capacity.  We are a relatively small island, but if we cannot have motorway connection from Cork to Limerick to Galway, and we cannot get from, say, Cork to Limerick in an hour and Cork to Galway in two hours, we do not have balanced regional development.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The existing motorway from Limerick to Cork, in particular from Limerick to Mallow, is impossible to travel on.  Anyone who knows it will know about the bottlenecks at Charleville and Buttevant, in particular down by the quarry.  This matter is very much to the fore in people's minds, in particular in Limerick but also in Cork and everywhere along the western seaboard, including Galway, because we need to have connection.  The Minister of State might indicate how the mid-term capital review is progressing, the anticipated timeframe for the collation of information, and where the M20 stands in this process.<\/p><p>At the start of this year, the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, agreed to my proposal to allocate &euro;1 million to Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, formerly the National Roads Authority, to allow for the recommencement of planning work in respect of the M20.  I thank him for that.  The allocation has allowed TII to recommence planning, engage consultants and do the pre-planning work required before the main design feature gets under way.  As we stand, no further time is being lost.  The key element now is to ensure that when the mid-term capital review is complete, we can effectively get the planning and design phase under way for the M20 with immediate effect.  We can do it on a staged basis.  The part between Limerick and Mallow is the most critical.  That is where considerable time is lost.  We must ensure that the M20 project is commenced.  The mid-term capital review last April was very welcome.  There is considerable demand for the project in Limerick.  Well over 200 people attended the public consultation meeting I held in the South Court Hotel on Tuesday, 18 April.  What people now want to see is action.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach is on record as saying he will look for this to be in place by 2023.  That is extremely achievable but on the basis that the M20, the Limerick-Cork motorway, gets the green light under the mid-term capital review.  We must see the design, route selection and construction taking place by 2023.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017071100002#E01000","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499779800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>The Programme for a Partnership Government committed to additional capital investment over the period of the capital plan to 2021, to be allocated on the basis of the outcome of a review of that plan.  This review is ongoing.  The process will guide and inform the decision by the Government on revised capital allocations made to Departments at budget time in October.  The review is also an important input to the long-term ten-year capital plan, intended to be finalised before the end of the year.  Submissions on the review and the additional funding available for allocation were sought from Departments in January 2017 and are currently under review by my Department.<\/p> <p>With regard to conducting the review of the capital plan, it is a matter for each Department in the first instance to identify its sectoral priorities and projects in its submission for any additional funding under the review.  The recommendations made by each Department will play an important role in ensuring that the additional funding is aligned with priorities, in terms of overall economic and social returns from increased capital investment, for example.  A public consultation process was also held in April to ascertain the views of the public and key stakeholders on what our national infrastructural priorities should be.  This consultation also sought views on infrastructure investment priorities beyond the period of the capital plan.  This will also help to formulate the longer-term ten-year plan.<\/p> <p>The assessment of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform of the submissions received as part of the review will be based on relevant evidence and research, such as on infrastructural capacity and demand analysis carried out by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service.

This is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate him on his promotion and wish him well in his new role.<\/p> <p>I refer to the new travel-mileage expenses rate which took effect for all public servants on 1 April this year.  The new rate was negotiated by the Civil Service unions with the Department of Finance.  It had the added dimension of the Haddington Road agreement in which the unions and employers came up with a new rate and method of calculating mileage expenses incurred by public servants.  Across the public service those most acutely affected are members of State boards and county councillors.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I was disappointed to learn from those bodies that no consultation took place on this issue with the representative bodies, either the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA, or the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG.<\/p><p>The new rate for travel expenses differs from the old one in that there are four different categories as opposed to two heretofore.  One significant effect of the new rates is that for the first 1,500 km a year that a claimant might travel, the rate drops from 0.6088 per kilometre down to 0.4479 per kilometre which results on a return journey in a drop of approximately 26%.<\/p><p>In practical terms, as I stated earlier, those most affected by this will be local authority members who would struggle to get up to 1,500 km through any group they might form part of, whether that be an education and training board, ETB, or a health fora.  Members of the north-east health forum who would travel to a meeting in Kells would leave Monaghan town, for example, at 12 o'clock for a meeting at 2 p.m. and would not be back home again until 6 p.m. - that is six hours.  Many of them will find it difficult to afford to be able to go to that type of meeting, which is disappointing bearing in mind that it is important, for example, on a health forum, that we have community voices heard.  This makes it more difficult.<\/p><p>I suppose a disappointing aspect of it as well is that when one considers this along with other cuts that local authority members have experienced in recent times, it makes the role of the county councillor that more difficult.  Indeed, in my own constituency, Cavan-Monaghan, in the past couple of weeks we had two councillors resign purely because they are holding down full-time jobs and were finding it impossible to manage the two.<\/p><p>It would be difficult to get a single arrangement with Revenue and whoever for county councillors on this issue, but I would ask if that could be looked at.  More importantly, we need to look at the issue of terms and conditions for local authority members in the round, and this will form part of it.  We need to make it more attractive for local authority members to carry on and not resign because we depend on them to be the voice of the community in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017071100002#G00800","speaker":"1396","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499779800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>The mileage rates are designed to reimburse an officer for the costs incurred in using his or her own car on official business.  The rates are set based on a methodology agreed with the staff associations.  The methodology takes account of both overhead costs, such as car cost and insurance, and also running costs such as fuel costs and maintenance.<\/p> <p>Under the Haddington Road agreement, a commitment was given to review the travel and subsistence arrangements in the public service.  As part of this review, discussions on the motor mileage rates took place between Department officials and the staff associations from autumn 2015.<\/p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, the formula underpinning the motor mileage rates was reviewed this year with a view to reflecting increased efficiencies and improvements in motor technology.  The revised rates are based on an agreed methodology that reflects changes in technology, road conditions, commuter behaviour and car ownership patterns.<\/p> <p>Some of the key changes of this review involved the following: an increase in the number of distance bands, from two to four, allowing a more nuanced reimbursement regime focused on officers who do significant work-related driving; a lower recoupment rate for the first 1,500 km; an increased recoupment rate from 1,501 km to 5,500 km focussed on officers who do such longer work-related driving; more beneficial reimbursement rates for cars with lower engine sizes and emissions; and the formula for calculating mileage now assumes an officer replaces his or her car every four years rather than every three years.<\/p> <p>This changed the way the mileage bands are structured.  Under the previous system, officers moved to a lower mileage rate after they had travelled 4,000 miles.  Part of the focus of the review was to ensure that those officers who undertake significant work-related driving are adequately compensated for using their own car for official business.  In order to allow this, it was deemed necessary to designate an initial mileage period where recoupment costs were lower.<\/p> <p>In December 2016, Department officials and the staff associations met the adjudicator under the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme to determine the upper threshold for the first distance band.  The adjudicator determined that 1,500 km was appropriate.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This was accepted by the parties.

As such, officers who accumulated mileage during the period would be closer to reaching band 2.  The Senator may wish to note that the revised arrangements provide for more beneficial reimbursement rates for cars with lower engine sizes and emissions.  For an officer driving a car with an engine size of less than 1,200 cc, there is only a nominal reduction of up to &euro;16 per annum in comparison with previous rates.<\/p><p>The Senator may wish to note that it is intended to review the motor travel rates after a period of three years in 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017071100002#H00200","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499779800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.

The Trinity College study described Ireland as having the most feminised homeless population in the EU.  Alarmingly, it also concluded the picture is likely to be actually worse, as women tend to be less likely to register as homeless for fear of being stigmatised.  The study also outlined that two thirds of homeless family households are headed by lone mothers.  It outlines the Government's continued failure to address the housing crisis, and this highlights a certain aspect of Irish life.  I ask that urgent action be taken to provide adequate housing for women and children in this city.<\/p><p>I also wish to raise the staffing crisis in the Defence Forces.  We see poor pay has forced many members out of the Defence Forces.  On average, 60 personnel of all ranks leave the Defence Forces every month.

We have seen the closure of beds in mental health units.  We have also seen difficulty in recruiting consultants in hospitals.<\/p><p>I call for a review of the recruitment and retention policies in the Defence Forces in particular and throughout the public sector generally.  Some of the worries highlighted by a University of Limerick report included poor pay and conditions for members of the Defence Forces, a feeling of unfairness and worries about their career development, with many members of the Defence Forces taking on second jobs to survive, taking out loans and, in some cases, even applying for the family income supplement.

Does he believe the accelerated recruitment can compensate for the loss of experienced personnel?<\/p> <p>Perhaps the Leader can tell the Seanad where is the return on the State's investment in training military personnel when they walk out of barracks as quickly as they are trained to take better paid civilian jobs.  I have said before in the House how an RTE journalist said Aldi was the place for commissioned officers to find a career when the Defence Forces was finished with them.  Pay and conditions have been outrageous.  Soldiers cannot afford to live on what they get, yet the Department of Defence returned &euro;27 million last year.  Soldiers are on family income supplement and some poor unfortunates must sleep on their ships because they cannot afford civilian accommodation.<\/p> <p>We speak about retaining pilots.  We are told by the Government that at the end of this year eight pilots will come on stream.  They will come on stream to fly single-engine aircraft and are of no value with regard to the Casa or helicopter service.

Nobody seems to give a continental damn that private soldiers, not five miles from here out in Rathmines, live in what they now refer to as \"Hotel Rwanda\".  I have seen the inside of these barracks and I have seen what they are like.  With regard to human resource management, if this was the corporate world and the number of people were walking out as are leaving the forces right now, the senior managers in that organisation would be fired.  We have a situation where young officers are posted at a moment's notice to anywhere in the country, without any regard for their family circumstances.  We have bomb disposal officers on duty for up to 18 or 20 days a month.  Is this any way to treat families?  Is this any way to treat individuals?  We have 11 bomb disposal officers where we have an establishment for 35.

It is vitally important that Senators would have an opportunity to discuss the statement in detail with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and to examine the direction the Government is taking.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, attended the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach last week to discuss his meeting this week in Brussels.  What concerns me is that the narrative being used to form economic policy is that we have almost reached full employment yet in the area I come from and in other areas in the west and rural Ireland in general, unemployment stands at over 30%.  It is important we discuss this in terms of the economic statement.<\/p> <p>The current visit being undertaken by the IMF to advise on capital investment indicates that the Government now faces a choice between tax cuts and capital investment.  Several groups and think tanks have openly asked for the Government to abandon the tax cuts agenda and focus on investment in key areas such as infrastructure and education.  It is estimated that we are currently under-spending on capital investment by up to &euro;3 billion per annum.  Per capita spend on infrastructure between 2013 and 2016 was 86% of the European comparator group.  We need massive investment in this area to make up for the years of neglect, especially in the west of Ireland.  Sinn F&eacute;in has long argued for targeted investment to increase employment in the west so it is made more attractive for further investment.  We have included many of these measures in our document, A New Deal for the West, which the Government is more than welcome to use as a guide.  <\/p> <p>There are studies that point out that the lack of investment in basic infrastructure such as transport and communications can render other Government supports such as social welfare and pension payments insufficient.  We have a road network in dire need of investment, which means major hospitals in the west remain many hours away by ambulance for those they serve.  I invite anybody who is in any doubt about this to travel the R312, which is the road connecting the Erris Peninsula and Erris with the main hospital in Castlebar.  I travelled it last week.

One way of doing this is to ensure members of the Defence Forces and their representative bodies have access to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and, ultimately, the Labour Court because they do not have such access and there is a trend across Europe that suggests it is the right thing to do.  Access to a labour relations commission is a human right across the world.  A person has an entitlement to ensure he or she has such access to vindicate his or her rights in the workplace.  That access to the labour relations machinery of the State to vindicate individual workplace rights would somehow put the security of the State at risk which is trotted out time and again is absolute nonsense.  That has not been the case in any country in which such rights have been introduced.  This issue was raised during the lifetime of the previous Government and pushed to a certain point.

I will not elaborate much further, suffice to say that these were identified as follows: 17 key issues relating to employment under the Department of Social Protection; 18 key issues under the HSE and the Department of Health; five key issues under the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government; five issues under the Department of Education and Skills; three issues under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs; one key target - simply one - under the Department of Justice and Equality to address with the Minister; one key target under the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; and two issues in the Department of Finance.  Their requests are more than reasonable.  It is about putting resources into supporting, helping and caring for people in their homes, where the majority of people want to stay unless reliance on hospitals and institutional care is needed.  I believe this to be a reasonable request and I ask everyone to take the time this week to look at their pre-budget submission.

I was also going to raise this issue and our party's grave concerns.  Operation Sophia is an EU military mission under the guise of the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, of the European Union.  The primary stated objective is to target and stop gangs using vessels for human trafficking, mainly from Libya.  It has, however, a much greater remit than that.  Phase two, which is now under way, includes the training of Libyan coastguards to capture refugees who are fleeing their war-torn countries, and throwing them in to so-called migrant detention centres.  It has a third phase that would mandate the participating countries, if necessary, to take military action in Libyan waters and on Libyan soil.<\/p> <p>These detention centres have been proven and documented to violate the human rights of those imprisoned in them.  The Libyan coastguards who are being trained have been guilty not only of abusing refugees, but also of firing live rounds into overloaded boats of refugees.  Pushing refugees who seek asylum into such centres by military force is a human rights violation and morally disgusting.  We should play no role in this.<\/p> <p>Currently, Naval Service missions in the Mediterranean Sea operate under a purely humanitarian search and rescue mission remit.  Over the past two years Naval Service personnel have rescued almost 16,000 people in the south of the Mediterranean Sea.  This is outstanding work, of which we can be proud.  That is, however, as far as our intervention must go.  We cannot allow the EU to undermine Ireland's neutrality and we must stand against any further militarisation of the EU and any forerunner to the creation of an EU army.  Operation Sophia is a military response to a humanitarian problem and it will not solve anything.  We must continue our search and rescue missions and significantly increase the relocation and settlement of refugees in Ireland.  I call on the Minister of State to come to the House immediately to debate this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017071100002#R00200","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1499779800,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I wish to offer condolences on the passing away of the little two year old boy, to his mother and to the family.  It is devastating.<\/p> <p>I want to speak today on the broadcasting of our national games.  One of the great organisations in the State is the GAA.  The pleasure given to the population from wonderful hurling and football matches is immense.  When a county is doing well, the mood of the people is lifted.  On RTE last weekend, the former Offaly hurler and GAA pundit, Michael Duignan, made the point that his father was not able to access the Waterford versus Kilkenny hurling match because it was on Sky TV.  The argument can be made that the Sky deal brings in extra revenue to the GAA and increases the exposure of these great games.  It must also be borne in mind that as an organisation the GAA relies on unpaid volunteers who give up their time to foster the games.  Some grassroots reporters and volunteers cannot afford to pay for Sky Sports.  It could be argued that people can go to the local pub to watch these games but this is not always possible as some rural pubs in particular cannot afford the fees charged by Sky.  Young children who are the players and stars of the future should be able to see their heroes on television and not have to go to a pub to see them.  Given that the deal with Sky TV runs until 2022, I believe that GAA clubs all over the State should show all the Sky games in an alcohol free setting so that children and families can also enjoy these occasions.  It is such a shame that some people are denied the opportunity to see their national games on television because of lack of money.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frances Black:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2474\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This needs to be addressed as our unique culture should be made available to all our citizens.<\/p><p>I also want to ask the Leader again about the recognition of Palestine.

At the finance committee, of which I am a member, I asked that we seek the liquidators of Setanta Insurance to come before the committee.  I believe there is a general worry and legitimate concern that many of the insurance companies have already factored the whole issue of Setanta into their pricing over the last year.  It has now arisen that they are not required to pay.  We might ask the Minister for Finance to come before the House to update us on the motor insurance industry.  We cannot have a situation in a year's time in which we find that the motor insurance industry has made exorbitant profits over the course of the year.  That could happen.  It is something that cannot be allowed to happen.  An industry is entitled to be sustainable.  However, an industry is not entitled to make crazy profits on the back of ordinary citizens.<\/p> <p>I spoke to an older person last week.  I will not call him an old age pensioner.  His car insurance had increased from &euro;700 to &euro;1,200 overnight.  That is replicated in many people we deal with.  The problem is that the motor insurance industry is well used to manning the barricades, effectively dealing with pressure and taking the pressure.  People then peel away and the companies charge the higher rates.  I for one will not allow that to happen.  We want the liquidators of Setanta to come before the finance committee.  I hope they will accept that request.  I would like the Minister for Finance to come before this House so that we can once again deal with an updated situation as to what exactly is the position regarding the regulation of the motor insurance industry.

They both relate to tourism, which as Members know is a huge contributor to the economy.  In today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, I note that the mandarins in the Department of Finance have approached the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, with a proposal to abolish the 9% VAT rate in the hospitality sector.  The 9% VAT rate has been a huge boost for tourism for the hoteliers, restaurateurs and so on since it was introduced in 2011.  We always understood that it could not last forever.  However, this is certainly not the time to remove it.  The indications so far of Brexit, particularly, and to a lesser extent the isolationist policies of the Trump Administration, are that tourism numbers are falling.  I pointed out in a previous debate in the House that UK visitor numbers for the first quarter of this year are down by 7%.  Anybody from the tourism counties such as Kerry or Dublin will know anecdotally that this is happening.  The figures are now stacking up to prove it.  Therefore, I believe this is most unfortunate timing.<\/p><p>When I raised this issue before, Members rightly pointed out that there is a lot of underpaying and unsatisfactory pay levels at the low levels of the tourism sector.  I am in full agreement with those comments and I do not want to stand over anything like that.  However, we must remember that a lot of our hoteliers are ploughing their profits back into refurbishing their hotels and bars on a regular basis.  There are hotels in Kerry that are demolished and recreated every number of years.  That is why we are there offering facilities.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Finance to address that issue when he is next in the House.<\/p><p>It was very disappointing to read that in a surveillance operation, the Garda detected a number of taxi drivers cheating their customers by taking scenic routes to prime destinations, such as from the city centre to the airport.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2233\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The fare for the journey from the city centre to the airport should not vary, or perhaps only by a couple of euro, depending on traffic conditions and so on.

New data from census 2016, published in mid-June, show there has been a 19% increase in the number of retired people in the country since 2011.  This amounts to over 500,000 people.  Retirees have spent their whole working lives investing in their families, communities and country.  The State needs to be more proactive in supporting these retirees in future years, in particular to prevent financial abuse of those who are physically, mentally or emotionally challenged in later life.<\/p> <p>I call on staff working in financial institutions to act promptly if they suspect their older customers are being exploited through various transactions and also to act with more consideration towards older persons.  The banks are altering their business models, eliminating cash and coin services and also cheque services if they get their way.  They are often acting in major disregard of sections of the community.  I do not wish to generalise too much but I have had the experience of dealing with retired persons who are utterly frustrated as they try to pay for their health insurance, for example.  They are told cheques are not accepted anymore.  The world is moving on according to a particular idea of the common good but it tends to be a very self-centred business and commercial idea of the common good.  We have all been in banks where we have seen officials trying to answer the queries of an increasingly bewildered group who find the banks are just not receptive to their needs or attentive to them.  We are dealing with an older population that is set to grow substantially.  It does not comprise older persons exclusively but there is to be a rise from 12%, the current percentage of the population, to 22% by 2041.  This is an issue for the upcoming Private Members' business but a wider discussion is needed in the House so we can pay attention to the issues in their entirety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017071100002#V00300","speaker":"1401"},{"type":"speech","time":1499779800,"counter":97,"content":"<p>I express my condolences on yesterday's tragedy in the Kimmage area of Dublin South-Central.  Councillor McHugh is on the ground there since yesterday assisting the shocked, bereaved community.<\/p> <p>The State's baby boom saw almost 64,000 live births recorded in 2016.  That is 1.3 births per 1,000 members of the population, which means the highest natural rise in Europe.  We have the lowest death rate, at 6.4 deaths per 1,000.  We must be doing something right for the older person.  In 2003, there was a population of 3.9 million, and this rose to 4.7 million last year.  In the next decade, it is predicted there will be an extra million.  We will number nearly 6 million but, taking in the North, there will be 8 million in total.  If this trend continues, our working population will begin to struggle.  We will not be able to provide essential services for the young and old, and we will have a complete breakdown of the inter-generational social contract.<\/p> <p>The report that emerged yesterday allows us to consider a new perspective on two particular aspects of health care services, one being maternity care and the other being the care of older people.  With regard to maternity care, the midwives of Ireland, my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues and I have been calling for the full implementation of the national maternity strategy so all maternity hospitals meet the Birthrate Plus standard.  <\/p> <p>With regard to the care of older people, I commend my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in on his submission entitled \"How we best respond to the Challenges and Opportunities of an Ageing Population\".  It outlines what I describe.  Pockets of knowledge on the facets of the problem of our baby boom and the ageing population are not enough.  We must have a frank, clear and co-ordinated strategic response to our changing population so we can address issues such as health care, a possible deficit in the workforce, and the increasing demand for care for the elderly.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Will the Leader invite the Minister for Health to the Chamber to discuss these issues which will have a massive impact on us in the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017071100002#V00400","speaker":"1388","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499779800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I commend the Leas-Chathaoirleach on his handling of the important hearings of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee into mental health services which took place here over the past several Thursdays.

These monstrosities I refer to are often referred to as bonfires.  They are more often than not referred to as expressions of culture.  There is no doubt for many people in the Protestant, unionist and loyalist tradition in Ireland that they hold a dear and important place in their hearts as an expression of culture.  We all know the longer traditional role of bonfires in our own Gaelic and pagan heritage on this island, as well as their symbolic importance and what they represented.<\/p> <p>What we have seen manifested in the streets over the past several years, however, really cannot be described than anything else than hate crimes.

It is vitally important that officials from the Irish Government say to the loyalist representatives who they are dealing with, because, unfortunately, unionist politicians have gone to ground, that this is not good enough.  It is not good enough to engage with the Irish Government, receive funding from the Irish Government for community and reconciliation projections but then go and burn the Irish national flag and try to pass that off as culture.  It is not culture, it is anti-culture.  It is hate crime.  It is important that the PSNI treat it accordingly and that a clear loud message goes from this House that the Members of the Oireachtas are encouraging officials from the Irish Government who are responsible to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, that we are watching, that we do not think it is acceptable or tolerable in 2017 and that the PSNI should act.<\/p><p>In case I do not get the chance, I wish County Down all the very best in the Ulster final on Sunday - a real expression of culture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017071100002#W00400","speaker":"1413","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499779800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile.

I hope and pray that the mother of that child who herself was attacked is on the road to recovery.  It is important we recognise there is an investigation ongoing.  I extend our sympathies to the families involved.<\/p> <p>Senators Ardagh, Craughwell, Gallagher, Gavan, Nash and Norris raised matters regarding the Defence Forces.  There are two parts to it.  First, I will put on the record of the House that in the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, we have a Minister with responsibility for Defence who is very proactive, who is very engaged and who takes immense pride in his job as Minister of State with responsibility for Defence and in the Defence Forces themselves, and I thank him for that.  It is important also that I put on record today in this House that each one of us understands, acknowledges and pays tribute to the men and women of the Defence Forces and, in recognising the immense work they do both at home and abroad, it is important that we see a continuation of the rights and conditions of employment, and residency, of members of the Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, is meeting representative associations this week.  The Minister of State has also been actively involved with the management of the Defence Forces.  As Members will be fully aware, pay restoration is continuing for members of the public service and, as Senator Craughwell knows well, public sector pay is governed by collective agreement, negotiation and bargaining, and PDFORRA signed up to that.  On living conditions, we have seen an increase in funding for capital investment and I accept that there is much to do and there is a journey to take.<\/p> <p>The Defence Forces Chief of Staff received Government approval for participation in Operation Sophia.  As Members will be aware, Operation Sophia is subjection to the triple lock.  Tomorrow, in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, there will be a debate on the matter.  It would have no effect on our neutrality whatsoever.  It is a UN-mandated operation.  To reassure Senator Craughwell and other Members who have raised it, it is UN-mandated, it receives Government approval and D&aacute;il approval.<\/p> <p>I have put in a request to the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, to come to the House.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->While he is not available today or tomorrow, I am endeavouring to have the Minister of State come to the House next week.  I ask Senator Craughwell in the context of his amendment to allow me to try to have the Minister of State come to the House next week.  It is fair to say the report issued is one we must all take seriously, but as the Senator knows, Operation Sophia was launched in June 2015 as part of the EU's broader action to provide a bigger and broader European response to the issue of migration and the refugee crisis.  We have seen the way our Defence Forces, in the deployment to the Mediterranean, have operated and saved so many lives.  With the Senator's indulgence, if he will allow me to try to endeavour to have the Minister come to the House, I will do that next week.<\/p><p>Senator Ardagh also raised the issue of the Women's Homelessness in Europe report.  We should not take solace in any report that either highlights, admonishes or calls for more action regarding the issue of homelessness.  The Government has prioritised Rebuilding Ireland.  It is the platform on which Ireland will tackle its housing crisis.  We all accept that Rebuilding Ireland will take time, but in saying that, it is also worth outlining to the House that we have seen 830 families exit from commercial hotels and bed and breakfasts, and 405 families have been prevented from entering these types of arrangements.  It is important to recognise that under this Government, we have seen domestic violence legislation, which has prioritised the personal safety of women over property, and we have seen the issue of barring orders being changed.  I accept, as Senator Devine also referenced with regard to the national maternity strategy, there is a journey to take.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to Rebuilding Ireland.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has allocated a further &euro;10 million for additional family hubs to be provided, which will allow for 200 families to be accommodated.  All of us aspire to and want to reach a situation where nobody is homeless or living in a hotel or bed and breakfast.  While the figures remain stubbornly high, this is a priority for Government.  It is the only Department with a multi-annual budget.  It has had the largest amount of money ever allocated for the provision of housing.  That is the Government's priority.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, at the behest of the Taoiseach, is carrying out a review of aspects of Rebuilding Ireland, and if changes need to be made, he will make them.  We will certainly have the debate again in the autumn, but I would certainly be happy to have the Minister apprise us of the situation in the House.<\/p><p>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh raised the issue of the summer economic statement.  It is my intention to provide for a debate next week in the House with regard to the summer economic statement.  The Government is committed to ensuring that we have a mix of prudent management of the economy with a relief on taxation and investment in infrastructure.  The fiscal strategy of the Government is very transparent, as outlined by the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and previously by the former Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan.  I look forward to that debate next week in the House.  The summer economic statement will be the central plank of the reformed budgetary process, providing a policy background for discussion of options in advance of the budget, and it would be an opportunity for Members of this House to have their budgetary provisions tested, costed and debated.  I look forward to seeing the figures from Sinn F&eacute;in and its taxation policy coming under scrutiny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017071100002#X00700","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499779800,"counter":110,"content":"<p>Ours?

Senator Gallagher raised GP cover for rural areas.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House.  The ten-year health strategy has been published and we will have to wait for a debate on that.  We need to look at how we can change the health landscape in the context of an evolving Ireland.  A new Department responsible for rural Ireland is being created and that is something we can also debate.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of family carers, and commended them on their tremendous work in keeping more people at home.  I would be happy for the Minster, Deputy Regina Doherty, came to the House to discuss this.<\/p> <p>Senator Black mentioned Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael's decision to give rights to Sky for some of its matches.  That is a debate that must return to.  I am a member of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael and was on its marketing committee when we looked at all matters related to the GAA.  It is regrettable that we are in a situation where some matches are not on terrestrial television.  It means a smaller audience is able to watch it.  I accept the GAA needs to be able to make money on a commercial basis, but it is regrettable that some of the championship matches, such as the one between Waterford and Kilkenny last Saturday night, were unavailable to people.  It is something the GAA will return to.  Senator Black also referred to people having to go to public houses or other places where alcohol is served in order to see the games.  Having venues where no alcohol is sold is something that we might look at as a society.  I appreciate Senator Black has been a champion in this House of alternatives to alcohol.  <\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Coveney, is in Israel this week and is not available but I would be happy to have that debate as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell raised the motor insurance industry.  He made a good point that the industry is good at fobbing people off, and wearing them down until they pay a higher price.  When he was Minister of State in the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, had action points arising from the working group on insurance.  Senator O'Donnell is correct that there needs to be fair play from the insurance companies and we must ensure that they are held to account.<\/p> <p>Senator Grace O'Sullivan referred to the report this morning about the tourism industry which enjoys a 9% VAT rate.  The Senator knows it was a catalyst in terms of kick-starting the economy and it was put in place by the last Government.  It led to significant growth in employment and allowed for an increase in visitor numbers.  She is partly correct that because of Brexit and the policies of President Trump visitor numbers have fallen but we must also ask if we are giving value for money.  In this city, there has been an exponential increase in prices for accommodation and food.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On certain occasions all over the country there is a rip-off of people on the cost of hotel beds, whether it be for a concert, a match or whatever else.  I will have no difficulty in scheduling a debate on the abuse that takes place in the hospitality industry.  It is important, however, that we have a wider debate, as the Senator rightly said, with reference to the small hotelier, small restaurateur and the small shopkeeper who do not exploit or try to take advantage of such events.  This is about ensuring a just and fair price.  It is regrettable if a minority rip off customers.  I would never want us to return to the days of rip-off Ireland when people were charged an arm and a leg to stay in certain hotels.  I acknowledge that the Senator shares this view and hope we can the debate the issue in discussing the summer economic statement next week.  <\/p><p>The Senator was also correct to highlight the activities of rogue taxi drivers who, although in a minority, charge excess fares.  We must give credit to the majority of taxi drivers who provide an excellent service for charging a fair and just fee.<\/p><p>Senator David Norris made reference to the Rugby World Cup.  As he will be well aware, it is not the form of this Leader to ram Bills through the House and debate all Stages at once, but this legislation is important for us a nation.  In the context of what happened last weekend in New Zealand and the IRFU being an all-Ireland body, under which we can all play similar to Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael, it is imperative that we support the bid to host the Rugby World Cup.  I am happy to support it and every Member should do so.  As I said, it is not the norm to take all Stages of a Bill at once, but this is exceptional.<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of organ donation.

To the best of my knowledge, Government policy has not changed.  To his credit, the Taoiseach has appointed Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon as Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora to continue the work of the previous Ministers of State, Deputy Joe McHugh and former Deputy Jimmy Deenihan.  Ours was the first Government to appoint a Minister of State  with responsibility for the diaspora.  In addition, the Taoiseach has appointed Deputy John Deasy as a special envoy to the US Congress, with a particular focus on issues related to the undocumented Irish in the United States.  The previous Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, appointed our good friend and colleague, Senator Billy Lawless, as a representative also.  Good and positive energy is developing.  To be fair to Senator Mark Daly, he has been influential and very involved.  It is important that all Members, in working with the Government, raise the issue of the undocumented Irish and address the fear expressed in the recent RTE documentary and as articulated eloquently by Senator Billy Lawless in the House on many occasions.  We have a duty to ensure immigration reform in the United States.  It is a difficult time to try to achieve it, but it is important that we work collectively to ensure a result.<\/p> <p>Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor referred to the Citizens' Assembly.  I was happy when the Fine Gael LGBT group made a submission on the need to support the elderly, given that people are living longer.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Senator raises a good point and we will have that debate in the House.  Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operational matters are a matter for the Garda and I will not get into the matter the Senator raised.  It is important for common sense to apply to how people respond to accidents.<\/p><p>Senator M&aacute;ire Devine also raised the issue of maternity services and our ageing population.  I will be happy to have the Minister come to the House.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is committed to the implementation of the national maternity strategy.  It is important we recognise the importance of our elders, the contribution they have made to society and the need for all of us to make sure there is proper policy around that.  <\/p><p>Senator Mullen made reference to our elderly and the issue of them dealing with banks, financial services and a compendium of other bodies.  I agree with the Senator that it is the pace of change that is frightening people rather than the change itself.  For me, going into a teller-free bank is a daunting enough proposition but for people who are elderly trying to navigate the machines, punching in codes or numbers, whether a VHI number or telephone number,  is off-putting.  There is an obligation on the banks and other companies to slow down a small bit and work with people to give them an opportunity to participate.  Our elders are very willing to accept and embrace change but it is the pace of change, which the Senator makes reference to, that is an issue.  I fully agree with Senator Mullen.  There are a number of banks in Cork city where there are no cashiers and there are others where, when people walk in, they are ushered to a machine.  It is important.  It is equally as off-putting when one dials a number and has to push button one, button two, button three and before one gets to button four, one is back to button one.  It is hard for people who are trying to navigate.  It is important that people communicate and do so with sensitivity.  I accept the Senator's point on that.<\/p><p>Senator Conway made reference to the issue of mental health.  I commend the Leas-Chathaoirleach on his stewardship of the Seanad Public Consultation Committee and thank all Members who participated on it.  I missed last week's meeting but from reading the testimonies in the reports and coverage it was a very worthwhile exercise.  We look forward to the report coming forward.  Any work on a cross-party basis to promote mental health and to have a platform with a blueprint or roadmap arising from it is welcome.  There is a proposal to come before the D&aacute;il business committee which will come to our CPP.  I look forward to all of us in the House embracing it because the issue of mental health is one that transcends all political parties and all socioeconomic classes and which affects all parts of the country.  It is by working together that we can bring about change.  That is for the common good.  <\/p><p>Senator Warfield referenced the impending retirement and departure of Carl Corcoran.  I join with the Senator in congratulating and thanking him for his decade long tenure in promoting new Irish artists and international artists.  The work being done by him and other presenters - I am thinking of John Creedon on RTE Radio 1 - illustrates the importance of the licence fee that is being collected by the State.  All of us wish Carl Corcoran of \"The Blue of the Night\" well.  I will digress for a moment and also wish Marcus Connaughton well.  He retired as the presenter of the \"Seascapes\" programme which was another example of excellent public service broadcasting for the maritime community.  <\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile made reference to tomorrow being 12 July and the bonfires that will be lit in the North of our country.  We do not support the burning of effigies or flags but, in recognising the traditions in the North of our country, it is important that we all mutually respect each other and live together.  That has always been my practice as a Member of this House and as somebody who aspires to a United Ireland.  We must recognise the importance of both traditions but it is important that there is meaningful engagement regarding talks around flags and parades by all sides.  That is why I hope we will see a return to devolved Government in the North as soon as possible.  <\/p><p>I thank Senator Feighan and &Oacute; Donnghaile for congratulating Roscommon and wishing Down well.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I want to commend the Cork hurlers for last Sunday as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017071100002#AA01400","speaker":"1391","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499779800,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Up the Rebels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017071100002#CC00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1499779800,"counter":163,"content":"<p>If Senator Craughwell will accept my bona fides, I will endeavour to get a date from the Minister in regard to his request.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017071100002#CC00300","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1499779800,"counter":164,"content":"<p>In reply to the Leader-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017071100002#CC00400","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1499779800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I will call the Senator shortly.

He follows in the footsteps of the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, who marked the 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide two years ago.  I also want to welcome the members of the Bosnian community who are in the Visitors Gallery along with Peter Osborne and Bronagh Catibusic from the Remembering Srebrenica charity.  For those who are not aware, Remembering Srebrenica's work is targeted at tackling hatred and intolerance in order to build a better, safer and more cohesive society for everyone.<\/p> <p>Today we solemnly mark the 22nd anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  That horrific atrocity saw more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys killed.  It is the single greatest atrocity in Europe since the Second World War and remains a brutal reminder of man's humanity to man.  As we mark today's anniversary, we stand with members of the Bosnian community in Ireland in remembering those killed and acknowledge the loss of their family members and loved ones.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frank Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> We applaud the work of those involved in the pursuit of justice for the victims and their surviving relatives, including the International Commission on Missing Persons and the Mothers of Srebrenica, the courage and humility of which in the face of unthinkable horror are an inspiration to us all.  <\/p><p>On behalf of all Senators, I commend the work of the charity Remembering Srebrenica.  Through learning the lessons of Srebrenica, the UK charity teaches current and future generations about the consequences of hatred and intolerance in all communities.  Through raising awareness of this tragic and preventable genocide and working in communities, including in Ireland, North and South, the charity continues to help communities to learn the lessons of Srebrenica.  In 2016, for example, it worked with volunteers throughout the United Kingdom to honour the memory of the victims, survivors and families at more than 400 memorial events involving 50,000 people.  Its educational initiatives have reached 32,000 children since their launch in 2015.<\/p><p>We all support the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the wider region in their efforts to build a sustainable peace and achieve economic and social progress.  In this context, I acknowledge Ireland's commitment to a European perspective on Bosnia and Herzegovina, with other countries of the western Balkans.  From speaking closely to members of the Bosnian community in Ireland, I am very aware of their deep appreciation of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and its Members for commemorating the 22nd anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide.  The Bosnian community here wants to fully recognise the wider contribution Ireland has made in commemorating that awful event.  As a concerted response to the war in Bosnia in the 1990s, Ireland accepted more than 1,000 Bosnian refugees through a resettlement programme, many of whom had been ethnically cleansed from parts of eastern Bosnia, including Srebrenica, while some of them had survived the horrors of the Srebrenica genocide.  The Bosnian community in Ireland has been active for many years in commemorating the massacre and seeking justice for the victims of the genocide and other atrocities which occurred in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s.  I am also aware that the Bosnian community deeply appreciates the cross-party political support it has received in Ireland, including in 2015, on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the massacre.<\/p><p>This year the theme of the Srebrenica commemoration is \"gender and genocide\", recognising the courage and strength of Bosnian women who have been at the forefront of efforts to ensure the world will absolutely remember what happened in Srebrenica.  We must remember that among the victims were 15,000 to 20,000 Bosnian women and girls, some as young as 12 years, who were subjected to sexual violence.  The exact number of victims is not known because the majority have remained silent because of stigma, shame and fear.  In Ireland Bosnian women have played a key role in raising awareness of what happened in Bosnia through organising memorial events, informing Irish people of their country and fostering an intercultural understanding.  Yesterday in Belfast, for example, Remembering Srebrenica held a special commemoration at Belfast City Hall.  As part of the event Munira Suba&scaron;i, president of the Mothers of Srebrenica, spoke about her experience of the atrocity.  Members of the Bosnian community in Ireland are very grateful for the welcome they have received in this country in rebuilding their lives. They have contributed significantly to Irish society in the past 20 years.  Their experience of surviving conflict, overcoming trauma and successful integration is an inspiration, as Ireland again accepts refugees from wartorn countries such as Syria.<\/p><p>The motion reflects the European Parliament's resolution of 9 July 2015 which agreed that 11 July should be recognised throughout the European Union as a day of commemoration of the Srebrenica genocide.  We do not just honour the victims of the genocide; we all want to send a powerful message that such horrendous crimes must never happen again.  I will return to some of the remarks made by the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, two years ago in a statement in which he noted the genocide had taken place in living memory and should serve as a stark reminder of the need to learn the lessons of the past.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Frank Feighan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=11\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Whatever the political discourse, it is the duty of every country in Europe to work hard to promote peace, tolerance and mutual understanding.

Creating an unbearable situation of total insecurity and no hope for the future was the aim of the self-declared President of the Bosnian Serb community in March 1995, a few months prior to the massacre.  When the Bosnian Serbs took over Srebrenica on 11 July it was declared by the military leader that they would extract revenge on the Muslim community, and they did.  Over 80 sites were used for the execution and burial of almost 8,000 members of the Muslim community.  While there were 8,000 victims, there were 19,783 members of the Bosnian Serb community and Serbian nation involved in the massacre and only a handful of them were imprisoned.  Very few people will see justice served upon them and very few will see justice for the thousands who were massacred.  This, I suppose, is the tragic legacy of Srebrenica.<\/p> <p>I commend Senators Feighan and Richmond on bringing forth this motion.  In regard to the comments of the UN and EU on ensuring this does not happen again, the greatest insurance that it would never happen again is if those who perpetrated crimes that happened in Europe, within the reach of the EU, faced justice.  The fact that merely a handful of those involved were imprisoned tells us, taking into account what is happening in Aleppo and in regard to other atrocities and crimes against humanity, that tragically those who carried out these crimes will not face justice.  Worse than this, many of the 19,000 involved are high ranking officials who work in the public service.  Where have we seen this before?  We saw it in Germany in terms of the tens of thousands who served in the Auschwitz concentration camp and were officials and bureaucrats within the Nazi regime, who ended up working in the Government of East Germany, with the full knowledge of the allied powers and the German Government.  The policy in Germany into the 1970s and 1980s was such that the German state turned a blind eye towards the actions of its own citizens against the Jews, minorities and other people, including Slavs, Serbians and the Muslims of Yugoslavia.  The irony of this cannot be lost on us - that a democratic country like Germany would turn a blind eye to the actions of people who perpetrated horrendous crimes, genocide on an industrial scale.  The Serbian Government, while recognising the mass killings would not recognise it, and barely passed that resolution in its own Parliament, not because it was sorry about the crimes but because not doing so would block its accession to the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2017071100002#EE00400","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1499779800,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Additional debate to follow.<\/p>"}]
