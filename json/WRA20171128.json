I am pleased to have secured funding for Tusla to establish this service.  In my performance statement for Tusla's 2018 business plan preparations, I have asked that this important service is in place in early 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla has put in place a project team who are to re-organise services within an integrated national Tusla emergency service.  This builds on the existing infrastructure.  Key steps in the process are to put in place a national manager, have a single national contact number, provide social work advice and support on a 24 hour basis, and have a foster care service available for out of hours placements.  This will also see an on-call social worker service being available to receive children removed by Garda&iacute; under section 12, and accompany them to their identified placement.  A project plan is to be developed by Tusla management.  <\/p>  <p>  At present, there is a 24 hour Emergency Out Of Hours phone service  in place in all areas.  There is a dedicated phone number for Garda&iacute; and hospitals to access social work consultation out of hours.  There are also social workers available out of hours in Cork, and in the Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare area, on a 24 hour, 7 day a week basis.  Budget 2018 will enable Tusla to provide a greatly improved service, by integrating existing services, and ensuring the on-call availability of social workers throughout the country on a 24\/7 basis for emergency cases.  A project team has been established to implement the necessary changes.  <\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and Tusla recently visited a service  that provides the out of hour supports in Northern Ireland. The service they provide differs from ours, as it is a wider service for children and adults, and is a contact point for statutory social work involvement in mental health services.  It is aimed at urgent or emergency situations outside of normal office hours.  This provides important lessons about access to a round the clock social work service.<\/p>  <p>  In urgent situations, Garda&iacute; must be present to access premises or to remove a child to a place of safety as social workers do not have such legal powers.  For example, the decision to invoke section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 can only be made by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If a child in immediate danger, as with any other citizen, the correct course of action is to contact Garda&iacute; without delay.  Under the new emergency out of hours service, a social worker will be on-call to attend situations where a child has been removed by Garda&iacute; as an emergency measure under section 12 of the Child Care Act. <\/p>  <p>  The expanded Tusla Emergency Service will enable greater joint working between Garda&iacute; and Tusla, which will create better outcomes and faster responses for children at immediate risk.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800058#WRA01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800058#WRA01450"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[50188\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800058#WRA01500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when the report of the expert technical group dealing with the site of the former mother and baby home at Tuam, County Galway will be brought before Cabinet; when it is expected that the report will be discussed in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; if the report will be tabled for discussion before the end of the 2017 term; if not, the reason therefor; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>In June of this year I appointed a multi disciplinary team of technical experts to ensure that decisions on the future of the site of the former Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, Co.

The new Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) will provide financial support for parents towards the cost of childcare.  This new Scheme will replace the existing targeted childcare programmes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme and will include &ldquo;wraparound\u201f care for pre-school and school-age children. The ambition of this project is immense; its scope matched only in size by its complexity. This scheme aims to reduce poverty, facilitate labour activation, improve outcomes for children and tangibly reduce the cost of childcare for tens of thousands of families. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently putting in place the legal and technical infrastructures to underpin the Affordable Childcare Scheme. I am delighted to report that draft legislation to give our new approach a legal backbone is well advanced and publication of a draft Bill is expected before the end of the year. <\/p>  <p>  The building of a state of the art IT system to make subsidised childcare more accessible is also being advanced. The IT development is subject to scrutiny by a peer review group (PRG) at the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO).  The project has passed the first stage of the peer review process (reviewing the Business Case) and is close to completing the second stage (Request for Tender Stage).  <\/p>  <p>  Whilst delivering the scheme as soon as possible remains a priority, I believe that it is prudent to ensure we get the new systems right, so that they operate smoothly for everyone. Accordingly, in progressing our work, we strive to meet the highest standards available and avoid mistakes made on previous government IT projects. In doing so, we have committed ourselves to extensive consultation and peer review processes. <\/p>  <p>  While intensive work is underway, the project is heavily dependent on timelines beyond its immediate control, such as the advancement of legislation through the Oireachtas.  In particular, the timeframe is dependent upon ICT development.  Once we have completed the Request for Tender element of the project and have the successful developer in place, we will be able to confirm and communicate a timeline for the full introduction of the scheme.  Until then, I am not in a position to make a commitment on the exact launch date of ACS.  <\/p>  <p>  We are well on our way to introducing the Affordable Childcare Scheme. In the meantime, the families of 64,000 children or 91% of the children eligible for the measures introduced by my Department are already benefiting from financial support for their childcare, on a par with what will be delivered under the new scheme.

Even if no complaint is ever made, the ability to make a complaint to the Ombudsman or Ombudsman for Children is a key right of a child or a parent in respect of a service being received by the State. The previous exclusion of people in Direct Provision from making such a complaint was wrong in my view and I am glad that such an exclusion no longer exists.<\/p>  <p>  The Ombudsman for Children has statutory independence in the exercise of his functions under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002. I am aware that significant work has been done by the Ombudsman for Children's Office, the OCO, as part of this expanded remit. I understand that since April 2017 the OCO has visited every Direct Provision centre and Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre in the country where children and young people under 18 reside. This was primarily to raise awareness and understanding of  the OCO's role to examine and investigate complaints. It is important that both residents and service providers are aware of the role of the Ombudsman for Children.  <\/p>  <p>  I am also aware that, in the context of its complementary statutory function to promote children's rights and welfare, the OCO is delivering workshops on children's rights for children living in Direct Provision. These workshops have been delivered in 9 Direct Provision centres since September 2017 and I understand that the OCO is planning to deliver further such workshops during 2018. <\/p>  <p>  My Department was represented on the Working Group on the Protection Process that was chaired by Judge Bryan McMahon that published its report in June 2015. One of that Group's recommendations was that the remit of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children should be extended to complaints relating to services to residents of direct provision accommodation centres and to transfer decisions following breach of rules. <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department also assisted the Department of Justice and Equality in consulting with children in Direct Provision centres on what they thought about their lives in these places.

It is my Department&rsquo;s policy that the use of any restrictive practice should only be a measure of last resort and as part of a continuum of planned interventions.  The decision to separate a young person must at all times be a proportionate response to the risk posed by the young person. <\/p>  <p>  After the publication of my Department&rsquo;s national policy on single separation in January 2017, a review of the Separation Policy for Oberstown took place, and the Oberstown Board of Management approved the revised Single Separation Policy in April 2017.

All staff are receiving refresher training on the revised policy and will receive training on the revised operational procedures also. <\/p>  <p>  An improved system of record keeping on the use of single separation has been further informed by an audit review that looked  at staff compliance with campus procedures and policies. In order to ensure compliance with procedures senior management must sign off on periods of separation and, following risk assessments, any reviews for an extension. This process has been strengthened by making senior management available to front line staff on a 24\/7 basis to sanction the initiation or extension of a period of separation.<\/p>  <p>  Children who are remanded or sentenced at Oberstown have multiple complex needs and vulnerabilities.

I am happy to report that progress is being made across all 15 actions of the plan I put in place to address the issues raised in the report commissioned by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into the use of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991, as amended.  The Strategic Liaison Committee, referred to below, is a high level forum between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla which facilitates liaison on inter-agency matters.  The current status of the recommendations is as follows:<\/p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.1 - Cultural change is being addressed by means of regular meetings by senior managers in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  The Strategic Liaison Committee, attended by senior representatives of Tusla and the Garda&iacute; meets quarterly.<\/p>  <p>  -  Recommendations 6.3.3 and 6.3.14 - the assessment of needs and provision of supports for families and children are being addressed through Tusla's roll out of a new single national approach to child protection from November 2017 on.  The \"Signs of Safety\" approach will help ensure appropriate supports and interventions are in place for families. <\/p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.5 - Substance misuse issues as a key indicator of risk: I have written to my colleague, the Minister for Health, bringing the concerns highlighted in the report about alcohol and substance misuse, and about children's mental health issues to his attention.  It is noted that the Signs of Safety approach will continue to include parental use of drugs and alcohol as a core part of child assessment<\/p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.6 Data protection: The Strategic Liaison Committee is planning to bring any actions or legislative change to the attention of myself and Minister Flanagan at the start of 2018.  <\/p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.7 - Protocols to support the commencement of the Children First Act 2015: A protocol between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla is being finalised in advance of the commencement of the remaining provisions of the Children First Act 2015.  <\/p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.13 - Assigning social workers to national specialist Garda child protection units: The Garda National Child Protection Unit has now been established.  A senior staff member from Tusla has been working within the unit on an informal basis for some time and this position can now be formalised.  <\/p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.14 - Appropriate assessment of the child's needs, including the child's mental health: My Department has written to the Departments of Health and Education in relation to the medical, educational and emotional needs of children subject to an emergency child protection action. My Department has also written to Tusla and the Strategic Liaison Committee to seek confirmation on the issue of impact and trauma, noting that Tusla's Signs of Safety approach to practice provides an appropriate, proportionate, and timely response to children 'at risk\/in need'. <\/p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.17.1 - Delegation of Tusla's role under section 12:  Tusla indicates that it was never the case that its role was implemented by a private provider. This is and has been exercised by Tusla.  The private provider was contracted to make sure there were placements available to Tusla in these cases.  <\/p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.17.2 - Use of foster placements and applicability of section 36(1)(b) of the Act:  Tusla notes that a child received under section 12 is not in care but is in Tusla's custody.  Tusla provides foster placements under section 15 of the Act that provides for accommodation of children for the purposes of part 3 of the Act (Protection of Children in Emergencies), which includes section 12.  <\/p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.17.3 - Applicability of Child Care Act and regulations to foster care providers used to provide accommodation in urgent or emergency cases: Tusla have confirmed that the standards and regulatory obligations applicable to foster care generally are also applicable to foster care placements on an emergency basis - be that private provider or otherwise.  <\/p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.17.4 - Standards to be applied for foster placements used under Part 3 Protection of Children in Emergencies of the Child Care Act 1991:  Irrespective of the pathway into Tusla&rsquo;s care, a placement with a private provider is subject to relevant standards.  Private providers are inspected by HIQA under national standards.   <\/p>  <p>  -  Recommendation 6.3.17.5 - Social work service to be provided out of normal office hours:  Tusla&rsquo;s immediate plan to enhance the out of hours service includes the integration of the three existing out of hours services into one national service.  The Minister has secured funding in Budget 2018 and has asked Tusla to progress this project in early 2018.<\/p>  <p>  I would note that research into the use of emergency care orders, under section 13 of the Child Care Act, is also progressing with Tusla.    <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the power to enter a premises and remove a child to a place of safety if they have formed the view that there is immediate risk to the child and there is insufficient time to seek an emergency care order through the Courts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800059#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Care Services Staff","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800059#WRB03750"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[50193\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800059#WRB03800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 71 of 17 October 2017, if a child care facility (details supplied) will be supported.","asker":"1291","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>My Department made &euro;1m of &lsquo;CE Sustainability Funding&rsquo; available in 2017 to support services that had been impacted by staff qualification requirements in the 2016 Regulations.

The 2017\/2018 numbers are expected (and on track) to be in line with 2016\/2017 uptake. Further, from September 2018, the ECCE Programme will revert to one single entry point in a given ECCE Programme Year (i.e. September) with eligible children entitled to two full years of ECCE provision. From September 2018, the number of ECCE enrolments in any given year will be around 114,000.

My Department obtained advice on the issue of civil fines from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that civil fines are not provided for in Irish law for anti-competitive practices having regard to Article 38.1 of the Constitution which provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law. In that context, any national legislation to introduce civil fines that would lower the burden of proof from beyond reasonable doubt to the balance of probability would pose constitutional difficulties having regard to the protection afforded in Article 38.1 of the Constitution. <\/p>  <p>  On 22 March 2017, the EU Commission published a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council to empower the competition authorities of the Member States to be more effective enforcers and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market. One of the Directive&rsquo;s aims is to ensure that all National Competition Authorities are able to impose effective deterrent fines. The proposal is currently being debated at the Council Working Group on Competition and is also being considered by the European Parliament. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the Law Reform Commission published an Issues Paper entitled \"Regulatory Enforcement and Corporate Offences\" on 27 January 2016. The Issues Paper invited views on the supervisory and enforcement powers of the State&rsquo;s main financial and economic regulators (including the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission)(CCPC) and the issue of administrative and civil fines was raised. I understand the CCPC made a submission to the Law Reform Commission on 19 September 2017 in response to the Issues Paper requesting the power to levy such fines.  Any recommendations or proposals that may emanate from this exercise in due course will be carefully considered by my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800060#WRC06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts Data","counter":164,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800060#WRC06700"},{"type":"question","counter":165,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[50394\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800060#WRC06800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the public contracts between his Department and companies (details supplied) in each of the years 2011 to 2016; the value of each contract; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":166,"content":"<p>Details of contracts between the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the companies in question during the period 2011-2016 are set out in the tables.<\/p><p><b>2011<\/b><table><tr><th>Company <\/th><th>Details of   Contract<\/th><th>Value of   Contract<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Nil <\/td><td>N\/A <\/td><td>N\/A <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>2012<\/b><table><tr><th>Company <\/th><th>Details of   Contract<\/th><th>Value of   Contract<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Nil <\/td><td>N\/A <\/td><td>N\/A <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>2013<\/b><table><tr><th>Company <\/th><th>Details of   Contract<\/th><th>Value of   Contract<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Nil <\/td><td>N\/A <\/td><td>N\/A <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>2014<\/b><table><tr><th>Company <\/th><th>Details of   Contract<\/th><th>Value of   Contract<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Ernest &amp;amp; Young<\/td><td>Analysis of Sectoral Ecosystems &ndash; Input to Enterprise Policy 2025 &ndash; Strategic Policy Division<\/td><td>61,461.00 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>2015<\/b><table><tr><th>Company <\/th><th>Details of   Contract<\/th><th>Value of   Contract<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>*Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche<\/td><td>Forensic Accounting and Analysis<\/td><td>&euro;23,249.46 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><b>2016<\/b><table><tr><th>Company <\/th><th>Details of   Contract<\/th><th>Value of   Contract<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>*Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche<\/td><td>Forensic Accounting and Analysis<\/td><td>&euro;8,260.68 <\/td><\/tr><\/table>*Both sets of data relate to a single contract, which was paid for in phases; the total paid was &euro;31,510.14.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800060#WRC06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Direct Investment","counter":167,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800060#WRC07000"},{"type":"question","counter":168,"qnumday":100,"qnumall":"[50670\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800060#WRC07100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the reason counties Roscommon, Leitrim and Meath were not allocated funds from of the &euro;93 million in funding for grant aid that was distributed by the Industrial Development Authority to help develop and support foreign direct investment in these counties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":169,"content":"<p>Regional development remains a key priority of mine and I am determined to help drive job creation all over Ireland, including in counties Roscommon, Leitrim and Meath.

Revenue allows a deduction of 10% of the market value of the benefit in respect of each person who has a right of residence.

A credit equal to 80% of the market value of the item donated can be set against taxpayers&rsquo; liabilities for certain taxes.<\/p><p>The heritage item(s) must be an outstanding example of the type of item involved, pre-eminent in its class, whose export from the State would constitute a diminution of Ireland&rsquo;s accumulated cultural heritage or whose import into the State would constitute a significant enhancement of the accumulated cultural heritage of Ireland and must be suitable for acquisition by the Approved Bodies which include the National Archives, National Gallery, National Library and National Museum.  The determination as to whether an item is a suitable heritage item under the scheme is carried out by a selection committee of experts, and is subject to valuation limits.<\/p><p>Section 1003A of the TCA provides that tax relief is available in respect of the donation of heritage property to the Irish Heritage Trust or the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, subject to provisions that the property is a suitable heritage property, for example that it is of significant historical or scientific value.  The scheme takes the form of a non-refundable payment on account of tax of an amount equal to 50 per cent of the market value of the heritage property donated and can be credited against particular tax liabilities incurred by the donor.  There is a ceiling of &euro;6 million on the aggregate value of heritage properties that may be approved for donation in any one year.<\/p><p>Section 611 of the\u00a0TCA provides that where an asset is disposed of for no consideration to the State to a charity or to other specified bodies such as the National Archives, the National Gallery, the National Library or the National Museum, the disposal is treated as not giving rise to either a gain or a loss for capital gains tax purposes. <\/p><p>Section 76 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 provides that where a gift or an inheritance is taken for public or charitable purposes the beneficiary is exempt from both gift tax and inheritance tax and the gift or inheritance is not taken into account when computing tax to the extent that Revenue is satisfied that it has been, or will be, applied for purposes which in accordance with the laws of the State are public or charitable. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800061#WRD04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies Data","counter":212,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800061#WRD04800"},{"type":"question","counter":213,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[50115\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800061#WRD04900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the bodies under the aegis his Department to which his Department provides in excess of &euro;1 million funding per annum;

The Risk Assessment(s) will form part of\u00a0the employer's\u00a0Safety Statement.<\/p><p>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 set out the First-Aid requirements for workplaces as follows: &quot;Employers have a duty to provide first-aid equipment at all places at work where working conditions require it. Depending on the size or specific hazard (or both) of the place of work, trained occupational first-aiders must also be provided. Apart from some exceptions, first-aid rooms must be provided where appropriate. Information must also be provided to employees as regards the first-aid facilities and arrangements in place.&quot;<\/p><p>It is important that the school management authority requests parents to ensure that the school is made aware of any medical condition suffered by any student attending. Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more students, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a student suffers from an illness requiring, for example, the administration of medication, that appropriate treatment is available.<\/p><p>Where a child requires adult assistance to assist in the administration of medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose.<\/p><p>It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of stedents for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school when appointing an SNA. <\/p><p>Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner.

This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.<\/p>  <p>  Enrolment in an ASD special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he\/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports. <\/p>  <p>  Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that: <\/p>  <p>  - S\/he has ASD <\/p>  <p>  - S\/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2013\/14 the NCSE has increased the number of post primary ASD special classes by over 100% from 124 in 2013\/14 to 276 for the 2017\/18 school year.<\/p>  <p>  The continued growth in post primary special class numbers is a natural consequence of the earlier growth in primary special class numbers.  However, it should not be assumed that the same levels of growth in post primary class numbers should apply.  This is because, for children with Autism, transferring from a special class in a primary school to a special class in a post primary school may not always be the optimal choice. Many children can progress to mainstream post primary with support of SNA and Resource Teaching hours, while more may transfer from primary to a special school depending on their presentation and needs.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to Carrigaline, there are 4 Post Primary ASD Special Classes, including 1 newly established class.  The NCSE continues to review Post Primary special class placement requirements in the area and have informed my Department that they are currently satisfied that there are sufficient places to meet existing demand. <\/p>  <p>  In order to identify need in the area for forthcoming school years, the NCSE refer to professional reports indicating students require the support of a special class. In this regard Parents\/Guardians of students with ASD seeking a special class placement should provide the relevant professional report to their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) to inform the planning process. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE will continue to engage with schools in the area in opening ASD special classes in future years as required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800063#WRF04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Appeals","counter":350,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800063#WRF04700"},{"type":"question","counter":351,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[49956\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800063#WRF04800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when a decision will issue to a person (details supplied) on their appeal for school transport.","asker":"1268","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":352,"content":"<p>School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.<\/p><p>Currently over 114,000 children, including\u00a0over 11,000 children with special educational needs, are being transported in over 4,500 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually.<\/p><p>Under the terms of my Department's Post Primary School Transport Scheme children are eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest school as determined by my Department\/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language. <\/p><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department, has advised that the child is not attending her nearest school and is therefore not eligible for school transport.<\/p><p>Children who are not eligible for school transport, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only which is subject to a number of conditions including the availability of spare seats on an existing service and payment of the annual charge.<\/p><p>In cases where distance eligibility is marginal or in dispute, vehicles fitted with calibrated measuring devices which measure the distance down to the nearest metre may be used to establish the exact distance and\/or the nearest school to the child's home.<\/p><p>In this regard, Bus &Eacute;ireann has been requested to carry out a calibrated measurement from the home of the child in question to the school attended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800063#WRF04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Protected Disclosures","counter":353,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800063#WRF05000"},{"type":"question","counter":354,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[49967\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800063#WRF05100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of protected disclosures he has received since protected disclosures legislation entered into force; and the dates of the protected disclosures and organisations affected.

The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases.

Galway City is one of these areas.  This review takes account of updated enrolment and child benefit data and also the impact of existing and planned capacity increases to existing schools in the area.  Notwithstanding that the Galway City area, including environs, is an area defined as a demographic growth area, it is also an area where certain schools are experiencing a decline in pupil numbers. <\/p>  <p>  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:<\/p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to demand for particular models of school provision, it should be noted that the patronage process for new schools is a separate process.  This process is run after it has been decided that a new school is required.

These expressions of interest are required to be from parents of primary school children eligible for enrolment in the first five years of the establishment of a proposed new post-primary school.

Some 2,300 new teachers were recruited in 2016-2017 and 2,900 are being recruited in 2017-2018.  The figure of 2,900 is 21% more than the number announced in budget 2017, so we have in fact been able to recruit more new teachers than we have announced.  All of the 2016-2017 posts have been successfully filled and the process for filling the additional posts in the current year is almost complete.  We are successfully filling the posts that we are making available.<\/p>  <p>  However, I am aware that some schools have reported difficulties in recruiting substitute teachers at primary level and in certain subjects at post primary level, and I am committed to examining all possible means of addressing these issues.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding issues around finding substitution at primary level, there are strong career opportunities in teaching and the number of permanent full-time positions are currently increasing at over 1,000 per year in 2016\/2017 and 2017\/2018.  Due to the additional permanent positions being created, young teachers have greater opportunities to take on permanent positions, and as a result some schools may be experiencing issues in hiring teachers to fill temporary or substitute roles, which arise in schools for a number of reasons, including covering sick leave and career breaks.<\/p>  <p>  At post primary level I have taken certain initiatives to address some of the supply pressures in particular subject areas.  These include, as part of the implementation of the Policy on Gaeltacht Education, increasing from 2018\/19 the number of places available on the existing Irish medium post primary initial teacher education programme in NUIG, to which I have granted two additional posts from September 2017.  This measure will strengthen the Irish-language proficiency of newly qualified teachers across a range of subjects and, it is anticipated, also increase the supply of Irish language teachers.  I have also increased from 85 to 101 the number of students admitted to St Angela&rsquo;s, Sligo to follow the Home Economics ITE programme in the current year, with further expansions in future years being considered.<\/p>  <p>  I have also undertaken measures to increase the pool of teachers available to schools in particular to fill short term vacancies.  My Department informed all teachers retiring in 2017 that in order to remain eligible for employment in a state funded teaching post for a period of more than five consecutive days or to supervise the State examinations, a teacher must maintain his\/her registration with the Teaching Council.  My Department also increased the limits for employment while on career break at primary level to a maximum of 90 days in a school year.  In addition, as a longer term measure, under my Department&rsquo;s Gaeltacht Policy, an RFT is currently being developed for a new Irish-medium B.Ed. (primary teaching) ITE programme.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the report of the Technical Working Group on teacher supply, &lsquo;Striking the Balance&rsquo; which, while focussing on the development of a model of primary teacher supply, outlined the work which will be required to establish a long term model of post-primary teacher supply.  The Deputy will appreciate that there are difficulties in developing a reliable model of teacher supply, particularly at second level, and this was recognised in the work of the Teaching Council as teaching is competing with many other sectors for graduates in areas like Maths, Science, and Irish.  The Teaching Council, which has an advisory role in this matter, recently convened a consultative forum on teacher supply with relevant stakeholders with the aim of producing teacher supply proposals and I look forward to seeing the report from this forum which will further inform our thinking in this matter. <\/p>  <p>  I am currently reviewing with my Department other potential initiatives on teacher supply.  In that context my Department has engaged with the HEA with a view to obtaining baseline data to support future policy decisions in this area.  My Department also intends engaging with other stakeholders, including school management bodies, in this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800064#WRG05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":428,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800064#WRG05800"},{"type":"question","counter":429,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[50357\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800064#WRG05900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if the staffing appeal submitted by a school (details supplied) in County Cork will be reviewed; his views on whether the appeal criteria do not take enough consideration of the issues facing small schools and multigrade classes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1283","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":430,"content":"<p>The criteria used for the allocation of teaching posts is published annually on the Department website.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. <\/p>  <p>  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location.<\/p>  <p>  The Staffing Schedule includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds.  The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board.  This process includes a provision in which schools that are not gaining an additional teaching post under the developing schools criterion can submit an appeal to the independent Appeals Board.  This appeal criterion is targeted at those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places and so assist the response to demographic growth within their area. <\/p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy submitted an application for consideration by the Appeals Board at its October meeting under the criteria of alleviating some of the pressure on class sizes at infants level.  The appeal was refused by the Appeals Board on the basis that the grounds of the appeal did not warrant the allocation of an additional post for the 2017\/18 school year.  The school has been notified of the outcome of the appeal. <\/p>  <p>  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2018 provides for an additional 1280 teaching posts in the 2018\/19 school year.

Human rights protections form a vital part of the institutional underpinning for the peace settlement founded on the Good Friday Agreement and serve to build and maintain confidence for communities across Northern Ireland. The protection of human rights in Northern Ireland - including through the incorporation into law of the European Convention on Human Rights - is one of the key principles of the Agreement, as set out in the chapter on Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity.  It is important to be clear that the European Convention on Human Rights is separate and distinct to the European Union. The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU has no impact on its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Even after the UK leaves the EU, there remains a continuing obligation on the British Government to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into Northern Ireland law, as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.  In this regard, it is welcome that the UK Government&rsquo;s White Paper on legislating for withdrawal from the EU that was published in March clarified that it has no plans to leave the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p><p>In February, as part of the All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit, the Government convened a Sectoral Dialogue on Human Rights under the Good Friday Agreement to hear the views of civil society, North and South, on the possible implications of Brexit for this pivotal chapter of the Agreement. This was a very valuable exchange and a number of key themes emerged, which have been communicated publicly, which are informing the Government&rsquo;s approach in this area, including as set out in the comprehensive document, <i>Ireland and the negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union<\/i>, published by the Government on 2 May.<\/p><p>The Government&rsquo;s programme of engagement with EU partners has ensured that Ireland&rsquo;s unique issues and concerns have been fully understood by the EU27 and have been reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position for the Article 50 negotiations with the UK.  In this regard, the Guiding Principles for the dialogue on Ireland\/Northern Ireland, which were published by the European Commission Article 50 Task Force in September, confirm that European Union law and practice has provided a supporting framework in Northern Ireland and across the island for the Good Friday Agreement provisions on Rights, Safeguards and Equality of Opportunity. They state that the Good Friday Agreement requires equivalent standards of protection of rights in Ireland and Northern Ireland and that the United Kingdom should ensure that no diminution of rights is caused by the United Kingdom&rsquo;s departure from the European Union, including in the area of protection against forms of discrimination currently enshrined in Union law. This position has been conveyed by the European Commission Task Force to the UK in the Article 50 negotiations in the High Level Dialogue on Ireland and Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously our responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles, including in the area of human rights. The Government will continue to pursue, with our EU partners, an outcome to the Article 50 process that protects our headline priorities and Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interests, including to ensure protection of and respect for the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800066#WRJ00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":515,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800066#WRJ00600"},{"type":"question","counter":516,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[49866\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800066#WRJ00700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"to set out the 142 areas of North-South co-operation that his Department is working on in the context of Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":517,"content":"<p>North South cooperation brings very tangible benefits to the daily lives of people and, in particular, to those living in the border regions where it contributes to improving economic opportunity and development.

North South cooperation between Ireland and Northern Ireland is one of the central elements of the Good Friday Agreement. The EU Taskforce&rsquo;s Guiding Principles for the Dialogue on Ireland\/Northern Ireland indicated that it is &ldquo;necessary for the European Union and the United Kingdom to examine whether, and if so how, the fact that European Union law ceases to apply in the United Kingdom after withdrawal might impact on continued cooperation and whether specific provisions need to be inserted in the Withdrawal Agreement&rdquo;.   Officials have been carrying out detailed work over the last few weeks to map out areas of cooperation that operate on a North South basis on the island of Ireland and which rely on EU law and policies.

The Irish Government made a very strong offer for the EBA to be located in Dublin. I wish to acknowledge the work carried out across government departments and agencies on our bid, which was well-received around Europe and viewed as strong and very competitive.

In addition, the OPW has recently tendered for the provision of a new male and female two-storey locker facility to be in place by the end of April 2018.

However, the provisions of the Fire Services Acts of 1981 and 2003 are relevant to the station. <\/p>  <p>  The Acting Chief Fire Officer in Sligo has advised that, following a fire safety inspection conducted on 25 November 2017, he is satisfied that Garda management are fulfilling their obligations under Section 18 (2) of the Fire Services Acts as far as is reasonably practicable and that, from a fire safety perspective, it is safe for personnel of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to occupy the premises. <\/p>  <p>  Further, on Monday 27 November 2017, two inspectors from the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) visited the station and identified some necessary improvement works of a relatively minor nature.  Based on their observations and assurances given in relation to planned improvements that are to be made, the HSA advised that it would have no concerns about members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na using the station as a place of work.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW considers that, while the building requires some upgrade works in order to bring it completely in line with current regulations, it is safe and fit for occupation.  These upgrade works were included in proposed scheme of works that were submitted to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for consideration and approval (and referred to in the proposals made by Garda management to the GRA at the meeting on 17 November 2017).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800067#WRK03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":609,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800067#WRK03500"},{"type":"question","counter":610,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[49917\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800067#WRK03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to reallocate resources to Ballymore Eustace Garda station in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":611,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including responsibility for the formulation of proposals in relation to the opening and closing of Garda stations.

The Act also covers those working in medical services in hospitals, including doctors, nurses, psychiatrists and others involved in the provision of treatment and care.  Section 19 of the 1994 Act provides that any person who assaults or threatens to assault any of these front-line workers is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;5,000 or a term of imprisonment of up to 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term of up to 7 years or both.

The penalty on summary conviction for such an offence is a fine of up to &euro;2,500 or imprisonment for a term of up to 6 months or both.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in the case of assault causing serious harm, an offender can be prosecuted under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 which deals comprehensively with a wide range of assault provisions, the more serious of which carry heavy penalties.  That Act provides for penalties of up to 5 years in prison for an offence of assault causing harm and for a penalty of life imprisonment for an offence of causing serious harm.  This general law relating to assault has application to all citizens, including front-line emergency workers such as fire service personnel.<\/p>  <p>  As already outlined, the law recognises the need to protect members of the emergency services carrying out their duties and provides strong penalties where offences against front-line workers are committed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800067#WRK06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Family Reunification Policy","counter":637,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800067#WRK06400"},{"type":"question","counter":638,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[50026\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800067#WRK06500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans to introduce measures to allow family members join refugees and asylum seekers here; the public policy implications of such measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":639,"content":"<p>On 14 November last, together with my colleague, the Minister of State with special responsibility for Equality, Immigration and Integration, David Stanton T.D., I announced a new scheme of family reunification in support of refugees and their families, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitments under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP).

When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed\u00a0Response Unit, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. <\/p><p>I am further informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, close to 1,400 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 35, 49 and 44 of whom were assigned to the Tipperary Division, Waterford Division and the Kilkenny\/Carlow Division respectively. \u00a0In addition, another\u00a0200 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest\u00a0next month\u00a0which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.\u00a0 The substantial increase in Garda numbers\u00a0is tangible progress on achieving\u00a0this Government&rsquo;s vision of\u00a0an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.<\/p><p>I am pleased to say that Budget 2018 will support the continuation of this high level of investment in the Garda workforce and ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. A further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College, an additional 500 civilians will also be recruited to\u00a0fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.\u00a0There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training early in 2018.<\/p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0 We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division, including the Tipperary Division, Waterford Division and the Kilkenny\/Carlow Division, in the coming years.<\/p><p>The strength of\u00a0the Tipperary Division, Waterford Division and the Kilkenny\/Carlow Division in each of the years 2013-2016 and on 30 September 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are as set out in the following table.<table><tr><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th><\/th><th>Garda\u00a0Strength by Division 2013 - 2017<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Division<\/td><td>2013<\/td><td>2014<\/td><td>2015<\/td><td>2016<\/td><td>2017*<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>371<\/td><td>359<\/td><td>354<\/td><td>364<\/td><td>372<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>274<\/td><td>274<\/td><td>282<\/td><td>277<\/td><td>285 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny\/Carlow<\/td><td>289<\/td><td>279<\/td><td>284<\/td><td>296<\/td><td>318<\/td><\/tr><\/table>*Up to 30 September 2017<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800068#WRL01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Expenditure","counter":657,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800068#WRL01600"},{"type":"question","counter":658,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[50228\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800068#WRL01700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Garda mountain bikes purchased in 2016 and to date in\u00a02017; if further funding has been made available to purchase additional bikes in 2018.","asker":"1291","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":659,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will\u00a0appreciate, decisions in relation to the provision and allocation of Garda resources, including mountain bikes, are a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the light of his identified operational demands and the availability of resources and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that no mountain bikes were\u00a0purchased by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na\u00a0in 2016 and to date in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  I am further informed that in late 2015, 100 mountain bikes were purchased and that these were distributed to Divisions in early 2016.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service. However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner. The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; is forecast at just over &euro;1.7 billion in 2017. <\/p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively. This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.<\/p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster (Versatis) is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults. It was reimbursed in the community drugs schemes from 2010. The projected budget impact was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure has increased significantly, from &euro;9.4 million in 2012 to over &euro;30 million in 2016, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. Currently, over 25,000 patients receive this item. <\/p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of Versatis highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data and its value is uncertain for all other types of pain. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, between 5-10% of prescribing of this product is for the licensed indication of PHN. <\/p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for Versatis from 1 September 2017. This process supports the appropriate use of Versatis, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. The HSE estimates that this protocol will reduce expenditure on this product by approximately 90%.<\/p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who receive antivirals for shingles are automatically approved for Versatis for three months. No action is required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy is notified of his or her approval status.<\/p><p>All patients who currently use Versatis have been identified and automatically registered on the HSE-PCRS system for three months and will continue to receive the treatment from their pharmacy until 30 November 2017. However, from 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients will no longer get Versatis under the community drugs schemes. The HSE has produced information leaflets for patients and advised GPs on treatment alternatives. <\/p><p>In exceptional circumstances, the product may be approved for supply through the community schemes for unlicensed indications. GPs apply for reimbursement for unlicensed indications through the online system. The MMP reviews applications before a decision is made and communicated to the GP.<\/p><p>Full details of the Versatis review are available on the HSE website at .<\/p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.

This commitment is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.

For a person to be admitted as an involuntary patient, there is a three-stage process involving an initial application, a recommendation from a General Practitioner and an assessment by a Consultant Psychiatrist that the person under examination suffers from a mental disorder and meets the conditions for involuntary admission as set out in Section 3 of the Act.  Such admissions are subject to review by a Mental Health Tribunal.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to point out that any assessment of whether a person should be admitted as an involuntary patient because he\/she is deemed to be suffering from a mental disorder, will take into account the question of whether there is a serious likelihood of the person concerned causing immediate and serious harm to himself or herself or to other persons.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be mentioned that Section 8(2) of the Act specifically prohibits the detention under the Act of individuals who suffer from a personality disorder, are socially deviant, or are addicted to drugs or intoxicants.  However, where individuals with such conditions are also diagnosed with a mental disorder, then they may be subject to detention but only because of the presence of a mental disorder.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Dual Diagnosis, the HSE's Mental Health Division recognised the need for a Clinical Programme for Dual Diagnosis to respond to people with substance misuse, both alcohol and\/or drugs, together with mental illness.  The HSE's Primary Care Division has already appointed a National Clinical Lead for the Addiction Services to improve its response to drug and alcohol abuse at primary care level and this Clinical Lead will work with the Mental Health Clinical Lead to develop a cohesive programme for those with a dual diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  The aims of this Programme are to develop a standardised evidence-based approach to the identification, assessment and treatment of comorbid mental illness and substance misuse.  An integral part of the Dual Diagnosis Programme will be to devise a model of care that will outline how all adolescents and adults suspected of having a moderate to severe mental illness coexisting with significant substance misuse have access to a timely mental health services nationally.  This is to be delivered on a CHO basis.  The aim will be for the service to be provided in an integrated manner across the HSE's Primary Care Division and the Mental Health Service and will ensure that there are close working relationships with the relevant specialities in the Acute Hospital Groups which will deal with any medical comorbidities that may occur, particularly in those with alcohol misuse.<\/p>  <p>  A National Working Group, made up of key stakeholders with clinical, service user and service provider expertise, has been appointed.  The Group had its first meeting in mid October 2017 and has initiated a work plan to develop a Model of Care based on a Programmatic approach to service improvement and development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800070#WRN04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vacancies on State Boards","counter":819,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800070#WRN04500"},{"type":"question","counter":820,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[49938\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800070#WRN04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of vacancies in each State board under the aegis of his Department, in tabular form.","asker":"1239","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":821,"content":"<p>The basis for the nomination of members to the boards of bodies under the aegis of my Department is usually set out in legislation.

Patients may access the healthcare they require in either the public or private healthcare system of another Member State under the CBD. Access to healthcare abroad is based on patients following public patient pathways, i.e. they must demonstrate they have followed the equivalent public patient pathways that a patient would follow if accessing public healthcare in Ireland.  It is important to note that reimbursement is confined to the costs of the care itself and that the rates of reimbursement cannot exceed the cost of provision of the care if it were provided in the Irish public health service.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE operates the CBD in Ireland. Referral for care under the CBD may be made by a GP, a hospital consultant and certain other clinicians. In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE through the National Contact Point (NCP) provides information for patients on the CBD on its website which can be accessed at www.hse.ie\/eng\/services\/list\/1\/schemes\/cbd\/ and also by phone at 056 7784551.  The HSE advises where a patient is in any doubt as to the need to seek prior authorization before availing of a consultation or treatment abroad to contact the NCP. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE also operates the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) for persons entitled to treatment in another EU\/EEA Member State or Switzerland under EU Regulation (EC) No. 883\/2004, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulations (EC) No. 987\/2009. The TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU\/EEA member state or Switzerland through the issue of form E112 (IE) where the treatment is:<\/p>  <p>  -  Among the benefits provided for by Irish legislation; <\/p>  <p>  -  Not available in Ireland; and <\/p>  <p>  -  Not available within the time normally necessary for obtaining it in Ireland, taking account of the patient's current state of health and the probable course of the disease.<\/p>  <p>  GPs refer patients to consultants for acute care and it is the treating consultant who, having exhausted all treatment options including tertiary care within the country, refers the patient abroad under the terms of the TAS. The consultant must specify the specific treatment and in making the referral accepts clinical responsibility in relation to the physician and facility abroad where the patient will attend. <\/p>  <p>  Applications to the TAS are processed and a determination given in accordance with the statutory framework prior to a patient travelling to avail of treatment. The statutory framework stipulates the patient must be a public patient and is required to have followed public patient pathways. Information on the TAS can be accessed on the HSE website at  www.hse.ie\/eng\/services\/list\/1\/schemes\/treatmentabroad\/ and also by phone at  056 7784551.<\/p>  <p>  Under the terms of EU Regulation 883\/2004, all persons ordinarily resident in the EU are entitled to apply for a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). The EHIC certifies that the holder has the right to receive emergency healthcare during a temporary stay in any EU country as well as Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland. This right is guaranteed to all persons who are covered by the public healthcare system of these countries. The EHIC holder has the right to receive necessary treatment in the host Member State's public healthcare system on the same terms and at the same cost as nationals of the State concerned. It should be noted that under bilateral arrangements, an EHIC is not required from Irish citizens when accessing emergency treatment in Northern Ireland and proof of residence (for example passport or driving licence) is sufficient. <\/p>  <p>  Information on the EHIC can be accessed on the HSE website at www.hse.ie\/eng\/services\/list\/1\/schemes\/EHIC\/ and also by phone at  061 461 105.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Medicines Agency","counter":878,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO04100"},{"type":"question","counter":879,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[50046\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will report on Ireland's bid to host the European Medicines Agency.","asker":"1436","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":880,"content":"<p>As a consequence of the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) must relocate to another Member State. The EMA plays a vital role in the protection of the health of 500 million EU citizens through the scientific evaluation and safety monitoring of human and veterinary medicines and I believed that Dublin would be an ideal choice for the new host city. The relocation of the EMA represented an opportunity to attract a prestigious EU Agency which directly employs almost 1,000 staff and would attract many more high-quality jobs in associated sectors. The EMA is also key to maintaining the competitiveness of the European pharmaceutical industry, which is worth approximately &euro;260 billion annually.<\/p>  <p>  In October 2016 the Government decided to promote Dublin as a suitable new location for the Agency. The Irish offer, which was developed by a cross-sectoral working group led by my Department, with colleagues from the Department of the Taoiseach and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as representatives from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), IDA Ireland and other Government Departments, was officially submitted to the European Council and the European Commission on 31 July 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department worked closely with colleagues in the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the strategy and campaign to promote the bid and demonstrate why it was felt Dublin represented a suitable location for the EMA, for Europe and for its citizens. <\/p>  <p>  On 19 November 2017, Ireland's Permanent Representative to the European Union confirmed that Ireland was withdrawing its bid for the European Medicines Agency in order to focus on the offer for the European Banking Authority recognising the political challenge of pursuing two bids concurrently. The decision on the relocation of the agencies was taken by the General Affairs Council on 20 November. The Council chose Amsterdam as the new location for the EMA and I expect that the Netherlands will be a suitable new location for the Agency that will allow it to the greatest extent possible continue its important role in protecting patient safety. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Documents","counter":881,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO04400"},{"type":"question","counter":882,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[50061\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has used a private email account to send or receive official documents or positions on Brexit; and, if so, the details of this correspondence.","asker":"1436","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":883,"content":"<p>I do not use a private email account to send or receive official documents or positions on Brexit<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Data","counter":884,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO04700"},{"type":"question","counter":885,"qnumday":355,"qnumall":"[50068\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if Ireland has a trauma director for the trauma services provided; if not, the reason therefor; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":886,"qnumday":356,"qnumall":"[50069\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of patients admitted and treated for trauma injuries in hospitals in each of the years 2008 to 2016 and to date in 2017, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":887,"qnumday":357,"qnumall":"[50070\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to centralise trauma care on two centres of excellence, as recently reported; the hospitals that are proposed to be downgraded; the hospitals that are proposed to be upgraded; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":888,"qnumday":358,"qnumall":"[50071\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the hospitals which treat trauma injuries; the trauma level each is currently at, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":889,"qnumday":359,"qnumall":"[50072\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans for the north west and the south east in the event of Dublin and Cork being established as major trauma centres; the precautions that will be taken to ensure that these critical masses of population would have adequate cover; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":890,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 355 to 359, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015, my predecessor as the Minister for Health established a Trauma Policy Steering Group, chaired by Professor Eilis McGovern, to make recommendations in relation to the development of a trauma system for Ireland. Patients who have used trauma services and clinicians were at the heart of the development of the plan. The Trauma Steering Group completed its final report in July 2017 and I intend to bring  it to Government before the end of the year. <\/p>  <p>  This report is about delivering best outcomes for the small number of patients each year who suffer major trauma, that is, injuries which have the potential to cause prolonged disability or death, and ensuring they get the right care in the right place at the right time. International evidence demonstrates that trauma systems are associated with better patient outcomes, improved access to care and reduced length of stay and cost-effectiveness, more lives being saved and fewer people being left with a disability. <\/p>  <p>  Following on from recent media reports, it is important to say that the report is not about closing Emergency Departments or diminishing services. Traumatic injuries may be low, moderate or severe. Major trauma involves injuries which have the potential to cause prolonged disability or death. Based on available data, it is estimated that Ireland has approximately 1,600 major trauma patients each year. To put this in context, Emergency Departments provide 24\/7 access for emergency and urgent presentations across the spectrum of medical and  surgical conditions, with 1,157,074 new ED attendances in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the specific queries raised by the Deputy in relation to the number of patients admitted and treated for trauma injuries in hospitals in each of the years 2008 to 2016 and to date in 2017 and the hospitals that treat trauma injuries and the trauma level each is currently at, as this is a service issue, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Neuro-Rehabilitation Services Provision","counter":891,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO05800"},{"type":"question","counter":892,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[50074\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO05900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of plans to build a neuro-rehabilitation unit in the midlands; if progress has been made in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1369","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":893,"content":"<p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) Social Care Division and the HSE Clinical Programme and Strategy Division are working in tandem to progress the implementation of the <i>National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-rehabilitation Services in Ireland.  <\/i>This is in line with the commitment to publish an implementation plan as outlined in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government<\/i>and the commitment in the HSE National Service Plan 2017 and HSE Social Care Operational Plan for 2017.<\/p><p>As the Deputy's question relates to a service matter, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for a direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":894,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO06100"},{"type":"question","counter":895,"qnumday":361,"qnumall":"[50077\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800071#WRO06200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive a hospital appointment.","asker":"1217","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":896,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

It aims to ensure that appropriate care pathways are in place in order that mothers, babies and families get the right care, at the right time, by the right team and in the right place.  Similarly, it recognises that, while all pregnant women need a certain level of support, some will require more specialised care.  Accordingly, it proposes an integrated model that delivers care at the lowest level of complexity and encompasses all the necessary safety nets in line with patient safety principles.  <\/p><p>The Strategy makes it clear that women should be offered choice regarding their preferred pathway of care, in line with their clinical needs and best practice.  The model consists of three care pathways - supported, assisted and specialised.  The Supported Care Pathway is intended for normal-risk mothers and babies, with midwives leading and delivering care within a multidisciplinary framework.  Care will be delivered by the community midwifery team, with most antenatal and postnatal care being provided in the community and home settings.  The woman can exercise a choice with her healthcare professional with regard to the birth setting, which may be in an Alongside Birth Centre in the hospital, or at home.  The Assisted Care Pathway is intended for mothers and babies considered to be at medium risk, and for normal-risk women who choose an obstetric service, while the Specialised Care Pathway is intended for high-risk mothers and babies. <\/p><p>With regard to birth settings, the Strategy proposes Alongside Birth Centres for the Supported Care Pathway and Specialised Birth Centres (current labour ward) for the Assisted and Specialised Care Pathways.  Freestanding birth centres are not recommended in the Strategy as it is considered that it will  first be necessary to monitor and evaluate the implementation of Alongside Birth Centres in an Irish context.<\/p><p>In relation to the terminology used to describe the new model of care, the Strategy, unapologetically, places mothers at the centre.  Therefore, profession-centric terms such as &quot;consultant led&quot; and &quot;midwifery led&quot; have been avoided, as far as possible, as they incorrectly place an emphasis on the profession.  As I have outlined already, in future, maternity care in Ireland will be provided in an integrated manner, by a multidisciplinary team, with women seeing the most appropriate professional, based on their individual need. <\/p><p>Finally, I should mention that the Strategy will be implemented on a phased basis over the coming years and this work will be led by the HSE National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme.  Last month, I was pleased to launch the Programme&rsquo;s detailed Implementation Plan for the Strategy.  That plan seeks to ensure that each maternity network will have all three care pathways in place and operational in 2018.  The Plan also provides that by early 2019, a minimum of 20% of pregnant women presenting at our maternity hospitals\/units, including those units in the north west, will have access to the supported care pathway. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800073#WRQ05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services Funding","counter":1021,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800073#WRQ05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1022,"qnumday":406,"qnumall":"[50302\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800073#WRQ05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the cuts made to organisations providing services and advocacy for those that suffer from dyspraxia-DCD; his plans to consider increasing the funding to organisations such as an organisation (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1433","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1023,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Securing affordable access to existing and new medicines in a timely manner is a key objective of the Irish Health Service. However, the challenge is delivering on this objective in an affordable and sustainable way in line with the resources allocated by the D&aacute;il and the relevant legislative provisions. Expenditure on medicines represents one of the largest areas of expenditure across the health service and will continue to grow in the years ahead as our health service continues to meet the needs of our citizens<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are engaging in a number of initiatives which have led and will continue to lead to better access to medicines for patients, value for the taxpayer and the cost- effective provision of medicines in Ireland.  Key initiatives include reference and generic substitution, under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the four year Framework Agreement on the Supply and Pricing of Medicines with IPHA, the Medicines Management Programme and National Drugs Management Programme within the HSE, and the development of a National Biosimilar Medicines Policy.  Ireland is also participating in a number of discussions amongst EU Member states to explore possible areas for collaboration including potential joint price negotiations and procurement.  <\/p>  <p>  However, access to medicines is not solely a funding issue.  A significant barrier to accessing new medicines is the price being sought by some manufacturers for their products.  The solution to increased access is multifaceted and is not simply a matter of allocating more funding for medicines at the expense of other health or public services.  The health service must continue to seek better value and lower costs for both existing and new treatments.  <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  This Act gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decision on the reimbursement of medicines, taking account of expert opinion as appropriate.  There is also an increased level of engagement and commercial negotiations between the HSE and manufacturers in an effort to reduce the price to affordable levels.  So while this process is resource intensive, it is clear that as a result of such a robust and scientific process, Ireland is paying significantly less for medicines and the ability to invest is enhanced.<\/p>  <p>  In my recent speech at the IPHA Annual Meeting and Dinner, I highlighted the need for innovative solutions to accessing new medicines. To this end, my Department will continue to consider how improvements can be made to the current system, and will, as part of this work, engage with key stakeholders in 2018 in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800075#WRS02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":1145,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800075#WRS03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1146,"qnumday":448,"qnumall":"[50544\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800075#WRS03100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) has been waiting for an appointment for surgery for over six months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1345","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1147,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Persons aged 70 or older who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds may also have their eligibility assessed under the general means-tested medical card scheme if they so wish, for example in the event that they face particularly high expenses, e.g. nursing home or medication costs.  This scheme is open to all persons, irrespective of their age and assessment is based on net income and assessable outgoing expenses.  The general scheme, although having lower income thresholds, provides for income disregards and relevant outgoings to be taken into account in the assessment process.<\/p>  <p>  Under the medical card legislation, having a particular illness in itself, does not establish eligibility for  a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.<\/p>  <p>   In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.  In addition, from August 2015, all persons aged 70 or older qualify for a GP Visit Card, regardless of income.<\/p>  <p>  There are no proposals at present to amend the legislation for the granting of eligibility for medical cards for persons aged 70 and over.  However, it should be noted that the gross income limits are reviewed annually and considered in the context of the budget.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to services for people with Parkinson's disease, the HSE funds a range of community services and supports to enable each individual to achieve their full potential and maximise independence, including living as independently as possible.  Services are provided in a variety of community and residential setting in partnership with service users, their families and carers and  a range of statutory, non-statutory, voluntary and community groups.  Services are provided either directly by the HSE or through a range of voluntary service providers.<\/p>  <p>  Services are accessed through an application process through the relevant local health office or through referrals from public health nurses or other community based staff.

Latest data from September 2017 shows that the public-private mix at a system level stands at 82% public for elective in-patient work and at almost 86% for day-case work.  This is consistent with the typical 80\/20 split provided for in the consultant contract.<\/p>  <p>  Arrangements concerning implementation and monitoring of Consultant Contract 2008 including the provisions in relation to private practice are matters for the HSE in the first instance.  Section 20 of the Contract provides a framework for the regulation of private practice, monitoring of the applicable ratio and steps to be taken where it is exceeded.  The responsibility for reporting individual consultant compliance with their contract was formally delegated to the Hospital Groups in 2014.  The main reason for this was to ensure local accountability.  Hospitals know their consultants and the work they deliver.  <\/p>  <p>  However it seems clear that the arrangements in place are not robust enough to deliver compliance in all circumstances and, as a result, some consultants are able to engage in private practice activity at levels that significantly exceed the permitted levels, or else they may engage in significant levels of off-site private practice, although their contract does not provide for this.  It is incumbent on publicly-funded hospitals to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract, including the provisions in relation to private practice.  For some time my Department has been working closely with the HSE on this.  It wrote to the HSE in July requesting that the HSE satisfy itself that no consultant is engaged, or will be permitted to engage, in private practice beyond the level, if any, provided for in their contract.  <\/p>  <p>  I am very clear that consultants must deliver their work commitment to the public system.  It is the responsibility of management to make sure these contracts are being enforced and I have asked the HSE to ensure that more robust measures are in place in 2018 to make sure consultants comply with their contractual obligations.

From September 2018, the number of ECCE enrolments in any given year will be around 114,000.

This compares very favourably to foster care services overseas.  The most recent figures for England show that 74% of children in care were in a foster placement and the figure for Northern Ireland is 80%, for children who were in care for at least 12 months.  The vast majority of foster placements are stable, loving, long-term arrangements, where children are nurtured and supported.<\/p>  <p>  By the end of last year, HIQA had inspected all foster care services.  The findings showed that, in general, children in foster care were safe, happy, in good health and attending school.  For 2017, HIQA focussed on specific standards in more detail.  These relate to the checks and balances that Foster Care Committees, and senior managers, should have in place to support a safe and effective service.  The child&rsquo;s experience of the service was not assessed during 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  This year's inspections show delays in completing formal assessments of relative carers, and the lack of regular reviews of all foster carers.  The need for Garda vetting for children over 16 and young adults in the household was also highlighted.  There were weaknesses in how some Foster Care Committees are informed about complaints and allegations against foster carers.  I am pleased to note that HIQA accepted Tusla&rsquo;s action plans in relation to the inspection reports, and I am monitoring improvements being made.  <\/p>  <p>  The clear themes coming through are of the need for better oversight, recruitment of staff, the replenishment and broadening of foster care panels, improved supports and supervision of foster carers.  <\/p>  <p>  I am asking Tusla to provide me with a national strategy for the recruitment of foster carers as part of its 2018 business plan, and to build on and improve the assessment and support for foster carers.

This new Scheme will replace the existing targeted childcare programmes with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme and will include &ldquo;wraparound\u201f care for pre-school and school-age children.  The ambition of this project is immense; its scope matched only in size by its complexity.  This scheme aims to reduce poverty, facilitate labour activation, improve outcomes for children and tangibly reduce the cost of childcare for tens of thousands of families. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently putting in place the legal and technical infrastructures to underpin the Affordable Childcare Scheme.  I am delighted to report that draft legislation to give our new approach a legal backbone is well advanced and publication of a draft Bill is expected before the end of the year. <\/p>  <p>  The building of a state of the art IT system to make subsidised childcare more accessible is also being advanced.  The IT development is subject to scrutiny by a peer review group (PRG) at the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO).  The project has passed the first stage of the peer review process (reviewing the Business Case) and is close to completing the second stage (Request for Tender Stage).  <\/p>  <p>  Whilst delivering the scheme as soon as possible remains a priority, I believe that it is prudent to ensure we get the new systems right, so that they operate smoothly for everyone.  Accordingly, in progressing our work, we strive to meet the highest standards available and avoid mistakes made on previous government IT projects. In doing so, we have committed ourselves to extensive consultation and peer review processes. <\/p>  <p>  While intensive work is underway, the project is heavily dependent on timelines beyond its immediate control, such as the advancement of legislation through the Oireachtas.  In particular, the timeframe is dependent upon ICT development.  Once we have completed the Request for Tender element of the project and have the successful developer in place, we will be able to confirm and communicate a timeline for the full introduction of the scheme.  Until then, I am not in a position to make a commitment on the exact launch date of ACS.  <\/p>  <p>  We are well on our way to introducing the Affordable Childcare Scheme.  In the meantime, the families of 64,000 children or 91% of the children eligible for the measures introduced by my Department are already benefiting from financial support for their childcare, on a par with what will be delivered under the new scheme.

From September 2018 all children will be entitled to a full two years of the ECCE scheme or free preschool, as it has become known.  This further enhancement delivers fully on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers.  I also announced investment to continue the childcare affordability measures introduced last September that are already benefitting 45,000 children, with 24,000 of these registered so far for the universal under-3 scheme, and 21,000 registered for the targeted schemes.  The additional funding will ensure that the door remains open for further children and families to register and benefit from these subsidies throughout 2018.  I have also recently commissioned an Independent Review of the Cost of delivering Quality Childcare which will assist me in seeking more investment  for childcare over the coming years. <\/p><p>The introduction in September 2017 of the universal payment for under 3s (and for children who are aged 3 but do not yet qualify for entry into the ECCE Programme) addresses the issue where children under 3 years of age were the only age group of pre-school children for which no other universal State support for care and education was previously available, given that children aged 3 and older can participate in the ECCE Programme or school.  The universal payment is a contribution towards the cost of childcare for under 3 years of age, given that many parents require full-time childcare for this age group.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme, which will replace the existing childcare schemes, will provide for a continuation of this universal payment for childcare.  In addition, it will for the first time provide higher payments for targeted subsidies for children under 3 years of age than for older age groups ( and the highest subsidies for children under 1 year old), to reflect the higher cost of provision for this age group, given the regulatory requirements on adult-child ratios.  Let me also add that the issues facing childcare providers in the provision of services to under 3 years of age is one also being considered by a subgroup of the Early Years Forum.<\/p><p>As part of Budget 2018, I have also secured a 5.7% increase in funding for Tusla in 2018 which amounts &euro;40.6m.

Tusla have provided a breakdown of the referrals they have received in the years 2014, 2015 and 2016, which is included in tabular format.  In addition I include data as published on Tusla's website for quarter 1 2017.  It should be noted that multiple referrals may be received that relate to the same child.  The Deputy will notice from the table below that the vast majority of referrals are for emotional abuse and neglect, possibly indicating abuse within the family setting.<\/p><p>Each referral received by Tusla is assessed and dealt with on an individual basis by the relevant social work team.  Approximately 60% of referrals to Tusla are of a child welfare concern with the remaining 40% related to child protection concerns.  Tusla's policy is to refer child welfare referrals to relevant family and community support services. At any stage, if a determination is made that there is abuse, whether physical, emotional, sexual or neglect, from which there is an ongoing risk of harm, the child protection pathway is followed. In a minority of cases this may lead to the child being placed on the Child Protection Notification System (CPNS) or the child being received into care.<\/p><p>Upon receipt of an appropriate referral, the Duty Social Worker carries out preliminary enquiries, including checking to see if the case is already open or known to child protection services, clarifies the nature of the concern, contacts key professionals, e.g. public health nurses or teachers, and records the details of the child and family.  It is possible that duplicate referrals have been received, or that the child involved is already receiving a service from Tusla, or that the child needs another service such as, for instance, the HSE's Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service.  If the threshold for a child protection assessment or response is not met but a child has an unmet need then this may be addressed as a child welfare concern by local family and community support services, organised through the Local Area Pathways team.<\/p><p>A referral becomes an open case (one per child) when it meets the criteria to need an initial assessment. Based on the information available, the referral will be given a priority level of high, medium and low.

These provide for the welfare of the child, the care practices, care records, accommodation and safety precautions. Children, depending on their identified needs, may be placed by their social worker in foster care either with relatives or general foster carers, in residential care or other placement types. The majority of children are placed in long term stable placements and currently over 92% of children are placed in foster care. A key part of the social worker role is to ensure the quality and safety of the child's placement, and to meet with the child on a one to one basis on all visits. There are safeguards surrounding each child care placement, whether foster or residential care and placements are supervised by a professionally qualified social worker.<\/p>  <p>  All foster care services and statutory residential centres are subject to inspection by the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA) and private and voluntary residential centres are inspected by Tusla against National Standards. These inspection reports of children's residential centres, fostering services and child protection services are also reviewed and analysed by my officials. The overview of these reports provides me with a level of assurance on the overall capacity of Tusla to identify and provide services to families and children.<\/p>  <p>  Within its national office, Tusla, has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team. This team produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, including detailed reporting on child safety and protection services. Tusla also provides me with information on children in care, their placement type, care status and allocation of social workers. Within my Department there is a Unit which scrutinises these reports and briefs me and senior officials on issues of note. The reports also provide statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlights challenges and areas where further improvement is required, such as the recruitment of additional social workers.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department meet Tusla management on a regular basis to review the level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement. I myself meet on a regular basis with the CEO and Chair of Tusla. Contact is maintained with non-governmental bodies on issues within the sector, including, for example, the Children's Rights Alliance, EPIC and the Irish Foster are Association.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that children in care have access to independent advocacy supports, such as the organisation Empowering People in Care (EPIC). Children in care also have access to the complaints mechanism in Tulsa, and may make complaints, or be assisted to make complaints, about their care to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800082#WRZ02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency","counter":1618,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800082#WRZ02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1619,"qnumday":612,"qnumall":"[50564\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800082#WRZ02300","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the degree to which a rapid response exists in cases of incidents of children at risk brought to the attention of her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1620,"content":"<p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, deals immediately with emergency cases, including for instance, if a child has been abandoned or is in immediate physical danger or at immediate risk of sexual abuse.

Once the child is in a place of relative safety, Tusla social workers can carry out a fuller assessment and put in place steps to support the child to reunify with their family, to put in place a child protection plan, or to receive the child into care.  Where a child has a child protection plan they are listed as active on the Child Protection Notification System.

CIB has taken this operational decision following years of analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders on the need for a more streamlined governance model.  The changes are being made at local company board level only.  The valuable work carried out by employees and volunteers working in CIS services and employees of MABS services will continue as heretofore. <\/p>  <p>  The Citizens Information Board is committed to the principle of local involvement in service delivery and has already held discussions on proposed new Local Advisory Committees.  CIB is committed to giving this matter further attention, through the Implementation Group&rsquo;s work, to devise a strategy to embed an effective and supportive network to ensure that the long standing, helpful, local linkages are not lost under the new governance arrangements.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to membership of the new regional boards, CIB has committed to apply modern best practice and fairness in its selection and recruiting methods, in line with best practice guidelines developed by the Public Appointments Service.  Existing Board members of local CIS and MABS companies will also have an opportunity to express their interest in joining the new regional boards.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed that Kerry MABS is included in the initial phase of the restructuring process in the South Munster region.  I am also informed that as the restructuring process progresses, all CIS and MABS services will be requested to commence gathering the information required to facilitate what is known as the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employees) (TUPE) process for employees and the transfer of business assets\/liabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  It is the intention of CIB to provide information and support through the transitional period, and in this regard, information sessions are being organised for Chairpersons of local services, providing an opportunity for Chairpersons to seek clarifications on the process of transfer to the new regional companies and wind up of the existing companies.  <\/p>  <p>  While cost savings was never a key aim of the restructuring of governance arrangements by the CIB, the transition will not be without cost to the Exchequer.  It is nonetheless necessary in order to achieve the appropriate standards of accountability expected from 100% publicly funded services.

Accordingly, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners (Revenue) allocated the husband&rsquo;s Revenue and Social Insurance (RSI) number to the wife and appended a &ldquo;W&rdquo; to the end so that they could be separately identified but linked for joint assessment.  Following the introduction of PRSI in 1979 Revenue collected social insurance on behalf of this Department and made the necessary transfers using this &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; number where required. <\/p>  <p>  Following legislative provision being made in the Finance Act 1993 for either spouse to be the assessable spouse, the practice of allocating &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers ceased and from then on, all persons were allocated individual, unique numbers.  However, it was decided not to ask all individuals with &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers to change them until there was an actual need to do so.<\/p>  <p>  The Personal Public Service Number (PPS Number) was introduced in the Social Welfare Act 1998, replacing the RSI Number, and my Department was given legislative responsibility for allocating and managing these new numbers.  In practice the RSI numbers in existence were retained and became PPS Numbers, including &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers.  <\/p>  <p>  As a result of the changes over 20 years ago, the vast majority of individuals now have their own non &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; PPS Numbers. <\/p>  <p>  While there is no legal requirement for a widow to obtain a new PPS Number on the death of her husband, the Revenue position is that while it continues to support &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers for the limited range of non-assessable spouse options, its systems now require a non &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; number where they are dealing with an individual in his or her own right.  Revenue has also stated that accommodating &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers for tax purposes would require significant ICT development across a range of Revenue systems.  Accordingly, Revenue asks people with &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; numbers to change them once they need to engage with them on taxation matters.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, as a husband&rsquo;s PPS Number may be extracted from his wife&rsquo;s &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; number, there are also Data Protection concerns over the continuing use of such numbers.<\/p>  <p>  The process of replacing a &ldquo;Level W&rdquo; number is relatively straightforward.  The process can only be undertaken by staff of the Client Identity Section (CIS) in my Department who can be contacted by phone or by email.  Accordingly, there is no need for the client to turn up at any office or to queue for service.  As part of the process, CIS verifies the identity of the individual, secures their consent, purges the existing number and replaces it with either a new number or one that the individual may have had prior to marriage.  In addition, all pre-existing records relating to that individual are transferred over to the new number.  Once completed, a letter advising of the new number is issued to the individual at their home address.  While every effort is made to complete this work within 24 hours, it can occasionally take up to 5 working days because of volumes.  However, urgent cases are always expedited.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800083#WRAA04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Communications","counter":1711,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800083#WRAA04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1712,"qnumday":646,"qnumall":"[50058\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800083#WRAA05000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she has used a private email account to send or receive official documents or positions on Brexit; and if so, the details of this correspondence.","asker":"1436","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1713,"content":"<p>The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has never used a private email account to send or receive official documents or positions on Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800083#WRAA05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Payments Administration","counter":1714,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800083#WRAA05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1715,"qnumday":647,"qnumall":"[50076\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800083#WRAA05300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"her plans to extend the Christmas bonus to those in receipt of illness benefit; the estimated cost of same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1716,"content":"<p>I was pleased to announce on Budget Day that an 85% Christmas bonus will be paid this year to over 1.2 million long-term social welfare recipients, such as pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents and long-term jobseekers at a cost of &euro;219 million.<\/p>  <p>  The Christmas bonus is payable to persons who are in receipt of long term social welfare payments.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the conditions of the State pension contributory is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment, i.e. between their 16th and 66th birthdays.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances.  <\/p>  <p>  Voluntary Contributions are designed to facilitate employees \/ self-employed persons who are no longer subject to compulsory PRSI, to pay contributions directly to the Department on a voluntary basis, in order to protect their future State Pension Contributory (SPC), Widow(er)&rsquo;s Contributory Pension and Guardian&rsquo;s Contributory Payment entitlements.  <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of qualifying conditions attached to the Voluntary Contribution Scheme. In order to become a Voluntary Contributor a person must (i) have a minimum of 260 to 520 Contributions paid &ndash; dependant on the period he or she wishes to pay for, and (ii) apply within 60 months of the end of the year in which he or she last paid or was credited a contribution.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department will take into account all relevant contributions, paid or credited, as well as the time frame involved, when making a decision on an individual&rsquo;s level of entitlement to the State Pension (contributory).  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800084#WRBB03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts Data","counter":1760,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800084#WRBB03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1761,"qnumday":664,"qnumall":"[50400\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800084#WRBB03400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the public contracts between her Department and companies, details supplied, in each of the years 2011 to 2016; the value of each contract; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1762,"content":"<p><b><\/b>The public contracts awarded to the companies concerned, in each of the years 2011 to 2016, and the value of each contract, is outlined in the table in Appendix 1.  <\/p><p>A breakdown of annual expenditure on consultancy and IT external service provision, and a list of purchase orders for &euro;20,000 or greater, is published routinely on the Department website at <i><\/i>..

As such, the changes did not preclude any pensioner who would have qualified for a full State Pension (contributory) pre-2012 from qualifying for a full rate after September 2012.  <\/p>  <p>  The current rate bands were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000.  The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous, and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time.  The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension, which many pensioners were solely dependent on, were maintained. Instead, the rates for people who both had additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  The current rate bands still provide pensions to people which are better than proportionate with their level of contribution.  A person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% pension, which compares favourably with contributory pensions in other EEU countries.  <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of well over &euro;70 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 to &euro;12 million extra each following year.  Awarding a maximum rate contributory pension to everyone who had spent time outside the PAYE system, regardless of their means, would be even more expensive and it is estimated this would cost well over &euro;1 billion per annum.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is examining in depth various options that would provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension, had the rate-bands not been amended in 2012.  If there are equitable changes that target such relief to those who were affected by the yearly average system, particularly those who had homemaking periods prior to the introduction of the Homemakers scheme, I will ask Government to consider if and how these might be financed.  <\/p>  <p>  It is intended to introduce a total contributions approach for new pensioners from 2020.  This will make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  It will also have significant homemakers provisions that will assist those pensioners who spent significant periods caring for their children, or adults with a caring need.  <\/p>  <p>  The main aim of Government policy on pensions is to make sure that pensions are affordable, sustainable and keep their value in the coming years.  The reforms that are planned will result in a more inclusive and fairer pension system for all citizens.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800084#WRBB04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":1769,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800084#WRBB04200"},{"type":"question","counter":1770,"qnumday":667,"qnumall":"[50516\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800084#WRBB04300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when a disability allowance payment will issue to a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The Department and An Post agreed a protocol in 2014 governing the forms of identification which claimants, or their agents, must produce in order to collect payments.  There has been no change in this agreed protocol or in the forms of identification required of claimants to collect their social welfare payments.  <\/p><p>Social welfare claimants must present one of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payment cards when collecting payments.  These cards are; the Public Services Card, the Social Services Card and the Temporary Payment Card.  <\/p><p>The Public Services Card, or PSC, is an identity token, issued by the Department, following a face to face registration process which involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature plus the verification of identity data already held by the Department.  No other identification is required of clients when a PSC is presented.  <\/p><p>The Social Services Card, or SSC, is a payment token, used to collect DSP payments.  The token is issued to claimants who have not yet been registered for and received a PSC.  If presenting for payment with an SSC, a person must also provide additional identification.  Ideally this should photographic.  Acceptable forms of photographic ID are: <\/p><p>- Current Passport (For Irish and UK passport holders, a passport which has expired within the previous 12 months is acceptable) <\/p><p>- Current (in date) National ID card for EU citizens other than Ireland or UK <\/p><p>- Current (in date) Irish or UK Drivers Licence or Irish Driver Learner Permit <\/p><p>- Current (in date) Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) Card <\/p><p>- Emergency Photo ID produced by the Department.  <\/p><p>If a claimant holds an SSC but does not have appropriate photographic ID then the following documents are acceptable: <\/p><p>- Medical Card and Proof of Address <\/p><p>- Bank Card and Proof of Address <\/p><p>- Recent work ID and Proof of Address<\/p><p>- Recent communication from Public Service body or Local Authority and Proof of Address.  <\/p><p>If a customer holds an SSC but is unable to present either acceptable Photo ID or alternative ID, An Post may make payment based on the personal validation of the Post Office staff on the basis that the customer is known to them by sight and name.  <\/p><p>Finally the Temporary Payment Card is a paper document issued by the Department for short-term use by a claimant pending receipt of a PSC or SSC. A temporary payment card is valid for a specific period.  An Post may not accept the Temporary Payment Card without the additional forms of identification listed above for the SSC.  <\/p><p>In addition to the identity requirements for claimants collecting in person, post offices are obliged to apply the following controls in respect of payments collected by authorised agents.  These agents are of two types; temporary and permanent.  <\/p><p>Payment should only be made to a temporary agent on presentation of the following: <\/p><p>-  A Temporary Agent form (TA1) signed by the claimant authorising the agent to collect their payments.  <\/p><p>-  The claimant&rsquo;s PSC, SSC or Temporary Card <\/p><p>-  The Agent&rsquo;s own photo ID. Acceptable forms of photo ID are the same as set out for SSC card.  <\/p><p>An Post have recently begun the roll out of an updated counter transaction system.  This change would appear to have caused some confusion among staff in post offices as my Department has received an increase in public queries regarding the use of the PSC for identification.  In each case the Department has asked An Post to contact the relevant post office to clarify that there has been no change in the agreed protocol governing the forms of identification which claimants, or their agents, must produce in order to collect payments.

The Guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for such developments.  The policy context, including renewable energy policy, for the Guidelines is set out in section 1.2 of Chapter 1.<\/p><p>The 2006 Guidelines were not subject to a strategic environmental assessment (SEA).\u00a0\u00a0As the Deputy will be aware, a focused review of the 2006 Guidelines is currently underway.<\/p><p>My predecessor as Minister, in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, announced\u00a0an emerging &quot;preferred draft approach&quot; to the review of the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines in June 2017.\u00a0 A copy of the announcement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: www.housing.gov.ie\/planning\/guidelines\/wind-energy\/coveney-and-naughten-announce-key-development-review-wind-energy-development-guidelines.<\/p><p>It is important to mention that, as part of the overall review, and having regard to the\u00a0recent ECJ Judgement in a case relating to\u00a0the Belgian\/Wallonian wind energy guidelines, it is proposed to undertake a SEA of the proposed revisions to the 2006 Guidelines before they come into effect.  This is in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001\/24\/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, the SEA Directive.\u00a0 SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process.\u00a0 It is envisaged that the public consultation as part of the SEA process will be undertaken in early 2018.<\/p><p>It is\u00a0estimated that the SEA process will take approximately 9 months and tendering to\u00a0engage\u00a0the necessary expertise\u00a0to carry out that\u00a0process is well advanced.\u00a0 In\u00a0light of the\u00a0SEA requirements, it is expected that the\u00a0Guidelines will not be finalised and come into effect until 2018.\u00a0 In the meantime, the current Guidelines remain in force.<\/p><p>When finalised, the revised Guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. <\/p><p>With regard to the proposed setback distance requirements in the &quot;preferred draft approach&quot;, which are based on international examples, these are primarily proposed for visual amenity purposes so that the setting of an appropriate setback in any planning determination\u00a0takes account of turbine size, while also taking account of other factors such as site design and layout, the scale of the project and its effects on the topography and landscape of the area.  Furthermore, the\u00a0&quot;preferred draft approach&quot; requirements in relation to setback distance\u00a0will also be subject to the need to separately comply with the proposed noise limits in the &quot;preferred draft approach&quot;.<\/p><p>My Department issues periodic advice and guidance by way of circular letters to planning authorities on a range of planning related\u00a0issues.\u00a0 General Departmental circulars do not have a statutory basis as compared to the Planning Acts, Regulations made under the Acts or any Ministerial Guidelines, Directives or Directions issued under the Acts.\u00a0 <\/p><p>However, Departmental circulars, which are generally advisory in nature, are used as a means for providing information to planning authorities in relation to various legislative provisions and requirements, to outline and clarify Government or Department policy, and to provide practical advice on the implementation of the planning code and general planning matters, with a view to ensuring consistency in approach and implementation by all local authorities.\u00a0 <\/p><p>In addition, under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as Minister, I am empowered to issue guidelines to planning authorities as may be required. \u00a0Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 and must apply any specific planning policy requirements therein in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts.<\/p><p>My Department issued circular letter PL 20\/2013 on 20 December 2013, the purpose of which was to advise that, in light of developing relevant national policy reviews, local authorities should defer amending their existing Development Plan policies in relation to wind energy and renewable energy generally as part of either the normal cyclical six-yearly review or plan variation processes.<\/p><p>On 3 August 2017, my Department issued circular letter PL 05\/2017 which reiterated the advice in previous circular letter PL 20\/2013 and provided an update on the review of the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines.\u00a0 However, its primary purpose was to issue new Ministerial\u00a0section 28 Interim Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Statutory Plans, Renewable Energy and Climate Change, entitled Interim Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Statutory Plans, Renewable Energy and Climate Change &ndash; July 2017, with a focus on the administrative procedures which should be carried out, and the national policies relating to renewable energy and wind energy that regard should be taken of, in the adoption or variation of statutory development plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800085#WRCC02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Accommodation","counter":1820,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800085#WRCC02400"},{"type":"question","counter":1821,"qnumday":683,"qnumall":"[50489\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017112800085#WRCC02500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that in 2016 and 2017 Cork County Council drew down none of the money allocated for Traveller accommodation despite a clear need for new developments including in the case of persons (details supplied).

My Department is working towards collating expenditure on both a measure and individual scheme basis from 2018 onwards.<\/p><p>Individual scheme and block based grant funding for group water schemes were made under the following measures of the new programme:<\/p><p>-  Measure 1 - Environmental and public health compliance (group water sector)<\/p><p>-  Measure 2 - Enhancement of existing schemes (group water sector)<\/p><p>-  Measure 3 - Rural development (group water sector)<\/p><p>-  Measure 4 - Transition of group schemes (water and waste water)  to public water sector  (Irish Water)<\/p><p>-  Measure 5 - Innovation and Research.<\/p><p>Measure 1 is transitioning to an individual scheme based approach in 2017 (with some remaining block grants).  Measures 3, 4 and 5 are scheme based from 2016.  Measure 2 continues to be a block grant based approach.<\/p><p>Details of the expenditure by the relevant local authorities under these measures are outlined in the tables below for the years 2016 and 2017 (to 27\/11\/2017).  Details of funding for individual group water schemes are available from the relevant local authorities.<\/p><p>The 2016 payments to local authorities under Measures 1-5 of the Rural Water Programme are outlined in the table below.<table><tr><th>Local   Authority<\/th><th>Measure 1<\/th><th>Measure 2<\/th><th>Measure 3<\/th><th>Measure 4<\/th><th>Measure

A commitment to deliver 50,000 new social housing homes through a range of delivery mechanisms is being supported by a multi-annual Exchequer commitment totalling &euro;6.5 billion over the period of the plan. These targets will be achieved using a combination of building, purchasing and leasing high quality properties to meet the needs of households on local authority waiting lists around the country.<\/p><p>The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) will support the delivery of\u00a010,000 of these homes by providing financial support for the leasing of houses and apartments by local authorities and approved housing bodies from a range of different sources. A total of 3,500 properties are targeted to be achieved using the Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) which harnesses the potential of existing vacant stock and brings it back into use for social housing. The remaining 6,500 properties to be leased are intended to be secured under long-term lease arrangements from a variety of sources. <\/p><p>In relation to NAMA\/SPV leases,\u00a0NAMA has established a special purpose vehicle (National Asset Residential Property Services Limited &lsquo;NARPS&rsquo;), to take ownership of properties where there is an established demand and then lease them long-term to an approved housing body or local authority. In these projects, NAMA funds the remediation of the common areas and the completion of the unfinished units, which are often the last remaining incomplete and vacant units in the estates. When the units are complete, NARPS purchase the finished properties and lease them immediately to the approved housing body or local authority. While NAMA is consistently mindful of identifying properties which may be suitable for social housing, the pool of such properties is reducing in line with the reduction in the NAMA loan portfolio and it is unlikely at this point that significant numbers of additional properties will be identified.
