I will begin by addressing the late submission of our annual report for 2015.  In the past the SFPA has been cited as the reason for our failure to meet the statutory deadline for the submission of annual reports.  We have taken this matter seriously and are committed to, and have demonstrated, an improvement in our performance in areas under our control in meeting annual report submission deadlines<\/p> <p>  With regard to the work of the SFPA, Ireland is surrounded by the richest fishing grounds in Europe. The SFPA acts as the guardian of these marine resources around Ireland.  To this end, we maintain an inspectorate, with 61 sea fishery protection officers operating from seven regional port offices up to 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Our primary statutory role is as the regulatory agency for Irish sea fishing and seafood production.  Our strategy aims for an industry built on compliance with fair, effective and independent regulation.  We aim to have systems that give robust confidence in Ireland&rsquo;s reputation worldwide as a source of high-quality fishery products and systems ensuring sustainability in order that there will be fishing for our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the highlights in the 2015 report, of which we have circulated a hard copy.  With regard to sea fishery conservation work, 2015 saw the introduction of the most significant element of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy, CFP - the landing obligation.  The first phase of the introduction of this very significant regulation to reduce and eliminate unwanted discarding of fish at sea included measures to be applied in pelagic fisheries.  Since 2015 implementation of these regulations has advanced to include other fisheries, including the requirement to land fish from demersal fisheries.  The application of the regulations presents a very real challenge to regulators and the industry.<\/p> <p>  We work closely with the Naval Service and the Air Corps which carry out all inspections at sea, as well as the national fishery monitoring centre under a service level agreement with us.  In 2015 the SFPA was responsible for 2,500 direct fisheries conservation inspections, of which 1,000 were carried out at sea by the Naval Service under the service level agreement.  The 1,500 inspections carried out by the SFPA were generally of landings by fishing vessels in ports, including 150 at sea-inshore fisheries inspections.  This area of inspection activity has been well supported by our consultative committee in order that illegal and unlicensed operators are not let compete with legitimate inshore fishermen.  The inspection programme generated 35 legal case files related to apparent infringements of the CFP.  The SFPA attributed points for serious infringements to seven fishing vessels in 2015.  The points legislation was subsequently challenged in the courts and following direction, it was revised.  <\/p> <p>  It can be difficult to measure how good a job a regulator is doing as inspection statistics only tell part of the story.  For the first time the authority included examples of the types of case we bring to court and the issues associated with these cases in the annual report for 2015.  We refer the committee to two fisheries-related cases, in particular.  In the first the apparent high-grading of fish by a large-scale pelagic freezer vessel operating within the Irish EZ was detected in 2013 after an SFPA-Naval Service investigation.  The operator was brought to court and convicted in 2015.  High-grading occurs where a fisher illegally selects the most valuable fish by size, discards the rest overboard and records only the fish kept on board.  The case illustrated the importance of carrying out controls on fishing vessels that fish in Irish waters but never land in Irish ports and how equipment could be used to grade fish illegally on an industrial scale.<\/p> <p>  The second case involved close co-operation between the authority and Legal Metrology Ireland, NSAI, to detect and prosecute an apparent case of tampering with approved weighing equipment at a pelagic processing factory.  The court found the defendant guilty earlier this year.  The case followed the discovery of a switch on the wall that could be used to interfere with the proper operation of weighing equipment, with the potential for undeclared fish to be caught, processed and sold.  The evasion of fishery management rules has a direct consequence for all who are dependent on the sea for their livelihoods.<\/p> <p>  With regard to seafood safety work, as an official agency of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, we are responsible for the control of the food safety systems for all seafood from production by fishermen or farmers throughout the production chain as far as but not including retail.  We maintain Ireland&rsquo;s shellfish classification system which classifies production areas according to water quality in line with European food regulations and has ramifications for how shellfish may be placed on the market.  We also validate labelling and traceability systems, including DNA checks of fish species.<\/p> <p>  During 2015 the SFPA carried out 1,700 seafood safety inspections, with 1,600 shellfish production samples.  By way of example of this work, fishing vessels were found to be harvesting razor clams outside a classified production area and as a result were producing shellfish with a potential risk to public health.  Traceability checks conducted by the authority confirmed that some of the shellfish harvested had been exported.  The export market closed access to Irish shellfish on a precautionary basis.  Thankfully, the importing authorities were persuaded by the effectiveness of the control systems in place in Ireland and reopened the market shortly afterwards.  However, this incident illustrates how irresponsible operators can damage the reputation of the entire Irish industry and put public health at risk.<\/p> <p>  Seafood can be traded freely within the European Union when produced from SFPA approved establishments.  Seafood consignments exported outside the European Union generally must be certified as being compliant with the standards of the importing third country.  We are responsible for providing health certificates detailing origin and traceability for every consignment of fish and fish products manufactured, processed or packaged in Ireland for export to an increasing number of third countries.  During 2015 the SFPA issued 6,100 export certificates, involving 50,000 tonnes of seafood exported to 35 countries outside the European Uknion.  An example of our work in this area is the export of live crabs to China where the importing authorities had concerns about specific criteria for imported crabs.  The authority, with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, engaged directly with the Chinese authorities.  Taking into account the wider picture of food exports to China, we temporarily suspended certification of crabs exported to China.  Following sustained dialogue with the Chinese authorities, the matter was resolved earlier this year. <\/p> <p>  In 2015 the SFPA commenced access to the European Maritime Fisheries Fund, EMFF.  It will fund the development of systems that support Ireland in meeting its CFP responsibilities.<\/p> <p>  The implications of Brexit in fisheries will be both unique and profound.  As regulator, the SFPA is concerned about the prospect of significant additional demands related to possible Brexit outcomes.  It is not possible at this time to calculate the size of the burden that will emerge, but we are sure that to support the trade of fish and fishery products from Ireland in a post-Brexit world additional resources will be required.  The key issues are fishing access rights, fishing opportunity rights and the trading of fish and fishery products.<\/p> <p>  Our annual report for 2015 informs on specific changes to our scallop control systems.  The changes arose from our attempt to meet the requirements of EU control systems for the protection of public health.  While Ireland is happy that its systems protect public health, the Commission is taking infringement proceedings against it in this matter.<\/p> <p>  Under the CFP, we also play a substantial coastal state role in the case of non-Irish registered vessels operating in waters under the control of the Irish jurisdiction.  More than 80% of the wild fish taken from Irish waters are taken by vessels from other member states.  The SFPA is proud to announce to the committee that we will shortly put in place a coastal state unit.  The unit will focus on fishing vessels that fish in Irish waters but which rarely, if ever, land in Irish ports to ensure they will operate on the same level playing field as Irish fishing vessels.<\/p> <p>  I thank members for their time and look forward to their questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062700002#O00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Susan Steele"},{"type":"speech","time":1498572000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Steele and her colleagues for attending.  The fishing community is aggrieved because its members believe they have been criminalised under legislation.  There have been stand-offs at various ports between fishing communities and SFPA officials.  Perhaps the problem is with the legislators, given that the authority is simply enforcing the legislation.<\/p> <p>  I refer to super trawlers.  Those of us who live in coastal communities regularly hear that fishermen are expected to jump through hoops, dot the i's and cross the t's, while super trawlers can operate in Irish waters.   Dr. Steele mentioned the new coastal state unit.<\/p><p>The <i>FV Margiris<\/i>is the second largest super trawler in the world, capable of processing 250 tonnes a day.  It was operating off the coast of Donegal quite recently.  It is banned from Australian waters but is out there, off our coast.  What is the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA doing about this?  Will the authority ensure officers will be on board these super trawlers while they are fishing in Irish waters?  We need an assurance.  I am sure all the witnesses watched the documentary &quot;Atlantic&quot;.  I found it very powerful to see Gerry Earley, a fisherman out in his wee boat off the Donegal islands, being brought to court again for alleged fishing offences while out behind him was what he described as a city of super trawlers and lights.  That to me is offensive and embarrassing to our State and to our people.<br\/><br\/>I want a cast-iron assurance given to this committee today over what the SFPA is doing to ensure these super trawlers are not taking a single fish more than what they are entitled to under the quota laws.  What guarantees can the authority give me here today as a Member of the Oireachtas and to the fishing communities concerned?  They have alleged to us that there are double standards in the ways that laws are enforced on their communities and limited livelihood because of the Common Fisheries Policy versus the super trawlers.  Given also that the <i>FV Margiris<\/i>is banned from Australian waters, why is it not banned from our waters?  What is the difference between the Australian policymakers and ours?  I would like cast-iron assurances today on the issue of super trawlers and on the sense that our seas are being hoovered up by them while our own small-scale fishermen operating out of piers and harbours around the coast are being made jump through hoops to comply with standards.  We have to be able to assure people that these standards apply to everyone equally, and that Irish fishermen have a fair opportunity.  I do not believe that is the case at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062700002#O00200","speaker":"1400","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498572000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the SFPA for the presentation.  I have a question on the issue of penalty point applications.  I know this has been an ongoing issue.  There has been a lot of anger from fisherman about the fact that, when penalty points are applied, they are applied immediately.  Even if the fishermen in question are eventually acquitted in any subsequent court case, the penalty points still stand.  I would like to know the authority's current position on this matter and whether it has engaged with the Department and the Minister on it.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the landing obligations, it strikes me that the SFPA has long-established operations around the landing of fish.  There is an issue, however, around ensuring vessels retain all the fish they catch.  The witnesses referred to the high grading of fish.  Having to throw away perfectly good fish was something fishermen always resented, and the public also found it abhorrent.  This has now been turned on its head and the new requirement is to ensure all fish are kept on the vessel.  This is much more difficult to monitor.  What steps are being taken to ensure there is no wastage, particularly in the case of the larger vessels?  There is, no doubt, an incentive to carry out that high grading.  What steps is the SFPA taking to ensure this is policed?  Taking into account the fact that policing of this nature would be more difficult and labour-intensive, does the authority have sufficient capacity to do so?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062700002#P00200","speaker":"1244"},{"type":"speech","time":1498572000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I again welcome the witnesses to the committee.  I too would like to bring up the issue of the very large capacity vessels, or super trawlers as they are known.  I understand that rather than simply discarding dead fish, these super trawlers mince the fish before pumping them back out.  This means they will not be seen.  Does the SFPA have the powers and ability to board these vessels easily and frequently to check that such practices are not taking place?  Speaking to fishermen and fishing organisations around the coast, they are strongly of the view that if Europe or the global community in general are serious about conservation, they have to be serious about taking on the large vessels.  They are the problem.  Small fishermen around the country, most of whom are sailing very risky vessels and finding it very hard to make a living, often end going out fishing on their own because they cannot afford to bring a second person with them.  That is very dangerous.  The livelihood of these fishermen is under extreme strain, and yet they can see these huge vessels hoovering up all the fish and disappearing off over the horizon with them.  If the authority does not have the power or ability to board these vessels, can it put an officer on board to monitor them full-time?<\/p> <p>  I support Deputy McConalogue's question about penalty points.

What proportion of small vessels to big vessels are inspected?  It is very easy for supervisory invigilations to catch the small person engaging in minimal offences.  According to some of my colleagues here who are quite expert in this area, the larger vessel can escape and do far more damage.  Senator Daly is correct in his comments on Brexit and the possibility of inspections and invigilations, protection amendment Bills, <i>voisinage<\/i>agreements and London agreements and so forth.  Has the authority given any consideration to all this?  What kind of impact can we expect from the result of the recent Supreme Court case?  The legislation, which is currently in abeyance, may well have to be delayed as we wait to see how the situation around Brexit crystalises.  It would be premature and foolish to proceed with it when no one knows how Brexit will play out until two or three years down the line.  Does the authority need additional resources to ensure the protection of what has been defined in the Supreme Court as a natural resource?  Has the authority made a submission to the Government for these resources?  They will be needed to protect the Irish fishery base, which is very important around the coast in terms of employment and income-generating capacity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062700002#P00500","speaker":"1370"},{"type":"speech","time":1498572000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>We will come back to Dr. Steele.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062700002#P00600","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498572000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>A number of very interesting questions were asked there.<\/p><p>The first issue I will come to - if the Chairman does not mind, I will not address the questions in straight order - is the points legislation because there were two separate questions on it.  There is legislation on the Statute Book.  This is in suspense at present as we are awaiting the appointment of an adjudicator by the Minister and awaiting nominees to the determination panel, by the Office of the Attorney General and by the Taoiseach and Minister for Defence.  The points legislation is in suspense at present.  That is in answer to those two.<\/p><p> To come back to the questions on super trawlers, Senator Mac Lochlainn raised the \"Atlantic\" documentary and the issues that were raised there and sought cast-iron assurances that not one fish more than the entitlement is taken.  We are completely dedicated to having sustainable fisheries.  When we inspect fishing vessels, we will target on at a risk basis.  It can be difficult to inspect large super trawlers at sea due both to the size of them and, if the weather is rough, to the difficulty for the Naval Service in boarding.  In addition, as was mentioned, it can be technically difficult because these are large vessels and we need to have trained fisheries officers.  We have the numbers of inspections that we have carried out.  They have been increasing.  We have been looking at that.  We have been working with other authorities to ensure that we are working on the risk-based work on that.  We are setting up and putting resources in.  As a number of members identified, there is a lot of pull on resources in the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority but we have made a strategic decision to set up a coastal state unit for the sole purpose of looking at the 80% of fish that is caught in Irish waters but not landed in Irish ports.  We believe that it is paramount that we put significant resources into looking at that and ensuring that we work on a risk basis.  We have superb relationships both with the Air Corps and the Naval Service for carrying out inspections but also with the flag states of vessels where the vessels are inspected on landing.<\/p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Miche&aacute;l O'Mahony, who runs the control side of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, who will go into more detail on the number of questions that we have had on what we call \"large-scale freezer vessels\" rather than \"super trawlers\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062700002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Susan Steele","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498572000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I will deal with the large-scale pelagic freezer trawlers.

We try to deal with the information we have and make the best of that to do the job that is before us.<br\/><br\/>The Senator was emphatically looking for cast-iron assurances of various things, one of which was the presence of officers on board.  We arrange for inspections.  We have a service level agreement with both the Naval Service and the Air Corps.  An inspection involves a discrete event of going on board, verifying what is on board and then coming off.  It does not involve staying on.  The European control regulation sets a general limit of four hours for an inspection and that is the framework under which we work.  It would be abnormal for inspections to take any longer than that.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Martin Kenny asked more or less the same question - have we the power to place staff on board.  Control observers are, within the European regulations, a matter for the flag state, not the coastal state <i>per se<\/i>.  As a coastal state, our role is one of inspections which is discrete - a sort of event where, one might say, it is happening now and now it is stopped.  That should directly answer the direct question on that.<br\/><br\/>In 2016, we carried out 13 inspections of these vessels.  In 2017 to date, we have carried out 15 inspections of these vessels.  Those are the raw numbers of inspections to date for those vessels.<br\/><br\/>Deputy Martin Kenny mentioned the mincing of fish.  One of the prohibitions for all vessels, including these vessels, is the prohibition to have infrastructure on board that would allow the return of fish to sea post grading.  That would include whether or not they are minced.  Mincing is not something we see on these vessels.  There was one highly publicised scientific trial which was mentioned in the media quite frequently.  That was - I do not have a date in my head - roughly towards the middle of 2015, when there was one vessel in the Irish EZ conducting a mincing trial.  That is not what we find on board these vessels.  Any return of graded fish to sea would be an offence with which we certainly would deal.  What we find in our inspections is that is not the norm.  I think that answers the questions that were asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062700002#Q01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Miche&aacute;l O'Mahony"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498572000,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Mr. Andrew Kinneen wants to come in as well, if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062700002#Q01700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Susan Steele"},{"type":"speech","time":1498572000,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Go ahead.

If they misbehave, they do a hell of a lot of damage.  We are very much aware of that.<\/p> <p>  At present, we have remote sensing equipment and we can tell exactly where the fishing vessel is, its speed and direction.  We can infer from that whether or not it is fishing, maybe not to the extent of legal proof but certainly from the point of view of guesstimating what the vessel is up to out at sea.<\/p> <p>  No doubt it is difficult at times to get aboard these vessels at sea.  It is a serious challenge to be deployed from a Naval Service patrol vessel in a small inflatable, get over beside the boat - I myself have done this job a long time ago - , get up along the side of the boat and get over.  One can be climbing vertically 10 m or 15 m.  It is a difficult job in the best of weather.  It is an impossible job in the conditions prevailing in the Atlantic Ocean a lot of the time.<\/p> <p>  There is a serious problem here.  As Mr. O'Mahony stated, we can be sure if the vessels operating inside our fishing waters are fishing or not.  We can also be sure if they have a legal entitlement to be there.  We are not so sure what they may or may not be doing with regard to high grading or misbehaving with regard to their fish-catching entitlement.  It requires going aboard those vessels to verify that.<\/p> <p>  We are very concerned about this and some years ago, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, took the initiative to get control experts from all over Europe on this particular question to look at what measures might be brought in place to make a more level playing field.<\/p><p>The other fishing vessels over which we have control, the pelagic fishing vessels, come into our ports every one or two days.  As stated by Mr. O'Mahony, we have a good platform in place for them in terms of controls.  They are not foolproof but they are better than what they were.  The super trawlers can work away for a number of weeks and then exit our waters without direct control by us.  We do have powers to direct these fishing vessels to port, but only with good cause.  As is the case of the other fishing vessels we board, we cannot interfere with the normal operation of these fishing vessels without good cause.  There are questions to be answered.  There is an implicit inequality in the way they operate shoulder to shoulder with an equivalent smaller fishing vessel.  We have had anecdotal reports from demersal ground fishermen of large-scale discarding of pelagic species at sea, but we do not know if they come from these large super trawlers or from other pelagic vessels.<\/p><p> We are conscious that there is a problem to be addressed.  We have some good technical leads from the remote sensing equipment, and we hope to develop real capacity with it in conjunction with the coastal state unit.  We are also researching techniques such as the last haul analysis, which involves a detailed examination of what a trawler brings on board in terms of average sizes to determine whether they are different from previous hauls recorded by the fishing vessel and thereby infer whether there has been abuse of the system.  Again, there is a gap between doing that and getting proof of the level required.  Reference was made to the criminal law.  The standard of proof in terms of bringing cases to court is very high.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062700002#Q02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Kinneen","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498572000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I hope the committee is happy with those answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062700002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Susan Steele"},{"type":"speech","time":1498572000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>May I ask a supplementary question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062700002#R00300","speaker":"1400"},{"type":"speech","time":1498572000,"counter":41,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062700002#R00400","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1498572000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>My apologies to Mr. O'Mahony for interrupting him during his presentation.

I note from a previous discussion that the Naval Service boarded the <i>FV Margiris<\/i>in November 2016.  I am focusing on this vessel only because it is the second largest vessel in the world and it gives rise to great concern when it is off our coast.  It was said earlier that, under European regulations, SFPA officers cannot be on board a vessel for longer than four hours and that the authority has the power to call a vessel to port, but to do that it must demonstrate reasonable cause.  Do the witnesses believe that there is need for strengthening of legislation at European level to give the authority the powers to be on board those trawlers when they are in Irish waters given their capacity to do damage?  From my perspective, it is outrageous that there is a four-hour limit in terms of on-board inspections.<\/p><p>My understanding, based on what the SFPA said in its evidence, is that it is impossible to give a cast-iron guarantee in regard to the operations of these super trawlers because of the difficulty in accessing them, particularly in adverse weather conditions, and because the SFPA does not have the power to bring them into an Irish port unless it can demonstrate reasonable cause.  I believe there needs to be an amendment of the legislation or regulations at European level such that when these trawlers enter Irish waters, legally under the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, it is possible to have people on board for much longer than four hours.  I would argue that our officers should be permitted to remain on board for the duration of the time they are in Irish waters.  I would welcome the witnesses' opinion.  If they do not agree with my proposition perhaps they would outline their ideas in this regard.  I note the witnesses' remarks in regard to technology, but I believe to ensure proper monitoring, we need people on board vessels while they are in Irish waters.

We welcome the Senator's passion.<\/p> <p>  In regard to having observers on board a vessel, there is a lot work to be done on this issue.  The policy needs to work.  As regulators, we do not get involved in policy but it needs to be carefully examined and benchmarked with what could work and will work.  In regard to the Senator's suggestion of an observer programme, we would be interested in anything that would assist us.  Is it the only way of dealing with the high risk in this scenario?  No, it is not.  There are records on when fish are landed and when they are sold.  There is also a last haul size grade analysis and many other things that can be looked at.  The assumption here is that the vessels are coming in to work against the Common Fisheries Policy.  Perhaps, they are not.  All these issues need to be addressed.  There is no simple solution.

We know that there are CCTV systems that are very effective in identifying production lines and what is happening on them to try to eliminate risks of illegal discarding and high-grading.  Again, that is a policy matter.  I know from hearing people in the fishing industry that they do not necessarily welcome the imposition of these technologies on boats.  It is a one-size-fits-all in the way it is set up at the moment for the larger fishing vessels.  There is no clear demarcation between vessels that freeze their fish or catch it and land it fresh.

The general pattern of such vessels is to come, stay for quite some time and fish heavily while they are here, weather permitting.  A total of 15 inspections in the year to date is a relatively high proportion of the fishing trips.  If we go on board a vessel that has been in Irish waters for three weeks, that is an index of what it has been doing for three weeks, which might be compared, for example, to a lot of other vessels that might fish for two or three days and then land and we would inspect them then.  Each of those landing inspections is an index of three days fishing activity whereas an inspection of a super trawler is an index of three weeks fishing activity.  It is not really a case of comparing apples with apples.  The figures I have given are in our view a useful percentage of the number of trips of those vessels but I accept they do not look big in the overall context.<\/p><p>We do not have the figure for the proportion of the Irish Box that is taken by these vessels.  They fish particular species - pelagic species - and generally target horse mackerel within the Irish EZ.  It would be their main reason for coming to the Irish EZ.  Many other fish are caught in the Irish EZ.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about follow through to the landing state.  We have worked hard to make as good a relationship as we can with our equivalents in the Netherlands or Lithuania.  There are really three states.  There is a coastal state - us - the flag state and the landing state, which we call the port state.  In some instances, our analysis of the data available to us might indicate that a potential risk of non-compliance.  We would highlight that to the flag state, which would highlight it to the port state.  On some occasions, although not very often, we have gone to view the inspection of the landing in the port state as well.  These are frozen boxes of fish so it is a box count and a pallet count.  Essentially, they are placed on pallets before they come off so they are really giant freezers.  The boxes are relatively amenable to being counted.  There is the issue of making sure a pallet of 30 kg boxes is a pallet of 30 kg boxes and not a pallet of 35 kg boxes.

If they develop more selective catch methods, they avoid the problem of having unwanted catches of fish for which they have no commercial use that they must manage when they come ashore.  If they cannot manage to be more selective in their catches, we will have a lot of problems.  We will have problems managing the catch that has been brought ashore.  We have been trying to encourage fishermen to record discards so that we have an idea of what is being dealt with.  We cannot say this has been a success despite our efforts at persuasion.  There have been port meetings held by the SFPA and our parent Department to try to explain this quite complex regulation to the fishermen.  I would say that there is a lot of work to be done in this area.  We could not claim that this is an area of high compliance at the moment.  We see this regulation as something that is of great benefit to fishermen if they can take it on board and take control of it themselves - not seeing it as a cat-and-mouse issue but one where they use their intelligence to catch the fish they want to keep.

On behalf of my colleagues, it is great to have an opportunity to make comments on the Bill.  The Minister appears to justify the Bill on the basis it is the continuation of fishing that has been going on for 15 years and he is therefore under some sort of moral obligation to facilitate it; that it is required because fishing vessels from the Republic of Ireland enjoy reciprocal rights to fishing sites from UK waters; and that it is a token of goodwill from the Minister for the Brexit negotiations between the UK and the EU.  Setting this aside, we present evidence the Minister's position is contradicted by facts on historical fishing and reciprocity and that it has no moral basis as it offers something far beyond what could be expected or offered by another country.  It also leaves Ireland open to additional legal risk, of which the Minister is already aware.<br\/><br\/>The proposed legislation will permit UK vessels access to our zero to six mile zone around the Irish coast, where they can be treated as if they are Irish vessels.  I refer to TAB1 D1 in the documentation provided to committee members, which shows a map of what the area looks like.  The UK fleet already enjoys privileged access to our waters in the zone between six to 12 miles along the east coast.  This was settled at the London Fisheries Convention of 1964.  This is easily available to see at TAB1 D2 in our submission document.<br\/><br\/>Northern Irish vessels, being UK vessels, enjoy access to inshore waters of the entire UK and all waters outside Ireland's 12-mile limit.  This is a big area.  Without the Bill, these vessels can still operate out of Irish ports in accordance with the London Fisheries Convention.  There is no suggestion UK vessels will either give up this access to the UK zone or reciprocate with the same access for Irish boats by Ireland passing the Bill.<br\/><br\/>Irish fishermen vehemently opposed the <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement when the Government of the day attempted to impose it in the 1960s, and disputed the concept of UK vessels fishing in the zero to six-mile zone.  There then followed serious disputes at sea off Dunmore East.  Any suggestion this has continued happily since the 1960s is factually incorrect.  There are numerous contemporaneous reports of hostility in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>from 1959 to 1966 that support this.  The evidence conveys a very different picture to the 50 years of happy fishing outside the zero to six-mile zone that the Minister presented to the Seanad.<br\/><br\/>At the beginning of the mussel case, the Minister and the Attorney General wished to disown the natural resources, the territorial seas and their property.  This is referenced at TAB2 D4 in the submission document.  What would happen if we had not successfully appealed the High Court decision to the Supreme Court?  Can the same people be trusted to do the right thing now or are they using the Oireachtas as a face-saving mechanism?  Have the same attitudes deprived Ireland of the benefits of its oil and gas resources?  Were oil and gas policies more rushed decisions involving blind cross-party support without understanding the consequences?  Are we to be an island nation without its own seas and marine resources?  The Barlow 2 case in the Supreme Court involved the reversal of roles, whereby the citizen had to protect the Constitution and the State with the Minister and the Attorney Channel opposing.<br\/><br\/>Fishing rights are to be guarded and preserved.  They are part of our sovereignty and Constitution.  The Supreme Court found that fishing by Northern Ireland vessels was illegal so any rights gained by these UK vessels or shellfish farms during the reference periods are now also void and must be returned to Irish fishing communities.  The simple way to address the issue is to abandon the Bill and allocate the relevant quotas back to the host state, which is Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The Marine Institute atlas shows an image of where Irish vessels fish around the entire coast of Ireland.  This is included in the documentation, at TAB1 D3.  It also shows an image of fishing activities by various national fleets in Irish waters, which is incredible.  Each time the Government has attempted to force this arrangement on Irish fishermen, the industry has opposed it, never more clearly than as expressed by Irish fishing organisations before the committee on 20 June 2017.  An explanation of the so-called arrangement has always been that it is above our station to question such matters.  We were told it was non-justicable and we had no standing to ask questions on it or even to challenge it.  The Supreme Court judgment finally put to bed this &quot;it is legal now so go away&quot; argument.<br\/><br\/>I wish to make a small correction to what is printed on the top of page 5 of our submission document.  The first line should refer to the Barlow 2 case and not the Barlow 1 case.<br\/><br\/>The UK structured its position on the <i>voisinage<\/i>letters that set out the arrangement in such a way that any rights vessels from the Republic of Ireland enjoyed fell away automatically as soon as the arrangement was ended.  We hear about a <i>voisinage <\/i>agreement, but this is only a few letters which do not say a lot.  However, one thing they do say is the arrangement will apply so long as the authorities of the Republic of Ireland continue to accord to Northern Irish vessels the same treatment as they would accord to vessels of the Republic of Ireland in the waters around the entire Irish coast.  This is included at TAB2 D3 in the documentation.<br\/><br\/>We contend the arrangement referred to in the <i>voisinage<\/i>letters is an arrangement from December 1959, and the arrangement was not to prosecute Six-County fishermen for fishing inside Ireland's new three- mile limits.  It was stated the strict legal position was that boats registered in the Six Counties were not entitled to fish in the new limits, that it would be impolitic to make an announcement that the law would not be enforced against Six-County fishermen and that the informal attitude to Six-County fishermen within the fishing limits would be continued.  It was also stated that no announcement would be made on the matter.  A senior judge described it as unlawful but tolerated.  This is the same context on which this new fisheries Bill is based, that is, not to prosecute.<br\/><br\/>The Minister referred in the Seanad to Irish fishermen utilising vessels from outside the jurisdiction.  Is this covered in the Bill by the term &quot;sea-fishing boat owned and operated in Northern Ireland&quot;?<\/p><p>That is a UK-flagged vessel owned and operated in Ireland&rsquo;s exclusive fisheries zone.  The Bill is being diluted for abuse in favour of UK vessels as it proceeds through the Seanad.  These vessels can still operate out of Irish ports and be owned by Irish fishermen but they cannot fish in the zero to six-mile zone.  Accordingly, there is no hardship or need for compensation as suggested by Deputy Gallagher at the previous committee meeting.  Deputy Gallagher&rsquo;s constituency of Donegal has 360 Irish fishing vessels that deserve his attention.<br\/><br\/>The Supreme Court was asked to make a decision as to the legality of fishing by Northern Irish fishing vessels.  It decided unanimously that it was illegal.  For clarity, this applied to all areas within Ireland&rsquo;s zero to 12-mile zone, apart from that provided for under the London Fisheries Convention, which can be seen at TAB1 D2 in the documentation provided.<br\/><br\/>With regard to Brexit negotiations and international agreements, our understanding is that the European Union has adopted a policy that there will be no bilateral agreements with the UK prior to Brexit.  Has the Minister investigated the consequences of legalising this fishing in terms of our obligations to our EU partners?  Has he investigated the risks the proposed legislation may create under Article 8(2) of the London Fisheries Convention?  Article 9(2), which is normally referred to, only applies to vessels that habitually fished under <i>voisinage<\/i>arrangements, not to be confused with a regime of &quot;not to prosecute&quot;.  Does the legislation comply with the Minister&rsquo;s fisheries management obligations, for example, in respect of conservation and management?  Will the Minister need to have joint management with the UK for Ireland&rsquo;s inshore waters?  Will he have to consult again with Stormont when managing the mussel industry in Cromane, in County Kerry?<br\/><br\/>Is the Minister aware that when he was in the Seanad on this matter on 8 March 2017, on the same day the UK fisheries Minister was being advised that the Common Fisheries Policy superseded the London Fisheries Convention, meaning that historic fishing rights derive from EU law, and not from the convention?  There was a man here who said he was sceptical as to whether the London fisheries rights could be revived after 40 years.  That reference is in TAB3 D3.<br\/><br\/>With regard to precedent for the legislation, the Minister should be aware that the<i>voisinage<\/i>arrangements concluded between other countries are never unrestricted.  He should note that <i>voisinage<\/i>arrangements made at the London Fisheries Convention are all documented in EU Regulation 1380\/2013 and listed in Annex I to the aforementioned document.  There is no mention of the Irish arrangement permitting UK vessels to operate in Ireland&rsquo;s zero to 12-mile zone other than that illustrated at TAB1 D2, the text version of which is in TAB2 D6.<br\/><br\/>All other agreements are specifically restricted to prevent abuse.  Typical restrictions include limits on species and locations.  Where is Ireland&rsquo;s <i>voisinage<\/i>recorded in this annexe?  The Minister alludes to this <i>voisinage<\/i>being in place since 1960.  The London Fisheries Convention was completed in March 1964 yet the so-called <i>voisinage<\/i>letters were dated September and December 1965, so how does the proposed unrestricted access sit in that context?<br\/><br\/>There is incontrovertible evidence that Northern Ireland shellfish farms, that is, plots of land on the sea bed, were allocated thousands of tonnes of mussel seed in the Republic of Ireland. <b><\/b>Some of those farms did not even own a fishing boat.  We then had a <i>voisinage<\/i>for fish farms.  Nevertheless, joint management under the legal umbrella or foundation of <i>voisinage <\/i>arrangements somehow allowed for allocation-quota of a precious Irish natural resource to UK shellfish farms.  These quotas or entitlements have since been traded but, more importantly, Irish businesses had to suffer the loss of these resources and Irish processing plants have closed down.  The Irish Department will not consider permitting Irish fishing vessels to have individual transferable quotas but was willing to permit a UK shellfish farm an individual transferable quota of mussel seed in the Irish Sea and the farm need not have a boat.<br\/><br\/>Has the Minister been made aware of such activities by his officials?  Does he propose to prevent such behaviour happening again in the future?  Does the Minister give foreign interests priority over Irish communities in this Bill?  Where is the legal, moral or economic justification for this?  Will the Minister rule out categorically that the ancillary legislation envisaged will provide for similar abusive regimes previously described as joint management or the seed mussel allocation committee, SMAC?<br\/><br\/>As for good relations and the all-island agenda, if the Minister wishes to give access to Northern Irish vessels on the basis of some higher political goal, he should say so explicitly.  If he chooses to legislate to give free access to our zero to six-mile zone, then he cannot simply ignore the legal rights of Irish fishermen, including their right to earn a living, and the constitutional protections that exist in respect of this and other rights.  When the then Taoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass, met with Captain O'Neill in the early 1960s, they did discuss agriculture and fisheries.  On fisheries, they discussed prosecutions for illegal fishing.  Today, there are examples of co-operation on agriculture on an all-island basis.  There is an all-island animal disease control plan, but that does not permit farmers from one jurisdiction or a dairy processor to milk the cows from the neighbouring jurisdiction, although they can buy the milk.<br\/><br\/>The <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement we have experienced is the only example of a transfer of assets.  What the then Taoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass, discussed with Captain O'Neill is documented in the National Archives and reported to the Oireachtas accordingly.  There is no mention of any <i>voisinage<\/i>agreement.  The reason for that is obvious, as can be seen in the difference between the then Taoiseach's SI 173\/1959 and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny's SI 22\/2016.<br\/><br\/>Further clarification on <i>voisinage<\/i>is available to the elected members in the Official Report of the D&aacute;il debate on the Maritime Jurisdiction (Amendment) Act 1964, during which the London Fisheries Convention is discussed but <i>voisinage<\/i>is not mentioned at all.  The <i>voisinage<\/i>dialogue letters do not occur until September and December 1965, more than a year later.  My colleague, Mr. Crowley, will later give a position offered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on <i>voisinage <\/i>in 2012.  The answer from the Minister, Deputy Creed, to Deputy McConalogue in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 24 November 2016 is somewhat misleading in so far as the Supreme Court judgment related to the zero to 12-mile zone and not the zero to six-mile zone referred to in the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  Perhaps the record of the D&aacute;il should be amended accordingly.<br\/><br\/>I will turn to my summary and proposed way forward.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, appears to have lost sight of the fact that he is dealing with illegal fishing in this legislation.  Fishing takes place in an environment where rules are numerous and strictly enforced, typically to the letter of the law.  What the Minister is actually proposing is to set aside the law for a specific group of British-flagged vessels to operate inside the Irish zero to six miles coastal zone and not be prosecuted.<br\/><br\/>The Minister is also proposing to allow another state decide which vessels will qualify to be classed in that &quot;not for prosecution&quot; group.  The terms &quot;Northern Ireland Owned and Operated&quot; and &quot;<i>voisinag<\/i>e&quot; are vague, uncertain and so incapable of enforcement they are void because of uncertainty.  Is this intentional on the part of the Minister?  Which part applies - owned or operated?  Even the text of the Bill is a contradiction of itself.  Does the Minister realise that while the Irish vessel registration system proves ownership, the UK registration system does not?  State authorities said they cannot look behind the licensing regime of another country, even if the vessels are fishing in Irish waters.<br\/><br\/>It is our honestly held view that this legislation is nothing more than a vindictive attempt to punish the fishermen and the industry which took the Supreme Court case.  The intent of the Minister is in all likelihood incapable of legislation but the ideology behind the Bill raises serious concerns.  Recently, we heard that fishermen who operate in the Moville district of Lough Foyle may not be given allocations this year.<br\/><br\/>To provide our summary of the proposed legislation, the arrangement to set aside the law was never legal and consequently should never earn any sort of legal recognition.  It has been continually opposed by Irish fishermen since the first attempt to impose it on us.  It was resurrected to facilitate access to our mussel resource for large Dutch corporations using Northern Ireland as a flag of convenience.  The legislation is not supported by any moral obligation given that no other country has ever given such access, nor does the UK give anyone else such access.  We are swopping a horse for a rabbit.<br\/><br\/>UK fishermen will continue to enjoy privileged access to our east coast six to 12 mile zone without this legislation.  The legislation offers nothing for the fishermen or taxpayers of the Republic of Ireland.  It will result in loss of income, jobs, taxes and people from Irish coastal communities.  Experience suggests that it will be abused in a similar manner as occurred in the bottom mussel industry historically.  It is already drafted for abuse.  The main beneficiaries will be large foreign corporations initially, followed by those who will exploit the loopholes now being created in the regulatory regimes by this Bill.  It may create major legal difficulties for Ireland elsewhere.  In the context of Brexit and the apparent intent of the UK to withdraw from the London Fisheries Convention, the Minister should not be introducing any new fisheries legislation.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has a sea territory ten times its land area.<\/p><p>This vast resource only produces around &euro;500 million worth of fisheries material per year for Ireland.  We would like to take this opportunity to begin new thinking for this massive resource and what it could mean for the coastal communities of Ireland.  We need new thinking whereby Ireland&rsquo;s leaders value our marine resources and develop an industry as large as farming.  The resources are there and other countries are harnessing them, as can be seen in tab No. 1, D5.  Deputy Creed&rsquo;s speech in October 2016 at the eighth meeting of the National Inshore Fisheries Forum stated: \"The inshore sector, comprising fishing boats of less than 12 metres in overall length, make up more than 80% of the Irish fleet and are predominately active within six nautical miles of the Irish shore&rdquo;.  That is over 1,600 Irish vessels depending on the area the Minister is canvassing the committee to give access to for UK vessels to fish in.  Note the Minister is not saying the Irish fleet needs the coast of the Six Counties. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062700002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerard Kelly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498572000,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelly for summarising as much as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2017062700002#W00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1498572000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I welcome the four witnesses to the committee and thank Mr. Kelly for his presentation.

They are certainly complex, difficult issues and do not lend themselves to a summary evaluation or assessment and require drilling down into various points, because following through on various issues, it seems to be the witnesses' contention that the Department has misconstrued the outcome of the Supreme Court case.  The witness is saying that this applies to all areas within the zero to 12-mile zones, apart from the areas provided for under the London convention.  Is that correct?<\/p> <p>  If the new Bill is passed into law, can the witnesses summarise how they will be disadvantaged?  There has been a significant focus on aggressive dredging in the zero to six-mile zone when fishing for mussels, which is wiping out the industry.  Are the witnesses saying that this legislation is not only premature but is not necessary?  Is that the contention?  I want to debate this with the witnesses.  The Minister says that he brought it forward in the interests of re-establishing what was a prior right which did not have a legal basis but which was essential due to the reciprocity arrangement.  Could the witnesses explain how those vessels register in an owned and operated scenario?  Can the witnesses give an example of how that operates?<\/p> <p>  They mentioned some Dutch vessels.  The witnesses are saying that not only is the legislation not necessary but it is premature in advance of the Brexit negotiations.  I am inclined to agree with them.  I said in the D&aacute;il that I do not see anything happening on Brexit for five or six years.  There has been no clarification.<\/p> <p>  Everyone is going around talking about stuff.  They do not have a clue.  No one does.  There are toenail experts talking about Brexit now.  The only certainty is continued uncertainty.  The very people who promoted Brexit do not know what it is about themselves.  Let us be clear about that.  Experts in this country are trying to say that we should be prepared.  It is nonsense.  I thought that the legislation was totally vague and imprecise, and if it was challenged in the courts it would fall due to uncertainty.  I am not saying that because it suits the agenda of the witnesses.  I believe that it was rushed in response to the Supreme Court case.  Mr. Justice O'Donnell gave the judgment.  Did the witnesses interpret from that judgment that the Department should actually bring forward its legislation?  That appears to be a follow on.<\/p> <p>  The impression that I got from what the Minister was saying in the Seanad was that this was only going to regularise the situation and that friendly cooperation was important, and the judge did advert to that in the course of his judgment.  Is it the view of the witnesses that there was no necessity for the Minister to bring forward this legislation because it was not advised?  The Minister does not have to do what a judge tells him, and there has been much talk about the separation of powers in recent times.  The judge indicated that a lacuna in the law would have to be fixed, but the witnesses are saying that there never was a lacuna in the law and that this was never the position.

I and my colleague, Dr. Gene Mehigan, are teacher educators in the Marino Institute of Education, MIE, a higher education institution in Dublin and an associated college of Trinity College Dublin, TCD.  Currently, we have an enrolment of almost 1,000 students across a range of undergraduate and postgraduate degree programmes in education.  However, the focus of our work is the education of future primary teachers, and almost 600 of our students are in this category.  Practitioner preparation for teaching children with a variety of strengths and needs in mainstream schools, special education contexts and DEIS schools is a central element of our work in these programmes, as it is in our separate degree programme for those working or planning to work in the field of early childhood education.  While provision of this nature permeates all our curricula, we also offer year-long core modules relevant to inclusive and special education, together with a range of school placement experiences in each of the school settings referred to.  Our student teachers demonstrate a keen interest in this provision.  They engage tremendously well with the courses and placements, and most elect to undertake their final dissertations on topics pertinent to the areas we are discussing today.<br\/><br\/>Nonetheless, as an academic staff, most of whom are also highly experienced classroom practitioners, we can empathise greatly with the very considerable challenges experienced and reported to us by these students as they take on the mantle of beginning as teachers in ever more diverse and complex classroom contexts.  As has been well documented, the process of transitioning from committed student teacher to effective beginning teacher is a demanding undertaking.  Learning to teach well is challenging.  In today&rsquo;s school contexts it can be overwhelming.  As teacher educators, we recognise that we must respond appropriately to this situation, but we also know that teacher education alone is not a sufficient response.  We suggest therefore, that school structures be equally addressed if our future teachers are not to resort to coping and survival strategies at the outset of their careers, to the detriment of their powerful potential as inclusive educators.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>In 2016, MIE was granted significant funding under the EU Erasmus+ programme to lead a five-country study in exploring this issue.  In light of European and national policies which promote mainstreaming over more specialised schooling provision, our three-year remit as a cross-sectoral, international project team of practising teachers and teacher educators is to identify best practice in inclusive education in our institutions and schools, and to recommend specific approaches that could advance such practice.  Even at this early stage of the project, after study visits to schools and teacher education institutions in Finland and Belgium, the project team is unanimous about the significant potential of one particular strategy for advancing inclusion in schools, namely, that of co-teaching in both teacher education and school practice.<br\/><br\/>In schools, co-teaching entails two teachers teaching together, sharing responsibility for meeting the learning needs of pupils, and at the same time learning from each other.  In the co-teaching model we observed in Finland, one of these teachers was an experienced mainstream teacher while the other was a qualified and experienced special needs teacher.  As we observed, with such a co-teaching partnership in a mainstream class, all children in the class will have greater opportunity not only to be present for but also, in accordance with current policy, to participate in and benefit from mainstream education.  In the teacher education context, the student teacher teaches alongside the host teacher rather than instead of him or her, and so is likely to be afforded greater opportunity at an early stage of professional development to learn about, and respond appropriately to, pupils&rsquo; diverse strengths and needs.  In both contexts, the strategy entails planning together and sharing review and evaluation of teaching and pupil learning.  An emerging body of research literature is pointing to the invaluable potential of such co-teaching approaches for advancing student teacher learning, experienced teacher learning and, above all, pupil learning in classroom contexts of considerable diversity.<br\/><br\/>On the basis of our own extensive experience in primary education, we would suggest that consideration be given to establishing a two-year pilot co-teaching for inclusion project at primary level.  Such a project would see the introduction to the primary school system of trained co-teaching tutors who would also be in a position to serve as host co-teachers to our student teachers and others undertaking school placement experience.  As outlined above, this initiative could have significant potential to advance educational provision for all primary schoolchildren in Ireland.  Furthermore, our proposal supports a number of Government policies and priorities, namely, the Department of Education and Skills special education teaching allocation model as outlined in circular 0013\/2017; the new primary language curriculum for English and Irish medium schools, as the suggested focus of this pilot project would be on literacy and language education; the policy on Gaeltacht education 2017 to 2022; the DEIS plan 2017; and the Department of Education and Skills literacy and numeracy strategy 2011.<br\/><br\/>We have outlined a proposed structure for such a pilot project in the documentation submitted to the committee.

I had planned for five minutes.  I will outline the issues.  Our suggestions are laid out in our submission to the joint committee.  I may discuss a few of them.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for affording us the opportunity to give the views of our members.  The National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, NABMSE, is the management voice of special education in Ireland and represents boards of management of special schools and mainstream primary and post-primary schools, usually with special classes.<\/p> <p>  In my statement, I will concentrate on the adequacy of training and supports for providers of special needs education.  I will not touch on the DEIS issue as it is not our issue.  The first matter I will address is training.  While there is some training available for teachers at initial teacher education level, most training is undertaken as continuing professional development, CPD, and through induction.  We have provided some detail of CPD in our submission, and while this is very welcome, teachers must have some experience of special education to undertake these certificate and diploma courses.  Very often, it is the newer entrant to the school who may be asked to teach in the special class.<\/p> <p>  We acknowledge the huge range of supports available from the special education support service, SESS, in our submission.  However, we have also detailed the lack of training for other members of staff involved in the support of pupils with special educational needs, SEN, in schools, namely, the special needs assistants, SNAs, and bus escorts.  The issues we have identified in respect of the training needs and associated issues include a lack of essential whole-school training; the high costs of initial training of staff in a range of areas and the costs of regular renewal of this training, some areas of which we have identified in our submission; the high cost of positive behaviour, crisis intervention and health and safety training; and the need for training of bus escorts.  Our suggestion is for an annual training fund for the training of whole-school staff, including the roll-out of bus escort training.<\/p> <p>  The second part of our written submission details the area of supports and their level of adequacy.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, policy advice paper, Supporting Students with Special Education Needs in Schools, published in 2013, contains 28 recommendations in respect of training and CPD, early intervention, transition planning, etc.  There are a huge range of recommendations there.<\/p><p>The findings and recommendations of the report should be examined and implemented without delay.  One recommendation on the new allocation model of teaching resources to mainstream schools has been introduced recently, so there is some movement.<\/p><p> Our first issue is that of capitation funding.  Special schools and classes receive enhanced capitation grants based on the special educational needs of their students.  However, this grant has been reduced over the past seven years and does not adequately cover the needs in this setting.  In these schools, capitation is required to cover the basic running costs, but in special education settings, these costs are higher due to the complex and additional needs of the students.  In addition to the basic running costs and essential staff training, which are referred to in our submission, maintenance of specialised equipment and health and medical provisions are also funded from the capitation grant and very often from fund-raising as well.  Some schools have experienced difficulties this year with the cost of insurance, and work has started on examining the issue.  It is hoped a resolution can be found in the near future.  Suggestions in our submission include an examination of capitation funding with a view to increasing the funding.  I have also mentioned the introduction of a training fund which schools could, with guidelines, avail of and prioritise their training needs.<\/p><p> The second issue is staffing.  I will refer again to the NCSE report.  There is a need for a reduced pupil-teacher ratio.  Recommendation 27.2 of the report regarding a reduced pupil-teacher ratio and provision of a school nurse reflects the complexity of needs in some special schools and settings.<\/p><p> Another issue we have identified is substitute cover for all teacher absences in special education settings and issues relating to posts of responsibility and the appointment of principals and deputy principals.  I have mentioned the deputy principal issue in this forum before but I will refer to it again.  NABMSE suggests a number of things.  One is substitute cover for all teacher absences because a class of children with special educational needs cannot be divided.  All staff should be included in the determination of posts of responsibility in special education settings.<\/p><p> We welcome all the recent curriculum developments, including levels 1 and 2.  However, it is essential that special educational needs are included in all new curriculum developments in the primary and post-primary sector.  This includes language and numeracy, which was mentioned by the previous speaker.<\/p><p> One of the issues identified is the provision of specialist subject teachers for pupils aged over 12.  There has been no allocation from the Department for some years.  That is causing some trouble in the introduction of these new programmes.  Other issues are the provision of suitable learning materials and the provision of home, school, community liaison for special schools, which is recommendation 27.3 in this policy advice paper.  I will mention one of the suggestions in our submission.  A mechanism needs to be found to increase specialist teacher hours for special education settings.  Another is the implementation of the home, school, community liaison service for schools without delay.<\/p><p> The fourth issue we have identified is on planning.  A number of the issues identified are opportunities for inclusion, which should be planned for, and transition planning from various levels of schools, that is, primary mainstream to post-primary mainstream and back and forth between special schools and mainstream schools.  A really important one, which the committee mentioned, is future planning for special educational needs provision, especially in the area of post-primary provision.  It is clear that co-ordinated planning needs to take place around educational provision for special educational needs.  It is essential there is early transition planning between health and education, planning for inclusion and planning for proper provision of special classes to ensure students with special educational needs are provided with an appropriate education.<\/p><p> The next issue is support staff.  We all know here that the education of students with special educational needs can depend on their ability to access the curriculum.  This is often dependent on the correct health related supports being available.  We have identified the need for funding and governance of nursing staff as many special education providers are educating students with the most complex medical needs.  Recommendation 27.3 of the NCSE report No. 4 should be implemented without delay.  We also suggest that other therapies detailed in the submission could be provided on a cluster basis to schools and that the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, be available to all schools.<\/p><p> I am almost finished.  Integration between health and education is an important issue.  We feel substantial moneys are being spent in the education system.  However, a more integrated approach throughout the system might yield better results.  There needs to be more robust integration between health and education, particularly in the provision of therapies, services and nurses.<\/p><p> The last point is on ICT and assistive technology.  The use of ICT and assistive technology is essential in the provision of education to pupils with special educational needs.  The current ICT grant to schools awards &euro;4 extra per pupil with special educational needs.  However, as the numbers of pupils in special schools tend to be lower, this is inadequate to purchase the equipment.  Some of the suggestions we will look at is the recognition that communications technologies are essential for access to the curriculum for some children, an increase in the funding for ICT to special education settings to reflect their specialist nature, and establishing funding for our schools for multisensory rooms or environments.  Providing other methods of distributing the ICT grant should be explored.  Suggestions have been made for a separate scheme for special education or a grant per classroom rather than per pupil.<\/p><p> I have probably gone over my time.  I thank the committee for the opportunity today and we look forward to working with everyone.  Members have probably seen my submission.  There is a lot more in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Breda Corr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Corr.

I am principal of Scoil na Naomh Uilig in Newbridge.  It is a fully inclusive school with 565 pupils from 31 ethnic backgrounds.  The school caters for children of all abilities, from children with severe and profound learning disabilities to gifted children.  We have five special classes dotted throughout the school building: three for children with autism and two for children with severe and profound learning disabilities.  Each child is integrated wherever possible with his or her peers in mainstream classrooms.  We also have excellent facilities for meeting children's sensory needs.  We also have a very large cohort of children with moderate and multiple disabilities enrolled in our mainstream classes.  We have gained a reputation for dealing positively with children with special needs.  As a result, we are receiving more enrolments of children presenting with challenging behaviour.  That is our reality.  Every child in our school is a valued member of our community and we all learn from each other.  There are a number of issues I wish to address.  However, I must preface this by saying I am only speaking from my experience as principal of Scoil na Naomh Uilig.<\/p> <p>  The issues are access to education for children with special educational needs, nursing and clinical support, training, challenging behaviour, and access to DEIS status.  The most pressing issue for us is access to education for children with special needs.  Inclusivity is the way to go.  Everyone in our school community benefits from the model we are developing.  Our model was set up ten years ago and it needs to be replicated throughout the country both at primary and secondary level.  In our school, there are eight children in fifth class.  Some of the parents are here today because they cannot find suitable places for their children in the secondary school system.  There are simply not enough places.  These parents embraced inclusive education seven years ago, and now they are caught in limbo, with limited places available in mainstream secondary schools and no capacity in the special schools because they already have their own cohort of children coming forward from the primary system.  It is unfair on these parents that they should have to search for and spearhead campaigns to find places for their children.  It is their constitutional right.  The Department needs to adopt a proactive approach to providing education for children with special needs at all levels.  These parents should, like me, be able to go to the local secondary schools and see which one best fits their children's education.<\/p> <p>  The next issue I will address is nursing and clinical support.  Our nurse was employed initially for 26.5 hours per week to care for the complex medical needs of three children.<\/p><p>Ten years later, her hours have been reduced to 24 per week and her workload, including copious amounts of paperwork, has significantly increased.  She now looks after 35 children, nine of whom have complex medical needs.  She is unable to take a lunch break and works, on average, nine hours extra per week for which she is not paid.  Mr. Jim Mulkerrins, from the Department of Education and Skills, is meeting special schools in Dublin to examine the standardisation of nursing support throughout the system but this really needs to be addressed urgently.<\/p><p> Our school is very lucky in that it has access to clinical care but it takes up to 18 months for an initial assessment to take place.  This is particularly unfair when one has a child with challenging behaviour.  In fairness to the child, classmates and the teacher, access to psychological services needs to be immediate in a case such as this.<\/p><p> On training, there are many aspects.  I have addressed them in my written submission.  More comprehensive training for special education needs to be provided at initial teacher training level and also at school level.  I take Dr. Ryan's points.  In Scoil na Naomh Uilig, our more pressing issue is that substitute cover needs to be provided for peer training prior to a mainstream teacher taking a special class.  Comprehensive training, which is currently available only on a limited basis for teachers in severe and profound autism classes, should be mandatory for every teacher taking such classes.  A similar course is also necessary for dealing with challenging behaviour.   A minimum qualification for bus escort and special needs assistance should be a FETAC level 6 qualification in child care and special needs.  Teachers need training on the management of SNA staff.  In an inclusive school, whole staff training is essential.  The Department needs to give us clear guidelines, directions and training on restrictive practice in school.  It is essential that training for dealing with special educational needs be mandatory and paid for by the Department and that substitute cover be provided.<\/p><p> The last point I would like to address is access to DEIS status.  As I stated in my written submission, we do not have DEIS status.  Our school has a very mixed population but more than 200 pupils in our school are from a socially disadvantaged background.  If they were in a smaller school, they would qualify for DEIS status.  The number of children with significant special educational needs should be a factor in the allocation of DEIS status.  When we visited schools in Boston to examine their model for dealing with children with special needs, we found each child with special needs was counted as two children in the mainstream class.  This meant the pupil-teacher ratio was immediately lowered.  In a school like ours, the teachers' workload would be somewhat reduced.  Surely some kind of sliding scale could be used to roll out the benefits of DEIS to all who need them.  I thank members and will answer any questions they have afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Noreen Duggan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Duggan.

I feel very privileged to be allowed to talk today.  We always feel very marginalised being a special school.  People do not know what to do with us.  I am the principal of St. Anne's special school in the Curragh, County Kildare.    We currently have 80 pupils enrolled.  We have 14 teachers and 30 special needs assistants.  I have had the privilege of having worked in special education for 39 years, 20 as a principal.  I have witnessed many positive innovations, instigated by the Department of Education and Skills over the years, up to and including inclusivity and this wondrous thing, the new junior cycle programme.  It is so innovative it is wonderful.<\/p> <p>  I have also witnessed the evolution of the special school model over this period.  It occurred without any definition or statement by the Department regarding what a special school is and should be, what it should offer, what its pupils should or could achieve by the time they leave at 18 years of age.  There is actually no written description of a special school except a vague reference in the special education review committee, SERC, report of 1993.  This only outlines a staffing ratio, which exists to this very day.  This lack of definition created a vacuum that was rapidly filled by the patrons of special schools, which were typically voluntary bodies that had provided to their schools funding and, in many cases, additional staff.  It was logical, therefore, that the vision created for special schools would be determined by their patrons.  With increases in capitation and funding, particularly for building projects and visionary aspects of the curriculum and organisational matters, this support of the patrons has been much diminished.  Aspects of this legacy remain, however.<\/p> <p>  If I were to describe our school, I would say it is successful but struggling.  Resources and supports have not increased in line with the complex needs or the numbers of children enrolled.  My concerns are representative of special schools all over Ireland but for the purpose of this meeting, I am reflecting the views of my school.  My submission was quite lengthy and I was trying to reduce it to five minutes.  I hope members will give it a good read-through.<\/p> <p>  Special schools are under tremendous pressure to enrol any child who applies as there seems to be a shortage of places.  This is regardless of the fact that the school might be full, whether the class is suitable or whether the child's needs can be met.  This is particularly relevant if the child develops behaviours that pose a challenge.  The more challenging the child, the more quickly he or she is filtered down through the system to us.  Our school, I am told, is considered the last resort.  If not here, then where?  It can be quite offensive to hear this as a school.<\/p> <p>  Segregation exists and discriminates against children with different needs from those who were discriminated against 20 or 30 years ago.  It seems that certain children are not suitable for inclusion, regardless of their academic ability.  It appears that, in many instances, the only suitable place is a special school, without a statement or even knowledge of why that is the case.<\/p> <p>  We have to ask what it is about the special school teacher that makes him or her suitable and competent to teach children with these needs, yet somehow mainstream teachers are not.  Why is it more acceptable for staff in special schools to sustain injuries and for children to miss out on their educational experience than in a mainstream setting?  Let me give statistics on injuries reported since the start of this year.  There were 189 incidents against staff and 59 against other pupils.<\/p> <p>  It is important to consider some facts on this.  Autism units in mainstream schools have access to the same grants to set the class up, the same staffing ratio, the same capitation, the same access to training and the same support, in Kildare at least, from the network disability teams as our school.  We, however, are obliged to take the most challenging from these classes without additional supports or resources and, often, to place them with several others who display challenging behaviours in the same class.  This is unrealistic and is not working.  It is also the worst model of education provision and can result in an appalling learning environment. <\/p> <p>  What does a special school offer that others cannot?  Dr. Jean Ware, in her report on the role of the special schools and classes in Ireland, examined this briefly but it still was not definitive.  The reality is quite persuasive: there is nothing that a special school teacher or, indeed, a special school can do that cannot be done anywhere else.  We are finding that psychologists are making the decisions as to who enrols in our schools through section 29 appeals.  Many of these professionals have never visited our school.  We are full and we will continue to be full for the next few years.  Already pressure is mounting for September 2018.  On one hand, our own clinical team is condemning our old buildings as being unsuitable for children with sensory processing difficulties but on the other, another psychologist is supporting a section 29 appeal that ensured we had to put an extra child into an already overcrowded room, simply because it was perceived that the child had no other choice.  We know from listening to our colleagues here that this is not the case.<\/p> <p>  We are finding it impossible to attract teachers to our school.  We do not have access to qualified substitute teachers like most schools in the area but splitting classes in our school is extremely problematic.  Let me give a few more statistics.  This year, we lost 172 days to teacher absence without any substitute cover.  There were 46 days within that where we had two teachers absent.  There were 22 days within that period on which there were three teachers absent, 12 on which there were four absent, seven on which there were five absent, one on which there were six absent, and one on which there were seven absent.<\/p><p>That is 50% of our staff.  We had between one and three substitutes, two of whom were not even qualified.<\/p><p> In my professional opinion, if the current model of special educational needs, SEN, provision is not reviewed with particular emphasis on the role of the special school within the system, this will not succeed.  It cannot be sustained.  We cannot sustain what we are doing in St. Anne's Special School.  What must be addressed as a matter of urgency?  If inclusion does not work, and I would be a supporter of it in spite of being a principal of a special school, then a definition as to what a special school must be has to be described.  It has to be described in conjunction with the relevant people who are in a position to do that.  We must be resourced appropriately within that description.  There is a move away from moderate general learning disabilities or assessments of severe or profound general learning disabilities to more of a needs assessment.  If that is the case, then the school has to be resourced appropriately according to those needs.  I am not sure how that will be done.  The staffing ratio will have to be increased if there is a role for special schools in the future.  Class sizes will have to be reduced.  Behaviours that challenge must be investigated.<\/p><p> Interestingly enough, continuing professional development, CPD, which is the model that is put forward, rather than initial teacher training, is not compulsory, but we have 60 staff, including nurses, who have to have management of actual or potential aggression, MAPA, training and training in person moving and handling.  That is very expensive and it is unsustainable.  On teacher training involving SEN, we get many teachers interested in placement in our school and it is a really positive experience.  However, we still find it difficult to attract teachers.  They are not flooding to our doors because we have a reputation of being the challenging school.<\/p><p> Nursing cover has already been mentioned.  At the moment, we are lucky.  We have two nurses on site, but that depends very much on the vagaries of our patron body.  We had three nurses with 50% fewer pupils eight years ago.  We now have two nurses.  On children with complex needs, there has to be some acknowledgement that, within the special schools system, there are children for whom, for whatever reason, whether medical or mental health issues, the school may not be suitable.  There is a distinct need to look at some sort of alternative provision for these children.<\/p><p> I would like to see a common approach to resourcing.  We in special schools throughout the country get frustrated when we meet, because depending on where a school is located in the country, one might be able to get more staffing and resources.  That is very frustrating.  Health and education need to negotiate and work together, particularly on the role of the therapists who support our schools.  The therapists see themselves as consultants, and the role of the teacher in that is very much compromised because the teacher ends up doing the assessments, the graphs and the charts, and these are assessed off site.  It is not a good model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Pauline Dempsey","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Dempsey.

I want to introduce my colleague, Ms Madeline Hickey, who is the director of the special education support service, SESS, which is one of the three support services currently transitioning to the NCSE.  They have transferred over from the Department since March, so we are having a very interesting time trying to develop a new support structure.  I assure the committee that we wish to be as helpful as we possibly can to assist it with its work in examining the adequacy of training and supports available to providers of special needs education.  Support for special education is, as I think we all know, a key Government priority.  Some &euro;1.7 billion, which is over 17% of the total Department of Education and Skills budget, is spent on supporting special education.<\/p> <p>  All students with special educational needs are taught primarily by the class or subject teachers.  This additional funding provides for 13,000 additional teachers to be allocated specifically to give extra support to students with additional learning and special needs.  That is in mainstream schools.  There are reduced pupil-teacher ratios in special schools.  There is one special education teacher for every five class or subject teachers.  The funding also provides for 13,000 special needs assistant posts, assistive technology, specialist equipment, special school transport arrangements and so on.<\/p> <p>  I know that the committee has already seen the written submission, so the purpose of my opening statement is to focus on teacher education, because research is clear that the quality of teachers and their teaching are the most important factors in determining student outcomes.  This is especially important for students with special educational needs.<\/p> <p>  One of the strengths of the education system at the moment is that all teachers are required to be fully qualified and registered with the Teaching Council.  However, initial teacher education on its own can be insufficient to prepare newly qualified teachers properly for some students with more complex needs.  These students require qualified teachers who are trained and equipped with the additional knowledge and skills necessary to meet their specific educational and care needs.  The skills learned through initial teacher education and more generalised professional development need to be further refined and adapted to meet diverse and sometimes very complex needs.<\/p> <p>  It is for these reasons that the Department of Education and Skills established the SESS in 2003 and the national behaviour support service, NBSS, in 2006 to complement the work of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, which was established in 1999.  Last year, the SESS provided in excess of 20,000 training days to more than 18,000 teachers.  However, through our research and consultation, we are aware that many principals and teachers still do not feel equipped and confident to teach some students with more complex needs.<\/p> <p>  There have been good recent developments aimed at improving the knowledge, skills and competencies of teachers in the area.  These developments include the Teaching Council&rsquo;s framework for continuing development, with inclusion as a core learning area.  We think this is a very good move because we believe that additional learning for teachers should be mandatory in this area of special education.  The inclusion of the study of special education as a compulsory module in initial teacher education was very good.  The decision to establish one NCSE support service, incorporating the SESS, NBSS and the Visiting Teacher Service, will reduce fragmentation and allow us to put a more coherent support structure in place which can support teachers and children.<\/p> <p>  The issue of training and supports is much wider than teacher education.  Students can benefit when all staff in schools and people with whom they interact have been trained in whole-school approaches to inclusion.  For example, when the NCSE was preparing our policy advice to the Minister on the education of students with autism, the need for autism awareness training for bus drivers and escorts was repeatedly raised, because inadvertent actions on the bus to or from school can trigger anxiety and behaviour issues.<\/p> <p>  We are currently carrying out a review of the special needs assistant, SNA, scheme.  This is a very significant support scheme which costs &euro;428 million, but it enables SNAs to meet the care needs of 30,000 students.  The need to improve the effectiveness of these posts with the provision of general and bespoke training for SNAs has been raised as an issue of concern by many consulted, including school management, parents and SNAs themselves.<\/p> <p>  These are just some of the gaps in the current system.  The focus of my presentation has been on the need to improve teacher education, but I am happy to answer any questions committee members may have on my much more extensive submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Griffin and ask Professor &Aacute;ine Hyland to give her presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#H00400","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498575600,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for inviting me.  I am honoured and pleased to be here at this stage to add my voice to the voices of my colleagues here.  I am here in a personal capacity.  I have been in education for a very long time.  I was a civil servant in the Department of Education 56 years ago.  I had to retire because of the marriage ban, but since then I have been a teacher, a teacher trainer, a university professor and, above all else, I am a mother, and I am a grandmother of a boy with autism, which puts me very much in sympathy with what I have heard here today.  I am very impressed by what Ms Noreen Duggan has to say, because much of it is what I have in my own submission and also what I believe.  I am utterly convinced of the importance of an inclusive school.  My grandson, who is now 12, has been lucky.  He has been in St. Clare's primary school in Harold's Cross, where Ms Maria Spring runs a wonderful school, but unfortunately he is hitting exactly the same problem as these parents here and the parents with whom other witnesses work.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the report of the Oireachtas joint committee on the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill, which I read before I came in, especially its recommendation that the NCSE be given the statutory power to compel schools to establish special classes for children with autism or other disabilities where such classes are required.<\/p><p>As the recommendation has already been made, it might be repeated as it is very helpful.<\/p><p> I note in the report that the Department of Education and Skills denies there is a chronic shortage of specialised school places for children with autism and, in fairness, I recognise the considerable advance that has been made in this and other special needs areas, particularly at primary level.  It is a really major issue at post-primary level.  Some members may have seen the campaign from the area in which my grandson lives, as we spoke about campaigns, and my daughter and her husband are spearheading it.  We do not apologise for it.  In Dublin 2, Dublin 4, Dublin 6, Dublin 6W and Dublin 8, or the entirety of the southern Dublin city region, there are no special classes at all at post-primary level.  There are nine at primary level, going on the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, website, but none at post-primary level.  The solution the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, might formulate for some of those children would be home tuition.  It is a disastrous idea and not a solution.<\/p><p> This is a very urgent matter and, ironically, it arises because we have been relatively successful at primary school level.  I was a member of the special education review committee in 1993, as was my colleague, Dr. Mehigan, and I was also chair of the educational disadvantage committee.  I really welcome what I have heard here.  I do not like to see DEIS and special needs education separated.  I am pleased with the new assistant secretary, Mr. Dalton Tattan, and I hoped he would be here today.  At least he has an overview and is the assistant secretary with responsibility for both areas.  It is a very positive development.  There are a number of other positive developments but of course they are slow and we need them now.  I will not sing the song of the campaign but the words are \"two, four, six, eight, ASD kids just can't wait\".<\/p><p> I will not speak about teacher training as we have had much good input in that regard.  I spent most of my more recent years, until I retired, in teacher training.  There are changes and I would be the first to put my hands up and say that in the past we gave no training to our young teachers, especially our post-primary teachers, on including children with special needs in mainstream classes.  That is changing thanks to the Teaching Council and the two-year programme for all teachers.  There is a compulsory element to the training that will at least provide some awareness of the approach they should take in including children with special needs and those from a variety of different backgrounds in mainstream classes.<\/p><p> I am not looking at educational disadvantage separately but as a sort of overall continuum, and there is a separate heading in the submission.  I am very aware of the improvements.  When I was leaving the Department of Education 52 years ago to get married, we had just finished a report pointing out that more than 50% of 14 year olds had dropped out of school.  That is more than half, so things have come on dramatically, as I would be first to recognise.  However, we want a really good and inclusive system for every child.  We do not want 3,500 children leaving school without a qualification, which is the currently the case.<\/p><p> I agree with Ms Duggan that the focus should be on the pupil rather than the school.  I will not bore the committee with a report I brought with me that is from 1965 and indicates a need for special assistance for needy pupils.  This was a pupil-centred approach rather than just a school-centred approach, although of course the school needs support.  There should be a continuum rather than a big bang or stop.  I chaired the educational disadvantage committee that reported 12 years and we were abolished very quickly.  I will come to that momentarily.  We would have made the point that at least half the children from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds are not in what are now called DEIS schools.  They are in other schools and they need support.  Currently, it is either a \"Yes\" or \"No\" and a pupil is either in or out.  The school is in DEIS band 1 or 2.  That will change a little.<\/p><p> There is a need for a whole-school and whole community approach, and the focus on the child and family has been highlighted so much.  We highlighted that very much in the report of the educational disadvantage committee.  We recommended a rights-based approach to equality and inclusion of diversity - we used the term a lot - as well as integration of strategies, structures and systems.  We recommended coherence overall of provision, highlighting the importance of interdepartmental and interagency links, with a view to ensuring greater cohesion.  We pointed out that half the children who require additional support were never in what are now called DEIS schools.  We are all saying that things have of course improved and the new literacy and numeracy strategy has led to improved outcomes for all our pupils, including those in DEIS schools, but there is still a gap, which is a big challenge.  We also recognise the increase of the year in teacher training will be helpful.  We must try to ensure there is full inclusivity in all our schools, and we have a much more diverse school population than we used to have.  The diversity is across social, cultural, ethnic and linguistic lines, along with children with disabilities and various special needs.<\/p><p> I query the transfer of responsibility for the school completion programme, the home, school, community liaison scheme and the National Educational Welfare Board to Tusla in 2014.  I was concerned about it and put my name forward, whether wisely or unwisely, to go on the Tusla board.  I was appointed to the board earlier this year.  I am concerned that the focus of Tusla is more on social care and there is almost no one on the board with an educational background as such.  I would still prefer if the school completion programme and the home, school, community liaison scheme had stayed with the Department of Education and Skills, but perhaps some members understand the process better.  There is further fragmentation, as we said there would be 12 years ago, and we must reduce that fragmentation in the delivery of services.  Sometimes when this happens, one wonders about coherence or the reasons behind it.  There may have been good reasons.  I am on the board now and, whether wisely or unwisely, I am taking some responsibility for it.<\/p><p> As I mentioned earlier I am disappointed the educational disadvantage committee was not replaced in 2005 after we reported.  It was a fairly radical and critical report but at least it existed as part of the Education Act 1998.  In 2012, that section of the Act was deleted.  I do not know why that happened but some of the witnesses or members may know.  It was great to have an educational disadvantage committee.  We had people from the formal system and the non-formal system.  I brought in part of the report but I will not waste the committee's time reading it.  Dr. Ann Louise Gilligan died only last week and she made a huge contribution.  As my colleague said, there are some young people who for various reasons will not fit into the school system.  That is recognised in the international literature and there must be other options available.<\/p><p> I express my concern about the ongoing high level of suspensions and expulsions, especially of young boys aged 12 to 16.  A parliamentary question was recently replied to by the Minister, Deputy Zappone, who now has responsibility for the area, and it indicated there were 13,000 suspensions last year.  It is a huge number.  Every time a young person is suspended for three, four or five days - it is usually a minimum of three days - the continuity of education is finished.  Those students will lose all standing in most cases when that happens and why would they bother after that?  There were 145 expulsions, which is a small number, but there is a large number of especially behaviourally challenged children, especially boys, in that age group who are on a limited or reduced school day, or worse again, in receipt of home tuition.<\/p><p>I have very grave concerns about home tuition.  While the NCSE has asked to have authority to place a child and the NEWB has no authority, it appears that no one has authority to ensure a child who is excluded from mainstream schooling has a school place as opposed to getting some kind of tuition.  I feel passionate and have done for many years on these issues.  While I recognise that there have been improvements, I am not going to give up until I am down under.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Professor &Aacute;ine Hyland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Hyland for that.

The postgraduate diploma courses in special education offered by the colleges of education as per circulars are of high quality and in demand.  These courses are supported by the Department of Education and Skills for teachers in special education posts.  In the context of a policy of inclusion, all teachers should have the opportunity to benefit from postgraduate courses in special education which are State funded and supported.<\/p> <p>  The special education support service, SESS, established and funded by the Department of Education and Skills has provided professional development opportunities to teachers.  The SESS is currently staffed by teachers on secondment.  The recently established inclusion support service within the National Council for Special Education will include the SESS and the visiting teacher service for children with hearing or visual impairment.  It is essential that experienced teachers continue to be recruited as part of the inclusion support service.  Therefore, the terms and conditions of future employees of the inclusion support service must be attractive to experienced teachers with specialist knowledge in special education.<\/p> <p>  In addition to courses in special education, tailored professional support and advice should be available to schools where they have identified particular needs within their own community.  The provision of therapy related services, such as speech therapy, emotional counselling and mental health support, is currently inadequate and causing a lot of frustration for both teachers and pupils.  Primary schools do not have access at present to behaviour support even though this is an area where primary schools need increasing support.  Having access to professional development and support is essential to teacher well-being as the complexity of needs in classrooms grows.  A sabbatical leave scheme for teachers, as promised in DEIS, must be acted on.  While local projects supported by philanthropic funding enabled disadvantaged schools to enhance educational provision to the school community, reliance on philanthropic funding is not sustainable long term.  The Department of Education and Skills must take responsibility for all funding of DEIS support programmes.<\/p> <p>  Regular professional development has been lacking in recent years for the home-school community liaison programme, the school completion programme and Early Start and needs to be restored.  Early intervention is crucial for both children with special educational needs and children at risk of social and educational disadvantage.  Early Start is a high-quality, intensive, early intervention educational programme for children most at risk of educational disadvantage and it should be expanded to all DEIS band 1 schools.  We also need more support for Traveller pupils.  The loss of the visiting teacher service for Travellers has left a lacuna in the system.  The Educational Welfare Service should be given additional resources to support Traveller families and schools with a high concentration of Traveller families should have additional home-school community liaison teachers.  Support for Traveller pupils should also be more explicit in the new allocation model for special education posts.<\/p> <p>  I turn finally to class size.  Almost all primary school classrooms now include children with special education needs.  It is unacceptable that we still have primary classes with more than 30 pupils, including children with special educational needs.  Smaller class sizes are essential to support inclusion.  The pupil-teacher ratio in special schools and classes must be revisited in the context that they now include pupils with far more complex needs than was envisaged in 1993.  DEIS band 1 schools have a more favourable teacher-pupil ratio than non-DEIS schools but DEIS band 2 schools do not.  It is the view of the INTO that the pupil-teacher ratio that applied in Breaking the Cycle of 15:1 in junior classes should continue to apply to the most disadvantaged schools.  The current DEIS band 1 ratio of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes should apply to all other DEIS schools.  This is only bringing us closer to the European norm.  I note that I agree with many of the comments previous speakers today have made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirbhile Nic Craith"},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  It has been incredibly interesting.  There has been a great deal of common ground in the views expressed, namely that there is a need for more teachers, a need for more appropriately trained teachers and the need for proper resources to support our pupils.  The main point in the mission statement of the Department of Education and Skills is on the provision of high quality education to enable all individuals to achieve their full potential and participate fully as members of society.  That is the reason we are all here.  After that, it is about the promotion of equality and inclusion.

Dr. Nic Craith referred to the programmes non-DEIS schools are losing out on to reduce their pupil-teacher ratios.

The focus for me in this area is always DEIS and disadvantage.  Many of the contributions today focused on special education but I note that there are many similarities with these complex needs and what is necessary for a school to address them.  I will focus on disadvantage and teacher training to which Dr. Ryan and Ms Griffin might refer.  I am delighted also to have Professor &Aacute;ine Hyland here today.  If I ever feel I am steering wrong, I go back to her disadvantage report of 12 years ago to remind myself of what it is I am doing.<\/p> <p>  I am very critical in relation to secondary schools which sometimes does not come across well.  I understand that teachers work in very stressful environments.  However, as the parent of a child going through DEIS schools and as a past pupil of DEIS schools, it is hard not to be critical of the way the system works within schools.<\/p><p> Primary schools are a little bit different from secondary schools in DEIS areas because pupils have the same teacher for all subjects, which creates greater continuity and works better.  At second level, school becomes a little chaotic for students, with children from different primary schools bunched together.  The entrance examination for second level schools creates an immediate division as children are categorised into separate groups of those who can and those who cannot learn a language.  At the age of 12 years, students are told they are not capable of learning French or Spanish and are graded into lower and higher classes.  This categorisation, which is based on an entrance examination, is done at a very young age.  Children are separated on that basis on their first day at school.  Do the witnesses wish to comment on how to tackle this issue?  This approach is not taken in all schools but the practice is common in areas of disadvantage. <\/p><p> Teacher training courses include modules on inclusive education.  I have been working with Dr. Fiona O'Reilly to create an approach to teacher education based on the model used for doctors.  Doctors who work in areas of deprivation are trained to understand the social context in which they are working.  This type of social medicine allows them to understand the complex needs of patients in deprived areas which may be slightly different from the needs of patients in more affluent areas.  The model has some valuable features.  Perhaps Dr. Ryan will consider piloting the programme Dr. O'Reilly and I have pulled together to see if it could help in teacher training.  We could offer teachers the type of training provided for doctors.  If teachers are to work in areas of disadvantage where addiction, domestic violence and intergenerational poverty are prominent features, they must be equipped to do so.  Teachers would have to do placements in youth clubs and domestic violence centres and would not go to a DEIS school to be taught how these schools work.  Instead, they would have placements in community groups in order that they learn to understand the individual.  New teachers learn from teachers who have been in the secondary school system for a long time have been a little bit battered by the system.  We could do something a little different in the area of inclusive education.<\/p><p> Students in disadvantaged areas do not have access to the funding and resources needed to obtain an educational psychologist's report.  People living in Cushlawn, west Tallaght and Jobstown cannot afford to have their children tested for dyspraxia, dyslexia, dyscalculia and so forth.  If parents could obtain a diagnosis, they could then access resources to address their child's needs.  How will this be addressed?<\/p><p> We are due to discuss reform of the leaving certificate in a few weeks.  Reform of the leaving certificate will be extremely important in DEIS areas because the leaving certificate does not serve people who attend DEIS schools.  The aspirations, ambitions and determination of teachers in some second level schools are focused only on school completion.  They have not accepted that they are part of the bigger picture in the transition to third level and aspirations have dropped.  DEIS schools have children who are extremely determined and would do well and also children who display extreme behaviour.  Teachers must try to teach children of widely differing ability, which drags children who would normally progress to third level down to a certain standard.  Teachers are telling sixth year pupils who probably would be capable of taking a higher level paper to sit ordinary level examinations because they have not taught the higher level curriculum.  As a result, children believe they are not capable when the issue is the inability of the school to teach the higher paper because the needs in the classroom are so complex and mixed.  This ties into the issue of transforming teacher education to ensure teachers are equipped to work in DEIS schools.<\/p><p> Professor Hyland told me once about the community development style of education in place in either New York or Boston where schools have youth clubs at night and the system is much more integrated into the community.  Perhaps we should look towards that model.<\/p><p> I support the view that we should examine the reason Tusla has been given certain educational briefs and perhaps recommend that these briefs come back into the education system.  Tusla's main priority will never be education.  If it becomes involved in education in areas of deprivation, parents and families will have a negative relationship with the agency or may fear it a little.  If Tusla were to assume control of a certain element of schooling, this negative relationship could tip over into the educational process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#K00700","speaker":"1404","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ruane.

I welcome in particular Dr. Gene Mehigan from the Marino Institute of Education who was one of my senior lecturers many years ago.  It is lovely to see him again.  A range of issues have been highlighted and I have been nodding in agreement with all the contributions because I spent 12 years as a teacher, seven of them as a learning support teacher.  I can honestly say that there are major issues that must be tackled head on.  Investment is needed in education because things have gone radically wrong as a result of the cuts and so on.<\/p> <p>  It does a complete disservice to a child when he or she cannot access speech or occupational therapy.  It is also at odds with the Education Act which states that every child is entitled to a high-quality education.  This is a major issue and one with which we in County Offaly and north Tipperary have been struggling for some time.  While the position in many areas is just as bad as in Laois-Offaly, it is certainly more pronounced in our particular area.  This is unfair on children when we are trying to strive for equality.  Education opens doors for children and gives them opportunities.  It is unacceptable that children who are already disadvantaged are being placed at greater disadvantage through a failure to provide services.  I have raised this issue a number of times because I am passionate about it as a result of personal experience.  I hope the problem will be resolved at some stage<\/p> <p>  Class size is also a major issue for teachers and has a serious impact on pupils.  Newly qualified teachers are being asked to differentiate the content of lesson, but this is not achievable in a class of 35 pupils.  Teachers are told to set objectives that are achievable, attainable, measurable and specific, but how can we set objectives and honestly differentiate to a high standard when so many children are in the classroom and teachers must engage in crowd control?  These issues need to be tackled head on.<\/p> <p>  Professor Hyland referred to the educational disadvantage, on which I introduced a Bill in March last.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#L00300","speaker":"1340"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498575600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Professor &Aacute;ine Hyland"},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I was nodding in agreement when she spoke on this issue.

I will continue to make this call and I commend Professor Hyland on raising the issue.<\/p> <p>  I was particularly interested in the comments on the practice of co-teaching.  Finland is one of the countries where co-teaching occurs.  Is this practice applied anywhere else in Europe?  How would co-teaching tie in with our new resource allocation model?<\/p> <p>  I fully concur with Ms Corr on the issue of capitation.  It is unacceptable that many schools are forced to raise funds and depend on the goodwill of the local community.  This is not good enough.  It is also unacceptable that capitation has been linked to other school outcomes because it is a separate issue and one which the Minister must address.  What would be an acceptable level of capitation in Ms Corr's opinion?<\/p> <p>  To address Ms Dempsey, it is shocking to hear about the high levels of injuries being sustained by teachers as a result of assaults.  Will she elaborate on the prevalence of the problem?  What immediate measures could be introduced to try to curb this unacceptable behaviour?

I taught for 16 years in a DEIS school which had a huge cohort of children with varied special educational needs.  I am completely aware of where resources are lacking.  The issue is, therefore, very close to my heart.  I have a couple of questions which I will not field to anybody in particular.  <\/p> <p>  On the workload of educational welfare officer, is there a maximum number of schools an officer can look after?  Is it a problem?  Can up to 30 or 40 schools be assigned to one officer?  How can an officer possibly track non-attendance if he or she has such a vast number of schools to look after?<\/p> <p>  In respect of reduced and limited timetables which may have been mentioned by Dr. Ryan, are there specific guidelines or structures for schools or is the issue managed on a school-by-school basis?  Is it the case that school A could be doing it one way, while school B down the road might be using a different way altogether?<\/p> <p>  I was interested in the suggestion of co-teaching.  I did some as part of the Droichead scheme about four years ago when a student teacher came and it worked very well.  There were also two SNAs in the room with 18 students.  I thought it was fantastic and it happened to work very well as the student teacher and I happened to work well together.  How are teachers chosen?  It is important to make sure they can work with another teacher.  Even 14 years ago, some teachers did not know how they would cope with an SNA in the room.  How would having a co-teacher and a few SNAs work when it comes to inspection, for example?  How will the experienced teacher be trained to co-teach?<\/p> <p>  I have heard anecdotal evidence that resource teaching hours are sometimes used as a timetable filler to have a teacher work a certain period of hours, rather than choosing the best teacher to do the resource teaching hours.  Is that something that happens and how can the practice be tackled?<\/p> <p>  In respect of students who do not take Irish, there is an issue that presents after the junior certificate examinations.  There are students with special educational needs and those for whom English is not their first language, as well as others who, for various reasons, have an exemption.  At leaving certificate level Irish is taught every day.  In some schools there are more students in a class who are not doing Irish.  A school can end up with 32 to 34 17 year-olds who are exempt from the class.  I do not think there is any guideline for dealing with this issue.  It seems to be about classroom control where the teacher tries to keep the students quiet for 40 minutes.  Could we tap into this resource to do something powerful to help students for whom English is not their first language or who have special educational needs?  A lot of the time there are no SNAs assigned to that group.<\/p> <p>  I am curious about the numbers at level 2 and the provision of proper training and how the strike affected the position.  Just before the strike started, I sat the level 2 examination in English and at that stage there were no guidelines for it.  When I asked the question at the end of the day, I was only taught to level 3.  I do not know what has happened since.<\/p> <p>  On the applied leaving certificate programme, I believe that for a lot of children with special educational needs, it is about getting them through the junior certificate examinations and then they opt to take the applied leaving certificate programme.  Does it serve them well?  The programme has been in place a long time without being reviewed.  If one takes the level 2 or level 1 programme, as suggested, can one progress to the applied leaving certificate programme or will it stop a student from progressing beyond third year?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#M00100","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for their presence.  I have found all of the contributions very informative but also quite disturbing, particularly those of the two principals.  Some of the problems they highlighted are a sad indictment of the education sector, specifically those who have decisions to make and are tasked with looking after the education of children.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Anne Ryan talked about the co-teaching model.  One problem I have is that I constantly hear about young teachers who receive training and then jump on an aeroplane to Dubai or wherever else.  It must be very frustrating for Dr. Ryan and her colleagues, as well as for society, that we spend so much on the education of teachers only for them to move away.  Why is that the case?  What can we do to stem that awful waste of resources?<\/p> <p>  Ms Breda Corr talked about capitation grants and the need for them to be increased.  She also talked about the lack of planning for pupils with special needs, particularly at second level.  My heart goes out to the parents in the Visitors Gallery.  I can only imagine how stressful it must be in trying to find a school that will take one's child to give him or her the best chance in life.  It is very depressing and the matter needs to be addressed urgently.<\/p> <p>  The contributions of Ms Duggan and Ms Dempsey were very striking.  Ms Dempsey talked about the lack of subject teachers and the many days on which she had no teachers.  Do we need to incentivise teachers to move into that area?

It is one that definitely needs attention.  <\/p> <p>  I will finish by putting Dr. &Aacute;ine Hyland completely on the spot because of her experience across a wide range of sectors.

I will add a few comments.  The delegates can certainly take the opportunity to answer, but, if they wish, they may also take some time to reflect and look for more information and provide us with a written answer at a future stage.  The clerk and I will ensure any follow-up information is circulated to committee members.  I thank everybody for the incredible debate we have had.<\/p> <p>  My first comment is to Dr. Anne Ryan.  On the hugely iimportant issue of teacher training in Marino, if there is over-subscription, is there a selection process and, if so, what criteria are used?  How long is the assessment period for each student teacher?  I think Dr. Ryan mentioned that there was a two-week placement for student teachers.  Is that period sufficient?  I know from teaching and teaching practice that two weeks are really not enough to gauge all of the challenges within the system.<\/p> <p>  In respect of students who complete courses covering both mainstream and special education, is there a sense that they benefit more from focusing on both together rather than working in just one?  It is important to recognise the challenge involved in promoting inclusive education.  Does Dr. Ryan see something in that regard?<\/p> <p>  Does Ms Corr from NABMESE have proposals for more recognised training programmes at level 7 for SNAs who play an important role?  Does she have a view on the opening up of courses available to teachers to accommodate SNAs and other staff?<\/p><p>We are talking about whole-staff initiatives.  It is important that we recognise the role that all staff play in the success of schools and that includes caretakers, secretaries and SNAs.  One must ensure that they are kept in the loop.<\/p><p> As Ms Dempsey mentioned, training in crisis intervention must be given.  We must consider providing the appropriate funding for such an initiative.  It should be possible to link training to SOLAS or the other training and apprenticeship programmes.  Unfortunately, money is always an issue. <\/p><p> Dr. Nic Craith mentioned regional support services.  Who is responsible for providing support services?  I am interested in hearing the thoughts of the witnesses on the matter and on the proposal to provide in-school models of mental health support.  Mental health services are very important.  Who would manage the scheme?  How would it be funded?  Would the service be provided on a full-time or part-time basis?<\/p><p> In 2005, professional development support was provided in the DEIS plan.  Can the witnesses recommend ways to improve professional development?  Can the scheme be improved?<\/p><p> I thank Ms Duggan and Ms Dempsey for outlining the realities of dealing with students and teachers.  They highlighted the difficult challenges experienced by many teachers.  Without a shadow of a doubt, they have identified the need for extra nursing and clinical supports and additional resources in order to ensure that children and, indeed, staff embrace the idea of inclusion.  Scoil Na Naomh Uilig is inclusive but St. Anne's school is not inclusive.  The witnesses outlined in stark detail the challenging behaviours that teachers encounter at the latter school.  I know because I visited the school recently.  On that occasion, I had a long conversation with the teachers about the situation, including the need for extra supports to be provided to them.<\/p><p> It is wonderful that junior cycle level 1 has been introduced at St. Anne's.  We should consider introducing junior cycle level 1 in mainstream schools as opposed to just special school.  Such an initiative would encourage inclusivity.  It would also afford an opportunity for students with special needs who have gone to a mainstream primary school to continue their education in a post-primary setting.<\/p><p> People have called for funding to be increased to fund the adaptation of school buildings in order that children with special needs can be accommodated.  Should we consider more specialised centres or schools rather than altering classrooms?  Adapting school accommodation would not be the most cost-effective way to do things.<\/p><p> The NCSE has made recommendations and a number of them have yet to be adopted.  Can Ms Griffin tell us which recommendation or recommendations need to be addressed as a matter of urgency?  She said that early contact with the home has proven beneficial and I ask her to elaborate.  I have discussed the matter with parents and I have a brother with special needs.  As a result, I sometimes feel there is not enough societal early intervention by the relevant services and agencies.  Early intervention is hugely important.<\/p><p> The review of the SNA scheme was mentioned.  When will it be concluded?  I am sure the committee would like to get a copy of the review and examine its findings.<\/p><p> Professor Hyland was a visionary lecturer in Carysfort College.  It is obvious that she has not lost her passion for education.  I want to discuss how we can change and provide support to young people at risk for whatever reason, be it behavioural or people with special needs who are at risk of not getting the best possible education.  I am interested in the final report of the educational disadvantage committee that she chaired.  How many of the recommendations have been implemented?  Will she please comment on the recommendations that have not been implemented?  I suggest that she do so in writing.  Interestingly, Dr. Hyland noted the number of children, particularly boys, that have been expelled because their schools did not have adequate resources.  I ask Dr. Hyland to comment on the matter.<\/p><p> We could spend all night debating these matters but I shall return to the panel.  I ask witnesses to indicate their wish to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#M00300","speaker":"1257","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498575600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I shall respond to the questions asked by Deputies Nolan and Catherine Martin.  Co-teaching is an interesting idea.  Deputy Catherine Martin said that for many years the classroom has been the domain of the class teacher and some teachers would have found the arrival of an SNA challenging.  That situation has changed somewhat with the advent of SNAs, resource teachers and  co-operative parents in the classrooms.<\/p> <p>  In response to the question of training, we have thought about how best to approach the matter.  One of the blockages is the notion of two teachers standing up and becoming a double act like Mutt and Jeff.  That is not what we envisioned originally.  We want a gradual release of responsibility to selected teachers in the same school.  One might have different levels of teachers.  For example, one might teach while the other observes or assists.  One could have parallel teaching where the teachers divide the class in two.  One could have alternative teaching, which is like station teaching but with different models of teaching.  Ultimately, one would work towards two teachers co-teaching in the classroom.<\/p> <p>  The question on co-teaching is relevant to us because we have thought about the challenges.  Let us say there are two teachers in the same school and one is a special teacher while the other is a classroom teacher.  We envisage that our own students, during their initial pre-service teacher education period, would work on the scenario.  That is the model that we envisage for such teacher training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#N00150","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gene Mehigan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498575600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Co-teaching is a model of choice.  It is the choice of the teachers involved to engage in the scheme.  Neither the principal nor anyone else imposes the model.  We visited a school in Finland and saw how teachers opted to join the scheme.  The special education teachers that we saw in Finland had worked in special education settings but found the system did not work for them and, more importantly, did not work for the children.  As a result, they decided to do something about the problem and a scheme was developed from the ground upwards.  We envisage a scheme that is run on an invitation only basis or, to put it simply, people who envisage the system working for them would be invited to participate.  Personality, teaching style, curriculum, subject and a variety of different variables would be at work.<br\/><br\/>As Dr. Mehigan mentioned, training would involve an introduction to a variety of different models.  I agree with him that there are many ways to co-teach.  We are familiar with at least six established models.  I recently spoke about this topic at the conference on special education for teachers that took place in Marino, Dublin.  A very interested principal teacher seated in the audience asked the very same question but called for training.  We do not want <i>ad hoc <\/i>training but a concerted approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne Ryan"},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Ryan for her comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#N00300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498575600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I shall answer the questions that were addressed to me.  I shall also answer the question on educational psychological reports even though it was not specifically addressed to me.  In terms of the cost, diagnosis and difference in provision, the National Educational Psychological Service should have more staff in order to ensure there is a similar provision everywhere and perhaps additional provision elsewhere.  We definitely need more psychologists.<\/p><p>The second question was no addressed to me specifically.  Deputy Nolan talked about access to therapies.  We suggested in our submission that the therapies would be provided on a school cluster basis.  Unfortunately, I am not so sure there are enough therapists of that nature in the country and there is probably a little training needs to be done.<\/p><p> Capitation was addressed by both.  It is hard for me to suggest a limit but there are a couple of points that I would make.  The capitation was &euro;100 more per pupil when I started in this job in 2009 and that is a big difference.  Say it was approximately &euro;900.  Roughly, it is within that range.  I mentioned a training fund.  The capitation is all right for heat, light etc., but I mentioned the cost of insurance.  We need to encourage schools to get involved in more procurement.  We need to make it easier for them which we are trying to do.<\/p><p> Linking it to school outcomes is very difficult.  I do not know what the acceptable rate would be but it is an exercise that could be done.  We did an exercise a number of years ago on linking it to the numbers.  We undertook a comparison between mainstream and special schools and it was hard to come up with a figure.  However, some examination could be done.  On the previous occasion I was here I mentioned that it might be something that the financial services support unit, when it comes into being, might investigate.  It might be a good idea.  Perhaps it is a job for them in the future because they will have an idea of the costings.<\/p><p> The following was addressed to Ms Pauline Dempsey.  We are very aware of the shocking high level of injuries.  That is a question that I would get on a daily basis.  As for the immediate measures, the Chairman talked about the training.  We are trying to work with the Office of Government Procurement and the schools procurement agency to look at this issue of that map of training which is prevention.  A teacher is trained, for example, in Pauline's school, and if he or she leaves that school then he or she has to train again.  There are significant costs involved.  We are looking at doing that in a different way.  I am not sure how that can be addressed, but we are looking at it and the cost of insurance.<\/p><p> There are a lot of issues with regard to the capitation.  Suffice it to say the reduction of &euro;100 in that time makes a big difference.<\/p><p> An issue Deputy Catherine Martin addressed was the guidelines for the short school day.  Unfortunately, there are no guidelines.  We got legal advice on that.  Really, it is very sticky because it is technically a suspension.  Much of the time they do it with the agreement of the parents and they will not take a section 29 appeal in that regard.  There is a little bit of that.  I do not like that shortened school day.  Often it is the only thing - related, usually, to behaviour - and there is no choice.<\/p><p> On the level 2 training, the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, NABMSE, as an organisation was involved in the level 2 training and launched it at conference a long time ago.  It is one of the better pieces.  It was a good investment for us, with the NCCA, at the time and a number of people were represented on the level 2 committee.<\/p><p> On the training itself, the strike did us a favour in special schools, I am sorry to say.  I never raised this issue with anyone I knew in the other unions.  In fact, all the teachers in special schools are in the INTO and they were not prevented from doing the training.  We got a year of that training concentration which was marvellous.  It does not happen too often.  We were delighted to be involved.  That is why we pushed the level 2 as well.<\/p><p> The level 2 training is probably prevalent enough in the schools whose staff are in one particular union - I will not mention which union here.  There is some ongoing training.  I am located in the Kildare Education Centre where a lot of the junior certificate training team come and I get regular informal updates.  It is great to have that there.  However, there are some mainstream schools that have the level 2 training in the school.  They just introduce it as another element and it is not called level 2, but I think it is.<\/p><p> The training is very good.  They have these so-called \"critical friends\" days to which people are invited where one looks at the training and can state, \"No, that will not work.\"  They are proactive with the training.<\/p><p> There is something I mentioned earlier that I would like to see.  Some of the schools are trying to do level 2 training but they do not have enough specialist teacher hours, the post-primary teacher hours.  I would like to see something being done with that, even in conjunction with the ETBs.  The Department has not allocated any extra hours for a number of years but we would like to look at that.<\/p><p> Senator Gallagher mentioned the lack of planning at second level.  I mentioned that.  It would be a problem, to be honest with the Senator, in most parts of the country, where there is very little provision for post primary.  I should have looked at the Monaghan matter if I knew the Senator had.  One has all these units - I hate that word \"units\", the definition of which I was asked at one stage here - or classes in primary but one does not have the corresponding number of classes at post primary.  That is difficult.  There needs to be more incentives given to encourage post-primary schools to set up such classes.  As I stated previously, they need a little more than merely being compelled.  There was mention of getting the resources straightaway and getting teachers with experience, not those deployed.  There is a need for incentives and more long-term planning in the Department.<\/p><p> As to more recognised training for special needs assistants, SNAs, there is a recognised training scheme.  There used to be four training schemes that were funded by the Department and recognised through the various third-level colleges.  The only one left, which is not funded by the Department, is in St. Angela's in Sligo and it is oversubscribed.  There is a cost involved.  The schemes need to be reintroduced and there needs to be standard training.  Here I will plug our own training for bus escorts.  Ms Duggan mentioned it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, a former member of this committee, was the junior Minister when we ran a pilot scheme in Galway in 2013.  We had an independent assessment done on that by Dr. Emer Ring in Mary Immaculate College and it was very positive.  We chose Galway because there were different aspects, such as rural schools and the only special school as Gaeilge in the country.  That actually worked well.  We are talking to the Department again.  It is proposed that St. Angela's may run with it this year but we would like to have recognition by the Department.  We are engaging with them on that basis.<\/p><p> That is probably my lot unless anyone has any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Breda Corr","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Corr.

I would like to focus for a moment on success in respect of injuries to staff.  There is a high level of competence in dealing with challenging behaviour.  Sometimes I think we take it to extremes and we deal with it for far too long.  As for the network disability teams, we find that by the time we call them in to look for support, they often do not have suggestions; we have tried everything.  There is a definite need for a behavioural analyst.  We have found that to have worked in the past and it has been very successful.  There need to be more such analysts in the network disability teams because anything a psychologist can tell us we already know and if we are calling a psychologist in, we are facing serious problems.  We also believe in trying to keep as many children as possible in school.  Sometime that costs and sometimes there are injuries.  On occasion, we have reduced the day with a view to increasing it incrementally as behaviours are reduced, if we get that support.<\/p> <p>  It is a big thing but training is not the answer.  We have looked at management of actual and potential aggression, MAPA, and have trained in it.  By the time it gets to the stage we are at, one is talking about restrictive practices.  When one is talking about reasonable force, most staff will back away and say that reasonable force is not a consideration in this.  MAPA is a very grey area.  We as a school go through strategies where one diverts and distracts and does all the nice things but we are not at all comfortable when it comes to restrictive practices and we tend not to do it which is also why there may be injuries.  The network disability teams are crucial in this and they do not seem to have the level of expertise that we require in our school.<\/p> <p>  On the incentive for teachers, I can only look to my own experience.  The reason I became passionate about special education was because I was exposed to it at quite a significant level in my initial teacher training.  I did not realise that such a system existed and I found it wonderful and delightful and it was all I ever wanted to do.  That is what has driven the passion of some of the teachers in our school who chose to go down that road.  I know teachers on placement with us enjoy it.  They have often substituted for us and we had two last year, who are two of the substitutes we listed, but it is not sustainable.  I cannot offer any more suggestions.  <\/p> <p>  The level 1 and level 2 learning programmes have been the most dynamic thing that has hit education.  I cannot say that strongly enough and I was on the level 1 steering committee.  I got the sense it was being considered a special schools programme and I argued quite positively about how it is a post-primary programme and therefore technically, it should be offered by post-primary teachers.  We are in a very fortunate position where we were able to employ post-primary trained teachers even though we are a national school.  They are the ones who offer our junior cycle.  It is very dynamic and in the best-case scenario, they may go out to mainstream post-primary schools with that knowledge and perhaps will manage to effect better inclusion.  It sounds as though I am trying to talk our own school out of a job but I know what high levels of expertise there are.  We have four post-primary trained teachers.  We have a very distinct separation.  Even though we are a national school, we do eight years primary curriculum and five years post-primary.  The post-primary teachers are the ones who offer our level 1 and level 2 learning programmes.  Sadly, on my level 1 steering committee days, there was a suggestion that anyone can teach level 1.  I know for a fact that all good teachers would be able to teach level 1 but I think it is discriminatory at a different level.  It is a post-primary curriculum and should be offered by post-primary trained teachers.  That opens massive floodgates for how special schools are defined.  This is why the definition of what a special school should be is vital.  There are special schools in Ireland today which offer nothing but the primary curriculum and that could go on for 14 years.  That is not acceptable.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#P00100","nonspeaker":"Ms Pauline Dempsey"},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Dr. Nic Craith wishes to come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#P00200","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498575600,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I will respond to a couple of issues that were raised although some others related more to the post-primary educational system and I am not qualified to respond to those.  The transition between primary and post-primary schools is a key area.  It was particularly evident where there are children who do not have a strong tradition of continuing and pursuing education.  There are some excellent projects on the ground but what we need is more co-ordination at national level.  Work is being done in that area at the policy level to support schools with the transition.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the workload of educational welfare officers, schools have experienced a lack of personnel during the recession.  When people retired, left or were on maternity leave, they were not replaced.  That left gaps in the system.  That probably created a workload for other educational welfare officers but it also created a gap from a schools perspective of not having someone in the area.  That also applied to some of the other professional services on which schools rely such as NEPS, where there were no psychologists in an area or whether they were on maternity leave or long-term absence and were not replaced.  That is a system issue that needs to be addressed in respect of how we continue with supports services that are required by schools for their pupils.<\/p> <p>  We have been waiting for some time for guidelines or a revised circular from the Department of Education and Skills on the whole area of the exemption from Irish.  There is need for new up-to-date guidelines which reflect the current educational context in schools.  That is another lacuna in our system that needs to be looked at.  <\/p> <p>  Teacher absences is a great issue.  The system issue is one of how we provide substitute teachers for teacher absences.  The INTO supports the idea of returning to the supply panels approach in which one has a cohort of teachers available for substitute cover and that should also apply to the special schools.  There should be teachers available for the regular substitute cover to fill in for teacher absences.  <\/p> <p>  The inclusion support services, as I called it, has huge potential to be an excellent support service for schools, teachers and pupils.  It is only just emerging.  It has brought together three existing services and there are many issues to be resolved regarding how to capitalise on the advantage those three support services had, how they are brought together, continuing with the support but also having additional expert specialist teachers coming into the support services, particularly in the area of autism where there has been a gap and where teachers require additional support.  There is potential there.  <\/p> <p>  Another issue which must be dealt with at a system level is how to provide what we call the health or therapy related services for schools.  The current system lacks consistency in that it varies depending on which part of the country someone lives in and what they can access.  There have been pilot projects which worked very well, such as a pilot project in Tallaght on a school-based speech and language therapy service.  The difficulty is they are often funded by philanthropic funding that may only be available for a short term but to sustain funding, it needs to come under the wing of the Department of Education and Skills or perhaps the NCSE might have a role in the future provision of the therapy services.  From a schools perspective it is important that they are available when the children need them.  At present, there are huge gaps and inconsistencies in those support services. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Deirbhile Nic Craith"},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Does anyone else wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#P00400","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498575600,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I will work my way through some of the issues raised and will finish with my wish list.  I may then ask Ms Hickey to talk about some of the matters relating to teacher training.<\/p> <p>  Senator Ruane raised the issue of disadvantage.  There is a whole overlap between special needs and disadvantage.  It was one reason for insisting that under the new model, which is allocating 13,000 additional teachers, the social context of the school would be a big determinant part of that because some of the issues are broadly very similar, in particular, the question of a child having a diagnosis or coming from a socio-economically disadvantaged background.  There is a lot of research evidence that teacher expectation and parental expectation of what that child is capable of achieving automatically goes down.  It is a very destructive thing.  We are trying to move away from the whole issue of diagnosis and we also need to do something in respect of disadvantage.  <\/p> <p>  The issue of lack of money and being unable to access a diagnosis was one of the motivations for changing the way that we allocate special education teachers in order that it is not linked to disability because for so many people, it is not simply a matter of funding.<\/p><p>It was driving people who had children who were not developing in line with normal goals and milestones to get a particular diagnosis so they could get additional resources, which was very destructive.  There is now a recognition in the education system of disadvantage with a view to changing how these children are supported.  Boston was mentioned.  I visited a preschool there for children with autism.  It is an integrated preschool.  One of the big benefits was for children who do not have special educational needs and children who came from disadvantaged areas.  Children are incredibly adaptable.  What they found was that for children who were developing typically, their communications skills improved hugely because as normal communication was not working they had to come up with a way of communicating with a child who does not communicate back.  When they were leaving the preschool their communications and interactive skills had developed hugely.  It is hugely beneficial for children who had a disability and children who did not have a disability.<\/p><p> In regard to the workload of education welfare officers, I regret I cannot be helpful in that regard.  In regard to resource teaching hours, members might recall that at a previous meeting we outlined that when we were doing our report in 2013 we found that primary resource teaching hours were being used by principals as timetable fillers, which is not their intended purpose.  One person could be really good but another might not have any idea of a child's needs, especially at post-primary level.  It is a really difficult area.  <\/p><p> In regard to junior certificate level 1 and level 2, it is very important that these programmes would be rolled out in mainstream post-primary schools because this benefits all children.  It is fantastic development.  In regard to students not doing Irish, I am concerned that so many children are being relieved of the task of learning Irish or, more important, deprived of the opportunity of learning Irish.  The new model provides huge opportunities for schools to be more innovative in how they use hours to support children who might have reduced timetables for various reasons and not simply because they are not doing Irish.<\/p><p> In regard to access to speech and language therapy, and occupational therapy, this is a major issue.  I have noted with interest that the national behaviour support service, which currently only operates at post-primary level, has contracted in speech and language therapists and occupational therapists because it considers it so fundamental to improving the educational outcomes for students who have behavioural issues in post-primary.  I am looking forward to learning more about it as a model.<\/p><p> In regard to co-teaching and how it works, co-teaching is part of the programme that is now available for continuing professional development, CPD.  CPD is available through dedicated CPD courses, online e-learning and in-school support.  Co-teaching will form part of the supports to schools around the roll-out of the new teacher model.  We believe it is a big part of the solution.  Everybody must be aware that teachers need to buy into it.  People cannot be forced to work together.  If we try to do that it could backfire.  Teachers generally do buy in to initiatives that are working.<\/p><p> In regard to what are the most important recommendations that have not been implemented, the Department has been incredibly open and embracing of the recommendations we have made thus far in regard to roll-out of the new model.  That will be in place from next year.  In regard to the early intervention scheme that embraces preschool children, we identified a huge gap in the system in that children who had disabilities were being excluded from the ECCE schemes and mainstream preschools.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs took that on board and has now developed an access and inclusion model.  We also made a recommendation on the schools admission scheme will I understand will be discussed tomorrow by the committee.  It is important that schools are not allowed to put up soft barriers that prevent children accessing a special class placement or a mainstream class.  Schools exist to provide an education for all children in their communities.  We are very strong on that point and we are very grateful that the Department has taken on the admissions to school issue.   <\/p><p> In terms of the priorities going forward, mindful that eaten bread is soon forgotten, the main issue is teacher education because the quality of teaching is important, especially around the area of challenging behaviour.  We have made a recommendation that in every school there should be one teacher who is skilled in the area of the management of challenging behaviour but all teachers need additional CPD around child behaviour.  In regard to the availability of clinical supports, children are only children once and if they need speech and language therapy, occupational therapy or physiotherapy they should not be left waiting for it.  We believe that the expansion of NEPS is very important.  There are a small number of children who have life threatening and complex needs who ten or 15 years ago would never have attended school.  In fact, they would not have survived.  We need to look at what are the right supports for these children in special schools.  I am speaking in this regard about children who have had tracheotomies and other life-threatening conditions.  We need to identify the rights supports to ensure their safety within the school environment.  That is crucial.  <\/p><p> In our 2013 paper we made a recommendation around the need for a new model of special school.  Special schools are changing.  They are now catering for children who have much more complex needs and equally children who are capable of doing the junior certificate and leaving examinations and therefore they need different rules and so on in that regard.  We recommended in our challenging behaviour policy advice that for the tiny number of children whose behaviour is such that they need very intensive supports, we need to develop a model that supports them in the short term.  I could go on forever but I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498575600,"counter":186,"content":"<p>In regard to co-teaching, training is available to teachers.  There is an online course, whole-staff training and training in education centres.  The new teacher allocation model provides us with a great opportunity to look at the different models of support for schools and to work with teachers to ensure provision of a model that suits each child's needs, be that in-class support, small group support or one-to-one support.  There are two circulars available in relation to the new model, Circular 13\/17 and Circular 14\/17.  There are guidelines accompanying those circulars and there will be dedicated CPD for principals and staff in schools around the implementation of the new model and supporting children in schools.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the curriculum, I am encouraged by the developments around the level 1 and level 2 learning programmes and post-primary level and also the developments around the new primary curriculum.  For the first time we now have dedicated CPD around the new primary curriculum for the special schools.  I am pleased about that development.<\/p> <p>  On the question of whether a student at post-primary level doing level 1 can progress to LCA, that depends on the student and whether LCA is the appropriate programme for him or her.  There is no reason he or she could not do so but, as I said, it would depend on whether the programme is appropriate.<\/p><p>With regard to CPD, there is very comprehensive collaboration between all of the services on the level 2 learning programmes, the junior cycle for schools programme, the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, the Special Education Support Service, SESS, the National Behaviour Support Service, NBSS, and the new support service.  I think it was mentioned that last year we provided more than 20,000 training days for teachers and in-school support to more than 1,200 schools.

We did the co-teaching module and use it a lot in schools.  It works very well.<\/p> <p>  There are a few small issues.  With regard to the initial teacher training, we have had people in observing in the special classes.  It is worthwhile.  However, we had a big argument about it last week.  We have young teachers who do not have experience in the classroom, yet at times they are actually put into a special class when they come into a school even if they have only had the two weeks' training.  They get involved with the teacher and all the rest, but it is a huge job.  I believe it is a disservice to any young teacher to put them straight into a special class.  Not only do they have to manage the children, but they also have to manage SNA staff.  It can be very difficult and daunting for young teachers.  However, there are young teachers who have done it and have done it so well.<\/p> <p>  We had a student teacher whose mother I knew well in our school.  She was in and was very successful in her work.  She was doing the learning support plus observation.  However, she was in one of our classes and she said to her mother that she would hate to be doing teaching practice in our school because of the challenging behaviour that she experienced in mainstream classes, because she would definitely fail her teaching practice.  That is what she observed.<\/p> <p>  As we were talking about the shortened day, I want to mention two children we have on a shortened day in our school at present.  One child joined our school in October from another school because relationships had broken down completely with that school.  The child has huge emotional behaviour issues.  None of us has identified exactly where he is coming from but his parents are very co-operative and have worked very closely with us.  When the honeymoon period ended, all hell broke loose.  He has assaulted many members of staff and other children have been injured as well as a result of his actions.  The child is totally caught up within himself and he is exhausted after one of these episodes.<\/p> <p>  We have to call in his parents when this happens.  His father is doing night duty and his mother is a full-time student.  Often, it involves a wait of an hour and a half.  The child can do a lot of damage in that time.  We tried to get him into a space in which he could either not hurt himself or others in that period.  We then asked the father to stay with him in school because we thought it was very important that the child stay in school.  The father has been trying his best, but when this happened two days in a row, he said that he could not continue to do it because he needed to get his sleep.  We do not have the extra facilities.  The child has not yet been assessed by a psychologist.  We have no facilities for this child, so we are left with a shortened day.  His mother and father now bring him to school in the morning and collect him one hour later.  That is really sad, but we cannot answer the problem.  I have been injured by him and so have many of the staff.  That is one example.<\/p> <p>  Another example is two little children who joined our school last May.  The are lovely children, both almost seven years of age.  They immigrated to Ireland and do not have a word of English.  They have never been in a school because in their country they do not start school until they are seven years old.  In our school, it is not appropriate to put them into junior infants.  Therefore, they joined a senior infants class with 29 children in it already.  The little girl has been fabulous and has settled in just grand.  She is able for it.  They are twins.  The little boy is totally not able for it.  He has no English and we do not have Slovakian.  We have tried to get some of his peers to translate for us.  The other child finds it all too much.  He is on a reduced day because he is not able for our classroom experience.  We have one English as an additional language, EAL, teacher but we have probably 130 children with English as their second language.  We cannot ignore those children.  That is the reality.  On the ground, we need more personnel and resources to answer those needs.  I would love to have both of those children in school for a full day.  However, that is just the reality.<\/p> <p>  We have great buy-in and our teachers work very hard to get things going and get things right.  We do not put children on a shortened day lightly, but sometimes it is the only answer.  That is a really emotional response, but I would not be truthful to the situation if I was not relating it.  We have had children on reduced days and, bit by bit, the day has increased until they are doing a full day.  We have had children in mainstream who totally did not cope.  Eventually, we got a diagnosis for them and they moved into a special class.  Now, at fifth or sixth class level, they are back in mainstream full-time, with the support of the special needs unit.  It is so good when it works well, but we do need the resources.  That is the big thing.  Safety for children and for staff is a huge issue for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Noreen Duggan"},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Duggan.

I was asked what I would do if I was the Minister.  The first thing to remember is that the Minister and the Department have access to an enormous amount of money.  Money is a great leverager.  We know that it leverages change.  Over the years, the various budgets the Department has had has given it much more power and authority to achieve change if it needs to.  It is not acceptable that there are not special classes or special supports for children who receive very good support at primary level but, when they turn 12 or 13, have nowhere to go.  The Department simply has to take action on that.  That would be my number one priority at present.  It is more than 100 years ago since places were available in schools for children who did not have difficulties.  In fact, they would be prosecuted for not going to school.  Here, we have children who want to go to school but cannot go.  I feel very strongly about that issue.  I am talking about 26 second level schools in Dublin 2, Dublin 4, Dublin 6, Dublin 6W and Dublin 8, where not a single one of them will agree to start a special class.  I agree with the Chairman that it should be voluntary, there should be a lot of support for them and we should not be forcing them.  However, if it comes to it, I am afraid we have to do it.  That is my first point.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the financial side, I make the committee aware that there is &euro;1.5 billion, as was pointed out, for special needs education.  That has been a fantastic development in the past 20 years.  That has all happened within a 20 to 25 year period.  We make a lot of noise about DEIS.  In its totality, including school completion and home-school community liaison, DEIS only has a budget of &euro;125 million.  That is one twelfth of what is available for special needs education.  I am not comparing them, but I am just saying that there is a lot of sound and noise about DEIS as if there is a huge budget going to the 20% of schools it goes to.  It is actually not a huge budget.  It is quite a small amount of money.  The point was made earlier on by a member of the committee that Ireland has a very low proportion of its overall budget going to education.  I am sure that has come up at the committee on a number of occasions.<\/p> <p>  Senator Ruane's point about streaming in DEIS schools has been highlighted by the ESRI.  It has highlighted that it is almost unique to DEIS schools now.  I would simply withdraw money from the schools in the morning if they persist in streaming.  They have had numerous circulars.  Circulars can mean nothing or everything.  If I were the Department, I would make it a condition of the funding that there is no streaming.  Almost none of the non-DEIS schools stream now.  However, we know that many of the DEIS schools are doing it.  Ironically, exactly as the Senator said, they are discouraging students from doing higher level papers in the senior cycle.  There are some DEIS schools in which no STEM subject is being offered at higher level.  That is a huge insult to the pupils and the families in their area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Professor &Aacute;ine Hyland"},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Just to add to that, they make those decisions based on a conversation with the student.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#R00500","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498575600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Not even the parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Professor &Aacute;ine Hyland"},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":193,"content":"<p>If students are coming home after dropping higher level on the day, there is no inclusion of the parents in actually making the decisions on LCA or on certain subjects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2017062700002#R00700","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498575600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>It is totally unacceptable.

It should not matter if one does not have 20% or 40% of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.  If there is X amount of money allocated to each pupil who requires additional support, it goes to the school.  That is the way it is done in other countries.  We are unique and we started with designated schools because there was not enough money to go around but now it has become like one of the ten commandments.  One has to be a DEIS school or not be one but that was never the intention 15 or 20 years ago when it started.<\/p><p> I accept the point about school completion and Ms Duggan made a good point about the limited school day.  Suspensions sometimes occur for those reasons but not 13,000 of them.  Once a pupil is on the roll on 30 September, the school gets the capitation and everything else.  If the pupil is gone by 5 November, the school still gets the grant.  I would check this when a pupil is suspended.  There is a very good inspectorate which checks these things.  The schools with the highest suspension rates are those getting the most money under school completion.  That is a total contradiction.  One gets extra money to help children complete school but then suspends these children.

I thank the members of this committee for the opportunity to speak today and for the members' openness and willingness to engage with the important issue of fossil fuel divestment.  There has been much criticism of the so-called new politics in the current arrangements and, in some ways, rightly so.  Without this new politics, however, I, as an Independent rural opposition Deputy, would not have had the opportunity to present legislation like this today.  This committee has helped facilitate this in a timely manner by ensuring the Bill reached scrutiny stage not too long after the Second Stage debate.<\/p> <p>  I will say a few words about the importance of this Bill and its contents before leaving the more technical aspects to the experts I have with me, who will also be presenting.  I thank Mr. Kingsmill Bond and Tr&oacute;caire for their incredible support and for the work they have put in to raise awareness of fossil fuel divestment and the progression of this Bill through the different stages.  As the committee will be aware from the explanatory memorandum, the Bill seeks to compel the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to divest its assets from fossil fuel companies over a period of five years.<\/p> <p>  I want to make clear that this Bill has not been brought forward to single out or castigate the ISIF or to use it as a platform to in any way attack the political ideology of any party in the House.  This Bill is about highlighting the urgent need for all policies to align with the agenda set out in the Paris Agreement.  This is not altruism - it is both our moral obligation and an existential expediency - nor is this about constraining investment and policy decisions.  It is about shifting policy and investment focus away from the technologies and industries that must be phased out if we are to protect civilisation as we know it and about ensuring that scare public resources are invested in the technologies, industries and jobs of the future.  It is about sending a message to the public and private sectors in Ireland, large and small, that the Oireachtas is taking the risks posed by climate change seriously and will act to protect people and the State from those risks.  It is also about demonstrating to the international community that Ireland stands by the commitment it made to the Paris Agreement and that it will be a serious player in the emerging green global economy.<\/p> <p>  One might well ask why a rural Deputy like me would be interested in bringing forward legislation like this but the answer is simple.  It is a question of climate justice.  Climate change affects everyone but not all equally.  Climate justice on a domestic level means local communities, in particular rural and isolated communities, having a stake in future energy projects which will have an impact on their communities.  We need to empower communities to engage with and defend themselves during the transition to a low carbon economy.  If rural Deputies like myself do not join the debate on climate change mitigation now, then we may continue to be left behind by national policies and decisions which disproportionately affect our communities.<\/p> <p>  I also feel very strongly that Ireland has an obligation, a duty and a moral imperative to concern itself with the plight of disadvantaged communities in poorer countries already feeling the effects of climate change and who are disproportionately affected by climate change while having no recourse to mitigate against its effects.  As I highlighted in the debate in January and in my written submission to the committee in recent weeks, I look forward to working with colleagues on Committee Stage to address any technical issues with regard to definitions to ensure the Bill serves to advance the decarbonisation agenda in Ireland, and to avoid unintended consequences.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062700002#B00200","speaker":"1366"},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I have been asked to focus on the global context for this energy transition.  I work for a think tank called Trusted Sources and I focus on the implications for financial investors of the shift to new energy.  I have provided a submission and a number of slides.  Having spoken to a number of people this morning, I will change the order of my submission a little, if I may.  I will first set out what we think is going on, second, I would like to consider the implications of the transition for investors and, third, if there is time, I will debunk some commonly held assumptions about the energy transition.<br\/><br\/>First, to explain what is going on, the world is undergoing a switch from fossil fuels to renewables, with implications as profound as the switch from biomass to fossil fuels 250 years ago, which began in England and launched the industrial revolution and the modern world.  This revolution is rapid, it is global, it is disruptive and it is now.  As a Deputy whom I met this morning said to me, Ireland missed out on the last energy revolution and it should not miss out on this one.  The initial driver of this revolution was regulation but it is now costs.  Solar, wind, lithium ion batteries and electric vehicles are starting to drive out the fossil fuel alternatives, not just because they are better for the environment and better for people&rsquo;s health, but because they are cheaper and easier to deploy.  It was countries such as Germany and the US which developed the technology, but in fact the key driver of change is now the emerging markets in countries such as China and India, and regions such as south-east Asia and, eventually, Africa, where energy demand is growing and where, for the first time, there is a real choice of energy supply options.  What we have is a classic emerging market energy leap-frog.  Nonetheless, we should not take the problems the transition faces in Europe as indicative of what is happening globally.<br\/><br\/>The impact of this switch on companies takes place when demand for the old energy starts to fall.  This has already happened for coal, for thermal electricity in Europe and for <i>per capita<\/i>fossil fuel demand, so we are seeing a series of peaks.  At current growth rates for solar and wind of 20% a year, the world is only three and a half years away from peak fossil fuels demand, and this will be followed by peak demand for petrol cars and peak demand for oil.  Once demand peaks, declining demand will unleash more competition between fossil fuels.  It will also embolden policy makers who seek to reduce pollution by increasing carbon taxation, which will then lead to an environment of falling prices for producers of fossil fuels.<br\/><br\/>That is on the negative side.  On the positive side, the shift will unleash a burst of creativity as the world&rsquo;s entrepreneurs are able to create and make use of increasingly low cost renewable energy, resulting in a world of distributed energy supply, digitised energy, autonomous cars, electric vehicles, smart grids and so on.<br\/><br\/>In the second part of my presentation, I want to talk to what is my key brief, which is what this means for financial markets.  Disruptive change of the kind I have mentioned usually means that the incumbents suffer as new entrants come in and prices fall.  Incumbents are the companies which have stranded assets at the top end of the cost curve.  They have unneeded infrastructure and management teams which are, frankly, in denial about what is going on.  We have already seen spectacular losses for investors in coal companies and electricity companies.  Over the last 12 months, the disruption has started to spread into the automotive industry and we believe it will continue to spread into a series of new industries, most notably oil and gas.  At the same time, we are seeing a shift of capital, ideas and talent into the new areas of solar, wind, batteries, electric vehicles and all of the software and services that surround them.<br\/><br\/>The real question is whether this is priced in by financial markets.  There is still a debate in financial markets about the nature of the energy shift.  While there are some impressive advocates of the view I have just set out, such as Amory Lovins, the consensus view remains that the energy change will take decades and that the lack of investment in new oil wells means oil prices will rise and then trend upwards over time.  This consensus, which I will discuss in the final part of my submission, is largely formed by the incumbent fossil fuel sector, which, of course, has no wish for change.  As a result, the share prices of these companies are still trading above book value and, for the most part, have not seen a collapse.<br\/><br\/>I would argue we are still in a position where it is possible to exit most fossil fuel companies at a reasonable price.  If we are right about this transition, this will not be possible in five years time.  A hedge fund manager may try to time this exit but strategic investors do not have this luxury.<br\/><br\/>In the final part of my submission, I want to talk about some of the most common counterarguments I hear, which are possibly resonating in the minds of committee members and which I talk about to many investors.  There are five such counterarguments.  The first is that people often say the International Energy Agency, IEA, has projections of future supply of solar and wind which are very slow and small.  I would respond that the IEA produces superb backward looking analysis but very weak forward projections, and that its forward projections have consistently and dramatically understated the growth of renewables.  For example, in 2000 the IEA forecast that in 2015 the world would have 6 GW of solar capacity, when in fact it had 226 GW, many orders of magnitude larger.<br\/><br\/>The second commonly made argument is that investors do not need to worry because the supposed lesson of history is that changes in energy systems take place slowly.  Again, this is incorrect.  While systemic change is indeed slow, marginal change is extremely quick.  The bankruptcy of large numbers of coal companies at a time when global coal demand was just 2% off its all-time high is a very good indication of that.<br\/><br\/>The third misconception is that renewables are still too small to make a difference.  In 2016, for example, solar and wind made up just 2% of global energy supply.  However, it is not the total size that matters; it is the share of the change.  In 2016, to take BP data because it is the most commonly used database, solar, wind and other non-fossil sources made up 62% of the increase in global energy supply but, from our calculations, by 2020 they will make up all incremental supply.<br\/><br\/>The fourth argument I often hear is that renewables are expensive and will continue to need subsidy for decades to come - that the renewable revolution is nothing other than a mirage driven by idealists.  This is backward looking and no longer accurate.  The cost of solar and wind has fallen so fast over the last five years that they are now cheaper than fossil fuels in a very large number of locations.  A bit like the mobile phone, it has moved from being a rich man's toy to a poor man's necessity, as, for example, solar lights are rolled out across Africa.<br\/><br\/>The final misconception is that the intermittency of solar and wind means they can never rise beyond a small share of the entire energy mix.  There are two important counterarguments.  First, there are plenty of countries, including Ireland, where solar and wind already make up over 20% of electricity supply.  Second, fossil fuel demand will peak when solar and wind make up just 12% of electricity supply and 5% of energy supply.<\/p><p>The best example that I can point to - it is a very good example - is to look at the early 20th century transition.  One example from the UK in 1907 is the demand for gas for lighting peat at the time, when electricity only had 2% of the market and far higher costs.<\/p><p> My final point is simply that we must look for radical change when these new technologies are still relatively small, and we are now at that position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062700002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kingsmill Bond","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498575600,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I wish to express my sincere thanks for the invitation to present at this hearing on the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill.  Tr&oacute;caire is delighted to be before the committee.  The organisation has worked hard on climate change in recent years.  We are especially grateful to Deputy Pringle for introducing the Bill and to the Oireachtas committee for prioritising its consideration before the summer recess.  In doing so, I believe the committee recognises the significant level of public interest in the Bill and the urgency of the issue, especially for the poorest people throughout the world whom Tr&oacute;caire represent.<br\/><br\/>Tr&oacute;caire was invited to attend an event in Cork city recently.  Members of the local community had organised a forum on climate change and invited their local Deputies to engage on the issue of climate action and the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill in particular.  At the event a grandfather posed a question to the elected representatives and to the members of the public attending the event.  The question was in two parts: &quot;What did you do when you knew?&quot; and &quot;What will we tell our grandchildren when they ask us this question?&quot;  The simplicity and sincerity of his question brought everyone in the room beyond all the data to the basic moral challenge posed to each of us as we make decisions around climate change.  I am putting the same question to everyone at the committee today.<br\/><br\/>Tr&oacute;caire is already seeing the game-changing impacts of climate change in the countries where we work.  We need look no further than the devastating food crisis currently taking hold in the eastern horn of Africa.  I imagine committee members are aware that almost 25 million people are in urgent need of food aid.  Millions are facing starvation in the coming months across Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and South Sudan.  The needs that we see are extraordinary and are caused by severe drought.  In some cases this is exacerbated by conflict.  This is the latest crisis in an increasing log of climate impacts that we have seen unfold in recent decades.  It is an unfolding human tragedy that will lead to increasing poverty, hunger, inequality, displacement and conflict in countries that have done the least to cause it and that have the least capacity to cope with it.<br\/><br\/>As many committee members are aware, Tr&oacute;caire is helping communities to adapt their livelihoods.  We are providing humanitarian assistance to these frequent disasters and we are active at the moment in the eastern horn of Africa.  We can see how fragile the situation is as well as the very real prospect of reaching a point beyond which these communities can adapt.  As we meet these women and men face to face and see the suffering caused by the fossil-fuel-based economies of richer countries, we have to ask ourselves this question: &quot;We know, so what are we doing?&quot;  That is why we are campaigning for climate action in Ireland with the support of the Stop Climate Chaos coalition, Social Justice Ireland, the Environmental Pillar and thousands of members of the public.<br\/><br\/>We are also before the committee today to urge the committee and the Houses of the Oireachtas to progress and pass the Bill to divest the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund from fossil fuels as soon as possible.  The vast majority of existing fossil fuel reserves must remain unburned if we are to deliver on the temperature limits set out in the Paris Agreement.  I believe we are all in agreement on that now.  The fossil fuel question represents a concrete and compelling test of our intent to deliver on the commitments in that landmark agreement.  Christiana Figueres, the UN's chief diplomat responsible for the negotiation of the Paris Agreement, has warned that unless action and ambition are increased by 2020 it will not be possible to achieve the temperature limits set out in the agreement.  This would make the sustainable development goals, which Ireland led the way in negotiating so successfully in 2015, impossible to achieve.<br\/><br\/>We have seen that divestment, even on a significant scale, does not result in the dissolution of an industry and historical evidence shows this too.  However, it does shift public and political opinion, leading to changes in government policies, market norms and investment principles.  It can significantly bolster political, public, private sector and investor understanding of why fossil fuels must be phased out as soon as possible.  That is the reason we are behind it.<br\/><br\/>We neither want nor expect fossil fuel use to stop overnight.  We want a timely, managed and just transition that puts those most vulnerable globally and in Ireland at the centre of concern.  Failing to deliver on the Paris Agreement is not an option.  This means stopping the expansion of the fossil fuel industry and stepping up the pace of the phase-out.  We have heard good economic argument for that too.<br\/><br\/>In stark contrast with Ireland's strong reputation for global poverty eradication and responsible multilaterialism, Ireland is consistently failing to deliver on its commitments on climate change.  Ireland cannot hide behind its small size and population.  We must recognise that we have one of the highest levels of greenhouse gas emissions <i>per capita<\/i>in the world.<br\/><br\/>I will close by returning to the grandfather from Cork and to the millions of women, men and children in the poorest parts of the world whose lives and livelihood are at risk from climate impacts that are already too much for them.  The transition is complex and must be managed.  We recognise that.  However, moral leadership that can unlock new ambition and progress is absolutely essential.  In his seminal encyclical, <i>Laudato si' - On Care For Our Common Home<\/i>, Pope Francis states:<\/p><blockquote>Hope would have us recognize that there is always a way out, that we can always redirect our steps, that we can always do something to solve our problems. Still, we can see signs that things are now reaching a breaking point...We must regain the conviction that we need one another, that we have a shared responsibility for others and the world...<\/blockquote> <p>Today we urge the committee and the Oireachtas to show that moral leadership and to continue the swift passage of the Bill.  In doing so, the Oireachtas will send an incredibly important global message of hope, solidarity and political leadership that will benefit all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062700002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Finola Finnan"},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I thank the deputations for their presentations.

Fossil fuels eventually will run out or become harder or more expensive to harness.  Even if we can harness them, we have the challenges of Paris and climate change.<\/p><p>There is a commercial aspect to what we are doing.  Can Mr. Bond put a value on State investment in fossil fuel companies?  Does Mr. Bond have any indication of the value there at the moment?  What has the State invested in those companies?  How much money would be available if we removed ourselves from those companies?  What is then available?

There is an incredible body of emerging evidence, analysis and recommendations concerning the need for the private sector to start monitoring and managing climate risks.

I would like to tell members about three things: how the ISIF&rsquo;s investment activity is supporting Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon economy; how the term &ldquo;fossil fuels&rdquo; relates to a very broad category in which some are at the high-carbon end of the spectrum such as peat and coal, while others such as natural gas have a role to play in the short term as we transition to a low-carbon economy; and how, as implementers of this legislation, we wish to minimise unnecessary transaction costs across the global investment portfolio and also avoid potential unintended consequences within the Irish portfolio.<\/p> <p>  I will address each of these points in more detail, but first I will give a brief overview of the lSlF and how it is addressing climate risk and decarbonisation as part of its long-term strategy to invest In Ireland.  The Oireachtas requires the ISIF to invest on a commercial basis in a manner designed to support economic activity and employment in Ireland.  The ISIF has approximately &euro;8.5 billion available for investment, with &euro;2.8 billion already directly committed to investments i Ireland across a wide range of projects and sectors.  This investment has attracted a further &euro;5.3 billion worth of commitments to Ireland from private sector co-investors, which means that to date &euro;8.1 billion has been committed to Ireland as a result of ISIF activities.  The remainder of the ISIF's assets are invested globally in bonds, equities and other assets.  In effect, the ISIF is managing two portfolios at the same time.  It is gradually selling a portfolio of global investments and using the proceeds to build a portfolio of Irish investments.  Liquidating one portfolio, while building another, requires two very different approaches.  The liquidation of the global portfolio is expected to conclude in the next five years under the fund&rsquo;s global portfolio transition strategy.  This means that divestment in the timeframe envisaged by the fossil fuel Bill is well underway.<\/p> <p>  Whether we are selling assets or investing in new ones, the ISIF is always conscious that it must act as a long-term, sustainable and responsible investor.  The fund&rsquo;s sustainability and responsible investment policy emphasises climate change as a priority for us.  As a global investor and universal owner, the fund&rsquo;s strategy has been focused on active ownership, risk mitigation and positive influence, rather than excluding sectors or companies.  Its predecessor, the National Pensions Reserve Fund, was a founding signatory to the principles for responsible investment.  The fund is also a long-term supporter of the CDP.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the three points I made at the outset, the ISIF is investing to support the transition to a low-carbon economy and actively targets investments that will be part of that transition.  For example, all of its investments in Ireland in the energy sector are targeted at facilitating, in line with public policy, Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon economy.  Given the structure of the economy and the energy sector, this requires the ISIF to be able to work with and invest in existing Irish energy providers.  It is important that it be allowed to retain this ability if it is to be successful in continuing the important work of supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  While we understand the draft Bill does not intend to remove this ability, as currently worded, it could be interpreted as limiting the ability of the ISIF to invest in a wide range of sectors, including SMEs, ICT, health care and infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  Turning to my second point, we emphasise the importance of distinguishing between high-carbon fossil fuels at the dirty end of the spectrum and those at the opposite end such as natural gas.  We are considering a process that could potentially see the exclusion of investment in companies where the level of risk to the fund&rsquo;s assets would be inappropriate to the given rate of returns.  Other sovereign funds such as those of Norway and France have also excluded the heaviest carbon emitters such as coal in the first instance.  In the context of the Bill, the ISIF believes tightening the definition of a fossil fuel company or focusing on those companies with the highest negative carbon impact may be appropriate in the first instance.  For example, eliminating fossil fuel companies engaged in coal extraction and processing could have a significant environmental impact.<\/p> <p>  Turning to my third point, I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to some potential implementation issues such as transaction costs and unintended consequences within the Irish portfolio.  The ISIF is already in the process of selling its global assets.  We expect to complete this divestment programme in the next five years, the time envisaged in the Bill.  However, it is important to note that selling in a shorter time period runs the risk of increasing transaction costs substantially.  The ISIF would have a strong preference for scope to be given to allow divestment to take place in a manner that is in line with the fund&rsquo;s current global portfolio transition strategy and which would not add to our anticipated transaction costs.  The Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill is largely focused on the global portfolio, but it is within the growing Irish portfolio that we foresee some potential unintended consequences of the current draft Bill, in particular, where we have invested indirectly.  For example, SME funds may be supporting local businesses such as service stations, distribution companies or home heating fuel suppliers.  This, again, points to the current broad definition of fossil fuel company which is perhaps unintentionally wide and the fact that even very limited levels of indirect exposure via funds would be prohibited.<\/p> <p>  I will conclude by returning to the ISIF&rsquo;s Irish energy strategy.  The fund invests in a manner that is aligned with Government policy and focused on Ireland&rsquo;s commitments across a variety of policy initiatives, including the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, the COP21 Paris Agreement and the national decarbonisation and energy security objectives for the economy.  Decarbonisation is a complex issue, particularly for Ireland where economic activity is likely to remain dependent on fossil fuels, especially gas, for an extended period - not years but decades.  The fund&rsquo;s energy strategy has an &euro;800 million allocation which is entirely focused on sustainable energy investment that seeks to enable Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon economy.  The strategy was developed in close consultation with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It is also informed by the fact that the current Irish energy market is largely dependent on imported fossil fuels and that 75% of our electricity is derived from fossil fuels.  While we would all prefer that this was not the case, this is the present day context in which the fund is operating.  It actively targets investment in companies which prioritise renewable energy, while reducing fossil fuel dependency.  It is focused on new sustainable energy infrastructure, business models and technologies which leverage Ireland&rsquo;s natural resources.  <\/p> <p>  Energy investments to date include &euro;155 million directly committed to a wide range of renewable energy projects such as the Dublin waste to energy initiative, NTR wind energy generation and Greencoat Renewables plc.  Indirectly, via a series of SME funds and infrastructure and forestry investments totalling over &euro;500 million, the fund is supporting renewable energy, power efficiency and onshore wind energy projects and emissions management.  The ISIF&rsquo;s current pipeline has approximately &euro;300 million worth of potential investment opportunities across a range of renewable technologies, including wind, solar and biomass.  It is also exploring more transformative investments under its innovation strategy, ranging from electric vehicles to energy efficient data centres to storage solutions, that together have the potential to shift the ways citizens and businesses will consume energy into the future.<\/p> <p>  Despite this commitment to renewable energy sources, in the interim the economy will remain dependent on fossil fuels.  To enable it to reduce its reliance on fuels such as peat, coal and oil, the fund may see merit, in line with its mandate, in investing in lower carbon fossil fuel based transition solutions such as gas storage and infrastructure.  We respectfully request the committee to be mindful of the unintended consequences that could inadvertently inhibit our ambitions to progress the use of low-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels.  This will mean specifically addressing potential issues likely to arise in the Irish portfolio such as the broad definition of fossil fuel company, the consideration of commonly used thresholds, the treatment of direct investment versus indirect investment and the fact that the Bill will essentially prohibit ISIF investment in a renewables project in semi-State or private utilities such as Bord na M&oacute;na or the ESB.  The ISIF strongly believes it must retain the flexibility to invest in such entities or projects where the investment case is clearly aligned with the State achieving its decarbonisation targets.  <\/p> <p>  I reiterate the ISIF&rsquo;s position that it Is highly committed to investing to support the long-term transition to a low-carbon economy.  The Bill has been very beneficial in increasing public awareness of climate change and bringing an opportunity to the ISIF to highlight the work we are doing to support the greater use of low-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels.<\/p><p>We share the goal of a successful transition to a low-carbon economy and hope that our insights will be helpful to the committee's efforts to achieve this in a way that will deliver the best outcome possible.  We appreciate committee members giving their time and welcome any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062700002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Bristow","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498575600,"counter":265,"content":"<p>I thank the joint committee for extending the invitation to speak at this session.  I wish to acknowledge the many fine investments currently held by the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, in its current portfolio in wind, solar and renewable energy companies across the globe and the &euro;44 million capital committed to energy investment in Ireland at the end of 2015.<\/p> <p>  Ireland must take its climate change commitments seriously.  The warming of Earth&rsquo;s climate system is unequivocal and human influence on the climate is clear.  Limiting climate change requires substantial and sustained reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies.  The challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is well understood by the Government and is reflected in the national policy on climate action and low-carbon development of 2014 and in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  The national policy position establishes the fundamental national objective of achieving a transition to a competitive, low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050.  Current investments held by the Irish Strategic Investment Fund in global fossil fuel companies such as China Coal Energy, Canadian Oil Sands, Yanzhou Coal Mining and many others are at odds with this vision and cannot be reconciled with current Government climate policy.  These investments do not help to advance the Government's stated vision and do not contribute to an overall global reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as required by the Paris Agreement on climate change and therefore these global investments should correctly be phased out.<\/p> <p>  The global fossil fuel sector received $493 billion in subsidies last year and therefore should not require any assistance from Irish citizens or the ISIF.  Ireland faces serious challenges in meeting energy and climate policy objectives and our current level of activity needs to be significantly ramped up to realise our stated national policy position.  Ireland is likely to face financial costs in 2020 to purchase compliance to meet greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and we will also have to pay for separate compliance to meet our renewable energy targets.  From a climate and policy perspective, this makes Ireland one of the poorest performers in Europe.<\/p> <p>  Further investments from the Irish Strategic Investment Fund in renewable energy and low-carbon technologies in Ireland therefore should be encouraged in place of investments in global fossil fuels companies, thus sending a signal that Ireland is serious about its stated commitments on climate change.  In keeping with the wider goal of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, these investments should look to support economic activity and employment in Ireland and provide long-term value for the State and citizens.<\/p> <p>  In reading the Bill, I make the following two observations.  Given the scale of the challenge in decarbonising our economy, the small number of energy companies in Ireland and size of the market here, I believe that all possible options should be made available to enable a transition to a low-carbon economy including the option of the Irish Strategic Investment Fund to provide investment to Irish companies that use fossil fuels to produce energy under strict conditions.<\/p> <p>  Specifically, I believe the Bill should distinguish or allow some mechanism to differentiate for investments in Irish projects that involve the use of abatement technologies with fossil fuels such as carbon capture and storage.  Carbon capture and storage is an existing technology that allows the majority of emissions from conventional power plants, fuelled with fossil fuels, to be captured and stored in long-term geological storage.  It can also be applied to the cement sector and other industrial processes.  Carbon capture and storage means that the harmful emissions coming from fossil fuels do not reach the atmosphere and do not contribute to climate change, thus achieving the same climate objective as renewable energy.<\/p> <p>  When carbon capture and storage is used with biomass or woody crops, it allows for the possibility of a net removal of emissions from the atmosphere.  These technologies are identified by our research in University College Cork, UCC, and other international research as critical components to achieving our obligations under the global Paris Agreement on climate change.  In the absence of private capital for the potential development of carbon capture and storage projects in Ireland, the option of investment from the Irish Strategic Investment Fund should be available as it advances the Government&rsquo;s vision of a low-carbon Ireland and enables our commitments under the Paris Agreement.<\/p> <p>  Second, I believe that the Bill, when applied to Ireland, should not preclude investments in Irish companies where that investment is dedicated to transitioning that company away from fossil fuel and significantly lowering its carbon footprint.  Investments like these would advance the Government&rsquo;s vision of a low-carbon Ireland and enables our commitments under the Paris Agreement.  Equally, these investments, if properly structured, will provide long-term value to the State.  These additions would be a constructive addition to the Bill, making it a truly transition-focused Act. <\/p> <p>  The decision for Ireland to divest from global fossil fuel companies is a very small step on the long road to a low carbon economy.  Fossil fuels will remain in the global energy mix for a long time to come and the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill&rsquo;s impact on the global industry will be minimal.  Its significance, however, is in the choice that we are making as a country to fully back a vision of a low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, we talk the green talk about climate action but are failing to the walk the walk and on its delivery.  We have a chance with the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill to show the world that we are finally serious about our climate change commitments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062700002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Paul Deane"},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":266,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an toscaireacht anseo.  I welcome the presentations.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask Mr. Bristow questions on the three specific points that he has raised.  In the earlier session, we heard on the first point that it is about ISIF being allowed to retain its ability to allow for the transition to a low carbon economy, which is very much in line with what Dr. Deane was saying there at the very end, to allow for continued investment in companies which would be deemed fossil fuel companies but are moving to or investing in alternative methods.  I believe there is probably scope there, from what I heard earlier, to deal with that in amendments.<\/p> <p>  Therefore, I want to move on to the second point that Mr. Bristow made.  He talked about how this should be staggered and the dirtier end of the spectrum should be targeted first, and the rest can be moved on to at a later stage.  I want Mr. Bristow to explain to the committee why he is making the argument that the legislation should focus on that, given that he has made the comment that the ISIF is divesting from its global portfolio within the five years that are laid down in the draft legislation anyway.  Why would we need to target, in legislation, the dirtier end of the spectrum, when Mr. Bristow himself says that ISIF will have divested from all of these global assets within five years?  He stated earlier that ISIF's investment in Ireland's energy sector is targeted at facilitating the transition to a low-carbon economy, so I presume it is not investing in the dirty end.

As the committee is aware and as outlined on Second Stage the Bill, which does not form part of the Government's legislative programme, gives rise to a number of concerns.  However, as also outlined on Second Stage, the Government is committed to working on the Bill with Deputy Pringle and with the Oireachtas so as to help ensure a beneficial outcome.  In this regard, this meeting is a welcome opportunity to contribute to the committee's deliberations.<\/p><p>I will take the committee through the rationale for the Government's position on this Bill including the underlying concerns and priorities.<br\/><br\/>As the committee will be aware, responsibility for Ireland's energy and climate action policies comes under the remit of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  However, as the Bill seeks to amend the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund's investment approach through an amendment to the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, Acts, I, as Minister of State at the Department of Finance, must lead on it.  The intention behind the Bill is well understood by both I and my colleagues in Government, including the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten.  In that regard, I commend Deputy Pringle for the work he has done in progressing the Bill to this stage.<br\/><br\/>This Bill was published at a time of significant developments in the areas of energy and climate policy, both nationally and internationally.  In considering the intentions behind the Bill, there has to be careful consideration of its wider policy implications and we must never lose sight of the continuing reality of Ireland's dependence on fossil fuels for our energy and transport needs.  Therefore, the Government does not think that ISIF's investment policy should be driving national energy and climate policy.  Energy and climate policy should be decided in a holistic manner with energy and climate at its core, and with all factors considered, including our environment, our economy, people's jobs and our international obligations.<br\/><br\/>The Government also has concerns that the Bill, as drafted, poses real risks to ISIF's ability to support the transition of our economy to a low carbon economy and poses risks to employment.  In addition, the Bill gives rise to a number of difficulties for the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, which I will address shortly.  We must also take into account progressive actions already adopted by ISIF in relation to fossil fuel investments.<br\/><br\/>Ireland is currently heavily reliant on fossil fuels, which accounted for 91% of all energy used in Ireland in 2015.  This is broken down between oil at 48%, natural gas at 27%, coal at 10% and peat at 6%.  Ireland's climate and energy priorities together govern the national decarbonisation strategy in line with Ireland's climate change commitments.  The issues of decarbonisation and the long-term transition towards a low carbon economy are central to the Paris agreement.  The extent of the challenge here is well understood by Government and is reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in 2014 and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  Critically, there is consistency and coherence between Ireland's climate and energy policies.<br\/><br\/>Similarly, the energy White Paper, <i>Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030<\/i>, published in December 2015, sets out a vision to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector by 2050.  Importantly, the White Paper highlights that fossil fuels will continue to have a key role in Ireland's energy mix even in a significantly decarbonised energy sector.  In light of this, continued investment in fossil fuel related technologies and businesses is a necessity.<br\/><br\/>In properly considering this Bill, we must take full account of Ireland having a very high energy import dependency with over 88% of our energy needs met through imports in 2015.  We have a significant security of supply dependency on imported fossil fuels, in particular from the UK.  Although Ireland has an excellent relationship with the UK in terms of energy, it is possible that this could be further complicated by Brexit in the coming years.  In order to ensure continued secure supplies of energy to Ireland in the future, investment from ISIF in strategic energy infrastructure may prove very necessary.  This Bill, as currently drafted, would preclude such investment.<br\/><br\/>The Bill's definition of a &quot;fossil fuel company&quot; is of significant concern.  It states, &quot; 'fossil fuel company' means a company whose business either wholly or partly engages in the exploration, extraction, refining, processing or delivery of fossil fuels (geological deposits);&quot;.  This definition appears to encompass a wide range of companies, including Bord na Mona and the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA.  It also appears to capture any business, local, national or international, involved in the delivery of fossil fuels.  This could include local distributors of oil, gas, coal and peat products to homes and businesses across Ireland.  This definition would prevent ISIF credit or equity funds from supporting Irish small and medium-sized enterprises which are active in these sectors.  The definition also appears to restrict investment by ISIF in companies which are developing innovative technologies that could improve the energy efficiency of fossil fuel based processes.  It may also restrict investment in technologies that could lead to improved air quality.<br\/><br\/>The former National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, transitioned to the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund in December 2014.  ISIF has a statutory mandate to invest on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment in Ireland.  All ISIF investments, since December 2014, comply with both this double bottom-line mandate and the fund's sustainability and responsible investment policy, which sets out key principles for responsible investment.<br\/><br\/>Historically, the only category of investment which was specifically excluded from the NPRF or ISIF was cluster munitions in accordance with the Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Act 2008.  The NTMA is now conducting a review of the exclusion of categories of investment.  The review includes a case-by-case analysis of all ISIF energy holdings in order to assess their sustainability and ultimately the investment case.  ISIF acknowledges that companies which are most exposed to and least prepared for transition to a low carbon economy may be candidates for divestment.<br\/><br\/>The global portfolio of the former NPRF is being sold or divested over a period of years in order to provide capital for investment in Ireland, in line with ISIF's mandate.  Energy investments in the global portfolio should be considered in the context of ISIF's Irish portfolio and its significant commitment to renewables.  ISIF's investment strategy, and its &euro;800 million energy allocation, is aligned with Government policy and the State's commitment to transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and sustainable economy.  ISIF published its Sustainability and Responsible Investment Policy in July 2016, emphasising climate change as part of its investment decision making process.  To date, renewable energy investment commitments include &euro;44 million for the &euro;500 million Dublin waste-to-energy project; a &euro;35 million commitment to NTR's onshore wind fund; investment in the Bluebay SME credit fund which made loans to Gaelectric and Mainstream, Irish headquartered renewable energy developers; and being a cornerstone investor in the Irish Infrastructure Fund, IIF, which holds a number of Irish onshore wind assets, forestry and energy efficiency technologies.  These are positive developments.  However, the Bill, as drafted, would lead to ISIF investments being directed away from supporting the implementation of Government policy and many companies and businesses which are vital to the functioning of Ireland's economy and society.<br\/><br\/>I thank the committee for this opportunity to outline the Government's concerns regarding this Bill.  As outlined, I want to constructively work with the committee to consider the provisions of this Bill, but also the wider implications.  In all areas of public policy, it is during the implementation of legislation that it is critical to balance a range of policy priorities.  In reference to this Bill, it is important to consider carefully how its provisions would be implemented.  We must legislate appropriately and avoid any unintended consequences of the legislation which we enact.<br\/><br\/>The Government is concerned that unintended consequences of this Bill, as drafted, could impact on the activities of both commercial semi-State and private companies which are focused on developing climate-friendly and energy-efficient policies and technologies.  During his closing address on Second Stage, Deputy Pringle, as well as other contributors to the debate, indicated a willingness to work closely to allay concerns regarding potential impacts from divestment.  I welcome this and I reiterate that I am committed to working closely with colleagues to achieve that same shared objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062700002#O01000","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":388,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on his elevation and his new portfolio and wish him well, and welcome the rest of the delegation.<\/p> <p>  I take it from the Minister of State's speech that the Bill, as drafted, would require big changes to comply with current Government policy.<\/p><p>If those changes were made would the Government take the Bill on board?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062700002#P00200","speaker":"1380","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":390,"content":"<p>While absolutely accepting the bona fides of the Bill, we very clearly think this is the wrong method to deal with climate change.

Earlier we heard that &euro;131 million of investments are caught up in fossil fuel on a global basis.  Over time the ISIF is transitioning away from global investment.  We could ask whether this is necessary but, equally, if the ISIF is doing what it will do anyway what is the real problem with this being done?  I can understand the logic of stating it is a timing issue, but it seems that over time it will happen anyway.  Would the definition of fossil fuels cover a company involved in plastics, as most plastics are derived from oil?  Perhaps the Department has a view on whether somebody making plastic extrusions or using oil not as a fuel but as a material for a product would be included.  I can see there could be reservations on this basis.

The ISIF fund is different.  It has different criteria to meet.  The funds coming from those external global funds and shares or stocks or wherever they are invested will be divested over a period as required, and there is a requirement in the State for a commercial return to have an economic impact.  It is equally important that areas in the State that current market structures are not prepared to fund are funded.  When the ISIF was established, I was on the committee with other members and we were not sure whether it would be as good as what we hoped, but it has proven to be.  It has made much significant investment in Ireland at a time when funding was not otherwise available.  The point is there is &euro;131 million to come in.  There is &euro;288 million in funds in indirect investment.  The term indirect investment creates a real concern.  ISIF has invested in BlueBay and Carlyle, which fund Irish companies.  By any reading of the Bill, these companies would be excluded if they had any direct or indirect attachment to the fossil fuels industry.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;35 million that ISIF has in the SBCI, which provides funding to small and medium enterprises, could also, by the reading of the Bill, exclude those small and medium enterprises from receiving funding because of the legislation.  It could be the consequence.  As I said earlier, we just do not think this is the correct method to deal with it.  An enormous quantity of work would have to be done to try to see exactly where is the &euro;1 billion in indirect investment.  It is a calculation.  There is also the impact it could have on plastics.  I am sure there are other areas in which companies could be under pressure.<\/p> <p>  Earlier I spoke to a geophysical surveying company.  It has 12 high-end high-value staff in rural Ireland.  These are the types of jobs we are trying to keep throughout the country.  The managing director told me very clearly he does not have anything to do with the fossil fuel industry, but a geophysical surveying company could be caught under the Bill.  The SBCI does not offer cheap loans.  It offers loans at market rates.  A company needing this support could be excluded, and it could cost, for example, 12 jobs at a point when we do not think it is quite necessary.<\/p> <p>  The ISIF and NPRF are divesting from companies not making an attempt to go down a low carbon route.  It would be better if they are allowed to do this in a more co-ordinated way over a five year period.  The ISIF is clearly one of the more capable funds.  I am not sure whether the actions the ISIF takes to address climate change risk have been discussed.  It is a long-time signatory of the principles for responsible investment.  It is the only Irish asset owner which has been a signatory for more than ten years.  The fund is a long-time carbon disclosure project supporter, and has actively supported the global and Irish network asking companies to disclose their carbon footprint.  The fund operates a sustainable and responsible investment policy, which was published in July 2016.  It is specifically focused on climate change and the steps being taken to address risk in the portfolio.  At present, it is tendering for additional services in this respect.  The fund is aware of risks posed by stranded assets as the world transitions to low-carbon solutions, and is committed to doing a case by case analysis of all its energy holdings to assess the sustainability and, ultimately, the investment case for these companies on an individual basis.  This process is under way in those companies, and a long-term solution will need long-term financing.  Divestment on a very limited basis may be appropriate.  The ISIF is already doing a lot.  The structure is in place to do this over a five year period.  I do not believe the Bill is the best method by which to continue.  We believe there could be unintended consequences that would have a cost for the small and medium enterprise sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062700002#Q00400","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":393,"content":"<p>I do not know whether the Minister of State or his officials managed to see some of our earlier sessions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062700002#Q00500","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":394,"content":"<p>I saw some of them, I did not see them all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017062700002#Q00600","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1498575600,"counter":395,"content":"<p>The point was made that not only is there a moral argument for this but as coal and oil become less acceptable and as people move disruptive technology towards electric cars, solar power and wind, the commercial viability of these companies over time is likely to decrease.

Let us be clear: the divestment of the ISIF portfolio has nothing to do with fossil fuels.  It is divesting from renewable energy.  It is divesting from everything in the global portfolio so it has nothing to do with fossil fuels.  The issue is whether we will send out a signal that the Parliament is saying we are recognising the emerging threat of climate change and taking action, and that State money will not be invested in fossil fuel companies in the future.  That has not happened.  It is a consequence of a decision we took in Parliament a number of years ago reflecting a view that we wanted to invest in Ireland as opposed to internationally but that equally means that ISIF is also selling shares in renewable energy wind farms or solar farms in which it could be investing.

The Minister, who I congratulate on his appointment, made an opening statement at last week's meeting and I would like to make one or two comments on that.  When the Taoiseach announced his appointment two weeks ago, he stated, \"Rebuilding Ireland is working but it may not be enough and so I am tasking him to review it within three months and to consider what additional measures may be required, including consideration of a greater quantum of social housing build, a vacant home tax and measures to encourage landlords to remain in or enter the rental market.\"  Within 24 hours a statement by the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, was published on the Department's website.  I acknowledge his enormous work, energy and effort in respect of Rebuilding Ireland.  It is Government policy and we are reviewing its performance in the first quarter of 2017.  The policy contains 48 actions, 13 of which were complete, according to the report we have been given, 26 are on schedule and nine are incomplete.  That is a reasonably good day's work benchmarked against the targets, timeframes and the people with responsibilities.  We must be fair and put this in context.  The period in question is the first quarter of the year, not the final quarter.<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to be parochial, as this policy is meant to be strategic, but I know best the area I live in and I would like to reference that.  Page 14 of the Minister's report relates to rapid build.  We have to get real.  Rapid build has not delivered.  It was envisaged 12 homes would be built in George's Place in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  There was great razzmatazz and a fanfare of publicity about this wonderful rapid build.  Why are they not permanent houses?  Why are there only 12 houses?  I have examined the locations for rapid builds and the zoning.  However, I will zone in on the one I know best in George's Place.  This has a major town centre zoning and the Minister and the professional planners who advise him will be aware that its capacity to realise a high quantum of residential units as well as commercial units is possible and practical.  Across the road, there is a private sector development, which is a five-storey apartment block, and there were Part V benefits to the local authority.  The site is served by brilliant public transport as it is on the DART line and is beside the sea.  I would love to live there.  I would like the Minister to revisit the site because the rapid build is a waste of resources and land and it does not maximise the potential of the zoning.  The Minister states in the report in respect of the 330 rapid build homes that are advancing that there are 11 projects but nothing is happening.  I went to the trouble to visit the site in George's Place before I came into work.  Nothing has happened.  There is a lovely private mews with a roof on it that was not there three weeks ago, which has been built by someone in the private sector.  Is the Minster serious about tackling the housing crisis?  I checked in with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council earlier.  There are 5,079 applicants on the housing list.  That includes a multitude families and children and, therefore, the number of people on the list is greater than that.  I would like the Minister to address that.<\/p><p> I will finish with one final example.  It relates to a place called St. Laurence's Park in Stillorgan, near the shopping centre.  It has 16 housing units, of which 14 are empty and boarded up.  Despite considerable correspondence between myself and the Department and the local authority, they remain empty.  How can we justify having 14 units lying empty for over five years?  There are only two people in there, who say they wish to stay and want to be left alone to live there.  Why can someone not come out and respond?  The Department talks about its delivery unit.  A parliamentary question was asked last week regarding the delivery unit.  We were told in the response that there were only four people in this special delivery unit.  How can we have confidence in a unit with only four people?  It is clearly under-resourced.  To be fair to the Minister, he did refer to that.   <\/p><p> I have two things I ask for.  The first that the Minister would visit St. Laurence's Park in Stillorgan and satisfy himself that these 14 units are there and empty and put a plan in to have them fast-tracked and opened for people on the housing lists.  The second, is that the Minister should cancel any arrangement to proceed with 12 rapid houses in George's Place when it has a major town centre.  <\/p><p> I will finish by going to the third item.  This relates to pillar 3.  I am delighted that the Minister signed the order regarding fast-track planning on Friday.  That is to be welcomed.  Given that there is a housing crisis, it is was a little disappointing that after this legislation was rushed through the House before Christmas in 2016 and we were assured that it would be up-and-running in relating to fast-track planning, that it has taken so long.  Nevertheless, we are where we are and it is now in place and to be welcomed.  It is a complex system to follow and because of the processes and the 16 weeks period.  Someone in the private sector did up an infographic and I can make this available to the Department.  They could look at this, do an infographic and circulate it both to the elected members around the country and to the officials.  The scheme is slightly cumbersome and it would be helpful to people.  I had reservations about it but I wish it well.<\/p><p> On this matter, could the Minister say how people might access it.  When we debated the legislation there was an issue about fees.  How are elected members, be they Members of the Oireachtas or the 31 local council, supposed to interact as people with a democratic mandate?  There was some suggestion that there could be a reduction in fees for them.  <\/p><p> I thank the  Minister and acknowledge that ultimately we are here to review a Government document, Rebuilding Ireland, in the first quarter.  There were 48 items on it, 13 are complete, 26 on schedule and 9 incomplete.  That is a good day's work and I acknowledge it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#D00200","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions.  I was the only one who did not get to ask anything last week.<\/p> <p>What interaction is there with local authorities throughout the country and particularly in larger areas such as Dublin and Cork?  What interaction is there in encouraging them and coming forward with site applications or plans for various state-owned lands that we can move on?  Without being parochial, Deputy Boyd Barrett, Senator Boyhan and myself could list a number of sites that are being actively moved on.  I wonder what consultation is happening on those levels?<\/p> <p>  On pillar 4 and the rental sector, is there an update on the amount of student accommodation that is in the pipeline?  If student accommodation can be provided, it frees up existing houses in the private sector that families can be housed in.  <\/p> <p>  Under pillar 5 and utilising existing housing stock, I am familiar with the site that Senator Boyhan spoke of.  It is near Stillorgan bowling alley.  We had complications there, where a bigger plan was envisaged for that site but it is something that needs to be moved on.

Do fiscal rules prevent that &euro;200 million from being rolled out?  As I pointed out the last time, if we are not rolling the last &euro;50 million out for another four years, it could be four or five years before that will have an effect, and we could have a time lag of eight years.<\/p><p> The fast-track planning process was due for around 21 May and I saw newspaper articles this morning indicating that it is in place.<\/p><p> I have a point of clarification on rent pressure zones, and I spoke to the Chairman before I came in.  We were meant to commence a review of that in June and I believe that will happen shortly.  I raised a point a while ago about how rent pressure zones are calculated.  My concern was that if one met the two criteria when the Minister brought it in - one was the rent was above average, and the other was that in four out of the previous six quarters, rent inflation was above 7% - that was fine, and the whole of Dublin, Cork and a number of other areas came in automatically after that Bill was passed.  We do a continuing review of that, and more local areas come in, with the possibility of some falling out.  I asked a question, because we are doing a continuing review, about the areas that came in initially, which will not meet the criterion for inflation in four out of the last six quarters in the next quarter when it comes to an end.  Those areas should, if it is being reviewed, actually fall out, because there will be three quarters now where there has been a less than 7% increase.  I am not sure who came back with the answer, but I did not fully understand it today.  Is there a second criterion which is being applied to rent pressure zones to make sure that these areas continue to stay in the rent pressure zones?  Otherwise, they will automatically fall out at the end of this quarter because of the three quarters in which there was a less than 7% increase.<\/p><p> I spoke briefly on vacant properties.  I think we should be doing much more with them.  I do not think the target that we have of 800 is sufficient.  Maybe there is a policy document coming, but one thing I have found in my local area is that the policy of commercial properties on the ground floor in towns is preventing them from being converted to residential properties.  People are putting in planning applications to convert both upstairs and the street level into residential properties, but they are all being refused because it does not meet the local area plan.  Is there any way we can get around that apart from doing material alterations to the town plan or a review of the town plan?  It is preventing a number of properties from coming back in that could be used.  I am not talking about cities, but about towns throughout the country where there are significant vacant properties at street level that could be converted to residential properties, and if the demand is there in time, they could be converted back to commercial properties.  It would revitalise the towns.  Those are just a few points.  I think we have an opportunity with vacant properties and I have said it over and over again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#E00300","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":486,"content":"<p>I agree with previous speakers.  I looked at the five pillars again over the weekend.  I am disappointed to be sitting here.  When I originally read the proposal - around Christmas - we all stayed and were all delighted to make sure that things were going to be going on track.  We are 12 months on and one is talking about infrastructure investment of &euro;226 million, and we need to address this.  That was there for empty houses, for homes for people.  I do not see an improvement in the amount of empty houses that are still vacant.<\/p> <p>  On that particular pillar, we are talking about affordable homes.  Mortgages are an issue.  I have brought this up because it is linked to the 31 local authorities.  The criteria for mortgages, where people do not qualify to go on the housing list - Carlow is one of the lowest - causes people to fall through the net.  They do not qualify for mortgages, but there is no incentive from local authorities, because one has to get refusal from banks and building societies.  This needs to be promoted to stop homelessness, and people need to be helped to get mortgages.  Local authorities have to work with them and give them incentives so that they can get mortgages.  The situation where a person is refused by a bank and a building society needs to be looked at, because if a person does not qualify, he or she has nowhere to go and becomes homeless.<\/p><p> I have concerns about the new builds.  I am aware there is a grant for the first-time buyer, if he or she buys or builds, of &euro;20,000.  I hope the Minister will not change that because it is crucial for those who are buying for the first time.  We need to promote this more, but we also need to look at the bigger picture when we are told there is this funding so that those who cannot afford to buy a new house might get some incentive to buy a vacant property.  I am aware of the scheme in Waterford and Carlow, and that is rental.  We need to provide an incentive for those who cannot afford a new house because many have come to me who have been pricing new houses and house prices have gone up.  They cannot afford to buy a new house but they asking is there any help with buying a second-hand house.  Is there some incentive for that?<\/p><p> My biggest issue is the lack of supply.  I am so disappointed to see there is a &euro;70 million roll-out fund to purchase vacant properties.  I just cannot understand this or the &euro;153 million provided in 2017 to local authorities to operate.  Where is all the funding going when homelessness is getting worse, when people cannot afford to buy a house and when they do not qualify to go on the local authority housing lists?  I have stated previously, and will say again, that the 31 local authorities need to have their own initiatives.  I read the five pillars.  I am aware everything is Dublin based and I understand that much of the Minister's work is done through Dublin because homelessness is more prevalent in Dublin but this is an action plan to be rolled out for Ireland.  I feel for rural areas.  For example, the fast-track planning for 150 houses does not affect small rural communities because there are not too many builders who will build 150 houses in one go.  I would welcome that.  I would love to see that in rural areas.  We would go mad for it, but it is not happening.  It is rural areas that are falling down.<\/p><p> In regard to the HAP initiative which I brought up on the previous occasion, I am adamant there needs to be a plan put in place so that landlords accept the HAP.  I take issue with that.  That is another reason people are becoming homeless.  The HAP is a good scheme and I have said I have no problem with it, but in many areas landlords are not taking it.  Landlords have that choice.  If one telephones the landlord, he or she will say it is his or her choice whether to take a tenant on the HAP.  That is where we are falling again.<\/p><p> I was unhappy with the initiative of certain areas, such as Dublin, Kildare and Naas, being picked for extra funding with the rent allowance where one had to qualify.  Only certain areas were eligible for that initiative.  That should have been rolled out to help with the rent allowance.  They made a plan, and seemingly certain areas were targeted, but that plan should have been rolled out across the country.  It is so unfair when there is a plan, and where seemingly certain areas meet this criteria, that these will get help with the rent allowance.  That should have been available in all 31 local authorities areas while we have a housing crisis.  Until this housing crisis ends, every local authority, whether urban or rural, should be treated the same, and that is not happening.  Even though Dublin is suffering and we have to help, rural areas are not qualifying for many of the pillars the Minister is bringing forward and it is unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#F00200","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

I might refer to the St. Laurence's Park example because it is a broader issue of vacant housing which came up separately.<\/p> <p>  In terms of vacant housing within the public housing stock, we have made significant progress over the past number of years in bringing vacant social housing units back into use.  In overall terms, the figure is in excess of 7,000.  Some local authorities report - certainly, one of the larger Dublin local authorities would have made reference to it - having fewer than 50 units vacant at any point in time as part of almost the normal churn.<\/p><p>However, there can be situations, and I think the Chairman was referring to this, where units can be vacant as part of a regeneration-type project.  Based on what Senator Boyhan has said, there may be two or three households that are still <i>in situ<\/i>.  We will continue to engage with the council because, as the Chairman has said, it has been engaging with us, and on the issues of funding, etc.  <br\/><br\/>Reference was made to the broader issue of our engagement with local authorities generally as part of driving momentum with regard to the social housing programme.  On a structured basis, the Department would have quarterly engagements with the housing team in the local authority and that provides an opportunity for a comprehensive run through of its programme to deal with any issues arising and to push on because our message to local authorities and indeed to approved housing bodies is that they should bring forward the projects and significant funding is available.  In respect of the social housing pipeline update we published along with the quarterly progress report, in the space of the three months of quarter one, we have seen the pipeline increase from about 8,400 units to over 10,000 so in the space of one quarter, the pipeline has expanded quite significantly but that is something we want to maintain.  This momentum is really what it is all about.  <br\/><br\/>Apart from those structured quarterly engagements, we would have a range of engagements with local authorities, particularly but not exclusively in the areas of greatest pressure.  We meet very regularly with all of the Dublin local authorities.  A delivery group is in place for Cork, which involves bringing the two local authorities there together with the Department and other players.  We have a lot of bilateral engagement with individual local authorities, particularly from a problem-solving point of view.  There can be many issues such as those relating to cost, messy sites or planning but our overall approach is to try to engage with local authorities on a problem-solving basis.  I am not saying there will not be difficulties because they exist.  There are knotty issues where we find ourselves having to work hard with local authorities to work through them to get to a point where we are delivering a quality product and value for money.  <br\/><br\/>In respect of the fast-track planning system, which was mentioned by a number of members, as Senator Boyhan said, the regulations have been made and that will kick off next Monday.  I acknowledge that it took us a little bit longer than we would have liked.  Ultimately, we ended up with 70 pages of regulations.  It became quite complex and we were determined to ensure that we got it right.  The Senator's point about information and infographics is well made.  If the Senator has documentation, we will certainly take that on board.  I know An Bord Plean&aacute;la has plans to publish its own guidance relating to the process and will be holding an information session on the new arrangements on Wednesday, 5 July.  We will certainly take that piece from the Senator.  <br\/><br\/>In respect of State lands referenced in the quarterly progress report, we have taken the first steps to pull together the bulk of State land potential for housing in a single mapped database that is now available online.  Again, we are engaging with all of the local authorities, particularly where there are sites that have significant scale potential, to move those sites forward.  Dublin City Council is already progressing a number of sites, as is South Dublin County Council with regard to one very large site.  In parallel with that, the Housing Agency has a prepared a land management plan for the 70 sites in the land aggregation scheme.<\/p><p>On the basis of its work, it sees about half having immediate potential and the other half more medium-term potential.  The process of engaging with local authorities on those sites is getting under way.<br\/><br\/>On housing delivery generally, we have put much focus on State lands because we recognise they do have potential, not just for housing delivery <i>per se<\/i>, but for mixed housing projects beyond the 10% social housing requirement and for some affordable rental.  They are quite important in the overall mix of housing supply coming forward.<br\/><br\/>Mr. David Walsh has up-to-date figures for student accommodation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498559400,"counter":492,"content":"<p>We have figures from the Higher Education Authority up to April 2017.

Accordingly, if there are pressures in some areas and scope in others, we are always amenable to moving moneys from one programme to another if it ultimately gets us the best outcomes.  We will continue to keep that under review.<\/p> <p>  The review of rent pressure zones that was signalled has commenced.  There is a public consultation process under way which closes this Friday.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's question about areas that arose, I will follow up with him on the reply he got.  From what he said, it was not entirely clear as to what happens in the circumstances in question.  There is a provision in the legislation which allows the Housing Agency to review an area where a rent pressure zone applies, if it considers the housing market has changed and should no longer be designated as a zone.  I am not sure that was made 100% clear to the Deputy in the reply.  I will follow up separately on that.<\/p> <p>  Last week when he was at the committee, the Minister touched on the vacant housing strategy.  He indicated a significant amount work has been done on it but he just needs to take a little bit of time to look at it.  Some interdepartmental engagement will also be required before it can be finalised.  Bringing forward that strategy is a reflection of the seriousness with which the potential of vacant properties from a housing point of view is being taken.  That said, we have some experience of several local authorities which have taken some of the census data and what it tells them about where it would seem there are significant concentrations of vacant properties.  In some areas - it is not uniform by any means - they have done on-the-ground surveys.<\/p><p>It seems as if at least some of the property that emerged in the census as vacant has in the meantime come back into use, for private housing or other purposes.  As I stated, a broader issue in this regard is being examined as part of the vacant housing strategy.<\/p><p> On planning exemptions and the matter of ground-floor and upper-floor units, we intend to make exempted development regulations that would allow for the conversion from commercial use to residential use.  The question, however, was more about the inclusion in the development plan or local area plan of an objective not to allow that.  My first reaction is that there are probably only two ways to get around that.  Mr. Walsh can certainly correct me if I am wrong.  There would either be a material contravention permission or a review or variation of the development plan.  In the short term, the material contravention might very well be the quicker way of dealing with it.<\/p><p> With regard to mortgages, which were raised by Senator Murnane O'Connor, we are certainly considering the current mortgages that are available through local authorities to determine whether they can be better promoted and so there can be a better understanding in regard to them.  Ultimately, we have to ensure that to whatever extent local authorities are giving mortgages, it is on the basis of sound credit policies.  We have had that conversation before.  It is a matter we all know about and understand.<\/p><p> One of the points the Senator raised strays into a broader issue, that of affordability more generally.  It also concerns limits for access to social housing and what is occurring in the private market, be it in regard to rental or purchasing.  We have indicated that the income limits for eligibility for social housing will be reviewed in the second half of the year.  We will be taking that forward after the summer.  There is, however, a question over some of the further measures the Minister and Taoiseach have flagged that might be wise to consider.  Maybe this is something the committee may wish to consider as part of the review process in which the Minister is now engaging.  It concerns whether there are things we should be doing in the space between eligibility for social housing and market housing, be it rental housing or housing for purchase.  We must determine whether more needs to be done regarding what might be termed as the affordable space.<\/p><p> The Senator referred to a few figures and budgets of different amounts.  She may have been reflecting on the question of whether the money is being spent.  Certainly, the money is very much being spent.  The most recent figure in my head is that about &euro;540 million from the housing budget has been spent thus far in the year.  That is probably between two and a half to three times what was spent at this time of the year in 2016.  This obviously reflects the fact that the budget is higher but also that the pace of expenditure and the momentum in the programme have ramped up quite significantly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":495,"content":"<p>Is that from the capital budget or the capital and current budgets combined?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#K00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498559400,"counter":496,"content":"<p>It is from capital and current.

It is really the capital piece that is showing the significant increase.<\/p><p>Senator Murnane O'Connor referred to issues around rural Ireland and certainly we do not see Rebuilding Ireland as a plan for Dublin or Cork but as a plan for Ireland.  Even in the social housing projects pipeline, a very significant number of projects are distributed across local authorities around the country.<\/p><p> In regard to the Housing Assistance Payment, HAP, in particular, we are very conscious of the pressures in the rental market and the importance of ensuring that landlords are aware of the benefits that HAP can bring from their point of view as well as from the tenants' point of view.  In fact, this morning there is an information session for letting agents and others involved in property to try to promote the HAP scheme.  In overall terms the target for HAP in 2017 is for an extra 15,000 HAP tenancies.  At this point in the year - someone might be able to get me the figure - notwithstanding the pressures in the rental market, we are on target to achieve that figure of 15,000 tenancies this year.  At this stage we have reached just over 7,000 new tenancies.  <\/p><p> If I understood the question, Senator Murnane O'Connor asked about the flexibility of the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  There is flexibility nationwide to go beyond the rent limits, but there is an additional level of flexibility when it comes to homeless households.  Apart from that, local authorities across the country have flexibility, in the event of needing to use it.  <\/p><p> I think I have covered most of the questions raised at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Chairman, are Mr. McCarthy's responses supposed to be the responses to our questions the last time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#L00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":499,"content":"<p>No.  They are the replies to questions nos. 3, 4 and 5.

If I understood correctly, I think it will come into play on Monday and there is an information session on Wednesday.  Have the developers had much engagement with the board on the fast-track planning process?  I have a specific point, that I raised with the Department directly.  During the passage of the fast-track planning legislation in the D&aacute;il, it was definitely my understanding in respect of the second period of extension, that any development that had commenced and where substantial works had been done would automatically qualify for the second period of extension.  It came as a bit of a shock to me when we got information from the Department that this was not the case.  A planning permission will only get a second period of extension if it had commenced works in the first phase and not in the first period of the extension.  In fairness, the Department has been engaging with me on this and we are hoping to solve this problem through the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill that is in the D&aacute;il, however that Bill has been kicked down the road for the past three weeks.  I do not know when it will pass.<\/p> <p>  In a great many proposed developments, the planning permission is running out of time.  I gave an example of a development in Kildare, where it was proposed to build more than 80 units.  Some 30 units are already occupied, a further 30 or more are almost complete, but the planning permission is due to run out next week.  There is nothing in the legislation to allow the developer to continue with the work.  That is only one site.  There are probably a number of sites in similar circumstances.  We need clarity.  The Department had hoped that the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill would be enacted before the summer recess.  The clock is ticking fairly fast.  It will have significant implications if we do not deal with this issue.  There was an oversight.  We did not realise the mistake until the Department came back and stated clearly that the development must have commenced during the period of the original planning permission to qualify for the second period.  That was not the intention. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#L00400","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":501,"content":"<p>Does Senator Murnane O'Connor wish to clarify something?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#L00500","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":502,"content":"<p>On the question of HAP, perhaps I did not explain what I wanted to know.  I know that one can make a special case, and that will be taken into account.<\/p><p>The midlands rent unit is gone.  We always had what was called rent allowance, but it has gone back to the local Intreo social welfare office.  However, trying to get the first time payment now can be an issue.  Everybody is entitled to one first time payment for a local deposit if one is renting a house for the first time.  It is an issue in that sense.  If one is not on the local authority housing list at present, one does not qualify for rent allowance unless one has an exceptional need.  Originally, when one applied for rent allowance one could get it without a problem.  Now, however, the first question one will be asked is whether one is on the local authority housing list.  If one is not, it is very hard to get rent allowance.  In my area it has gone back to the Intreo social welfare office in Carlow and I find that I talk to that office three or four times a day, which is an issue.  These issues are getting worse as they are moved from one area to another.<\/p><p> I have another question about pillar 3 on buying houses.  What is the plan for buying houses into the future?  Cl&uacute;id Housing, Respond! Housing Association and Co-operative Housing Ireland play a massive part in local authorities, but they have not been mentioned once here.  These are areas where I believe we are falling down.  Cl&uacute;id Housing and Respond! Housing Association have been building and buying houses, while Co-operative Housing Ireland has got very big again.  I noticed that it was not there for a few years but it is now back on trend.  What role do we play with local authorities and these associations?  There is the issue that people cannot buy them out, but if they are building and buying we will happily take them.<\/p><p> Under Pillar 3, there is &euro;226 million for 34 projects in 15 local authorities across the country whereby 23,000 new homes will be built by 2021.

I am increasingly concerned that the original intention of this scheme, which was to assist in the delivery of affordable units, will no longer happen.  A sum of &euro;226 million has been awarded in principle to a range of projects.  Last August, under a circular from the Department local authorities were given guidance on what the affordability component should be.  The circular says clearly that a minimum of 40% of homes delivered should be available at prices 10% below the average cost of market housing, including under &euro;300,000 in Dublin and comparative affordability outside Dublin.  Given the cohort of people for whom affordable housing is required, in real terms one is looking to &euro;230,000 to &euro;260,000 as opposed to &euro;300,000.  In September a new circular was issued which stated that it might not always be possible to deliver 40% of the new homes under the LIHAF bids at prices 10% below the average cost of market housing.  When I questioned the previous Minister, Deputy Coveney, on this some weeks ago he essentially said that the criteria are now up to the local authority in its negotiations with the developers.  I am hearing from colleagues in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, for example, that there might be no affordability in terms of the affordable units in the development that is benefitting from taxpayers' money.<\/p><p>What is the Department's target for affordability?  What is it considering in terms of the percentage of units and the price of units?  The Minister gave a clear commitment that if affordability was not delivered the funding would not be released.  Can that be confirmed?  If we meet again in a few weeks and we see units in Cherrywood at &euro;350,000, &euro;380,000 or even &euro;400,000, many of us will wish to know why any of that LIHAF funding is being disbursed.  I am very concerned about that.<\/p><p>I am also concerned about reports in the <i>Sunday Business Post<\/i>relating to the review of the all-in costs of construction which the Department and the Housing Agency are conducting.  It is a newspaper report so it might not be accurate, which is not to cast aspersions on the <i>Sunday Business Post<\/i>, but it appeared to suggest that there might be a reassessment of apartment standards.  There has been intensive lobbying by some of the large developers in terms of car parking spaces, the number of lift shafts, dual aspect and so forth.  I seek an update on the review of the all-in costs and some further detail on it.<\/p><p>Many of us have concerns around issues of fire safety, particularly in the context of what we hope will be a very significant increase in new public and private stock coming on stream.  We have all been raising the Milford Manor report from Newbridge and asking for updates through parliamentary questions, although we have not been getting much clarity.  My questions are very specific.  How long has that fire safety report been on the desk in the Department?  What are the issues delaying its publication and when is it hoped that it will be published in some form or another?  It is a key report in terms of the kinds of matters about which we are all concerned.<\/p><p> With regard to private rental, the fourth pillar, what is going on with the cost rental model?  We have been talking about this for two or three years and we are hearing from Dublin City Council, for example, that with the Oscar Traynor road site, there may not be a cost rental element to it.  Nobody knows what that model is looking like.  In South Dublin County Council, the manager has already excluded cost rental from the joint venture that is being proposed for Kilcarbery-The Grange as there was not a model.  Even the Minister when he was before us the last day said we were progressing cost rental.  I do not see it.  My understanding is there is one project and perhaps clarity can be provided on that.  The Housing Agency outside of Dublin, perhaps in Greystones, may have some element of cost rental.  There is no point in us talking about this now as it is two years since the ESRI report and we do not have a model.  Could we have an update on that?<\/p><p> I do not want to open a big debate on short-term let regulations so I will not look for any detail aside from the following.  Why has it taken seven months from the An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision for the first meeting of the working group in the Department?  It seems to be an incredibly long period and we were all quite surprised to learn that when the departmental officials were here last week.  What pressure is the being directly brought to bear on Airbnb to provide the data it has so far been unwilling to share with officials or Members of the Oireachtas that would give us a real sense of whether there is a problem with commercial landlords abusing those online platforms?<\/p><p> Will we get a timeline on when the vacant homes report will be published?  I appreciate the new Minister wants some time to examine the draft on his desk and I am quite heartened by some of the comments from him and the new Taoiseach.  Clearly if it did not include a vacant home tax, for example, there would be no stick to match the carrot.  Will the targets be more ambitious than the 3% of vacant stock that the Department and the action plan currently has and will more money be allocated to that?<\/p><p> I also have a miscellaneous question.  I understand there is a departmental working group currently examining regulations of approved housing bodies.  As we know, there is an issue around the potential for the redesignation of approved housing bodies as on-balance sheet State bodies, as has happened in Britain.  That would have major implications for the funding of Rebuilding Ireland and conversations we will have with the credit union sector and approved housing bodies regarding potential additional lending.  Could we get an update on the discussions about the regulation of approved housing bodies and when it is expected that the legislation will come to us?  Do the witnesses have any fears with regard to EUROSTAT, the Central Statistics Office and the current review being done on the status of approved housing bodies as non-State entities rather than State entities?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#M00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I asked the last time about fire safety and I know it is not our primary topic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#N00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":509,"content":"<p>We will speak about it at the end of the meeting, probably under pillars 1 and 2.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#N00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I can come back to it.  With regard to the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, I asked last time how the Department would deal with the fact that approximately 75% of the original Rebuilding Ireland plans to deliver social housing between now and the end of the programme are based on the scheme.  I asked if this would be reviewed, given the near-certainty that this is not possible.  I contend it is certainly not possible to reach that target.  Is there any recognition on the Department's side that the targets envisaged for the delivery of HAP cannot be reached?  It is important.  The 110,000 figure was given for social housing of various sorts, including direct builds, those from approved housing bodies, the HAP, the rental accommodation scheme and so forth.  The figure approximates to the number of families or households on the housing list.  I presume that is why the figure was given.<\/p><p>To deal with the housing and homelessness crisis we need a plan to eliminate the waiting list.  Is the plan to eliminate the list and does the Department have a plan to do so?  If the majority of what is proposed in Rebuilding Ireland is dependent on the housing assistance payment scheme, which I perceive to be the case, is there now a recognition within the Department that a substantial portion of that plan cannot be achieved?  To demonstrate this, I would like to give a couple of examples.  <\/p><p> A family of two adults and two children on a single income of &euro;41,000 does not quality for HAP because of the thresholds, which I also asked about.  The minimum rent for a three bedroom house in south Dublin, which this family would need, is &euro;2,350 per month or &euro;28,000 per annum.  As I said, the family's net income is &euro;41,000 per annum.  They also receive &euro;3,360 per annum in child benefit, giving them a total income of &euro;44,360 per annum.  As the family does not qualify for the housing system payment, after they have paid their rent they have &euro;16,000 per annum remaining for all other expenses.  Some 63% of this family's income is spent on rent and they do not qualify for housing support.  For a family of one adult and one child in receipt of one parent family payment or jobseeker's transition payment, the income per annum is &euro;11,585 plus child benefit of &euro;1,680, giving a total of &euro;13,265 per annum.  The minimum rent for a two bedroom apartment in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-south Dublin area, which they would need, is &euro;1,800 per month or &euro;21,000 per annum.  The housing assistance payment for this area is &euro;1,250 per month or &euro;1,500 if a person-family is homeless, which equates to a maximum payment for a homeless person-family of &euro;15,000 per annum, leaving a deficit of &euro;6,650 per annum.  It should not be forgotten that as part of the HAP scheme people have to pay 16% in rent to the local authority.  The total rent payable by this family is &euro;9,000 per annum or 68% of their income.  These people cannot even access that accommodation.  It is unavailable to them.  What does the Department propose to do about this?  Does the Department have a plan to address it?  Is there a recognition within the Department that it does not have a solution to these issues and that the degree to which the housing plan is dependent on HAP needs to be radically re-examined and similarly the thresholds to allow for housing support for people whose income is a little above the thresholds?<\/p><p> In regard to the statistics around delivery under HAP, including the 12,075 delivered in 2016 and the 15,000 it is projected will be delivered this year, how many of those are recategorisations of people on rent allowance?  At first glace one would think 12,000 new social housing units were delivered last year and a further 15,000 will be delivered this year but if the majority of them as I strongly suspect are recategorisations of people previously in receipt of rent allowance and are therefore still in the same private rented property with the same landlord and the same insecurity, critically, because we now know that HAP does not guarantee security, then that is not social housing provision.  It is not new social housing.  It is not social housing at all because there is no guarantee.<\/p><p> In regard to the 10% social mix and so on, the biggest housing developments in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area in recent times are Honeypark and Cualanor, which are being built in two phases, one under the 20% provision and the other under the 10% provision.<\/p><p>There are 848 units adding up to 108,000 sq. m.  Are we measuring in units or in metres?  Is there a real social mix here or is it a question of land?  In Honeypark the Part V requirement should have added up to either 169 units or else 21,692 sq. m. under the old 20% rule.  What we got in reality were 80 social and 63 affordable units with a square meterage of very considerably less than 10%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#N00400","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I am not going to cut Deputy Boyd Barrett off but I have given him seven minutes and I have two more speakers to get in.

What percentage has been used?<\/p> <p>  My second question concerns the publication of the sites in the ownership of public authorities and others and the seeking of expressions of interest.  What processes have been put in place for us to analyse what progress has been made on this?  What onus and responsibility is on the Department and on the local authorities for movement here?  How much inactivity on these sites would be required for the State to move on them for the provision of units?  <\/p> <p>  With regard to the rental sector and the HAP scheme, how many people have been moved from HAP schemes into social houses in recent years?  We were very nervous during the passing of the HAP legislation last year of the fact that it was unlikely to prove the short-term solution it was presented to be.  Due to the unavailability of units we felt that people would be on this scheme for much longer, despite the commitment to the contrary by the then Government.  The same Government remains in place so I would like to know what progress, if any, is being made on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#P01000","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":522,"content":"<p>Does the Senator require a clarification there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#P01100","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":523,"content":"<p>I would like to come back at some point to Pillars 4 and 5 if I could.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#P01200","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":524,"content":"<p>Certainly.

I think the Minister is going to answer those questions so that is fair enough and I accept that.  I would also like to address point 4.23, which is on page 47.  This deals with accommodation in the rental sector.  There are three points I would like to make about this.  Is the Department prepared to engage with a policy shift towards publicly-built, publicly-owned properties that are privately rented on public lands?  A number of people have touched on this issue.  The reality is that there is lack of ability to even secure affordable accommodation, be it rental or purchase.  There is a real case to be looked at again for properties that are publicly-built and owned but privately rented.  There is also social rental, but what of private rental?  Deputy Boyd Barrett set out some issues there.  We see all of the benefits of that and it is really important.<\/p> <p>  There was also a suggestion that we might have a national differential rent scheme.  That was in the context of public housing but I would have a national differential rent across the board for everybody who cannot afford it.  The reality is that people have to have the ability to pay, be it public or private.  Perhaps the witnesses might touch on that.  <\/p> <p>  I also have an question on point 5.5 on page 56.<\/p><p>It states, &quot;We will review the Tenant (Incremental) Purchase Scheme following its first year of operation.&quot;  I note that it is stated in the covering note:<\/p><blockquote>The review is now complete and a full report setting out the findings and recommendations has been prepared.  Following consultation with relevant Departments on implementation arrangements, it is intended that definitive proposals will be brought to the Minister in June 2017.<\/blockquote><p>It would be great if the Department could share the review with us at some point.  It is one of the key objectives the Department undertook.  It is now done and marked off in the report as &quot;Status: Complete&quot;, so I ask the witnesses to share it or circulate it at the appropriate time.  Clearly, they will brief their Minister - that makes sense - but I ask them to bear this in mind and keep us in the loop.<br\/><br\/>Finally, action No. 5.9, on page 57 of the report, states: &quot;We will review planning legislation to allow the change of use of vacant commercial units in urban areas, [ - this might have been touched on by my colleague next to me - ] including vacant or under-utilised areas over ground floor premises, into residential units without having to go through the planning process.&quot;  In layman's terms, what does this mean?  It will mean that the Department will recategorise such units or designate them as exempt developments.  I presume that would be the thinking.  There are issues in this regard.  However, for various reasons, the Department did not proceed with this objective anyway.  It was not progressed for whatever reason.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on the Department's intentions in this regard.  The Department did not proceed with the objective at that time, but there are implications for the planning code of the reclassification of such a case to non-compliance or an exempt development.  &quot;Exempt development&quot; is actually the term I need.  I ask the witnesses to touch base on the Department's intentions in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#P01400","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1498559400,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I will try to deal with those comments.

On the discount and benefit that would accrue in the State taking up the cost of infrastructure as opposed to being dealt with normally through development contributions, we amended the requirements to provide two options.  A local authority could in negotiations with the developer either facilitate a reduction in the price of a certain proportion of the homes or reduce by a proportionate rate the entire price list.

I did, although perhaps in my muttering style, make reference to AHBs which are hugely important.  They deliver very significantly for us and are important players as part of the implementation of Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p> <p>  That comes back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin and the issue of reclassification.  We had some discussion on this previously.  That, obviously, is a significant issue and we are working closely with the CSO and with the AHB sector in regard to it.  The last update we had from the CSO was that it was probably taking a little more time than it might have envisaged.  Whether the CSO will come to a conclusion on it before the end of the summer or whether it will stretch to the autumn is not entirely clear at this stage.  It then it moves on to EUROSTAT which will ultimately make the decision.  It is certainly something for at least the second half of the year.<\/p><p>We are certainly alive to the potential implications that might flow from this and honestly engaging with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance on it in order that we will be as prepared as we can be in terms of what it might yield.<\/p><p> The Deputy also referred to the regulation of the approved housing body sector.  Publication in the current session of a Bill dealing with the issue has been committed to and we are practically there.

We were guaranteed that people would be moved to a transfer list and considered appropriately in the provision of permanent solutions.  How many of the 356 have been in involved permanent solutions?  How many of the three homeless families have been involved in permanent solutions?  The information is available from the inception of the scheme in February 2015 to date in the latest quarterly report, for quarter one, but it does not classify or clarify to what social support scheme they were moved.  Unfortunately, it again paints a grim picture.  Units are not being supplied and permanent solutions are not being provided.  I have heard initial murmurings from the Minister about the issue of supply and the onus or responsibility being on the Department and local authorities to deliver social units.  They need to do what we need to do, which is to build homes.  I hope and expect to see new supply initiatives along the lines recommended by this committee and elsewhere.

Obviously, it is one of the first issues I have had to confront since being given this brief.  The first target is to ensure new families who find themselves in the precarious position where they have to present as homeless will not be accommodated in hotels.  That should not be the first response for them.  The other target we have to meet is moving those families who are currently homeless and in commercial accommodation out of hotels.  We have two competing targets which we are trying to meet.<\/p> <p>  I met the local authorities last Friday to again go through the numbers of new presentations this month.  We spoke about finding a pathway for families who were still homeless and in commercial emergency accommodation.  At the end of May, the figure was around 650 and I wanted to see what the solution for each of them could be.  To understand it, I will continue to engage with the local authorities every day this week.  I am due to meet them again tomorrow.  There are a few commitments I have asked them to meet in working with me to have further clarity and provide more certainty for those families who find themselves in this difficult position.  Up to 50 families will be accommodated in the Mater Dei centre.  That is a first, not a last response.  It is far superior to families being in hotels and emergency accommodation.  Once we have them in a hub, we can provide wraparound supports and see them progress towards a more permanent solution which is more sustainable for them.<\/p> <p>  Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor said rural Ireland had been forgotten in the provision of housing in general and that the level of homelessness was just as bad outside Dublin.  Unfortunately, when we look at the figures for homeless families, 85% of the problem is in Dublin, but that is not to say there are no supports available through the local authorities.  If the Senator believes her local authority was falling down in a specific area, be it in the case of the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, families or homeless persons with certain needs, she should let me know.  Because of the constant interaction I have to have, if I have intelligence from Members, it would be helpful.  We have schemes such as the buy and renew and the repair and leasing schemes, with which the Senator is familiar.  I have looked at the figures for these two schemes and there is scope for significant improvement.  In the coming months we can get the word out about them, linking with similar schemes which will come through under the vacant homes strategy which will be published later and as part of which, there will be a focus on the direct supply time measures.<\/p> <p>  The provision of hubs is being advanced in Limerick, Cork and Kildare.  The housing assistance payment scheme for homeless families was rolled out recently in Cork where a place-finder was also put in place.  There is no intention to have a hub in Carlow specifically.  We are using other social housing mechanisms and the housing assistance payment scheme in this regard.  If the local authority wants to approach me about the creation of a hub and believes it is necessary to do so, I am open to it.  Again, the first target we need to meet is ensuring families who present as homeless are not accommodated in hotels.<\/p><p>I am very much open to that if it believes it is necessary.<\/p><p> The first target we need to meet is making sure families who present as homeless are not being accommodated in hotels.  If there is a feeling in the Senator's local authority area that a hub is needed so families do not have to go into hotels, let us explore that.<\/p><p> Concerns were raised about the HAP scheme in general and about people being able to avail it.  Considerable work has been done on this in recent months in regard to the new supports.  I believe 350 people or households have been accommodated each week through  the HAP.  We launched an education initiative on the HAP for landlords so they could gain an understanding of their obligations and responsibilities, in addition to the benefits that accrue for them under the scheme, including greater resources in respect of what the market price might be and also the consistency that can be achieved in terms of the tenancy because of the payment being made through the local authority.  As with everything, we keep these matters under review.  If the Senator is worried about a particular issue in her local authority area, it is very easy to deal with specifics and to get working on them.<\/p><p> The Senator referred to a women's refuge in Carlow.  That is the responsibility of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#V00400","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I know.

I will raise the issue with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked me to reconsider the various local authority social housing income thresholds.  I will consider this but I do not want to give too strong a commitment on what we can do.  I had a meeting yesterday on the mortgage-to-rent scheme we have had in place.  I believe it was piloted in 2011 and rolled out in 2013.  The uptake has not been as strong as we would like but there are reasons for this, including the difficulty of engaging with some borrowers.  There have been difficulties in terms of the eligibility criteria and people understanding them.  The meeting I had yesterday also covered long-term financing solutions, potentially for a further rolling out of the scheme.  It is definitely needed.  It is a question of discovering other financing arrangements.<\/p> <p>  I have another meeting later this week to determine whether there is a potential avenue in this regard.  I will also be having discussions with the Minister for Finance on other matters that have been discussed previously.  That would mean that we could see a lot more people moving more quickly to mortgage-to-rent arrangements.  There was a review conducted of the scheme.  A report was produced in February of this year.  One of the points made concerned timelines and the fact that it takes too long for people who present with this problem to move to a solution.  We need to narrow the timelines if we can.  There is a proposal in this regard to be explored.<\/p> <p>  The other point about the mortgage-to-rent scheme, on which I wish to touch briefly, is that we need to find a scheme that will work not only for people who have a need for social housing but also those who need an affordable solution but who do not meet the threshold criteria in regard to social housing.  That is a matter I am going to examine also.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about staffing in local authorities. Each chief executive is responsible for staffing in his or her area.  In 2016, the previous Minister sanctioned an arrangement for each local authority chief executive to fill vacancies at grade 7, equivalent grades and below and to bring about a workforce plan without needing to seek approval from the Department to do so.  They have been given greater autonomy in doing that.  Since that happened, 646 additional staff have been approved by the Department to deliver on the goals in regard to our housing and rebuilding strategy.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about boarded-up houses being bought out for homeless families and whether funding is a problem.  Funding is not a problem in that scenario.  I mentioned the two schemes we have that can help in this regard.  On vacant homes in general, there is a new plan or strategy to come out.  I have reviewed that already and I have engaged with officials on it.  It comes under another pillar and I will address it under that if we get a chance.  There are some new ideas that I want to bring to bear on the strategy.<\/p> <p>  A sum of &euro;32 million is available this year for the repair-and-leasing scheme.  Some &euro;25 million is available for the buy-and-renew scheme.  The issue in this regard is getting people to understand that the scheme exists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#W00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":593,"content":"<p>There is a lack of information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#W00400","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":594,"content":"<p>Yes.  There is some money in my Department to help if we want to do more about advertising to raise public awareness.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of voids, a new programme was commenced to try to deal with the backlog.  A sum of &euro;80 million was provided, and 7,000 social homes across the 31 local authority areas were remediated to a high standard.  I acknowledge, however, that not every local authority is doing this to the same degree of efficiency.<\/p><p>I sat on Dublin City Council in 2009 and 2010 and I know that voids were a significant issue.  Since then major progress has been made, but not every local authority has succeeded in meeting this standard.  We have to continue to drive this in local authorities, because it is not acceptable that a significant number of voids continue for a long time, when families have housing needs.<\/p><p> On the question of de-zoned lands owned by the local authorities, again this is a function for the local authority, should it want to make a variation to its development plan and to rezone a piece of land, if it thinks that would be beneficial.  I think it is important that the local authorities understand that.  Of course, the Department is trying to centralise a land management initiative, so that we can get proper sight over what is available in each local authority and that we have a mapping of available land in place.  This is a matter that I am reviewing at present, so that we can see how we can better deliver social land into new housing schemes.  Many benefits will derive from such land use on the part of the State.  I think part of what we are talking about in terms of what we need to do is rebalancing the fact that so much of this need was outsourced to the private market a number of years ago.  When the market crashed, of course, a significant burden was placed on a number of people.  As a principle, the State needs to make direct provision for social housing in the first instance.  One can build other supports that we have seen working successfully in other countries around that.<\/p><p> On the question on the proposed council scheme in Carlow, which needs approval and for which the local authority needs the money, we did review the approval system for planning for construction projects and we are moving to put proper timeframes in place for each stage of the approval process.  I know that certain elements, for example the delivery of the framework for procurement around rapid build is now successfully in place and that will help people move very quickly through the process.  I think that since Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue, the Department will meet with Carlow County Council on the construction timeline.  In terms of the figure of 138 units being approved, we want to see that expanded and the timeline met.<\/p><p> Deputy Dessie Ellis, who is not present, asked about the delivery of sufficient social housing and why the process is not working.  At present, there are housing units on 607 sites in the pipeline, but in the first quarter of 2017, 1,600 units were approved.  We have a very ambitious target of 47,000 units during the period of the programme but we have the funding behind it as well.  We need to ensure that we are delivering on the commitments in the programme.  It has been said in the course of the review that I am undertaking that if there is a need for a greater intervention in terms of the delivery of social housing units, we will make that intervention.  <\/p><p> Deputy Ellis made the point that nobody was raising the issue of affordable housing.  There is a number of sites that will come online in Dublin City Council - and I know that Deputy Ellis used to serve on the city council - where we can make an effort on supplying affordable housing that people can buy but also that people can rent.  I think it is very important that we use what leverage we can in that regard to make sure that we are meeting those commitments.  The former Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney had discussed with the committee ensuring that when we plan large housing schemes involving a significant number of people, we will have the right mix from private housing, affordable housing to buy, affordable housing to rent and social housing so that we can help build those new communities.  <\/p><p> On the question of an over-reliance on the private market, where the minimum cost of a house at &euro;300,000 is unsustainable, we are looking at initiatives to ensure new financing solutions or new schemes and initiatives for homes for first-time buyers are affordable.  I had a meeting yesterday on an initiative that we may be able to introduce in that regard.  I will be able to expand on that further in the coming weeks when we have a clear idea of the direction we will take on that.<\/p><p> Deputy Ellis also raised the issue of elderly people looking for suitable places to live.<\/p><p>Good work is being done with the different housing bodies and the local authorities in this regard.  In the development I had the privilege to visit a couple of weeks ago 70 new homes were being delivered, and 16 of the occupants of those homes were elderly people who were moving out of larger homes that were once family homes but were no longer necessary.  That is freeing up a further 16 homes in the local area for families.  As part of this we must ensure that we are finding solutions for elderly people who want to move on to another stage of their lives or who no longer have a need for large housing.  That is being done.  It was achieved in the case I mentioned by carrying out an advertising campaign in the local area.  That is how they were able to find people to move out of their larger homes.  It was what those people wanted, in fact.  They were seeking to move into a smaller home because it suited them in that stage of their lives, but it also worked in terms of the community and finding new homes for families.<\/p><p> With regard to public private partnership programmes and problems in delivery, good progress is being made on this.  Some 1,500 social homes will be rolled out in three bundles and the total capital value of the programme is &euro;300 million.  The first bundle is six sites in the greater Dublin area.  Deputy Ellis is probably familiar with the site in Finglas in his constituency.  Some concerns have been raised there by local residents about the development, with a focus on the levels of social housing in the area.  The development designs for the first bundle of six sites have been completed and the lodgement of the Part 8 planning application has commenced.  We hope construction will commence next year with units becoming available in 2019, which will be very welcome.<\/p><p> There was also a question about a proposal for a State run entity that could deliver social and affordable housing.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has an idea on this and for a pilot initiative to work with a local authority to deliver that.  I told Deputy &Oacute; Broin that it is something I will consider.<\/p><p> Deputy Ellis also spoke about the hubs and said they cannot be allowed to turn into long-term homes.  I agree.  To reiterate, the hub is a first response.  It is a good first response and certainly is a better first response than hotels.  We are moving quickly on this.  Some 200 families will be supported in hubs as a result of the &euro;10 million I approved last week.  I have spoken with the local authorities, particularly in Dublin, and told them that if they can identify new locations for more hubs, if they consider them necessary, we can discuss funding for that.  Again, it should be noted that it is just a first response.<\/p><p> Deputy Casey raised a good point - one that occurred to me as well - on the social housing projects in the quarterly reports.  There are unique identifier numbers for each of the different units.  To be perfectly honest, reading the quarterly report can be confusing at times.  It is divided very well into the five pillars so we can talk about the different ways we must tackle this problem, but some of the initiatives cut across the pillars so it is important that we are not double counting something or getting confused about what is being delivered under which module or part of the plan.  When we do the next quarterly report, and I have already spoken to the officials about this, we have to find a way to help people better track progress where it is happening so they can understand it more clearly.  There were other suggestions about different columns that could be added and we will consider them as well.<\/p><p> Deputy Casey also asked about the rapid builds and why we are not delivering on them or delivering more.  I raised this already today.  There are 500 rapid build units advancing at present and by the end of the year 1,000 will be delivered or advancing.  Part of the delay was due to the procurement process.  That was solved by the previous Minister, Deputy Coveney, through the new framework in place.  We hope this will progress more quickly as a result.  Deputy Casey spoke about eight projects that appear to have gone backwards since the approvals process.  Perhaps he will identify them to us so we can be clear about them and see if that is the case.<\/p><p> With regard to the fast-track planning, I have signed the order.  It comes into effect on Monday, 3 July.  On Wednesday, 5 July, An Bord Plean&aacute;la will hold an information meeting for local authorities, developers and others so they can understand what it means for them.  I have also spoken to the Housing Finance Agency about it and what it means for it.  I believe it is a positive development.<\/p><p> There was reference to a statement from the previous Minister, Deputy Coveney, that no local authority project had been refused.<\/p><p>To clarify, the process is the local authorities propose a project to the Department and it is not the other way around.  The list contains all projects sent by local authorities to the Department and they can be approved.<\/p><p> It was stated that vacant properties are a win for everyone as infrastructure is already in place but the question was asked as to why we are only targeting 800 of the 198,000.  I will get a better chance to speak about these figures when we publish our vacant homes plan.  Very useful work has already been done around these figures relating to vacant homes.  Of the 198,000, between 70,000 and 90,000 are in areas with high demand for housing, so automatically it is a lower figure.  There are issues around short-term vacancies, meaning homes that are being sold or in the process of being re-let, and another amount is taken from the total.  A certain number of homes are caught up in legal issues such as wills.  There is still a healthy number we can target, and we must do that with a carrot and stick if we are to get those vacant homes into use.  It will not amount to just 800 and the figure will be much bigger.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017062700002#W00500","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1498559400,"counter":598,"content":"<p>There is a target of 6,600 over the six years under what has already been announced.

I have already spoken to officials about the process and I hope I will have another chance to speak about it with regard to the review that has begun.  It is a daily part of my work.  As I consult with the different stakeholders in all this, it is a chance for me to hear from them about some of the initiatives they feel could be picked up.  Their time has come in terms of what we have done in the past 12 months and what the Department and the previous Minister have done.  There is an opportunity here as well and I welcome the submissions I have already received from members of the committee about what they feel still needs to be done in this process.  I met the former Minister at the Department, Deputy Coveney, after my first meeting in the job, which was with the Secretary General, and he went through a couple of matters he felt worth picking up and which may not have been addressed in the course of the past 12 months.<\/p> <p>  It is important that we put property interests on notice that we need to move quickly with more ambitious plans where there are empty homes or other forms of property that are empty.  This is a crisis to be dealt with and we must move quickly now to release assets and make them into homes for people who need them.  That includes the State's direct obligation to provide social homes and look after people who cannot afford to rent near to where they work or who want to buy because they are starting families.  It is about dealing with the different aspects of this problem as they present.  It is key as we consider the supply measures that must be brought online.  This is not just about finding new financing and sites or new ways of leveraging sites.  It is not about getting people to build more quickly.  This is also going to be about existing stock and making sure it is used appropriately, given the immediate challenge we have.  I hope we can introduce measures for a two or three-year period until new supply is brought online with new builds.  That is something I am examining now.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked a number of questions on a topic we discussed last week, including about defective buildings and regulations, fire and building standards and the fire safety review and standards.  There are a couple of things going on.  The Deputy is aware that, immediately after the Grenfell tower tragedy, I convened officials in my Department to ensure we moved immediately to live safety inspections in local authority housing and using the building control management system to notify landlords of their obligations in this regard.  It is a series of work that needs to be done and this is the beginning.  We had the chance to debate this with the Green Party's Private Members' motion and it also came up with the issue at Lynam's Hotel.<\/p><p>A second phase of work will now commence.

We know that an informal review has been commenced by the chief fire officer in Dublin, which is welcome.  The statement will reference what we hope other local authorities will move to do in terms of the challenges posed arising out of what happened in Grenfell in regard to the quality of products that were used in the UK and may have been used here and to reassure people, where possible, that the buildings they are living in is safe and that things that happened in the UK have not happened here.  There is a suite of secondary measures that we are moving to complete within set timelines.  To ensure this is done, yesterday I convened the second meeting of the task force, which comprises officials from various parts of the Department brought together after Grenfell to ensure we could move not only on the life and fire safety issues with the local and fire authorities but on putting in place of regulations, building standards and building inspections.

I am not convinced, however, that families' overall needs would be better met in a hotel given the different supports we can give to them around all these things.  Unfortunately, there are families which, because of exceptional circumstances, will need a more tailored plan for their individual needs and that will mean they will be in hotels for much longer than I would like them to be.<\/p> <p>  Questions were asked about an audit of vacant properties in each local authority area.  I am currently reviewing the vacant housing strategy.  We are making sure we have teams in each local authority who can drill down an appreciation of exactly where these units are and what is the state of their vacancy.  This is so that we have informed data driving what we then do in terms of incentives and any other measures that might be brought to bear to make sure that we get them released.  That is a part of what we are doing.  <\/p> <p>  The issue of a place finder service for D&uacute;n Laoghaire was mentioned.  The Dublin Regional Homeless Executive has a place finder service for the use of the new homeless HAP scheme.  It is operated by the executive so that should also apply to homeless families and individuals in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area.  If the member has examples of people who have not been accommodated through this service then I would like to hear about them because they should be.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the security of HAP, many measures have been put in place to ensure a more secure situation for people accommodated through this scheme.  These include the fact the local authority will make an electronic payment to the landlord, the fact the local authority has flexibility with the size of the payment that might be made and the fact that if there is unfortunately a loss of income on the part of the person living in the accommodation through the HAP scheme, this will not have an impact on the local authority's ability to deliver the payment to the landlord.  A number of things are being done to make sure there is security for tenants moving into HAP.  While they are no longer able to avail of the housing list, they are able to get access to the transfer list.  Some families find themselves moved through the transfer list into other forms of longer term housing.<\/p> <p>  Cherrywood was mentioned and the changes in the social housing provision there.  As the committee knows, when that strategic development zone was first put in place the requirement was for a 20% provision, 10% affordable and 10% social.  That was amended in 2015 to 10% social housing because we wanted to kick-start construction activity and reduce the viability gap that was hindering new developments at the time.  It was to try to make sure that we could get new developments built.  There was also a policy change bringing the focus onto social housing alone.<\/p><p>We want to see if we can increase our ambition in that regard, be it through the use of local authority land or other means such as LIHAF, to bring Government leverage to bear to make sure we have a more ambition than just 10% social housing.  We are continuing to consult local authorities, including D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, to see what we can do in respect of bringing new land banks online.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked about the difference in the obligations for providing social and private housing allocations on public and private land and if the mixed tenure policy is the same.  We have much more control over State land regarding what we can deliver when we own the land and how we can deliver it.

NAMA sold the development to Cerberus, people are now being evicted and the 15 units remain vacant.

Caithfimid a chur san &aacute;ireamh go bhfuil na dalta&iacute; seo timpeall 15 bliain d'aois.  N&iacute;l siad ag deireadh a gcuid tr&eacute;imhse sna scoileanna.  Fanann an chuid is m&oacute; de scoil&aacute;ir&iacute; a dh&eacute;anann an teastas s&oacute;isearach ar scoil go dt&iacute; leibh&eacute;al na hardteistim&eacute;arachta.

M&aacute;s f&eacute;idir &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh go n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha sa seomra ranga, is fearr &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh sa tsl&iacute; sin.  T&aacute; molta&iacute; l&aacute;idre mar sin foilsithe ag an OECD agus ag &aacute;iteanna eile.  Th&aacute;inig an chomhairle sin chugainn &oacute;n NCCA.  N&iacute;or bhain s&eacute; leis an nGaeilge amh&aacute;in.  Bhain s&eacute; leis na teangacha uilig, i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re.

Bh&iacute; tuairisc&iacute; scr&iacute;ofa ag an SEC agus ag an Roinn agus, fi&uacute;, bh&iacute; eolas faighte ag an NCCA.  Bh&iacute; a l&aacute;n br&uacute; ar dhalta&iacute; sleachta a chur de ghlanmheabhair.  N&iacute; hamh&aacute;in sin, chuirt&iacute; sraith de phicti&uacute;ir &oacute;s comhair na ndalta&iacute; agus dh&eacute;anadh siad cur s&iacute;os uirthi.  Is minic a bh&iacute; an cur s&iacute;os sin de ghlanmheabhair ag dalta&iacute; gan, i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re, tuiscint acu ar p&eacute; rud a bh&iacute; &aacute; r&aacute; acu agus n&iacute; raibh siad in ann gn&aacute;thchomhr&aacute; a dh&eacute;anamh leis an scr&uacute;daitheoir n&oacute; le duine eile ar bith.  Sa ch&aacute;s seo, is ar an m&uacute;inteoir f&eacute;in an meas&uacute;n&uacute; ar an gcomhr&aacute; n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha seo.  Is &eacute; sin an m&uacute;inteoir a bhfuil taith&iacute; aige n&oacute; aici ar na dalta&iacute; agus ar a ndul chun cinn.  An chomhairle l&aacute;idir a fuair an Roinn &oacute;n NCCA n&aacute; gur fearr c&oacute;ras mar sin a chur i bhfeidhm.<\/p> <p> Tagann an dara cheist a bh&iacute; ag an Seanad&oacute;ir as an rud sin agus ruda&iacute; a chur de ghlanmheabhair.

Ceapaim f&eacute;in go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go bhfuil ruda&iacute; &eacute;igin - d&aacute;nta, amhr&aacute;in agus araile - againn de ghlanmheabhair.

Is maith an rud &eacute; sin.  Cuireann s&eacute; le st&oacute;r focal na ndalta&iacute; gan dabht.  N&iacute;l aon rud i gcoinne ruda&iacute; a chur de ghlanmheabhair agus n&iacute;l aon rud ina choinne sa churaclam nua.  Ag an am c&eacute;anna, n&iacute; hionann gn&aacute;thchaint agus gn&aacute;thchomhr&aacute; agus sleachta a bheith de ghlanmheabhair ag duine.  Is maith an rud &eacute; a bheith &aacute;balta sleachta a r&aacute; de ghlanmheabhair.  B&iacute;onn party pieces ag daoine.  N&iacute;l aon dabht ach go gcuireann siad le focl&oacute;ir&iacute;n an dalta.  An rud is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute;, &aacute;fach, n&aacute; go mbeadh na dalta&iacute; in ann gn&aacute;thchomhr&aacute; a bheith acu eatarthu f&eacute;in agus le daoine eile.  Sin an rud at&aacute;imid ag iarraidh a spreagadh.<\/p> <p> Sa tr&iacute;&uacute; cheist a bh&iacute; ag an Seanad&oacute;ir, luaigh s&eacute; an Polasa&iacute; don Oideachas Gaeltachta agus an cheist a bh&iacute; aige n&aacute; an raibh s&eacute; ag teacht salach ar an bpolasa&iacute;.  N&iacute; d&oacute;igh linn go bhfuil.  Tiocfaidh m&eacute; ar ais ar an bpointe maidir le l&iacute;on na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; a bh&iacute; p&aacute;irteach sa phr&oacute;is&eacute;as comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in ach an rud is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; a th&aacute;inig as an gcomhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n leis na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; n&aacute; seo.  Nuair a d'fhoilisigh an NCCA an ch&eacute;ad dr&eacute;acht den churaclam n&oacute; den shonra&iacute;ocht, bh&iacute; s&eacute; ar intinn sonra&iacute;ocht amh&aacute;in a bheith ann agus bheadh s&eacute; cos&uacute;il le mar at&aacute; s&eacute; anois.  Bheadh Gaeilge ann agus sin deireadh leis ag ardleibh&eacute;al agus gn&aacute;thleibh&eacute;al.  As an gcomhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n, &aacute;fach, th&aacute;inig a l&aacute;n tuairim&iacute; chuig an NCCA agus bh&iacute; m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; ag r&aacute; nach leor curaclam amh&aacute;in agus go raibh curaclam sa bhreis ag teast&aacute;il &oacute; na scoileanna l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge agus &oacute; na scoileanna Gaeltachta.  Rinne m&uacute;inteoir&iacute;, go h&aacute;irithe m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; i nGaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;, arg&oacute;int nach raibh leibh&eacute;al na Gaeilge agus an d&uacute;shl&aacute;n sa siollabas ard go leor do na mic l&eacute;inn a bh&iacute; Gaeilge &oacute; dh&uacute;chas acu.  D'&eacute;isteamar leis an gcomhairle sin.  Th&aacute;inig an NCCA ar ais ag an Roinn, phl&eacute;amar an cheist agus shocraigh an tAire ag an am iarraidh ar an NCCA dh&aacute; churaclam a fhoilsi&uacute; agus a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id mh&uacute;inteoir&iacute;.<\/p> <p> Toisc go raibh an cinneadh sin d&eacute;anta, bh&iacute; ar an NCCA dul ar ais go m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; agus dara babtha de chomhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n a bheith acu.  Bh&iacute; comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n ar an Idirl&iacute;on acu agus bh&iacute; comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n scr&iacute;ofa ann.  Bhuail an comhairle le gr&uacute;pa m&uacute;inteoir&iacute;, go h&aacute;irithe gr&uacute;pa m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; &oacute;n nGaeltacht.  Bhuail an comhairle le scol&aacute;ir&iacute; chomh maith.  Scr&uacute;daigh an comhairle an rud a bh&iacute; ann ag an am agus &eacute; sin an dh&aacute; dr&eacute;achtshonra&iacute;ocht.  Lu&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin leis an bpolasa&iacute; Gaeltachta.  Ceann amh&aacute;in de na tuairim&iacute; a fuaireamar f&eacute;in sa Roinn nuair a bh&iacute; an Polasa&iacute; don Oideachas Gaeltachta &aacute; phl&eacute; n&aacute; nach raibh tuismitheoir&iacute; agus m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht s&aacute;sta leis an gcaighde&aacute;n Gaeilge a bh&iacute; sa seansiollabas.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; r&oacute;-&iacute;seal do lucht labhartha na Gaeilge.  An rud a d&uacute;irt siad linn n&aacute; go bhfuil ardchaighde&aacute;n le baint amach sa Bh&eacute;arla ag mic l&eacute;inn sa Ghalltacht nuair at&aacute; B&eacute;arla &aacute; staid&eacute;ar acu.  An cheist a bh&iacute; acu n&aacute; c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfuil a leith&eacute;id ag titim amach i scoileanna Gaeltachta nuair at&aacute; an Ghaeilge ag na scol&aacute;ir&iacute;.<\/p> <p> F&aacute;ilt&iacute;onn an Roinn go bhfuil dh&aacute; shiollabas, n&oacute; dh&aacute; shonra&iacute;ocht, ann.  Chomh maith leis sin, bh&iacute; imn&iacute; ar mh&uacute;inteoir&iacute; agus ar scol&aacute;ir&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht nach bhfuair siad creidi&uacute;int ar an gcumas labhartha a bh&iacute; acu.
