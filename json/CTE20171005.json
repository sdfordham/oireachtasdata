May he rest in peace.  With the agreement of the committee, I propose that we adjourn at noon to allow members be in the D&aacute;il Chamber for the expressions of sympathy.  The Business Committee has indicated that all D&aacute;il business will be suspended for the day, other than the expressions of sympathy, but this has not had an impact on committees which are meeting this morning.  The request is that, as a mark of respect, we adjourn at noon in order that members may attend the D&aacute;il Chamber.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.

Agreed.  One item brought to my attention as arising from the minutes is that we received a letter last week about the Higher Education Authority, third level institutions and consultancy fees.  It relates to our ongoing concern about and interest in spending by the various third level institutions.  We have discussed the Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, on a number of occasions.  I have been presented with an article from the <i>Evening Echo<\/i>which indicates that Cork Institute of Technology recently spent almost &euro;13,000 in marking the retirement of the outgoing president.  This information was provided as part of the freedom of information process.  There was &euro;5,000 spent on catering and &euro;3,000 on providing tables.  There were also pipes and drapes and other elements.  I propose that in view of current difficulties we write to Cork Institute of Technology for a detailed explanation as to why it felt it was appropriate to spend &euro;13,000.  The student hardship fund would have benefited more from the &euro;13,000 rather having than a banquet to celebrate a retiring official.

The HEA expects to be in a position to provide the information requested by the committee later this month.  We will note and publish the correspondence.<\/p> <p>  Item No. 775B is correspondence, dated 26 September, received from Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, director general of the Health Service Executive, HSE.  It includes the independent review of the cost associated with the care of \"Grace\" and the Deloitte report to which we referred.  Does any member wish to comment on it?  We are scheduled to meet representatives of the HSE on 26 October to discuss section 38 and section 39 organisations.  It might be worth having this matter as part of the discussion and engagement with the HSE on that day.  We will put it on notice that we will raise the specific matter at that meeting.  We will, however, have to be mindful of the work of the commission of investigation established by the Oireachtas.  We need to stick to that exact report.

As we will need a full day, people can schedule it at this stage.<\/p><p>The next item is No. 782B, correspondence dated 3 October in my name.  I forwarded a link to the Garda interim report as I did not think it had been formally sent to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I think we all got a copy of it so I have made sure that the committee received one.  We note that.  The Garda will feature on our work programme later on again.  <br\/><br\/>No. 783B is correspondence dated 3 October 2017 from HIQA providing some of the follow-up information requested last week.  The correspondence includes details of an error in staffing numbers in the business plan, a breakdown on source of concerns raised with HIQA, human resource risks and risk profiling in the organisation.  We will note that and await receipt of the full information.  Also, we will ask the Department of Health questions on that day.  I am sure that we will receive all of the information within the week.  <br\/><br\/>No. 788B is correspondence dated 4 October 2017.  I shall sigh with exasperation before I deal with this matter.  The correspondence is from the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, on the payment of moneys due to Console staff.  We awaited this item.  The Minister has pointed out that the liquidation is ongoing but, in the event that there is no money to pay staff, he considers it inappropriate to pay the money out of voted expenditure.  I think the committee has made its views very clear on this matter.  I wish to reiterate publicly the opinion that there is an onus on the Department to make an <i>ex gratia<\/i>payment to these individuals because a significant reason these people were not paid moneys due to them can be attributed to the lack of oversight by the HSE, in the first place, in terms of monitoring the Console organisation.  While we cannot force the Minister to take action, we again appeal to him to reconsider.  I propose that we do not let this matter go.  The Committee of Public Accounts will issue a report in the course of the coming month on various issues.  I think it is an issue that the committee will not stand back from.  I know, technically, there might be a point.  I think there have been other precedents where payments have been made and if there is a will, there is a way.  Can we agree to note his response?  Effectively we are saying we are not satisfied with his response.  We will examine the topic again but there it rests just for today.  <br\/><br\/>The next item is two documents, Nos. 790(i) B and 790 (ii) B, which have just come from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  They are on the screen but I have not had an opportunity to print them.  The documents update the committee on the audit status of the educational and training boards and third level colleges.  The documents can be viewed on the screen now and I suggest that we start at the top.  <br\/><br\/>Document No. 790(i) B clearly shows that the audits for 2015 have all been cleared until we reach the line that refers to Kildare and Wicklow where audit queries are still outstanding, Limerick and Clare has an audit &quot;in progress&quot; and Louth and Meath has &quot;audit queries outstanding.&quot;  Is that the end of the ETBs? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017100500002#B02200","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507190400,"counter":28,"content":"<p>No, there is more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017100500002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Let us scroll up the screen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017100500002#C00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507190400,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim is the other one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017100500002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The document shows that the audit for Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim is still being reviewed.

It is not our practice to have the Minister attend, but it should be considered in light of the level of importance attaching.  There is an omission.  On further consideration, the assistant commissioner for Dublin, Mr. Pat Leahy, could usefully contribute to this discussion.  One meeting would do it, but, if possible, we will need the Minister as well.  That would be my preference.  One meeting with Mr. Noel Waters, Mr. John Barrett and Mr. Pat Leahy would do it.  Perhaps it could be a morning session.  We would get the opportunity to put these issues on record.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that some of our colleagues are not present and that people might view pursuing this as being political.  However, there are tangible reasons for this to be of concern - value for money in the first instance.  Political considerations come second.  Previously, Deputy Cassells gave clear examples in the context of Meath.  I cited an example relating to Sligo whereby a Garda station that had been condemned was awaiting this process.  We received the interim report and there were media leaks over the weekend.  The committee was told approximately five times in a row that the criteria for opening and closing were exactly the same, but we have reason to believe that is not the case and there is a suggestion that the decision was based on population increases.  To follow on from Deputy Cassells's contribution at our previous meeting, County Meath has had precisely the same percentage increase that Dublin has had, namely, 5.9%.  It has suffered closures and downgrades to brass buttons and the Deputy cited an increase in crime levels there, yet these other Garda stations were opened.<\/p> <p>  A decent morning session of three hours - with the Minister present if possible, but certainly Mr. Waters, Mr. Barrett and Mr. Leahy - would be useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017100500002#D02400","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Deputy Cullinane indicated, but I will invite Deputy Kelly first because he has sent in correspondence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017100500002#D02500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I support Deputy MacSharry 100%.

Value for money and appropriate spending are major issues.  What was cited at the committee's meeting last week does not come across in the report that was released.  Some people would like to believe that the report put the matter to bed, but it did not.  The criteria that were outlined to us and those that were used, and the fact that the Department of Justice and Equality set the criteria, which is unacceptable, do not add up.<\/p> <p>  As to how certain stations were picked, there is the problem of the report referring to crime levels actually decreasing in an area where a station is to be opened but where the population is increasing.  If that is the case, then there are many Garda stations in areas where populations are increasing that will be opened.  Many others will have arguments for same.<\/p> <p>  I subscribe 100% to this request.  We can handle this in a morning or afternoon session, whichever the committee decides, but we cannot do it without the attendance of the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality.  He has many questions to answer and a considerable role to play.

I was away last week so I missed last week's exchanges, but it was more of the same: witnesses came in and gave their views, members asked questions and the witnesses were away on their toes.  Now we are looking for them to come back again, not, I hope, in order that we have the same exchange and the same one-day outing again, after which we are none the wiser.  When we say we want to put the matter to bed, what do we mean?  I see it this way - the central question being put was whether the reopening of one Garda station was a stroke.  That is the question people were asking.  Let us cut to the chase - that is it, or was the reopening based on evidence, proper process, proper procedures and so on.<\/p> <p>  We have a report and we should examine it.  The job of this committee is to come down one way or another on the practice, process and procedures followed.  This goes back to what I have been saying about all the work we do.  Again, people are coming before the committee for the sake of it.  We have our say, they have theirs, they are away and we and the public are none the wiser.  Either this was done right or it was not.  I believe the committee must look at the report and hear from the witnesses.  It does not have to be a big report; it can be a one or two page view of what we believe happened or did not happen.  However, there must be some conclusion, in my view.  Otherwise, what are we doing?  I would, therefore, put that caveat on people coming back in.  There is a logic to it.  I speak in an unbiased way because I do not know what the answer is, and it may well be that proper process and proper procedures were followed or that may not be the case.  Let us examine the matter and then let us adjudicate on it based on what we are here to do, which is to examine the practices, processes and procedures around the decision-making that led to the reopening of this Garda station.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017100500002#E00100","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":95,"content":"<p>The report is quite interesting.

There are issues regarding the refurbishment costs and there are other costs.

I warmly welcome the idea that we are taking a strategic approach if this is the new approach to the deployment of resources, but it has not happened before.  We also must understand what is the role of the Policing Authority, not to be crossing lines, because my understanding is that it has a role in the distribution of resources and I do not know whether it has been bypassed in respect of this initiative.  We need to separate the lines of our responsibility and value for money.  The refurbishment is one thing, but why are some stations picked out over others?  The area we need to consider is whether there is a value for money aspect to this.  The one thing we do not want to do is give the impression that we have a remit beyond the remit we do have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017100500002#E00600","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":100,"content":"<p>Deputy Murphy has on numerous occasions got to her feet and spoken of the policing issue in Kildare in precisely those terms, so I can vouch for that.  It is all set out on her record.  I think we are clear as to what is our remit.  It is public money and decisions to allocate, spend and discharge public moneys and the associated processes and procedures around that.  We are not proposing to stray beyond that, and we need to bring people back before the committee.<\/p> <p>  I broadly agree with the proposals to bring back those individuals who have been cited but, as my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, said, there must then be some outcome as a result.  I have read the report and I will go back and read it again to try to ascertain what kind of systematic application of criteria, if any, was in place and to get under the bonnet of that issue.  The reason that is important, including for this committee, is not simply in respect of this particular case study of decision-making, but also lessons that might be learned or advice that might be given regarding how work within the system happens generally.  There is a concept used in the North called targeting objective need, and to those right-minded among us it sounds sensible that one would target resources where they are needed.  It has not always been straightforward in Northern politics for many different reasons, but we have battled to get that concept embedded in decision-making processes.  As I was reading the report, I wondered to myself the extent to which this was about targeting objective need, or indeed the use of census data and so on, so I agree with Deputies Kelly, MacSharry and others that we need another session on this issue.  However, I would like it to be a conclusive session shaped in that way around the use of resources and decisions.  We should bear in mind that we are not just about counting up the pounds, shillings and pence; we also have a very specific duty and remit in respect of processes and procedures.<\/p> <p>  By the way, I had asked about the criteria used in the closure of stations and their provenance.  I do not think we have had a response to that, although the acting Garda Commissioner said he would get back to us on it.  I am broadly in agreement with the caveat that Deputy Cullinane has entered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017100500002#E00700","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":101,"content":"<p>It has all been said.

It has been said, and I will not repeat it, that we should not stray into the remit of the justice committee, which I think we are in danger of doing.  Our workload is heavy, so I suggest an afternoon session that does not interfere with the extremely important workload we have laid down.

A large part of it depends on the people coming before us and their not being smart or stonewalling us.  I agree with Deputy Connolly about the Department of Justice and Equality.  Its role in the Templemore issue is most pertinent in terms of this particular issue as well.

Many different angles have been covered and there has been a broad-ranging debate.  The committee must be clear and logical and ensure we get to a conclusion if we are revisiting this.  I propose that we agree what members have accepted but I want a detailed and specific proposal to be prepared this week by the secretariat for the committee to sign off on next week as to precisely what our agenda will be.  We will set the date for that meeting next Thursday.  I agree about the importance of logic.  At the risk of incurring the wrath of some members, there have been a few major gaps in the logic of what has been said.  The assistant commissioner, John O'Driscoll, wrote the report.  If anyone is to come before the committee, it should be him.  I am amazed that members have suggested people from further down the ranks should come in and discuss a report they may have had no involvement in writing.  One person wrote the report.  I find it inconceivable that he would not be the person invited to appear before the committee.  His name has not been mentioned by members so far, so there is a lack of clear thinking in what has been said this morning.  We will come back to it next Thursday with clearer thinking.<\/p> <p>  It was said that the decision to allocate money is not the function of the Committee of Public Accounts, it is a function of the line committee in respect of the Estimate in the Department.  Any cost to be incurred regarding Stepaside Garda station, staff moving there and so on will be incurred in 2018.  That is a matter for the Committee on Justice and Equality to consider and approve as part of its discussion of Estimates for 2018.  It is not the job of this committee to cut across an Estimates debate in another committee with regard to expenditure next year.  We do not have a role in approving Estimates of expenditure that might be spent in an area next week.  We must be clear on that.  We want to see the logic and process of how decisions that have been taken were implemented.  I make those points to ensure the committee is within its remit.  Future expenditure is not our job; that is politics and an issue for the Government, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or the Committee on Justice and Equality.  There has been a major gap in the process of how the Committee of Public Accounts has been acting on this issue recently, given there was a debate on this matter without anyone mentioning the author of the report.  I propose that we start with the person who wrote the report.  We are agreed that we are going to do it and will need a conclusion but I will ask the secretariat to put an exact paper before the committee next week that we can sign off on and know precisely what will happen.<\/p> <p>  I have been most disappointed recently by the Department of Justice and Equality because when the acting Garda Commissioner was here in July, he committed to issue the report in good faith.  When the Garda checked with the Department shortly thereafter, the Department blocked the issuing of the report.  The Taoiseach was asked about that last Thursday or Friday after our meeting.  He had no problem with the interim report being issued and that was done by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, last Saturday  Had the Department not interfered with the commitment given by the acting Garda Commissioner, the committee would have had the report in July and last week's controversy that the Department brought on itself, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Committee of Public Accounts and the political establishment would not have occurred.  The Department of Justice and Equality caused the problem from beginning to end.  From the day the acting Garda Commissioner appeared before the committee to the publication of the report it was the Department and the Department alone that stalled the issue and caused the problem.  Consequently, it must be asked why it sought to block a public commitment by a very senior Garda officer.  Members understand that we are going to do that and we will not discuss it any further.<\/p> <p>  We want a specific detailed paper so that we have an agenda, as members said, and will be able to start, show the logic of what we are doing and draft a report at the end of the process.  We want to be able to sign off it.  We will have that on our work programme next week.

The primary role of IDA Ireland is to attract foreign direct investment to Ireland.  It does this by promoting Ireland as an attractive location to potential investors through the payment of grant aid and through the development of industrial property which is readily available for use by potential investors.  The IDA received State grants of around &euro;155 million in 2016, representing 92% of the agency's total income for the year.  Its other income streams amounted to &euro;14 million and included profits on the disposal of assets, grant refunds and rental income.<\/p> <p>  The IDA&rsquo;s gross expenditure in 2016 amounted to &euro;160 million, including &euro;95.6 million in grants to enterprises in support of research and development activity, capital investment, employment and training; &euro;42 million spent on pay, pensions and administration; &euro;12.5 million on expenses related to the property portfolio and depreciation charges; and &euro;10 million on promotion activities.  In addition to its recurrent expenditure, the IDA expended &euro;15.4 million on property additions, including land purchases, site development and construction work on its property holdings.  At the end of 2016, the IDA&rsquo;s property portfolio had a net book value of approximately &euro;152 million.<\/p> <p>  The IDA revalues property based on reviews carried out internally or by independent valuers, as appropriate, where there are indications that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  Following the 2016 review, the IDA reversed part of the impairment charges on its property portfolio which had been recognised over the period 2008 to 2013.  The impairment charges reflected the effects of the downturn in the property market over that period and the reversal of the impairment charges, valued at &euro;36 million, reflects a general uplift in property values. <\/p> <p>  The financial statement for 2016 received an unqualified opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017100500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>Thank you.

As the Chairman mentioned, I am accompanied by Ms Mary Buckley, Ms Eileen Sharpe and Ms Regina Gannon.  The focus this morning is the financial statement for 2016.  I have submitted a detailed statement but do not plan to go through it in its entirety.  Instead, I will pick out some of the highlights.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has already outlined the functions of IDA.  To focus on 2016, IDA client companies created just under 19,000 jobs on the ground during the year across a range of sectors, with every region of Ireland posting net gains in jobs.  When job losses were taken into account the net increase in employment was just under 12,000.  The strong net job creation performance is a result of a very strong pipeline of new investments and lower job losses within the employment portfolio.  Losses as a percentage of the overall employment portfolio were at their lowest level in 19 years and IDA Ireland has endeavoured to minimise the impact of job losses through its client transformation programmes.<\/p> <p>  The number of investments secured during 2016 rose to 244 from 213 in the previous year.  The number of new name investments increased to 99 from 94 in the previous year.  There were 199,877 people employed in IDA supported companies at the end of 2016, the highest level in the history of the State.  In addition to direct employment, IDA estimates that an additional 170,000 jobs are supported indirectly by IDA client companies, representing a significantly wider economic impact.  This trades through to the overall drop in unemployment that we have witnessed, from a high of 15.2% to 6.1%, according to the latest figures published by the CSO on Tuesday.<\/p> <p>  The detailed briefing document makes reference to some significant investments in 2016.  Included among these are investments by Oracle, Credit Suisse, HubSpot, Amazon and Paypal.  There were also significant regional announcements during 2016.  Most important in that regard is the areas involved which included Dunboyne, Nenagh, Drogheda, Galway, Limerick, Cork, Clonee, Waterford and Tullamore, demonstrating a wide dispersal of investments.  This performance was produced against a backdrop of unprecedented geopolitical change, an underperforming European economy and intense competition from other jurisdictions for foreign direct investment, FDI.  Many of the projects won in 2016 were capital intensive.<\/p> <p>  FDI has a huge impact on the economy, as evidenced by the exports from Ireland, which totalled &euro;149 billion in 2015, the latest year for which data is available.  Expenditure by FDI companies in the Irish economy totalled &euro;18.8 billion, comprising &euro;10 billion on payroll, &euro;5.2 billion on Irish services and &euro;3.6 billion on Irish materials.  Significant research and development is also undertaken by these companies, the value of which totalled &euro;1.53 billion in the last year for which figures are available.  80% of corporation tax comes from FDI multinationals and 10% of direct employment in Ireland is now accounted for by multinationals.<\/p> <p>  IDA has a very ambitious strategy which was set out in 2015.  The target is very clear: 80,000 new jobs to be created in the economy over the period 2015 to 2019 and 900 new investments.  If delivered, this will bring total direct employment by FDI companies in Ireland to 209,000 people by 2019.  Last year, 2016, marked the second year of the implementation of the current strategy and cumulatively, over the first two years, the agency is well ahead of the targets in the strategy.  A key element of the strategy is a focus on increasing investment into regional locations.  We have set a target to increase investments in all regions outside of Dublin by 30% to 40% while also maintaining the high level of investment into Dublin.  This target is extremely challenging given the global trend towards FDI favouring large urban centres.  Regions which do not possess urban centres of scale pose a significant challenge in terms of attracting FDI.<\/p><p>Despite this, IDA Ireland is making steady progress in all regions.  However, it is important to note that investors ultimately make the decision on investment location.  Each region in Ireland posted jobs growth in 2016.  A total of 52% of all jobs created by IDA Ireland clients were based outside Dublin while 59% of all employment in IDA Ireland-supported companies is outside Dublin.  We continue to work with all regions on their offering through the development and implementation of regional action plans.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned, we have a property programme where we invest in turnkey property solutions to shorten the time it takes investors to set up.<\/p><p> A critical element of our strategy is continued strong focus on key sectors such as technology life sciences, pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and medical technologies, international financial services, media and content, engineering, business services, and food.  We will continue to target these sectors.  I have set out in my submission some of the changes that are happening in these sectors.  I do not plan to go through them now but I am happy to return to them later.<\/p><p> Ireland's value proposition is based on offering investors a safe and stable investment location with access to the EU market, an education and skilled workforce, an attractive environment where people want to live and work, a competitive, consistent and transparent corporate tax regime and an excellent return on investment.  This value proposition remains valid, but we have to re-emphasise different parts of it and work to improve others to remain relevant in the changing global environment.  There are always areas that need attention, including the current pressing issue of residential property supply.  The effective and speedy implementation of the Government's action plan for housing is extremely important from our perspective.  We have also highlighted some of the areas that the National Competitiveness Council has identified as requiring attention to safeguard Ireland's competitiveness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017100500002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Shanahan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I will stop Mr. Shanahan there as he is about to refer to Brexit.

Mr. Shanahan stated one of the key tenets of Ireland's value proposition is a consistent, transparent tax regime.  The decision by the Commission to initiate court proceedings against Ireland has sent shockwaves through government circles.  Relations will deteriorate between the Government and EU officials.  How do the chief executive officers internationally whom Mr. Shanahan deals with and the potential clients the organisation is working with who may feel threatened view this?  Are future deals threatened by what has transpired?  We can talk about our educated workforce, our position within the EU and the fact that we are an English-speaking nation, but, at the end of the day, as Mr. Shanahan has reflected on himself, tax is a major component of the offer on the table.

One statement in my opening address that I did not get to, which I would like to mention, is that it is the team of 320 people who work with me across the globe that deliver those results.<\/p> <p>  As members will have heard from Government spokespeople and the Minister for Finance yesterday, the Government believes it is an unnecessary step.  I am aware of the effort that has gone into recouping the &euro;13 billion from Apple and the work that has gone in from both sides to setting up the framework to allow that to happen.  I do not believe that anybody has been negligent and I believe that it is an unnecessary step by the Commission.  I also reiterate that the Commission's initial findings were unwarranted and unfounded and its own decision in this regard was internally contradictory.  This will be seen as more of the same.  It is the same issue rather than a new issue and, therefore, I do not believe that there will be a great level of renewed attention on this.  Our current and prospective investors are well aware of the Apple tax issue and they will see this as a playing out of this issue and the Commission's previous findings.<\/p> <p>  With regard to how that has impacted on investment, the results speak for themselves.  Investment has increased and we have seen no diminution in investment since the Commission announced its initial decision in respect of Apple and Ireland.  In the first half of this year, job approvals increased by 20% year on year and we have experienced the same high level of investment.  There is nothing to signal that this is causing an impact.<\/p> <p>  In my discussions with chief executive officers and senior leadership teams of companies, they are well aware of Ireland's position on this issue.  If anything, they believe what I said in my opening contribution, which is that we have a consistent, stable and transparent tax regime, and Ireland will continue to have that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017100500002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Shanahan"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Shanahan worried that it appears to be a case of playing hardball now?

At the outset, I refute the comments which he has attributed to Deputy Collins in respect of our behaviour having been reprehensible.  It has been in no way reprehensible.  A legal dispute exists between ConnectIreland and IDA Ireland.  ConnectIreland lodged a dispute notice with IDA Ireland in August 2016.  I will not comment on any aspect of that dispute or on any individual companies because it is a legal dispute.  However, I am happy to provide factual information.  The Deputy asked some factual questions.  I am happy to provide context.<\/p> <p>  The first thing to make clear, and to be fair to the Deputy he did so in his question, is that this is a programme operated by IDA Ireland for which ConnectIreland has the contract.  It is contracted to ConnectIreland to deliver.  Succeed in Ireland is an IDA Ireland programme.  We have a vested interest in ensuring that it works.  Our intent was to make it work.  The situation is that ConnectIreland received a commercial contract in March 2012.  It signed up to that contract and to some addenda.  The contract expired on 26 March this year.  IDA Ireland had extended the contract by one year to allow for an orderly wind-down.  The target of the Succeed in Ireland programme over the period was 5,000 jobs.  As of today, there are 544 jobs on the ground.  By way of information, 302 of those jobs are in Dublin and a further 30 are in Cork.  That means 61% of the jobs are based in Dublin and Cork.  The remaining 212 are spread across a small number of counties.  We have paid ConnectIreland more than &euro;2 million in respect of those jobs - &euro;2,270,000 to be precise.  Under the contract, IDA Ireland has also paid a termination fee to ConnectIreland in respect of 398 jobs which have yet to be created.  That termination payment was &euro;1,539,500.  If all of those 398 jobs are created, it will be great.  If more than 398 are created, we will pay ConnectIreland further.  If they are not delivered, we will recoup the moneys which we have paid to ConnectIreland.  The contract provides for all of this.<\/p> <p>  IDA Ireland has, at all times, behaved professionally in respect of the operation of this contract.  We have operated to both the spirit and the letter of the contract which we had in place, as we do in all our commercial dealings.  I remind the committee that IDA Ireland operates a huge number of contracts and partnerships across the public and private sectors to deliver jobs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017100500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Shanahan"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I will move on because I am short on time and there are some other areas which I want to address.  In his opening remarks and the reports which he has submitted to the committee, Mr. Shanahan put a lot of emphasis on the regional aspect.  It is an old chestnut for many public representatives and statutory bodies throughout the country.  Some statistics were included in the response to a parliamentary question which my party tabled some weeks ago which showed that of the 323 IDA Ireland site visits thus far this year, 155 or 48% took place in the capital.  Five counties, some of which still have excessively and stubbornly high rates of unemployment, received just one IDA Ireland visit so far this year.  Two counties, one of them my own county of Meath, received none.  In the sections of IDA Ireland's document, Winning: Foreign Direct Investment 2015-2019, which are specifically about the regions, it talks about the existence of clusters and critical masses of population and it sets out criteria in this regard.  The big thing for major centres and provincial towns is actually to create these clusters in the first instance.  If a commuter county on the edge of Dublin such as Meath is unable to achieve that, what hope is there for other counties?<\/p> <p>  When I look at the statistics and go through the list of counties which have only received one visit, I see Donegal, Monaghan, Offaly and Roscommon.  The report mentions the wins which were achieved in 2016.  It references Shire and Facebook. Is that the kind of thing we are looking at for the regions?  Mr. Shanahan knows exactly where those locations are.  They are right on the Border.  They are not beside the clusters of population the development plans set out to create.  Are back office facilities such as those being provided for Facebook all we can expect in the regions and the wider geographical area?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017100500002#L00400","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507190400,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Achieving balanced regional development is the single biggest challenge which IDA Ireland faces, but it is also the single biggest challenge which Ireland faces.

As the Deputy pointed out, two of the most significant investments last year, Facebook and Shire, were made in Meath.  Of course proximity to Dublin helps in that regard.  Site visits tells a part of the story, but they do not tell the whole story.  There could be one site visit to Meath, but it could be the right site visit.  We had a situation last year where one county received one site visit but got three investments.  It is part of the story.  It tells us that investors are interested in larger urban areas.

I say this in the context of being in the Gaeltacht area in Cork D&eacute; Luain - a comharchumann struggling for money.  Yesterday, we heard a presentation from a representative of the comharchumann - the co-operatives - pointing out issues and begging for money.  They create jobs and are getting a tiny amount.  I know IDA Ireland does very good work - certainly in Galway west.

I will be following it up specifically regarding proposals for the west of the city and Connemara.<\/p> <p>  In his opening statement, Mr. Shanahan made a very strong comment about corporation tax.  I have a different view.  I have looked at the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  He has given no opinion but has simply highlighted the fact that corporation tax receipts are highly concentrated and difficult to predict.  He goes on to point out that 70% of the receipts were paid by the top 100 and, more significantly, 13 of the 100 companies with the highest tax income had an effective rate of less than 1%.  Mr. Shanahan said today that the effective rate is much higher than that.

The question of regional development has been raised and I cannot let Mr. Shanahan go without mentioning issues in the south east.  It is one of two problematic areas, though I acknowledge that jobs have been created in recent years.  We had a much bigger problem five years ago, and we are in a much better situation now.  It is still a problem, however.  I am looking at the national unemployment figure of 6.4% and the figure for the south east of 8.1%.<\/p><p>Even within the figures there are variations and in parts of the south east the rate of unemployment is even higher.  I am constantly trying to figure out why that is the case.  I have talked to stakeholders, opinion makers, entrepreneurs and captains of industry in the south east and they all say the same thing, that there is no good reason the south east should have a higher unemployment rate.  I am trying to figure out the solutions.  This is very important because resources and infrastructure follow jobs.  We need to bring jobs to Ireland Inc. and that is the primary function of IDA Ireland.  Many jobs are brought to Dublin.  Of course, we have to build up the capital city, but if it overheats, it creates pressures in the areas of public transport, housing and rents, etc.  We need a counterbalance to it.  We have to identify such areas for that purpose.  Why does the south east have an unemployment rate much higher than in the rest of the State?  Is it due to skills shortages?  Is there a need for property solutions?  Is it due to the lack infrastructure?  As the hard analysis must have been made by IDA Ireland, I ask Mr. Shanahan to help me to understand why the south east is underperforming to the extent it is.  I am not dismissing the good work that has been done and know that Mr. Shanahan is going to say the number of jobs in the south east has increased.  I accept that, but the reality is that the unemployment rate in the region is higher than the national figure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017100500002#P08800","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507190400,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I will not go through the long list of FDI projects in the south east or the Deputy's county.

IDA Ireland looks at the unemployment figures and also meets companies which have to make decisions on where they should locate.  There is a need for support for the regions.

It can be seen in some places in the south east that where there is an institute of technology such as in Waterford, there is more investment and there has been more indigenous growth.  IDA Ireland is not the only arm of the State involved in industrial development, but one can see the benefit of an institute.  It is not important whether it is an institute of technology or a university, although a university has more cachet; it is what the institute does that is most important.  Where there are such institutes, one can see clusters emerging.  In practical terms, we had a property solution on the ground which we were able to sell to a pharma company very quickly to create jobs and we are about to do the same again.  That is how we start to build a cluster and we move on from there.  Other counties in the south east also have opportunities.  On Monday I addressed a financial services seminar in Gorey at which some very strong players were present with which we have the ambition to build a cluster.

It is a clear function of the Government and the Government and politicians will decide whether we should increase or decrease it.

This morning we heard the announcement that 50% of the announced jobs will be for people who will be recruited domestically and 50% will be for people who come in because of the language issues.

First, on Brexit, there are both challenges and opportunities from an IDA perspective.  It is not all upside.  There will be more investment, and we have seen some of that already as a result of Brexit, but 13% of the IDA portfolio is exposed to the UK in terms of exports.  Some &euro;19 billion euro worth of exports out of our client companies is to UK.  That represents a challenge and a risk.  It is a two-way street, as it is, obviously, for indigenous companies.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the challenge of residential housing and the impact it is having, I would say in the recent past it has not posed us a difficulty in marketing Ireland, which I think was the Deputy's question.  Ireland is still seen as very attractive, as evidenced by even just this week the number of announcements that have been made, such as Veritas announcing more than 200 jobs, Microsoft, whom the Deputy herself has referenced, announcing this morning an additional 200 jobs, and Fidelity International yesterday announcing 280 jobs.<\/p> <p>  If I just take the Fidelity International and Microsoft examples, Fidelity International has added 250-odd posts in the past 14 months, so I think the companies are comfortable that they can still scale in Ireland.  Similarly, Microsoft this morning confirmed that it has fulfilled 80% of its previous recruitment drive which was announced less than a year ago for 500 people, so the evidence on the ground would suggest there are a lot of good things happening.<\/p> <p>  Undoubtedly, residential housing is an issue.

The significant penalties will accumulate as a result of our failure to meet our renewables targets rather than our emissions targets.  We have a big job still to do in that area.  Deputy Dooley raised the matter of heat targets, which is 12% by 2020.  During the current year we have significantly ramped up capacity, both within the SEAI through current funding but also by significantly increasing capital funding by &euro;100 million this year.  There are two issues relating to it.  Of course we would like more money.  No Minster will say that he or she would not like more money, but there is also a certain level of capacity in the industry and the one thing that would help me would be a multi-annual programme.  In talking to the operators carrying out this work throughout the country, their major problem is that there are peaks and troughs.  They effectively have six months to carry out these works, from the day the scheme is launched, to the application going in, to it being approved through the SEAI, to the work is carried out and being accounted for by the end of the year.  The case that I have been making to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is for us to get a multi-annual budget in order that the process can be streamlined to keep people within that sector where the capacity has been built up and to exploit that fully.  We can do the programme more cost efficiently and in a more streamlined way, and we can deliver far more for the money we have allocated.<\/p> <p>  We need to look in broader terms at how we engage people to do deep retrofits, which is a challenge all over Europe.  If one could fund that, that would be the way to do it, but this Government does not have the capacity to do that on the scale that would be involved, nor will any future Government.  We are working with the European Investment Bank and have had a number of meetings with it on this matter to see how we can leverage people's capital or their capacity through a range of schemes.  Some people have access to capital so grant aid might suit them.<\/p><p>Others, especially families, do not have access to cash.  The issue, therefore, is whether the investment could be repaid over time through electricity bills.  We are considering a number of suites of measures and we have had some constructive discussions on the issue with the European Investment Bank, EIB.  There are 120 sustainable energy communities nationwide and we held a meeting with them in Longford earlier in the year to ascertain if we could have a more co-ordinated approach and if they could leverage this funding through the State.  Those discussions are ongoing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100500002#A01000","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507194000,"counter":442,"content":"<p>On the energy Estimate, the Minister referred to a meeting held in Boyle, County Roscommon, earlier in the year.  That meeting was useful in terms of the Brexit discussion.  Something similar could be done on energy because we must bring everyone with us, including all the political parties, business people, local authorities and members of the public, on this issue.  We need to create a movement to change our approach to energy use and production.<\/p> <p>  I note the total Estimate for the year increased by 28% to &euro;115 million, which clearly reflects needs.  A significant gap must be bridged.  The Minister indicated in the D&aacute;il yesterday that not only would we not reach our target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020, we would not even meet the other target mentioned, namely, a reduction of between 6% and 11%.  I understand the Minister stated the reduction could be as low as 4%.  Is that correct?  If so, that would be a serious concern.<\/p> <p>  On the electrification of transport, the ESB funds the installation of electric charging points, of which we need many more.  The parties are generally in agreement on these issues.  Who would fund an increase in the number of charging points given that the ESB is not Mother Teresa of Calcutta and will not continue to dish out money for this infrastructure?  If the ESB has a responsibility to do this, that would be fine, but as a commercial semi-State company, it will clearly want to achieve a return on any investment.  I ask the Minister to clarify the position in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Major changes will be needed in renewable energies.  From my meetings with people involved in the sector in the past 18 months, it is clear they have not yet started to consider microgeneration seriously.  The big players in the sector and the Government talk about the issue but it is time they started to act to advance microgeneration.  The future of renewable energy will not be a handful of sources of electricity generation.  The biogas project in County Kildare is being delivered by Mr. Costello.  We need to start similar projects nationwide.  Germany is taking this approach.  Britain, which is not viewed as a green nation, is ahead of us on energy.  As a country that is trying to develop a green image from a sustainability point of view and from the point of view of our agriculture and food production sectors, we must get ahead.  We have an oversized agriculture sector and we have not closed the circle.  We are producing much more milk and beef than previously.  I would like to see much more mixed farming.  From a sustainability point of view, we are in danger of crashing the car as we seek to meet our environmental obligations.<\/p> <p>  We have not even started to address the issue of slurry, which is being turned into dry fertiliser pellets in other countries.  Other than one or two projects, including the one to which I referred, we have barely started thinking about biogas.  We are heading for a crisis with the European Commission regarding pig slurry.  We have had a number of years to take action on this issue but have failed to do so.  Will the Minister outline his plans in respect of electric charger points and the agriculture issues I raised?<\/p> <p>  A great deal of good work has been done on retrofitting houses built in before 2007, including in 2004 and 2005.  While I do not argue against retrofitting these houses, the problem is that houses built in 1917 and 1920, the year the late Liam Cosgrave was born, are not being retrofitted because this is a much more difficult task.  Many of the people living in these houses are elderly and are experiencing fuel poverty.  These homes are affected most by heat loss and are the most expensive dwellings to heat.  I have raised this with every Minister in the past six and a half years.  I ask the Minister to deal with these houses.  While I accept that they are the most difficult and most expensive to retrofit, we must start to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100500002#B00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1507194000,"counter":443,"content":"<p>On fines, will the Minister update the joint committee on the position regarding the agreement with the European Union on greenhouse gas reduction targets for 2030?

The outcome of this assessment in negotiations with the Commission will affect the timing of the imposition of fines for our failure to act on climate change.  What is the state of negotiations with the Commission on this issue?  When will they be finalised?  I understand this is a key issue in terms of what fines we may face.<\/p> <p>  On the energy support schemes, I understand the Government is still providing grants for gas-fired heating systems.  If that is the case, when does the Minister intend stopping this practice?  It is long past time that support for fossil fuel systems ceased because it is no longer justifiable, regardless of how efficient the system.  We must move towards systems that produce zero carbon and do not use fossil fuels.  Why are grants being provided for anything connected with fossil fuels?  To give another example, the Department funds scholarships for fossil fuel training in colleges.  Will these students work in an industry that will no longer exist in 30 or 40 years?  Why are we still supporting fossil fuels?

He is right when he argues that there is a great deal of merit in having a much broader debate.  This suggestion which was made on foot of the White Paper is now encompassed in the national dialogue on climate change.  I agree with the Deputy that there needs to be a debate on a myriad aspects of this issue.  The country's renewable energy policy is being reviewed.  Deputy Eamon Ryan was probably Minister at the time when we put all of our eggs into one basket, in effect.  We made significant progress by putting the focus on wind energy, but many other new technologies have become available since.  Solar photovoltaic technology is one such example.  Now is the time to look at such technologies and get the public to engage with them.  There needs to be a far broader debate on this issue.<\/p> <p>  I would like to respond to what was said about statistics and targets.  Prior to last year, the EPA projected that Ireland's reduction in greenhouse gas emissions up to 2020 would be somewhere between 6% and 11%.  Earlier this year it announced that it had revised that forecast downwards.  It now states that based on the level of growth in the economy - as we move forward we have to separate the direct link between economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions because we cannot maintain it - its projection is that the reduction on 2005 levels will be somewhere between 4% and 6%, rather than 20%.  That is from where the figures are coming.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan asked a question about fines.  We cannot be definitive because of the myriad of complexities in this regard.  If we do not hit our renewable energy targets, we are looking at fines in 2020.  Deputy Eamon Ryan has asked about what will happen after 2020.  Depending on the starting point, we could be looking at recurring fines on an annual basis between 2020 and 2030.  While there is no dispute about where we need to get to by 2030, the starting point will have a significant impact for us in Ireland.  Two or three other member states have a similar issue, but it is particularly dramatic for us in Ireland.  If the starting point is our outturn for 2020, it will mean that rather than paying fines in 2021, 2022 and so forth, we will be able to put that money into deep retrofits and supports for renewable energy projects.  The argument I have made to the Commission and my colleagues at Council level is that it would make far more sense, not just for Ireland but also for other member states, to spend that money to reduce our overall greenhouse gas emissions rather than in paying fines.  The negotiations are ongoing.  I will be in Luxembourg on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of next week for further engagement on the matter at Council level.  The Council has not yet come up with a negotiating position to engage in the trilogue with the European Parliament which, as members will be aware, has already agreed its approach to the matter.  If the European Parliament's position is the accepted one at the end of the negotiating process, Ireland will pay significant fines from 2021 onwards.  That money would be far better spent in carrying out the deep retrofitting about which we have been talking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100500002#C00300","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1507194000,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Will it be a qualified majority vote or do we have a veto?

It is an ongoing process.<\/p> <p>  Senator Joe O'Reilly raised the issue of community microgeneration.  In fairness, Deputy Eamon Ryan has on a number of occasions pushed the idea of having an energy community.  There is the basis for such an approach.  I was asked for my views on the co-operative movement.  As a country, we have been wrong to move away from it.  The co-operative movement could be very beneficial for many aspects of society in Ireland, including this one.  Our policy on sustainable energy communities involves a co-operative approach.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is pushing this through 120 groups in communities across the country and we want that number to increase.  A co-operative approach is the best one to take in this context.<\/p><p>The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, is an organisation that could do this.  Traditionally the co-operatives were seen very much in the agricultural sphere but we have a very successful co-operative in County Roscommon that organises home help, the Roscommon Home Services, RHS Home Services, which is a thriving business.  There are many opportunities for a similar model in the energy area.  <\/p><p> In respect of microgeneration, we have an engagement with the stakeholders and people who are interested in this area on 17 October, which is being organised by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI and my Department.  I would encourage my colleagues who are present to attend and participate in that event and to encourage other interested groups to get involved in it because we now need to deal with these issues.  I am very anxious to support the microgeneration of energy.  We had initially included it in the renewable electricity support scheme. There are a number of complexities that will be teased at this event but I want to try to run microgeneration in tandem with that.  I think the suggestion that Deputy Ryan has made in the past and Senator Joe O'Reilly has made here today is a way that we can overcome some of the challenges.<\/p><p> On grants, there has been a 50% increase in the funding for energy this year.  I got a significant increase in that, some &euro;100 million is available this year.  Senator O'Reilly asked whether we are below profile but that comes back to questions from Deputies Ryan and Stanley in regard to older homes.  We targeted 500 houses for a deep retrofit, spending somewhere between &euro;20,000 and &euro;30,000 per house, carrying out a deep retrofit on fuel poverty homes in particular and the broader aspect of communities experiencing fuel poverty.  It has not taken off as quickly as we had hoped.  A great deal of work had to be done in respect of it and we are below profile specifically because of that.  Deputy Stanley is correct that we are trying to do far more significant retrofits on older homes.  We have done a lot of the low hanging fruit in respect of retrofits.  One in five homes in the country has had a retrofit carried out on them, supported in one way or another by the State, but now we need to go back and do deep retrofits of many of those homes.  We are also looking at the rental sector and what can be done.  That is a particularly challenging area that we need to look at.<\/p><p> Under a well-being scheme, we have done significant deep retrofits on homes in the Dublin area.  We established a pilot scheme and we have targeted people with COPD initially.  We are now looking at families with children with asthma and we have had very positive anecdotal evidence from the pilot to date that people are more comfortable in their homes, yes their homes are more energy efficient but we are finding that those people are getting sick less, they are presenting at hospital less, their stay in hospital is shorter and there is a significant health benefit in respect of that.  I hope we will have empirical evidence by the end of the year on those results which I hope will justify ramping up the capacity.  This comes back to the issue I raised earlier in regard to multi-annual budgeting.  <\/p><p> Deputy Stanley also raised the issue of agriculture.  I am sure many members were in Mount Street yesterday at the discussion on the Mercosur talks.  I spoke to Commissioner Phil Hogan on the issue of carbon leakage.  We see it in industry.  Neighbours of Deputy Dooley in Limerick speak about carbon leakage, but we do not speak about it in relation to agriculture.  A far broader debate needs to take place on carbon.  We are making progress in the area.  We have engaged in the largest genotyping project in the world and have now genotyped 1 million beef animals in the country and that gives us a basis to improve beef production, reduce the overall carbon footprint yet a significant amount of work still remains to be done in the area.  We are moving in the right direction.<\/p><p> Senator O'Reilly spoke about France and Deputy Ryan raised the supports we are providing, not just what we are supporting.  We are considering solarPV which has not been supported up to now.  The SEAI is reviewing all of those grant supports, the current rates, the technologies that are supported and will make an announcement shortly.  The objective in the general grant scheme is to grant aid one third of the cost, with two thirds coming from the household.  The SEAI is reviewing those costs, if I can secure a multiannual budget, we can build up the capacity in the country which should help to drive down the cost in that area.<\/p><p> I think have addressed most of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100500002#C00700","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507194000,"counter":453,"content":"<p>The Minister has answered comprehensively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100500002#D00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1507194000,"counter":454,"content":"<p>This is a lovely building.

What is coming across is that it is very aspiration for the Minister to include remarks such as: \"embracing new technologies for communities, and smaller microgeneration, but on the other hand that is not the evidence of what is done.  Less than a year ago, I tabled an amendment to the Minister's Bill to allow small communities access to the national grid and he argued vociferously and hard against it.  The majority voted against it.  Yet in his response to my question he outlines the facilitation of grid access for community-led projects; ring-fencing of capacity for community-led projects; and the establishment of community benefits register.  He does not respond by actually doing things that will give the community the idea that the Department is interested in its needs.  For example, the Minister voted against the recent Sinn F&eacute;in Bill on the regulation of turbines.  What that Bill was attempting to do, in my view, was to give communities reassurance that they were not going to be imposed upon by ginormous wind farms up against their homes and their farms and that there would be some kind of tight regulation on how the major commercial interests in the energy field would be regulated and controlled.  The communities are not getting the reassurance at all, except in the very nice language used in written answers.  Nothing is being done in fact to reassure communities that the Minister is interested in them having a role and buy-in to renewable energy in this country.  I think unless we get that buy-in, understanding and support and trust between Government policy and local communities we will not do anything except facilitate commercial renewable energy technologies.<\/p> <p>  There were interesting reports in the media about farmers in County Offaly having to block Element Power from continuing to construct these ginormous 169 m high turbines near their land.  I do not think the Minister would like to live beside these turbines and neither would I, and when local people object to them, they are being called NIMBYists who are stopping progress.  On the other side, if other local communities try to buy in to producing their own energy and gain access to the national grid, that is also being blocked by the Minister.<\/p><p>I therefore see his policy as full of holes and contradictions.<\/p><p> I would like the Minister to spell out to us how the new renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, will help local communities buy into renewables because that is absolutely the future.  Perhaps sometime we could invite someone from the energy department in Germany, where they are doing this correctly, regulating it correctly and having a huge level of success, to tell us a few things about how we could do things differently in Ireland.  We are blessed on this island as far as nature is concerned with the amount of access to natural renewable energy we have.  Compared to a country such as Germany, we should be way ahead instead of way behind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100500002#D00500","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507194000,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Smith.

I listened to some of the contributions.  I apologise for being late.  I had another commitment coming into the Chamber.  I never expected to be speaking in this Chamber - certainly not so soon.  I know some of our colleagues on the committee, such as Senator Leyden, have had esteemed careers in the lower House before progressing to the Upper House and that Deputy Dooley did this in reverse.  I am sure many Members have made that journey.  I think Senator O'Reilly has as well.  There is a lot of movement.  I will not predict the future for myself, but it is a pleasure to be here in such august surroundings.  The Chamber looks very well in its new home.<\/p> <p>  Back on topic, I want to inquire into and express a few opinions on the Government's energy policy and the whole energy spectrum.  I listened with interest to Deputy Smith's comments and I certainly sympathise with much of what she said.  The wind industry in particular is controversial, and I know the Minister knows this from his own constituency no less than nationally, but I hope there is a sense of consensus emerging.  We struggle with the reality that the communities affected closest to wind turbines in particular struggle.  I have seen this at first hand and do not think the wind developers and some of their practices we have seen can be condoned in any shape or form.  They have come in and rode roughshod over local communities, with a complete lack of consultation, driven neighbour against neighbour and been responsible for all sorts of sharp practices.  There was a suggestion that the main wind farm in my constituency of Kildare north, bordering into Meath - I serve Meath as well - was an attempt to sterilise the entire two counties because it was such a widespread farm and was not necessarily a strategic imperative in terms of energy production but was perhaps an attempt to get in there and wipe it out before someone else could do it.  There were all kinds of misdemeanours at play there.  I hope we are seeing a consensus emerge on the committee and more widely that renewable energy in different forms is the way to go.  I think the technology of offshore wind is becoming a little more affordable and that solar is beginning to emerge and seems to be less controversial with local communities - so far anyway.  Time will tell.  We have heard talk of biomass, although I am not sure it is viable, considering the raw product required to go into it.  Then there is wave energy, in respect of which I understand there are difficulties in terms of technology.  However, as technology progresses, I hope we can make that journey.<\/p> <p>  We have seen the likes of Portugal, Spain and some of the other Mediterranean countries, which of course enjoy greater access to solar energy than we do, make great strides and, I think, go energy-negative in terms of pricing a few times.  Some of them have run out of renewables for a few days at a time, which is quite unprecedented and very welcome.  Deputy Smith mentioned Germany and other countries and how they operate.  When a few of us from this committee travelled to the renewable energy conference about a year ago in Copenhagen, that was one of the topics we discussed with parliamentarians from around Europe.  We sometimes think Ireland is unique, our situation is very different and we are against all these things when everyone else is for them, but in fact when we discussed the matter with other members of parliament from around the EU, we discovered that it is almost the same everywhere and that no community welcomes a renewable energy project on its doorstep, whether it is central Europe, Scandinavia, the Mediterranean or, indeed, the midlands in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  However, what they have done right and what seems to enjoy greater appeal or greater acceptance is where there is a far greater degree of local involvement, participation and dividend for wind projects.  For example, along the Scandinavian coastline, where there are little self-sustaining communities, there is a small wind farm that has the support and encouragement of the local community and there is a direct dividend in terms of both share options or share ownership schemes and energy credits.  Therefore, if one lives near the wind farm and is involved in its production or involved in it in some other way or impacted in some way, one enjoys a credit on one's energy prices or even a share certificate which can be cashed in sometime or passed on to one's estate if one wishes to do so.  There may be some lessons to be learned from that.<\/p> <p>  I looked at the estimates and the figures.  I am concerned about the implications.  The whole difficulty with this is that we are trying to toe a fine line between being sympathetic to local concerns and yet meeting our climate change targets.  I do not have the date of the meeting, but in a previous committee hearing we heard from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, which suggested that for each percentage point below 16% we fell in respect of our overall target, we would be fined in the region of between &euro;100 million to &euro;150 million.  Therefore, if we fell short by one percentage point, we could be looking at a &euro;150 million fine, and if we were down by ten percentage points we could be looking at a &euro;1.5 billion fine.  I ask the Minister, or perhaps his officials, whether he has any view at this stage or, even better, any figures as to how we are looking for our 2021 targets.  Are we potentially looking at fines in excess of &euro;1 billion and, if so, what might they be or where exactly are we positioned in that space?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100500002#E00300","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speech","time":1507194000,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister to answer Deputy Smith's and Deputy Lawless's questions before we move on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100500002#E00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1507194000,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I will deal with the straightforward question first and then come back to the broader comments made by Deputy Smith and Deputy Lawless.  Our overall renewable energy target for 2020 is 16%.  For energy efficiency it is 20%, for renewable electricity it is 40%, for renewable heat it is 12% and for renewable transport it is 10%.  The 10% target is legally binding; the overall 16% target is legally binding; the others we can chop and change, so to speak.  Based on the current trajectory, it is expected that we will come in at 13.2% but, with policy implementation between now and 2020, we hope to come in at somewhere between 15% and 16%, so that is what we are working towards at present.  Currently, based on 2016 figures published by the SEAI, we are at 9.4%.  They are the answers to those questions.<\/p> <p>  I take the point that Deputy Lawless made about examples across Europe where they have run on 100% renewable energy for a day or two but I think people fail to realise that Ireland is actually a global leader in this.  It is not acknowledged.  Today we can take a 60% loading of variable renewable energy, which is wind in the main, on our grid, an isolated grid.  There is no country in the world, no grid in the world, that can take that potential loading.  Yes, across Europe they have had 100% renewables on a particular day but they are networked into other grids.  They can do that.  They can manage that variability quite easily because they are concerned with a Europe-wide grid.  We have an isolated grid here.  It is known globally as the Irish problem.  We have already tested it on a loading of 65%.  That will go live in the new year.  Again, we will be the global leader in this regard, and our objective is by 2020 - in order to take 40% renewable electricity onto the grid, 36% of which is projected to be wind - to be able to manage a potential loading at any one time in the grid of 75% variable electricity.  It is called the VS3 project and we expect to be doing that by 2020.  Globally, everyone is looking to Ireland as to how we are doing this.  There was a major international conference in Trinity College earlier this year to which all the grid operators from around the world came because they want to see what we are doing here.  We have departments of energy all over Europe and across the globe visiting us to see what we are doing here, so we are a global leader.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100500002#E00500","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1507194000,"counter":462,"content":"<p>We are a global leader in terms of grid management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100500002#E00600","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1507194000,"counter":463,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p> <p>  Coming back to the broader question that Deputy Smith and Deputy Lawless asked about the communities aspect of renewable energy, I was appointed 16 months ago as Minister and I think in the first interview I gave I made this very point: that we need to engage with communities more and we need to broaden the renewable energy portfolio and not put all our eggs into one basket.  I think that interview came two days after my appointment.  I accept what Deputy Smith says.<\/p><p>However, she does not have the facts and maybe there has been a weakness on my part in failing to explain what we have done in the past 16 months.  These are on the Department's website.  One of the first things I did as Minister was to tell the Department that we needed to review our renewable energy policy because I have always felt we were putting all our eggs into one basket.  The review is ongoing and is looking at the broad range of renewable energy technologies, not just wind.  I agreed a new code of practice with the wind industry, to which it signed up at the end of last year and which incorporates a clear complaints procedure, a process in which there is level of engagement with local authorities and a requirement for the industry to report, on an annual basis, on how it dealt with complaints.  This addresses the problems with existing wind farms, some of which I have personally experienced.  The industry has written to each Member of the Oireachtas stating that there is now a dedicated email for Deputies, Senators and councillors to engage with the code of practice.  It was not easy to agree but we agreed it and I acknowledge the work of my Department and the industry in doing so.<\/p><p> The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has started an engagement to put a community gain proposal in place.  The challenge is how to put something in place that is real and tangible but also has the flexibility to deal with different measures in different communities.  One community may wish to buy into a wind farm or another renewable energy proposal that has been proposed.  In other areas, the community may want to develop an enterprise hub or a tourism project.  I told the SEAI that I wanted to see a community dividend that has a long-term economic benefit to the community beyond the renewable energy project.  The SEAI has published its report and there is now a consultation process as part of the renewable electricity support scheme.  I look forward to the input of the public in this regard.

Any project developer looking for funding under the new renewable electricity scheme has to comply with the new community engagement and community dividend conditions.  The renewable electricity support scheme is out for public consultation at the moment and the closing date is also next month.  Communities are very much to the fore in this process.  We have spoken to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, about giving priority access to the grid for community-led projects.  It is within the commission's competence, not mine, but I have expressed the views of members of the joint committee.  The commission is accountable to the committee, and not to me as Minister, so I suggest the committee invite the Commission for Regulation of Utilities to come before the committee to make their point.  I have expressed my views and they are built in to the renewable electricity support scheme, as they are built into the proposals that come out in the new scheme when it is adopted early in the new year.<\/p> <p>  Sustainable energy communities are all about developing capacity in communities across the country to put forward their own proposals or to engage with the promoters of such proposals, of which there are 120 across the country.  I addressed them in Longford earlier this year and they are an integral part of driving the agenda.  New wind energy regulations are out for public consultation at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith also asked about the Private Members' Bill that was proposed last week.  I am opposed to that approach for a number of reasons.  Setback refers to the nearest single turbine and not a wind farm so it is the same whether one turbine is being built or 50 are being built.  I do not think that is right.  A wind farm of 50 turbines will have a far bigger impact on a community than a single turbine and this is why the approach we are taking is one based on noise.  I look forward to Deputy Smith's input into the consultation.  The noise criterion takes into account not just the proposed wind farm but all the existing wind farms whereas the Sinn F&eacute;in legislation cannot do so.  The system we are proposing is far more robust.  We have taken the World Health Organization standards for night-time noise, which are lower than for daytime noise, and are applying them on a 24-hour basis.  We will put the regulations in place and will give the Environmental Protection Agency the resources and teeth to ensure that if a new wind farm breaches the new standards it will be shut down until it complies with them.  I am looking forward to the input of the public in the consultation.  By using noise as the primary factor, we deal with wind farms and not just a single turbine as happens with the setback approach.<\/p> <p>  I have written to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to say we need guidelines to assist local authorities in respect of solar farms.  One of the first actions I took as Minister was to sign an international agreement with seven other EU and EEA member states on the North Sea's ocean energy technology development, allowing us to share capacity research across the Irish Sea and the North Sea.  We are one of the global leaders in research in this area, with the MaREI centre developed in conjunction with Science Foundation Ireland, and a number of international investors have been in contact with the Department in recent weeks on the subject of the deployment of ocean energy renewables here.  I want to broaden the renewable energy suite and not just look at one area.<\/p> <p>  A microgeneration meeting is taking place on 17 October where we will look at how we can best support microgeneration deployment, whether for roof-top solar or communities generating their own renewable energy.  The SEAI and the Department are leading this.<\/p><p>I reject that we have not brought communities to the fore on this.  What I have done in the past 16 months can be seen in the material published on the Department's website.  As Deputy Smith said, there is a long way to go on this issue.

Ireland could potentially face fines of over &euro;1 billion if it does not meet certain targets and based on current performance it appears unlikely to meet them.  It is important to note that if the State is on the hook for &euro;1 billion or &euro;500 million that would certainly have an impact on future Estimates and is very pertinent to the debate on Estimates and budgetary implications.  I am a little confused because the Minister said that we are currently at a figure of 9.4% but also mentioned 13.2%.  If I understand him correctly, one figure refers to renewable energy sources and the other to energy efficiency.  We have to get to 16% in both cases so it seems a leap must be made.  The Minister discussed how that might be done and how we might get to or close to 15%, although that would still be 1% less than the targets and could mean a fine of &euro;100 million.  However, better that than a fine of &euro;1 billion.

However, because we are considering noise rather than setback they may be considered when a new application comes in for a wind farm.  There are several wind farms in the midlands, which is the neck of the woods Deputy Stanley and I are from.  If one of those wind farms submits a new application, that must take into account the noise generated by the existing wind farm.  Depending on wind direction, there can be a mutiplier effect in relation to the new project based on noise from the existing wind farm.  That is how it will be taken into account.  It cannot be retrospectively applied to projects that are already operational but if a new project is applied for account will be taken of the impact of existing wind farms in the area.<\/p> <p>  The difficulty with Deputy Stanley's Wind Turbine Regulation Bill  is that it relates to setback rather than noise.  The approach of the Government is very different in that regard.  The guidelines go into that issue in great detail.<\/p> <p>  Deputies Lawless and Eamon Ryan asked about the penalties Ireland could face on not reaching its renewable energy targets.  Deputy Lawless is right to say they could potentially be &euro;1 billion but they will not be anywhere near that and I will momentarily address that issue.  There was a 50% increase in the voted energy budget this year.  I will be pushing for further increases in the coming years.  The current priority is to get a budgetary commitment over several years because it is important to show an upward trajectory in it and significant investment must be put in in the coming years.  Regardless of fines, that investment is needed.<\/p> <p>  The 2020 renewable energy target for Ireland is 16%.  As of 31 December 2016 we had achieved 9.4% and, therefore, have 6.6% to make up by the end of 2020.  Based on the current trajectory, it is estimated we will achieve 13.2%.  We are considering the policy measures that will take us up to the 16% target by 2020.  Deputy Ryan asked how much of that will be accounted for by increasing the mandatory requirement for biofuels in petrol.  While I am open to correction, that will be approximately 3% between now and 2020.  We are currently at 5% on our renewable transport target and expect a further increase of 3%, most of which will be made up by biofuels.<\/p><p>We are also looking at how we can ramp up capacity in the area of EVs in the coming years and we are in negotiation with the Minister for Finance on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100500002#G00700","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507194000,"counter":477,"content":"<p>We are now moving on to programme D - natural resources.

It was a kick in the face to do this when we had shut down and the committee and the D&aacute;il had gone.  The Minister of State made the announcement without flagging it to us in advance, and this is part of a policy that flies in the face of everything we have been talking about in respect of climate change, saving the planet and delivering on our targets.  Any old eejit in science could tell us we need to stop extracting fossil fuels, but the Minister of State has licensed an exploration in the Porcupine Basin where there may be twice as much as in Corrib, despite the latest results which do not look good but about which I am not convinced.<\/p> <p>  If it is in the ground, leave it there.  That is the general philosophy for dealing with climate change but we seem to have every intention of extracting it.  On top of that, we have passed an anti-fracking Bill, which effectively meant we should leave something in the ground if it was on land.  There was serious opposition to an amendment that would have extended the Bill to offshore resources, with people saying it would delay the Bill, which was sponsored by Fine Gael and supported by us.  Doing so would have meant the plan to grant this licence, which was already signed, sealed and delivered and announced after the D&aacute;il closed, would have been scuppered.  It is extremely disappointing and flies in the face of any attempt to deal with climate change in this country, so I ask the Minister of State for an explanation.  I had a question for him yesterday but I was not able to be in the D&aacute;il when the Minister of State took questions, although I believe Deputy Boyd Barrett took one of the questions for me.  I got a written answer from the Minister of State but it does not address my question at all.

There has been a reduction in the forecast to 6,000 km in 2017 because the works in 2017 have taken place in Galway and Mayo, much more mountainous terrain and prone to inclement weather conditions.  Low-flying aircraft need clear skies so there were time delays in the work.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Smith asked about oil.  Energy security deserves a full debate and my Department has been in contact with the Chairman of the committee in this regard.  Subject to the work programme, the subject deserves fuller research in the context of renewables, oil and gas and offshore exploration.  The licence was signed by me in July.  A lot of research is held in the Department on active licences, and the 2015 Atlantic oil and gas exploration licensing round was launched in June 2014, which opened all Ireland's major Atlantic basins, Porcupine, Goban Spur, Slyne, Erris, Donegal and Rockall, for licensing.  The form of petroleum authorisation on offer was a two-year licensing option, and 43 applications were received from 17 companies by the close of the round in September 2015.  As at 30 June 2017, there were 65 extant and active offshore petroleum prospecting licences, licensing options, exploration licences, lease undertakings and petroleum licences.  An application to drill from Providence Resources was also received and the overall assessment of the proposed exploration well comprised three key elements: a technical review of the proposals, undertaken by the petroleum affairs division of the Department; an environmental review, undertaken by BEC Consultants, an independent consultancy appointed by the Minister; and a financial review to ensure compliance with section 22 of the Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety (Amendment) Act.<\/p><p> First of all, no oil or gas was found at that site, which has now been plugged.  The drilling ship has left and the survey has ended.  No application for approval to drill will be granted unless the Commission for Energy Regulation has issued a safety permit and approved a safety case and the Irish Coast Guard has approved an emergency response plan and an oil spill contingency plan.  The marine safety policy division of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Irish Coast Guard, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, the Marine Institute, the Department of Defence, the Department of Justice and Equality, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health and Safety Authority, the Commission for Communications Regulation, the Commissioners of Irish Lights, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Irish Aviation Authority, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the underwater archaeological unit of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht are notified in the case of any application to grant approval to drill.  Permission to place a temporary well head and associated infrastructure on the seabed is also sought under section 5(2) of the Continental Shelf Act 1968.<\/p><p> I would like to comment on the larger question.  I appreciate that we got cross-party support for the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Prohibition of Onshore Hydraulic Fracturing) Bill 2016, which was proposed by Deputy McLoughlin.  During all debates on the Bill, I said we do not support a prohibition on offshore fracking or on offshore oil exploration.  This is an issue of energy security in the first instance.  If oil or gas were discovered anywhere off the coast, it is likely that it would take a decade for that oil or gas to be brought onshore.  Even if it were never brought onshore, the knowledge of its presence would provide energy security in an uncertain world.<\/p><p> The Government's energy White Paper acknowledges that irrespective of everything that is going on, Ireland will continue to rely on fossil fuels until 2050.  At present, 45% of our energy usage comes from natural gas.  While much of that gas is imported, some of it comes from the Corrib field.  The Kinsale and Seven Heads fields are winding down and will cease production soon.  This country is continuing to rely on natural gas, in particular, to meet its energy requirements.  In the absence of the knowledge that we have an offshore source of natural gas, which would provide energy security for this country, we rely on imports from Norway via the UK, which could become more complicated as a result of Brexit.  We have to look at the energy interconnector to France that may be in the pipeline up to 2025.  That would mainly import nuclear energy from France.  There is a wider debate to be had about energy security, the use of oil and gas and the question of renewables.  All the information about licensing is provided on the website.  I am aware that additional information about the application has been provided since the granting of permission for the well.  I hope the committee will engage in research about energy security.  It should bring in representatives of industry, Friends of the Earth, An Taisce and the international energy authority to discuss fully what is happening on a global scale and on an Irish scale with regard to oil and gas use.<\/p><p> Senator O'Reilly asked about mining.  I passed on information about the current application in his local area to him and to other Members of the Oireachtas yesterday.  There are legacy issues relating to mines.  Thankfully, the level of environmental requirements to be met by any new application surpasses anything that has happened in the past.  Notwithstanding the legacy issues in places like Avoca and Silvermines, we should also look at the exemplary Boliden operation at Tara Mines near the Senator's locality, which employs more than 500 people.  The highest environmental regulations are observed at the mine in terms of safety, resources and the tailings facilities.  The application in the Senator's locality is at an early stage of advancement.  It is an application for a prospecting licence rather than an application for mining.  For mining to happen, a full planning process involving environmental assessments and, most likely, oral hearings will have to be completed.  Under new regulations, remediation of mining sites is part of any planning application.  Any company that may be granted a mining licence in the future has to provide a fund to ensure some of the problems that arise in this industry can be remediated.  We are familiar with the problems that have arisen in the past at Silvermines, Avoca and other sites.<\/p><p> Deputy Lawless spoke about the circular economy, which we supported in the recent minerals development Bill.  On the question of looking again at old sites, I have expressed concerns about the practicality of such a move rather than the concept itself.  As it happens, I went to Silvermines last Monday to attend a public meeting of the community there, which is dealing with legacy issues in the locality.  The Department is engaging with the community and spending money on remediation.  I suggest that any talk of looking again at tailings facilities with a view to reactivating them should be considered with caution.  There would be huge opposition to any suggestion that the tailings facilities in Gortmore, for example, could be remined.  During the 1980s and 1990s, local people endured wind blows and felt that they suffered the impacts on human and animal health and on farms.  I appreciate that the amendment we proposed was supported by the Irish Centre for Research in Applied Geosciences.  I know the Deputy has done a lot of research with the centre.  This could certainly be considered on a small scale.  Any proposal would have to be contingent on public support in the local community before it could be looked at.  I will get the Deputy a fuller update on the steps that have been taken to date.<\/p><p> I will also have to look for an update on the oceanography institute because I do not have the latest information.  The Marine Institute is doing exceptional work as part of the INFOMAR project, which involves important work to update the seabed mapping programme.  A great deal of the offshore work has been done.  There is now a concentration on inshore work, which is slower and more complicated.  This project will provide us with some valuable information, particularly with regard to marine safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100500002#H00800","speaker":"1314","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507194000,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I would like to make a comment and a request.  My precise point is that we are so reliant on fossil fuels that we should not see our future as a continuation of what we are doing now.  As we try to deal with climate change, surely we have to factor an energetic and well-funded ambition to move away from fossil fuels into what is going to happen over the next ten or 15 years.  There is no evidence of such an ambition.  This is the problem with everything we do here.  The evidence of a commitment to renewable energy in this committee and in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is not strong enough.  The Minister of State says and writes wonderful things, but I am sorry to say it is just rhetoric.  Where is the evidence that we are actually driving ahead with a determined attempt to get renewables to the top of the agenda?  Rather than doing this, we are issuing licences.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State startled me when he referred to the number of applications for more drilling and more extraction of fossil fuels from our shores.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could email me the beginning of his reply.  I am particularly interested in the list of those who are informed of these decisions, which seems to consist of everybody from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the lighthouse keepers.  Is there any chance he could inform the Deputies and Senators who sit on this committee and try to grapple with the challenge of climate change that licences are to be issued?  We should find out when we are on our holidays in County Donegal or elsewhere that the Minister has made a decision of this nature.  I suggest it is extraordinary carry-on.<\/p> <p>  My point, which has not been addressed, is that we need a discussion on our whole energy strategy.  On the one hand, we are saying lovely things about renewables, climate change, communities, and wind and wave energy, etc.  On the other hand, we are flying ahead with the issuing of licences for the extraction of more fossil fuels from our shores.<\/p><p>The suggestion made that we should sit down with the energy sector and examine all these issues is a very good one and I would like to see it implemented.

As I said this on radio after the licence was issued, I would hope that future Ministers in my position will not even have to consider such matters because there would not be a need for oil or gas.  Perhaps that will be the case at some stage in the future.  There are many technologies relating to electric cars, but we are still a long way from finding alternatives to jet fuel and the fuel used for the marine sector.  These are intense users of hydrocarbons.  Alternatives might come in to play.  In terms of the aviation sector, I am aware that the possibility of mixing bio-gas with jet fuel, which would reduce reliance, is being examined but that is some way off.<\/p> <p>  I would certainly offer the Department's support for any work the committee does on the area of energy security.  The national mitigation plan is addressing that entire area but there are serious decisions to be made.  For example, Moneypoint, which is a big producer of energy, is reliant on imported coal.  It has to transition to an alternative over the coming years.  Will that be natural gas and where will that come from?  The peat stations in the midlands are a finite resource.  They are considering integrating biomass in those stations.  What are the alternatives in those areas?<\/p> <p>  I have huge concerns relating to the planning process.

I am told there has been some recovery.

Unfortunately, the Pacific pink salmon was found in Irish waters, in the Galway weir fishery, in June of this year and also in the River Erriff, in County Mayo.  It is not a new occurrence.  It occurs periodically, and incidents have been reported as far back as the 1970s, but we do not want this Pacific pink salmon to intermix and breed with our Atlantic salmon stocks.  It is imperative, therefore, that anglers report catches of pink salmon to Inland Fisheries Ireland.  There is a hot-line number, 1850 34 74 24, and it is important that if anglers come across these salmon they notify Inland Fisheries Ireland, which is keeping a close on this matter.  It is an issue about which those of us in the Department are worried.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Lawless's comments, salmon stocks have gone through a precarious existence over many years.  There was a ban on commercial drift netting in 2006.  For the initial year, there was an increase in stock numbers.  Since then, unfortunately, that increase has stopped and there has been a reduction.  Thankfully, the reports for this year are better and this will help improve the five-year averaging in terms of each river's conservation limits.  As the Deputy is aware, there is a process that is gone through based on science and international best practice.  If one has a higher return in 2017, that will improve the five-year average of rivers.

They have to dig into their budgets every year to provide a lot of funding for environmental measures.  The plastic bag and landfill site levies are obviously doing their job, but we need to broaden the number of sources of income for the environmental fund.  I introduced a waste Bill in the D&aacute;il a few months ago.  The provisions of that legislation would certainly go some way towards achieving that objective in the context of the return of disposable items.<\/p> <p>  In the document before us dealing with Programme F, percentages are given for recovery rates.  While I welcome the increased levels of recovery, the figures we have available are only up to 2013.  They are for municipal, household, commercial and packaging waste recovery.  I would welcome more up-to-date figures.  While I do not expect to receive the figures for this year, or even 2016, we should certainly have figures for 2014 and 2015.  Perhaps there is an issue with the gathering of that data, but I just wanted to highlight the point.<\/p> <p>  Litter has become a huge problem.  We need to introduce heavier penalties for illegal dumping which formed part of the Bill I introduced earlier this year.  People certainly should not throw cigarette butts out of their car windows, but we really need to get to grips with those who come along in pick-up trucks or lorries and tip loads of waste, some of which may be hazardous, in the Dublin mountains, the Slieve Bloom mountains and elsewhere.  We need to tackle the people who are dumping huge amounts of waste illegally on a commercial or semi-commercial basis.<\/p> <p>  I would like to see figures for the levels of waste reduction, although it would probably be hard to produce them.  If we are to get to grips with the problem, waste reduction at source is the key.  We have to stop the production of waste.  We are all aware of recent reports on the international plastics industry.  As a small island nation, we have a chance to do something about this problem on a North-South basis.  I hope, when the Executive is up and running in the North, we will be able to take initiatives in this area to deal with tyres, plastics and so forth in a joined-up manner.  We need a joined-up, all-island approach to the reduction of waste at source, which is the really big issue.<\/p> <p>  Reports on 9 September last highlighted the fact that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission had refused to join the group being established by the Department to monitor domestic waste collection charges.  Where do we stand now, if the commission has pulled out?  What credibility does that body have?  Monitoring is fine, but what power does the Minister have in controlling what the refuse collection companies charge their customers?  When are the changes coming into force?  Last July we were to have an exclusively pay-by-weight system.  However, there was a lot of debate and discussion about that matter at the time and the introduction of such a system was deferred until September or October.  Where do we stand now?  What power does the Minister have to keep control of charges?  As I recall it, from the discussions we had at the time, the Minister will have very little power.  What about the powers and credibility of the monitoring group?  Will it just be a commentator?  Will it be stating that what is happening is terrible and that it is not happy about it, while being able to do damn all about it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100500002#L00200","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1507194000,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

There is a certain lead-in time required for projects of this nature.  Budgeting and procurement usually take place in the first half of the year.  As site work can only take place in favourable weather conditions, it is expected that the main part of the expenditure from this allocation will happen in the second half of the year.<\/p> <p>  The household waste collection price monitoring group has been established and had its first meeting on 13 September.  A company has also begun the process of monitoring the rates charged by household waste collectors.  The company will report back to the monitoring group on a monthly basis and the results will be published.  They will be monitored and analysed and will provide an evidence base in the context of future monitoring or additional regulation of the waste market.  I have asked the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, to carry out a study of the operation of the household waste collection market.  We have been working very closely with the CCPC in relation to the price monitoring group and the study it will carry out.  The decision was taken by the CCPC to focus on the study of the operation of the household waste collection market, which is why it decided not to be directly involved in the price monitoring group.  However, the evidence collected from the price monitoring group will feed into the overall study under way which the CCPC expects to finish early in 2018.  The study will assess the nature and scale of consumer and operator issues in the household waste collection market and consider if the introduction of an enhanced regulatory regime could efficiently address these issues in the short and longer term.  It will include research on current issues in the waste sector, an economic assessment of the household waste collection market and an overview of the waste collection systems in other countries and make recommendations to me.  That is the role of the CCPC.<\/p> <p>  On the powers available to me, it is a competitive market.  The powers are actually with the local authorities rather than me, as Minister.  If, based on the aforementioned study and the work of the price monitoring group, there is a requirement to change the regulations in this area, we can look at doing so.  <\/p> <p>  On the broader issue of illegal dumping, I have said on numerous occasions that I believe it is both economic and environmental treason.  It has a huge impact on communities and areas all over the country.  As Deputy Brian Stanley knows, Senator Catherine Ardagh's Bill has completed Second Stage in the Seanad.  We also have Deputy Eamon Ryan's Bill which has been discussed by this committee, as well as the Deputy's own Bill.  There is a myriad of Bills, but I want to see progress in dealing with the issues of illegal dumping, the generation of waste and how we dispose of our waste.  I am quite willing to engage constructively with the committee in that regard.  We can deal with this issue in a piecemeal fashion, with one Member after the other bringing forward Private Members' Bills, or we can deal with it in a comprehensive manner.<\/p><p>I am on record as saying that I am open to any constructive suggestions coming from any side of the House in relation to this, whether from Deputy Stanley, Deputy Eamon Ryan-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100500002#L00400","speaker":"1234","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507194000,"counter":503,"content":"<p>Is the Minister prepared to look at the return of deposit scheme, which is part of the Bill that I introduced, and the changes in penalties, but also the requirements on landlords and tenants, as part of the committee deliberation?

I am on the record as saying if I had that money there are other ways that I would spend it.  However, let us see what comes out of this.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanley is asking - this is one of the issue we have to look at - how do we broaden the environmental fund and what areas do we go into in regard to it.  There is a broader debate to be had here and I am willing to look at that.  However, I want to ensure if we are spending public money that we are getting value for it, and that we are having a tangible impact on the generation of waste and addressing the issue of illegal dumping.<\/p> <p>  We have put significant funding into it.  This year, we have increased investment, both in terms of resources to the local authorities but also capacity within the EPA.  The waste enforcement regional lead authorities have been working with us on the illegal dumping initiative.  We have made significant progress on that this year, both in terms of cleaning up black stops across the country and deploying new technology, such as the use of drones.  Some local authorities are using drones to gather evidence.  There is also use of CCTV.  More needs to be done in that regard.<\/p> <p>  I announced an initial allocation of &euro;650,000 for the initiative to combat the illegal dumping problem.  The demand from local authorities was double that and as a result, I increased the budget to &euro;1.3 million.  I will look at new initiatives that come forward from the local authorities, subject to the budget next week and having the Estimate.  I believe that I will have the Estimate to look again at what initiatives are coming from local authorities across the country.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the waste statistics, there is a disappointing two-year time lag.  We are working with the EPA on that to see whether we can bring them more up to date..  According to the current statistics, the glass recycling rate is 87%, the paper and board recycling rate is 79%, the metals recycling rate is 81% and the plastic recycling rate is 35%.  As the committee will be aware, part of the problem is in regard to being able to recycle much of the plastic being generated.  We are well in excess of the EU targets on all of this.  We are one of the leaders across Europe in rates of recycling.  Of course, more can be done.  I am willing to work with colleagues here to see what initiatives will work in the Irish context that will give us the best value for the money we spend in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100500002#M00300","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1507194000,"counter":505,"content":"<p>We will now move on to programme G - appropriations-in-aid, if the Minister would like to make a brief opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017100500002#M00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1507194000,"counter":506,"content":"<p>Appropriations-in-aid are income receipts into my Department other than from the Exchequer.

I echo the Chairman's sentiments in referring to the death last night of Mr. Liam Cosgrave, who was Minister for External Affairs between 1954 and 1957.  Though his tenure was short, his influence on foreign policy was enormous as he oversaw the process which resulted in Ireland becoming a full and active member of the United Nations, UN.  I cannot do better than echo President Higgins when he quoted Mr. Cosgrave on our entry to the UN:<\/p><blockquote>His words on that occasion that Ireland should work to 'take our place in the comity of nations and do our part to secure what small nations have always required, the maintenance of peace' remains to this day an important reminder of our nation's role and unique voice on global issues such as disarmament, peacekeeping, human rights and development.<\/blockquote> <p>This provides so much of the context of the work we will discuss at this meeting.  I am joined by the director general of Irish Aid, Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca, who was formerly our ambassador to Mozambique and who oversaw one of the largest bilateral country aid programmes; Ms Nicola Brennan, the head of our policy unit, her colleague, Ms Nicole McHugh; and the head of our humanitarian unit, Ms Emer O'Connell.<br\/><br\/>Our people are global, spread across the planet.  Our trade is global and we invest abroad.  Our values are universal, founded in the UN Declaration of Human Rights.  Ireland is rooted in Europe, particularly as a member state of the European Union, and much of our development is exercised through the Union.  We have strong bonds in north America, Australia and New Zealand, and Argentina, and we have partnerships for our development activities through these bonds.  We are helping to build relationships in Asia and we are engaged in development activities across south east Asia.  Our place in the world helps create our prosperity but it is also founded on ensuring that others are secure and prosperous in their parts of the world, and playing our part as a global citizen to make that prosperity a reality.<br\/><br\/>We have particularly special relationships with Africa through our generations of missionary endeavour, migration, new African diasporas resident in Ireland and many years of development and humanitarian work undertaken by both Government through Irish Aid and by humanitarian and aid agencies.  The work of many individuals and organisations, including many colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs, over many years has built on their legacy.  Their stories, like so many others we grew up with, were a reminder that our peace, security and well-being are linked umbilically to the peace, security and well-being of others, and if that was true in our youth, it is even more so today.  Ours is an interconnected world.  Recent climate events such as the hurricanes in the Caribbean or drought in east Africa tell us that we need to act in common with others to address the challenges of our age.  That sense of sharing the planet informed the negotiation of the sustainable development goals, SDGs, also known as Agenda 2030, which was led and co-facilitated by Ireland at the UN.  The SDGs were adopted by the UN in 2015, following an extensive process.  They set an ambitious set of targets and it is expected that all countries will respond to the challenge not just domestically, but also in foreign policy.  They set a context for our work in the future of Irish Aid and our wider development assistance for the coming decade and beyond.<br\/><br\/>Before briefly touching on the role of Irish Aid, I would like to situate it within Ireland's broader development assistance work.  Ireland makes its financial contributions to the UN and the EU like any member state in good standing.  In addition, Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to international development is a whole of government commitment.  It does not rest solely within the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Many Departments contribute from their budgets to multilateral organisations, for example, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine&rsquo;s support for the World Food Programme.  Other Departments contribute in kind, for example, to the support the Health Service Executive provides to health system strengthening in the developing world.  Between one quarter and one third of all Irish overseas development assistance &ndash; in 2016, just over &euro;241 million &ndash; is accounted for by this whole of government contribution.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and particularly its development co-operation directorate, manages the remaining two thirds of Irish overseas development assistance.  This amounted to &euro;486 million in 2016.  The portion managed by my Department is branded Irish Aid.<br\/><br\/>Irish Aid works across the world, but with a focus on Africa.  Our policies are aligned with the SDGs, with our current focus interventions designed to reduce hunger and build resilience, create conditions for sustainable and inclusive economic growth, encourage better governance and accountability, and support human rights.  We maintain long-term development programmes in a number of key partner countries, including Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Zambia, and outside Africa, in Vietnam.  Ireland also works particularly closely with a number of other African countries.  Our focus is always on the most vulnerable.  In recent years, Ireland has looked to deepen its support to fragile states such as Somalia or South Sudan, building on the experience of our embassy in Sierra Leone.  Ireland has also had to respond to emerging humanitarian crises such as Syria or what have been termed the &quot;forgotten crises&quot; of famine and conflict across the Sahel and into the Sahara, often accompanied by migration and refugee movements, north and south.  In 2016, humanitarian assistance totalled &euro;194 million, the highest it has ever been.  Sadly, the pressures to respond to calamity and disaster, often man made, continue this year.<br\/><br\/>In Irish Aid&rsquo;s efforts, we work with many partners.  Some are well known to this committee, including fantastic NGOs such as Tr&oacute;caire and Concern.  Others might be less well known but, nonetheless, they do excellent work in niche areas.  We work with local partners on the ground in many countries as well as with international and multinational partners.  In working with partners, the watchwords are results, efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability.  I believe we do good work, in which Irish people can take pride.  The most recent assessment of Irish Aid by the OECD's development aid committee, DAC, was very positive, particularly the extent to which Irish assistance is targeted at the poorest countries and reaches those who are most vulnerable.  It commended Ireland on grounding its policies in the needs and priorities of its partner countries, and having a clear overall vision for development co-operation.  The review noted that Ireland plays a leadership role at global level on its priority issues, particularly hunger and nutrition.  It also praises Ireland for responding rapidly and effectively to other natural disasters.<br\/><br\/>However, notwithstanding the good work done by Irish Aid, and by many others, it is clear that aid alone cannot solve the problems of poverty and hunger.  Lasting solutions must be underpinned by developing countries own leadership, by their ability to harness their own human and other potential, and to address inequalities.  Ireland plays its part by leveraging the voice and experience earned through our development programme to advocate to partners and internationally to bring about the positive changes needed if vulnerability is to be addressed.  The SDGs give new impetus to that task. <br\/><br\/>It is clear that while One World, One Future, our policy platform, has stood the test of time, there are significant new drivers for change since it was completed.  The committee's review is timely and welcome in that context.I will pass now to my colleague, Mr. de B&uacute;rca, who will go into more detail on the shape of the aid programme and some of the emerging challenges it faces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Burgess"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507190400,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I would like to add my condolences to those expressed to the family of Mr. Liam Cosgrave and his friends.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.<\/p> <p>  The Secretary General has outlined how Irish Aid fits into Ireland's wider foreign policy and global footprints.  It might be useful to give a brief outline of how our aid programme is structured and how we work to maximise its impact.  Irish Aid is not a legal entity; it is a branding that we use to represent the funds disbursed through Vote 27, the development co-operation budget of the Department.  In turn, the development co-operation division that I lead, working closely with the Department's financial controller, manages those funds.  However, branding ourselves as Irish Aid saves us having to explain the Department's structures to partners, particularly aboard, which is useful, particularly because Irish Aid does what it says on the tin.<\/p><p>That is important in gaining leverage and traction on the issues about which we care when dealing with governments, administrations, other donors, agencies and communities in the places where Irish Aid is active.  It involves our good name which has been recognised by the OECD's development assistance committee and others as being effective.  It is our calling card which I hope we use well.<\/p><p> The provision of aid is, of course, about much more than just having a good name and channelling money to a cause, no matter how deserving.  There are many causes - too many - and while we manage a considerable sum of money, &euro;486 million this year, there are many more demands than we can reasonably meet.  In part, the question of who we fund is answered by the priorities set in One World, One Future which no doubt members of the committee have seen.  The document which was published in May 2013 sets out Ireland's policy on international development.  It sets out three goals, namely, reduced hunger and stronger resilience, sustainable development and inclusive economic growth, and better governance, human rights and accountability.  It also sets out six priority areas for action, namely, global hunger, fragile states, climate change and development, trade and economic growth, essential services; and human rights and accountability.  Nothing stays still.  As Mr. Niall Burgess mentioned, the work of the committee is timely in helping to set the agenda as we move forward.  We have had the sustainable development goals which now inform our work and on which we need to build, as well as an increasingly complex set of emergencies, famines and other challenges which require an immediate response.<\/p><p> Irish Aid is organised along a number of pillars which support the achievement of the overarching goals mentioned.  In part, our funding follows these pillars.  Perhaps the most familiar to many is the humanitarian pillar - Ireland's response to emerging catastrophes such as famine or the recent hurricanes.  It is also where we respond to complex situations such as refugee flows or to mitigate the effects of conflict.  Funding is channelled through multinational actors such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent or the UN Central Emergency Response Fund.  This allows Ireland to pool its resources with others for maximum impact.  <\/p><p> Ireland works with non-governmental organisations, NGOs, both Irish and international.  Our key partner countries also have humanitarian lines in their budgets which give good intelligence on how best to respond where crises have a regional dimension such as in the Horn of Africa.  As Mr. Niall Burgess mentioned, Ireland has eight key partner countries, Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Sierre Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Vietnam in Asia.  In addition, we work closely with a number of other countries.  I mention Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Nigeria, South Africa and Zimbabwe, in particular.  The work we do in these countries is focused on the achievement of measurable results which are reported on quarterly.  The annual report of Irish Aid which was published last week is a distillation of that reporting process.  The countries in which we work are mostly the least developed, but they all share an essential fragility which goes beyond the technical term \"least development states\".  Attention is paid to ensure the work done in our partner countries is effective and efficient as it reduces poverty and that appropriate attention is paid to the prudent and effective management of Irish taxpayers' resources.<\/p><p> Our presence on the ground is important in feeding back to the other pillars of our work to ensure that, for example, our support for multilateral agencies, including the European Union and the United Nations, is targeted most effectively.  It also means that Ireland has an informed voice when speaking at multilateral fora, drawing from our experience and being able to bring forward and propose solutions to common problems.  This enables us to maximise our impact in partner countries in developing regional perspectives and also to contribute to the fine-tuning of the international response to emerging crises.<\/p><p> Civil society organisations play an important role in development.  Ireland is home to many excellent organisations, some of which are household names, while others quietly do life-changing work.  In recognition of this, Irish Aid funds a number of larger organisations on a multi-annual basis and others on an annual basis to achieve a set of agreed goals.  Their experiences also enrich feedback and our own analyses and, importantly, help to spread Ireland's global footprint and open doors for other Irish development partners.  Our missionaries, although much reduced in number, also play their part.  NGOs frequently have a privileged space for advocacy which is important in helping to transform governance scenarios in countries in which we work.<\/p><p> It is also important that we inform the public about our development programme as we depend on their support.  It is their taxes which pay for Irish Aid.  This hearing is an important part of that feedback to taxpayers, as is, for example, Africa Day and the Department's development education programme.<\/p><p> Underpinning these output pillars is a strong team - some of my colleagues are present - with a focus on policy development and being in tune with international best practice.  There is a learning culture within Irish Aid which uses a valuation and review process, as well as international research, to try to ensure our programmes are the best they can be.  Increasingly, too, Irish Aid is able to dip into and learn from good practice across the Civil Service and the public service.  Mr. Niall Burgess mentioned the co-operation with the HSE in health system strengthening.  I also mention, for example, the work Teagasc is doing with Irish Aid to help agricultural research in a number of our key partner countries, which is an exciting new development.<\/p><p> Given our history which includes famine and migration, many Irish people have an instinctive understanding of why the international solidarity Irish Aid encapsulates is important.  We are a generous people.  However, it is also important to say we are not foolishly altruistic.  We have our own self-interest.  The Ebola crisis, for example, was a reminder of the need for functioning public health systems on our neighbouring continent.  Ireland was able to respond quickly and effectively and make a significant contribution to stemming the flow of that terrible disease.  That was important for the people of Sierre Leone, but it is also important to say it was important for us.  As we look forward - the continent of Africa will experience a demographic bulge in the next 50 years - it is in our own interests to ensure this will become a demographic dividend, that it will be a continent on which the youth will be educated to take up the sustainable jobs that will be created in societies, that will be resilient in dealing with the climate challenges ahead, in a world where the promise of the sustainable development goals will be achieved.  This is not something Ireland can deliver by itself, but it is something on which African countries should be and are taking the lead.  However, Irish Aid, as part of our wider foreign policy and working with others, can help to progress its vision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. de B&uacute;rca for his presentation.

That part of the economy has been internationalised in a major way.  If we could get some of these major international companies which have been remarkably successful and which were indigenous Irish companies involved, with Teagasc, in knowledge transfer of using sustainable methods of food production, it could be extremely beneficial.  It would involve the use of a very slight amount of their budgets.<\/p> <p>  Regarding migration, we have had numerous groups appear before the committee who are working in the most difficult of areas.  I refer to NGOs, in particular, which are trying to help people who have been displaced.  The figure of 65 million people who are displaced throughout the world is shocking.  Is any of Irish Aid's work aimed at addressing the root causes of the problem, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa?<\/p> <p>  A number of the us met Mr. Jamie Drummond from the organisation ONE.  He spoke about the potential for transformation in the areas of the digital economy and date and said his organisation would strongly argue that there was the potential to transfer assistance and support using financial services and the digital economy.  Perhaps that is one area that might be explored.  That work is in its early days, but is it an issue that is being considered by Irish Aid?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#C00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":527,"content":"<p>Ta f&aacute;ilte romhaibh go leir.  It has been a sad week following the shooting in Las Vegas and the death of Mr. Liam Cosgrave.  Yesterday we met a member of the Rohingya community who was living in Ireland and wanted to know about our involvement in that particular issue.  <\/p> <p>  I wish Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca well in his new post.  There is no doubt that Ireland's reputation in this area is second to none.  It comes from the work of Irish missionaries, on which Irish Aid is building, as well as the role played by our ambassadors.  There is no doubt that Irish Aid is meeting demands, but as it meets demands, there is an increasing need.<\/p> <p>  It was very good to see in the report of Irish Aid which was launched last week a breakdown of its funding of &euro;486.6 million and read about the difference it was making, but there are questions about our share of the European Development Fund, on which the position is not clear.  We have been asking questions about where exactly it goes.<\/p><p>Mr. Burgess mentioned lasting solutions with governments.  We know how vital that is.  We certainly saw some good practices when we were in Nairobi where a particular group is working with the government.  The government is providing the funding for the medication and the group is working with the women who need the medication.<\/p><p> A group from Malawi appeared before the committee last week and we were talking about the group's relationship with the committees and how Irish Aid comes before us.  That is not the norm in many African countries but it did happen in Malawi.  Will such an approach be pursued?  In order to work with a government it has to know what a group is doing.  Irish Aid going before committees and talking about what it is doing would be very useful.  Will Irish Aid try to support that approach more?<\/p><p> I will come back to coherence of policy again.  I know it is important to Irish Aid but the question is whether we are making progress on that.  We know the aid that is going out is making a difference.  That is great because our aid is untied but I am sure there are increasing demands on that.  When we trade, we are continuing our human rights agenda with workers' rights.  We are still waiting on the report on business and human rights.  That brings in the whole area of tax in terms of ensuring tax justice.  We must also ensure that what we are doing - or not doing - with climate change is not impacting.  The issue of policy coherence is hugely significant.<\/p><p> As for population growth, a report will be launched in another week or two with the latest figures.  While I know how difficult it is in some countries to talk about family planning, it is vital.  We see an increasing number of child brides.

In response to the question on migration and the 65 million displaced people and the root causes, the complex humanitarian crises we are facing now in the wider Middle East, Yemen, the Horn of Africa, the Lake Chad Basin, north-east Nigeria and even a new fragility around climate and food security in southern Africa are the drivers of displacement but that has become a very significant theme and a pull of funds from Irish Aid.  Our total humanitarian assistance is close to &euro;200 million, which is a sizeable percentage of our total aid.<\/p> <p>  I will make two points on the root causes and how we address them.  The first is that the sustainable development goals give us a remarkably comprehensive framework for trying to think about the root causes and the linkage between the causes and the symptoms, which we did not have before.  The goals give us a framework to think about how Irish Aid is delivered but in some of the areas I mentioned, in particular in the Horn of Africa, we have a major humanitarian crisis in countries where we also have very significant long-term development programmes, for example, in Uganda and Ethiopia.  We have an embassy now in Kenya, which we did not have a number of years ago.  We have programmes just across the borders from some of those countries, some of them directly delivered and some through agencies.  One of the issues for us in thinking about the future of the programme is how our long-term programmes in those countries can best contribute to the drivers of migration.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that struck me when I joined the Department is that it was against the backdrop of the famine in Ethiopia, which was the largest humanitarian crisis I had seen in my lifetime.  Those were images that drove a lot of people into working with humanitarian agencies and into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as well.  When I took up this job one of the first visits I made was to go to Ethiopia to look at the work of Irish Aid, in particular in northern Ethiopia.  It gives one great pride to see some of the work that we did a couple of decades ago in Ethiopia, experimental work around water management in Tigre, which was then picked up by the Ethiopian Government and mainstreamed across its policies in northern Ethiopia.  When one looks at fragility in the region now one can see there is a resilience in that area which was once one of the most vulnerable areas, for reasons in which we can take some considerable pride.  It does show that there is a very real connection between what is being done in development programmes today and the kind of humanitarian issues one may or may not have to face in five years' time or a decade hence.<\/p> <p>  On the Rohingya, obviously most of the displaced Rohingya are in Bangladesh and our own reach in that part of the world is limited enough, and yet the partnerships we have developed with other agencies give us a reach beyond what might be expected.  For example, we are a very significant core donor to the International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC, and to the federation of Red Cross societies.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, met the president of the Red Cross in New York a couple of weeks ago.  We have a very deep dialogue and trusting partnership with the Red Cross, which is to the foreground of the relief effort in that region.  We have given specific funding to one partner, I think it is Christian Aid-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Burgess"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507190400,"counter":530,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Emer O'Connell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507190400,"counter":531,"content":"<p>-----and we are examining other partners we could work with in that region.  We have an aid programme in Vietnam and as we scale it down we have been scaling up our practical aid activities in the region but also in Myanmar.  We have a newly opened embassy in Bangkok with Brendan Rogers, former head of Irish Aid, who is accredited to Myanmar.  He is regularly on the ground there and is giving us an understanding of the situation that can help to direct our efforts as well.  When one looks at it in totality it is an indication of how Irish Aid has a reach that goes far beyond our bilateral country programmes and is capable of reaching what would otherwise seem rather difficult areas for us to reach.  We are still in the early stages of a crisis that is going to be protracted and shows no signs of immediate or short-term resolution.<\/p> <p>  On Malawi, I was very interested to hear what Deputy O'Sullivan had to say.  I was there a few months ago and I was impressed at the work which the embassy has been doing to try to work with the Government in Malawi around issues of governance, even in areas which are unusual for us, for example, with the judiciary and the legal system.  The embassy has helped to build links between the judiciary and our own legal system here.  Those are not particularly expensive programmes.  They do not demand very significant resources but they demand a lot of thought, effort and some creativity as well in trying to find connections that can be valuable and enduring and yet they can have an impact beyond the resources that are put in.  There is certainly scope for looking at what we do and our own systems for accountability and transparency in Irish Aid and seeing how we can engage some of our partner governments more closely.  That is an area for future development.<\/p> <p>  On the question of coherence, that is an area we have to continuously look at and there are several dimensions to it.  There is obviously the coherence with our own multiple activities.  As I said in my opening remarks, the work we do in support of development is a whole-of-Government effort and that is not simply the non-foreign affairs and trade part of ODA that runs through other Departments, it is the entire Government footprint.<\/p><p>We have been talking about Ireland's footprint across the globe and the way that footprint makes an impact is obviously an issue to which we need to give thought.  We have been doing a lot of work in Irish Aid on building economic links.  This goes to the point made about how the food industry can play a positive role in research and the transfer of skills.  We have been doing a lot of work through, for example, the Africa Ireland Economic Forum on bringing different players together to see how they can co-operate, fundamentally around these goals that are now the centrepiece of Irish Government policy, in ways that are mutually reinforcing.<\/p><p> I will ask one of my colleagues to speak in detail on the fellowship programme and how the fellows are selected and allocated.  In looking at the future development of our programme, there is tremendous potential in the area of fellowships.  It goes to the point about how we can enrich thinking in some of our partner countries on some of what we do well so people can bring those skills back to their own countries.  I have been struck by what is happening in Vietnam in particular - where, perhaps, our fellowship programme is more developed than in other areas - and the fact that the networks we have built through our fellowship programmes have given us real traction with the government there on the further development and evolution of Vietnam.  This was very evident during the President's state visit to Vietnam last year.  I have left out some issues and I will pass them to my colleagues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Burgess","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507190400,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I will pick up from where Mr. Burgess left off.  I will go back to the Chair's question on agribusiness.  His point was very well made.  There is a resonance between the transformation in Irish agriculture and agribusiness over the past 50 years and the journey which many of our key partner countries in Africa have yet to travel.  They are trying to move up the value chain from smallholdings, and often subsistence, which requires a lot of work to get scale.  In some instances, we have tried to introduce key opinion makers to the concept of the co-op, which was one of the ways in which we took the smallholder model here and enabled scale and, very importantly, local ownership to be maintained.  There is an attractiveness around this model.  There has been a series of visits to some of the Irish agribusiness companies.  For reasons of climate, the areas where we are strongest, which are often in dairy, do not always translate to an African context.  This is good for Irish business because we are not in competition, but it means we must be careful to ensure when we do this type of twinning that we try to match what we can give to what the partnerships need.<\/p> <p>  Approximately three years ago, we launched a small innovation fund to encourage Irish businesses to look at opportunities with African partners in Africa.  An example is a nutrition company called Devenish, which used the fund to get a footprint in Uganda and worked with Ugandan producers to improve the nutrition and some of the seed technology available and bring them up the value chain.  This has proved quite successful, such that Devenish is trying to replicate it, without Irish Aid assistance, in Kenya.<\/p> <p>  On the technology point, an interesting piece of Irish technology tells when a cow is about to go into labour.  This means that the farmer knows he or she needs to get the vet, or whatever needs to be done.  I am not an agricultural expert.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":534,"content":"<p>I used to stay up at night watching the cow.

Anything that reduces the cost to farmers is very valuable.  Clearly there is more we can do and we are open to this.  We are in good conversations with a number of Irish agribusiness concerns.  We are also very much involved in conversations with ministries of agriculture and others in the countries where we work to ensure that what we do meets their needs.<\/p> <p>  Another example from agriculture, which I know personally, is that Fyffes was giving free advice to the Government of Mozambique.  Mozambique has a potential comparative advantage in banana production but does not have the logistics chain ready.  Fyffes has been giving it advice on how to get the cold chain logistics up to scratch in order that its bananas can be sold on the international market.  Fyffes is also advising on how to get the phytosanitary aspect correct so that Mozambique can avoid some of the banana diseases getting into the broader chain.<\/p> <p>  Some of this is also linked to the question of data, on which I touched briefly.  There is an opportunity for countries that did not necessarily go through an analogue industrial revolution to leapfrog and move to digital, and we want to be part of this.  We have taken a few initiatives so far.  This is something on which we can build.  The current Estonian Presidency of the European Union has been trying to drive its digital for development agenda, and this will also bring broader attention and resources to it.<\/p> <p>  From trying to get our children to programme our televisions, we all know that there is a youth dimension to the adoption of new technologies.  It is very interesting to watch the widespread adoption of digital telephones, or smartphones, in Africa, which are transforming how people communicate.  There is also quite an amount of app development in Africa.  The Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, will go to Tanzania in ten days to attend the launch of Africa coding week.  This is a partnership between Ireland and SAP that tries to get children in Africa to develop coding skills.  It is interesting that it is in Tanzania this year.  Last year, it was launched in Uganda, and both are Irish key partner countries.  A few years ago we launched a young scientists competition in Tanzania, which has now gone to Kenya.  It is not just about looking at digital in terms of developing an app but putting value on the STEM subjects, which are something we know here, and giving children in other parts of the world the same types of opportunities we have ourselves.  This digital for development concept, which is about coding skills and giving children access to what could be used for small business, is being rolled out this year in some refugee camps in Jordan.  It is not just children in somewhat settled environments but those who have gone through the trauma of moving, in a refugee context, who are being given access to this.<\/p> <p>  Irish Aid has supported pilots for mobile banking in Malawi and Ethiopia.  We have also trialled information systems in Tanzania and Malawi to get market information to farmers.  There is more we can do as the technology advances and as mobile phone telephony becomes more widespread.  There is somewhat of a concern because some of data suggests that low-income families sometimes will put money into keeping the telephone fed rather than feeding the children, so we need to be careful to make sure that by putting an emphasis on development we do not actually lose some of the emphasis on some of the other stuff, such as nutrition, which are also important.  Clearly, in places that are not necessarily well-connected as regards roads, it is important.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned education, and to pick up Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's point on family planning and opportunities the data shows there is a clear correlation between access to education and the date of first birth.  In many countries, girls give birth way too young.  In many of our key partner countries, we work with education ministries to look at keeping girls in school for as long as possible and to ensure that when they leave school, there are economic opportunities available to them.  This has to be a key part of any strategy.<\/p><p>We have done work with gender Ministries to identify the cultural drivers.  Sometimes there are deep cultural drivers that differ in various parts of the country also.  There is no one size fits all solution.  It is not that we, as foreigners, come in and say, \"Change your culture\".  When we work with local ministries, who work with local thought leaders and with traditional leaders, over time we can help to create a context where some of those cultural drivers can begin to change.  We are sensitive to that but we have to do it in a way that respects the local cultural norms, etc.<\/p><p> There are elements around health system strengthening that are also important.  Part of it is about making sure that there are attended births.  There are still very high maternal death rates in many of the countries where we work.  This is directly linked to a lack of access to trained birth attendants.  There are often fears about going into the conventional medical systems because the learnt experience is that if a person is about to die, and if he or she goes there and dies there people think that scientific medicine kills.  We need to think about innovative ways to encourage women to get into those systems.  Ironically, some of the work we have done on HIV has been very important in health system strengthening and in getting young women who might be at risk to get into the conventional medicine system.  Some of the logistic chains we have helped to build in order to get anti-retroviral drugs out - for example in Mozambique - are the same logistic chains that are used for the distribution of contraception and so on.  This is not something we do on our own, we have to work with others in partnerships.  In rolling out the programmes we work with UN partners, including the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, the UN Women and The Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, as well as other bodies, health and education ministries and donors.  In many ways this is a job of a generation.  The statistics show that things are beginning to change and we can take some credit for that.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Sullivan spoke of trade and human rights.  I am told that the Department's human rights and trade documents will be available in the next few weeks.  I do not want to get ahead of these, but hopefully it will give some comfort in that regard.  One of the consequences of having embassies on the ground in Africa is that is gives us an opportunity to perform an ethics check on what Irish business does.  It also gives us an opportunity to advise on the local cultural context within which people work, to make sure that business in pursuit of its legitimate profit motivation does no harm or does least harm in that process.  To be fair, most of the businesses that I have been engaged with are very responsible and try to build good corporate social responsibility elements in to their work in Africa.  There are cases where businesses have come to embassies to look at who they might partner with to design the most culturally and geographically specific approaches to the process.<\/p><p> I am sure there is more that could be done but we are trying to do our best to provide a resource to that.  This is where we, as an organisation, need to do more learning also.  I would not say that we have this one sorted.  We are up for it and we are trying, as are more Irish businesses, to look to a growing Continent as a source of trade and investment.  Different responsibilities go with trade and investment, and in the kind of things people invest in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":537,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. de B&uacute;rca.

Deputy O'Sullivan spoke on the issue of the UN and the EU and how much of our overseas aid budget actually goes directly to them.  The issue is really over the control.  Members often receive memos about aid programmes that Ireland has signed up for under the EU.  We hand over the cheque and Ireland's control of the funding dissipates.  Clearly there is an advantage to having scale and in Ireland partnering with organisations such as Tr&oacute;caire and Concern.  During the time of the austerity budgets, however, Ireland was so committed and tied in to giving X amount of money to different EU programmes that the actual amount of money over which Ireland had discretion dropped substantially.  The figure at one stage was some 46% of all our overseas aid budget being sent to the EU.  Between the UN budget and the EU budget where is that figure at and how much is left? I believe the Secretary General spoke of two thirds, which is &euro;486 million, as the figure over which Ireland had discretion.  I would like to clarify that.<\/p><p>I will now turn to the issue of fraud.  Given the circumstances under which Ireland works in partnering with developing countries and their systems there is always the risk and likelihood of fraud.  How much of Ireland's budget gets lost in fraud? It is a risk and an outcome we are all well aware of as likely to happen.  On an annual basis, how much do we lose to that in hard figure terms?<\/p><p>I thank Mr. de B&uacute;rca for answering the question on trade and human rights.  A concern was raised at this committee numerous times relating to the Colombian trade agreement.  While there is a human rights mechanism also in the trade agreement with the EU and Israel, there is no way of actually triggering that mechanism that we can see.  What does a country have to do to lose its trade agreements with the EU or lose its aid from the EU?  Apparently there is no enforcement of the mechanism, and that keeps happening especially in the area of trade where for every $1 of aid, $3 is lost to African and developing countries through the trade practices of the EU, the United States of America and others.<\/p><p>Mr. de B&uacute;rca made reference to consulates, embassies and the footprint around Africa, which I welcome.  The Taoiseach has also spoken about expanding Ireland's consulates.  Ireland's consulate network is part of this committee's work programme.  I had engagement with the Secretary General and with our consulate section where we looked at how consulates and honorary consulates are appointed.  We discussed the issue of the United States of America and Canada.  Given the Taoiseach's announcement of increasing Ireland's footprint in this regard, could the Department come back to the committee with the plan for which countries are being decided?  I do not want to know how it is decided, just which countries will have honorary consulates over the next ten years, even though they may not happen.  I know of the process where the ambassador tells the Secretary General that they need someone in their region.  Without a plan, that approach is too <i>ad hoc<\/i>for the vision that I am sure the Department has in the context of where we need people now, in places we did not have them before.  This has been on the work programme for as long as I have been here, but it will remain.  With regard to the Taoiseach's announcement, we would like to see from the Department the plan for where the consulates are going to be placed.  I came across an example recently-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#F00300","speaker":"1414"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":539,"content":"<p>We will return to the issue of the consulates on another day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#F00400","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":540,"content":"<p>There is an issue in Germany where we have four consulates and there are some 16,000 Irish citizens there.

If any message goes out from this committee today it should be that aid does work.  The biggest danger is apathy, ignorance and people believing that no matter how much money is pumped into these areas, in terms of outcomes, it still comes back to the problems of famine and so on.  It is vital that we continue to reinforce that message, particularly to taxpayers who are paying a considerable amount of money.<\/p> <p>  The biggest concern I would have is about our lack of understanding of where the money is being spent and our lack of oversight and scrutiny of many of the programmes.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked about the European Development Fund, EDF.  That is one of the areas about which we would have a concern.  I would like to hear some suggestions as to how this committee can improve oversight of that.  We need to be confident enough to be able to sell the idea of the work Irish Aid is doing abroad to our constituents and to those who are opposed to the idea.  There has been widespread party and non-party support for it in the House.  Now and then, someone will make the argument that we should be spending the money on people at home such as the homeless, people who go to go bed hungry and so on.  We need to have that confidence and examine ways to have that oversight.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the current system, the Minister might come before the committee every so often.  At budget time, we go through the figures and have a discussion on them.  I do not know if my colleagues share this view but that does not give us a sense of the position.<\/p> <p>  I am also conscious that fewer politicians travel to see many of the programmes.  There is no political benefit as such for people who travel.  They get it in the neck from journalists and others back home who say that they stay in such and such a hotel.  It is important that all of us who are supportive of the idea of overseas development aid, ODA, are on the same page on it.<\/p> <p>  On the EDF, Ireland provides a significant amount of EDF funding.  It represents 5% of overall ODA funding.  It does not have to be today but we need to consider providing information on the areas where EDF is spent, how it is allocated and what it is spent on.  Considering it is funded by all EU members, how are decisions on spending made?  What influence does Ireland have in that process?  <\/p> <p>  In terms of ODA, there appears to be a shift from bilateral spending to multilateral spending.  I understand that 47% of our ODA is multilateral funding.  I understand also that in times of humanitarian crises, basket funding is needed to tackle major health issues.  The witness mentioned Ebola, malaria, HIV, AIDS and so on but is the bilateral element being downgraded?  If that is the case, the witnesses might explain the reason.  A number of the partner countries speak positively about our bilateral programmes because of the partnership approach we use, but it is no longer mentioned as frequently.<\/p> <p>  There seems to be a trend towards a reduction in aid to the least developed countries, LDCs.  Ireland's contribution to LDCs is below the United Nations target of 0.15% of gross national income, GNI, in 2016.  Given that people are still suffering from extreme poverty in those countries, how is Irish Aid working to address that?<\/p> <p>  The global footprint was touched on by other speakers.  Libya was raised as an issue, and it is related to ODA.  The reports in that regard are disturbing.  The committee met representatives of M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res, doctors without borders, during the week and heard about human rights abuses and so on.  The witnesses are aware of people's concerns in that regard including people being returned to the Libyan coast guard and detention centres.  Last year, Ireland provided &euro;600,000 to the EU Africa trust fund for migration.  I am not sure how that money is spent or on what it is spent.  Does anyone go to Libya?  Do we have any involvement in Libya?<\/p> <p>  In regard to Turkey, according to the Irish Aid Annual Report 2016, &euro;5 million was allocated to the European Commission Turkey refugee facility.  Again, I have no idea what that is spent on or if any other members know that.  I have spoken out repeatedly in the Chamber, and in this body, about the refugee deal with Turkey, which is described as a country of safe origin.  That could not be further from the truth in view of what is going on, but what is the money spent on there?<\/p> <p>  My last question is on the way this committee can improve the oversight.  Reference was made at the outset to the members of the African diaspora, and probably members of diasporas who were involved in other countries.  Is there a way of tying in that experience with the ODA work?  People are on the telephone all the time and information goes back and forth but there is no structure in that regard.  Similarly, in terms of those Deputies and Senators who travel to see the programmes, there is no formal structure for them to report back on their experiences.  A report is given but there is no engagement or formal interaction with the witnesses.  Would the witnesses see that as a positive way to move on matters?  That is not a criticism but in terms of their impressions and so on, that is important.  It would mean that the Deputy, the Senator or people who are going on those trips would feel that the work they are doing is being acknowledged but also that there is some feedback or communication between them and the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#G00200","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":546,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance and for the impressive presentation.  I join with others in commending them on the positive work being done by Irish Aid.  It is very good to hear about the developments that are going on, the commitment to untied aid in particular and the acknowledgement of links with climate change and development.  It is welcome also to hear an update on the kind of work that is being done in terms of digital development.  I have some familiarity with the work of Camara, a great small Irish organisation that is doing a lot on that front.<\/p> <p>  I have three specific questions.  The first is on the 0.7% target of spending on ODA.  Do the witnesses see us reaching that target by 2025?  I have met with Dochas, the association of international development NGOs here, and I am aware it has briefed many of us on the committee.  It has made a budget submission looking for a multi-annual plan at Government level setting out how we can reach that target and committing again to reaching it.  Has there been progress on that and will we see that next week in particular?<\/p> <p>  The second question is a related one in terms of the issue of multi-annual spend.  I recently spoke at a gathering of fund-raisers for development NGOs under the Ask Direct umbrella and I heard from them their understandable frustration at the requirement by many people who donate.  That would include organisations like Irish Aid, which is working through partner NGOs.  They were frustrated about the quarterly measurable results.  Everyone understands we have to have quarterly measurable results but the witnesses, particularly Mr. de B&uacute;rca, alluded to the fact that many development programmes now are slow burn, for example, when we are spending on judiciary programmes, which Trinity law school has a history of running, in some African countries like Tanzania, which I have visited with our programme, and South Africa.<\/p><p>These are slow-burn programmes and they are very important to developing the rule of law and governance in countries like Tanzania, South Africa and Botswana, where I have also been.  There is not a very immediate and tangible result, which can be difficult for organisations.  How could that be addressed?  The witnesses indicated the funding method is about funding a number of organisations on a multi-annual basis and others on an annual basis to reach a set of agreed goals.  How is that squared with the longer term development programmes where we are trying to achieve sustainable development?  Ethiopia is another good example, and we heard about water management systems put in place at the time of the famine.  These are slower burning programmes but very important in terms of famine prevention and prevention of humanitarian crises.  I wonder how Irish Aid can manage that challenge and how we can assist as a committee in supporting that work.  I see it as important to move towards greater multi-annual planning.<br\/><br\/>How does Irish Aid manage relationships with partner organisations here, particularly where there are governance issues?  For example, we know there is a planned merger being spoken about between two agencies here.  How is this managed when Irish Aid is linking with organisations working directly in developing countries?<br\/><br\/>I have a follow-up on the Libyan matter, which was raised by Deputy Crowe.  I met representatives of M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res and I know they raised directly with us the appalling conditions experienced by people being held in detention centres in Libya.  I know they are seeking a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, about that.  I express support for that as it is very important for us to see what we can do from an Irish Government perspective and from within the European Union to try to address those conditions.  There are many concerns in particular about a lack of oversight of the detention centres that are seemingly being run on a very <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis by private entities and individuals in Libya.  That is where the abuses are ongoing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#G00300","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I ask for responses to be as succinct as possible and only to the relevant topics for today's meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#H00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507190400,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I will keep my responses very short and pass very quickly to Mr. de B&uacute;rca.  Senator Daly mentioned the question of bilateral and multilateral funding, as well as the matter of control.  It was mentioned by others as well.  It is an issue.  The figure for our total overseas development aid, ODA, channelled through multilateral organisations - the EU and United Nations, mostly - is approximately 40%.  There has not been a reduction or diminution in our bilateral aid programmes, country programmes and strategic partnerships we developed.<\/p> <p>  On the question of control, we put many resources, effort and time into influencing our multilateral partners.  We are very much across the governance of the European Development Fund, EDF, and Mr. de B&uacute;rca could speak to that a little more.  It is quite a large part of the work of our permanent representation in Brussels.  We work very closely with like-minded partners within the EU.  People speak of alliance building within the European Union and we have built alliances with other partners in the European Union around the shaping of dispersals through the EDF.  We put some effort into being on the governance bodies of some of our organisations, and we are on the governing body of the World Food Programme now and moving into the governing body of OCHA, the UN co-ordinator for humanitarian affairs.  I could give other examples as well.  We see that as a fundamental part of the work we do equal in importance to our management of our bilateral programmes.<\/p> <p>  On the matter of fraud, in 2016 suspected frauds amounted to just under 0.3% of the overall programme and approximately half that money was recovered.  Although some of it is categorised as fraud, in reality in some cases we were deal with the likes of theft of stock from a warehouse, for example, where recovery would not be possible.  As the pull towards humanitarian crises and working in what are essentially failed states increases, the risk of fraud increases as well.  The efforts we must put into understanding those risks and mitigating them as best we can while accepting we can never completely exclude them is an increasing part of our work and the time we put into the aid programme at senior management level.<\/p> <p>  The only point I should make about Ireland's footprint overseas is that it is not just about missions, embassies and consulates.  ODA is also a very important part of our footprint overseas and our diaspora and culture are also part of our overseas footprint.  It is important to think about it in the round in those terms.  In any discussion about footprint we would speak about development activities, including through multilateral organisations, as an important part of Ireland's footprint.<\/p> <p>  I might skip the Good Friday Agreement but Deputy Crowe mentioned the matter of control.  I have dealt with that.  The concept of selling Irish Aid to constituents was mentioned and I could not agree with the idea more.  Mr. de B&uacute;rca mentioned we must continuously think about how we are communicating what we do.  We believe we have a fantastic story to tell and Irish Aid is a great story but getting that out is something we must think about continuously.  We feel we can always do more in that regard.<\/p> <p>  There were questions about Libya and the EU Africa trust fund.  We are very heavily invested in the discussions at EU level both on assistance and support in Libya and the associated political dimensions but our bilateral reach is limited.  We are accredited to Libya from our embassy in Rome.  There are some cases where one must say we simply operating at a distance.  That is the case even in terms of the humanitarian assistance for the crisis around the wider Middle East.  We are accredited to Lebanon and Jordan from our embassy in Cairo, which has a very heavy workload on its hands.  Getting back to the point about control, we have been placing development and humanitarian specialists in embassies close to these humanitarian crises.  For example, we have put a humanitarian specialist into our embassy at Ankara whose brief is to engage full-time with the agencies dealing with that crisis.<\/p> <p>  We have dealt with the matter of communication.  There was mention of the target of 0.7% of gross national income, GNI, and there are large Government policy decisions at stake in this regard.  If we were to reach 0.7% of GNI by 2030, our overall aid programme, on current projected growth rates, would be approximately &euro;2.5 billion.  That would require an increase of approximately &euro;150 million per year between now and then.  That is the scale we are looking at with a growing economy.  What we consider as we project growth are matters of oversight, good governance and control around the aid programme.  In terms of the recent trajectory of funding, our assistance has been growing, albeit at modest levels.  A great deal of the work we have put into Irish Aid over the past number of years has been around managing its reduction, although it was a modest enough reduction.  It was also about considering matters of efficiency as we reduced as well, so as to ensure impact would have been maximised even in years when the funding was reduced.<\/p> <p>  There was a question about measurable results and short-term versus long-term goals.  Mr. de B&uacute;rca has been dealing with this very closely in the field.  As I am conscious of the time I will hand over some of the matters to him now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Burgess"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507190400,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I will pick up one point on the 0.7% of GNI goal.

That was probably no harm.<\/p><p>In regard to the question on results and frustrations, many in Irish Aid are frustrated by having to report quarterly and that is a dilemma.

It is about good communication and we perhaps need to double check that what we ask of organisations is proportionate to the amount of money we give them.  If a higher level of money is given or if it is over a multi-annual period, one needs a higher degree of oversight.  Quarterly reporting is an important part of risk management in terms of financial probity and so on, which is needed, and also if something is not working one wants to be able to understand that as early as possible so the money can be used for something else.  There is never a guarantee that what one starts will deliver what one wants.  One needs to find a balance and that is more art than science.  It is about communication.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Crowe's point about feedback in the context of communication and how we can better relate to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas is well made.  Several Deputies were recently in Uganda and we have resolved to meet them to get their feedback and impressions.  There has already been correspondence in that regard.  That should be done on a more institutional basis in the future.  We do not always know when people go because they can also do so on a private basis.  We are open to being contacted and told that a person has something he or she wants to tell us.  It is a two-way conversation.  The Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, which is part of our relationship with Members of the Oireachtas, is also important in that regard.<\/p> <p>  There were several questions from Deputy Crowe and Deputy O'Sullivan about the European Development Fund, EDF, and how we engage with it.  In part, it goes through the normal EU decision-making processes whereby there is a proposal from the European Commission that goes through various committees on which Irish civil servants are represented and is finally technically signed off by Ministers.  The trick is to get in there before the European Commission makes its proposals.  We use our embassy network in the countries in which we are most engaged in Africa to ensure we are talking to people very far up the food chain in the European Commission to make sure the propositions that come through are ones we can support and endorse down the line.  That also means we have a mechanism on the ground to track what is happening.  We do not have a presence everywhere in the world and there are different priorities in different areas.  For example, if the European Commission comes up with a proposal for using the EDF in Latin America, our ability to influence that is reduced because we have a lesser diplomatic footprint and assistance budget for that area.<\/p> <p>  The broad precept or strategy is set out in a 20-year agreement called the Cotonou Agreement wherein the EU agreed broad terms of engagement with African, Caribbean and Pacific states.  The current agreement expires in 2020 and next year a new set of negotiations between the EU and those countries will begin, which is an opportunity for a reset or a rethink on whether we are doing the right thing.  We are beginning to think about how we can endeavour to get it right.  Although it has not been discussed in any great depth or with the Minister, we would like a continued focus on the least developed countries and Africa in particular.  Brexit may affect the balance of how that works and we must be aware of that.  Classic EU governance structures such as the Court of Auditors and so on are involved.  There is a relationship between the Court of Auditors and our own audit, etc.  There is a lot to this area and I can come back to the Deputies in writing if they wish because I do not want to take up too much of the committee's time.  We are aware of the issue and we accept the premise and so on.<\/p> <p>  A broader issue raised is that we currently give quite a lot of money to multilateral organisations but it is not one cheque.  Some of the money we give to multilateral institutions is at local level.   For example, we might give money to UNICEF in one of our key partner countries to deliver something such as an education process or social protection programmes etc. for young mothers, and that organisation is subject to the normal local oversight rules we would have with any partner.  There is a variable geometry in how we engage with multilateral organisations and we are very conscious of having to ensure we can stand over the money we spend.  If members have a question about any particular partnership, we can come back to them on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I offer my sympathies to the Cosgrave family on the death of the former Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave.

One of the most successful aspects of Irish Government is its involvement in Irish Aid.  It is very sad that no member of the media has thought it worthwhile to come to the meeting to listen to what is being done abroad and to report on it.  All that is ever reported is how we are doing in terms of the 0.7% of GNI goal but there are no questions about how the money is being spent or who knows what it is being spent on.  The witnesses should make a video on the role and work of Irish Aid and tell the world and the people of Ireland what it does, where it does it and that it is not all about money but is about its role and involvement in different organisations and different parts of the world.  I am very serious when I say that because there is a total ignorance of those matters.  It is all about pounds, shillings and pence and nothing to do with the things we have heard of this morning, which is a terrible shame.  One thing I hope will come out of the meeting is for the witnesses to take up my suggestion as it would be very worthwhile.<\/p> <p>  The first people to get the video should be the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas so that they would all be fully aware of the extent and role of Irish Aid and its involvement throughout the world.  This is not just about money, it is about people and their work.  One could put 20 people into a place where one good person would be equal to the 20.  One can waste or spend money or dish it out just to say targets have been met.  I am more interested in where money is going and the input we have in dealing with various problems around the world.  Even if nothing else comes out of the meeting, I hope the witnesses will agree to make a video or similar because people need to know what is being done and they do not currently know that.  I have been a Member of the Oireachtas for approximately 30 years and I did not know the extent of what Irish Aid does.  I knew of the organisation and various aspects of its work but I did not know the full extent of that.  One can issue press releases and so on but that is irrelevant because the media is not interested in that and is only interested in how we are doing in terms of the 0.7%.<\/p><p>That is it.

It makes an extraordinary contribution to the world and Ireland's reputation overseas not just in terms of the level of aid, but also the thought that goes into how that aid is provided and Ireland's championing of untied aid.  I would appreciate it if the witnesses commented on the importance of the untied aid aspect of Ireland's contribution.  Other members have asked how Irish Aid ensures that these concerns are carried forward in multilateral programmes.  We have heard about the work on governance, which has been positive, but there are specific concerns about the militarisation and corporate tying of aid and the danger of aid being used as leverage in immigration control agreements.  How is Irish Aid working to ensure that Irish moneys are not being used in these ways and to influence that policy more broadly?<\/p> <p>  I understand that there used to be a high-level group on policy coherence.  Senator Daly referred to trade and other matters.  Will the witnesses give us a sense of how they engage with policy so as to ensure that our trade and other policies are not undermining the goals towards which they are working?<\/p> <p>  My final question is on the sustainable development goals, SDGs, and builds on the points that were made about communication.  Given that this is an issue of universality, do the witnesses agree that this is an opportunity to reframe?  The SDGs are a game changer, in that they present a chance to reframe long-term rather than short-term thinking and the connection with the Irish public, who are also affected.  It is appropriate that Irish Aid works with governments on particular health programmes, etc.  How does it support civil society in partner countries to engage and be empowered in terms of shaping the SDGs?<\/p> <p>  How does Irish Aid deepen its support for the large number of Irish volunteers who work in the global south and, when they return to Ireland, want to be active in issues of global justice and solidarity?  I ask this in line with last year's development education strategy, which was a positive one.  In the active and dynamic way described by Deputy Barrett, development education is something that all who have travelled overseas can be a part of and return to.<\/p> <p>  What are the witnesses' thoughts on these questions?

The green flag programme has been successful in creating awareness of the environment, not just among schoolchildren, but also among families.  Perhaps there is an opportunity to have a better dissemination of information through second level schools and the third level.

The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has been discussing this matter with us.  The people we are trying to reach, including those in schools, do not consume their information through annual reports.  They consume it through 30-second and 60-second videos.  We have been talking internally about re-examining our skills, including those on bilateral aid missions.  Communication skills are not something that we have put on the front line of our development activities.  It is not the case that the onus for determining how we can better communicate what we are doing is only on us as much as it is on others.<\/p> <p>  All of our bilateral aid is 100% untied.  The OECD picked up on this point when it reviewed our aid.  If we are not unique in that regard in OECD terms, then we are almost unique.  That reflects on trade, in that our bilateral aid is not tied to trade, and on militarisation.  On the latter point, there is discussion under way in the EU, with a Commission proposal that would essentially determine that EU funds would not be used for the procurement of military equipment.<\/p> <p>  One of the issues that we need to consider is security.  The spectrum of what we do contributes to security - human security, food security and gender-based violence - all the way up to the participation of Irish volunteers in international crisis management and peace support operations.  As we speak, 600 Irish people are participating on 14 missions, including in places that are dangerous and not well known, for example, Niger and Somalia.  There is a story that we have yet to tell about how that spectrum of activity contributes to human security in insecure parts of the world.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the SDGs, we should take on board and reflect on the point about support for volunteers who have returned to Ireland.  Once they have come home, they are a major asset and resource for our development activities.<\/p> <p>  We work closely with civil society in our country programmes.  As it must be, a large element of those programmes is directed at building up civil society as an important part of the future of those societies and as a basic assurance that development activities are well run and overseen.  In our foreign policy, one of our two keynote human rights policies - we are the voice for this policy in human rights fora, including most recently at the UN Human Rights Council - is on the protection of civil society space.  At the UN and elsewhere multilaterally, Ireland is rightly seen as a leader on that issue.<\/p> <p>  I attend schools from time to time and am always struck by the images on the walls and the questions asked.  One will not be asked about 0.7%, but one will see images of Irish peacekeepers and Irish Aid in many classrooms.  Mr. de B&uacute;rca can discuss what we do in terms of development education, which has been a strand of our work for some time.  In our transition year programme, for example, we bring transition year students into the Department for a week every year.  A large part of what they do relates to our development programme.  It is always one of the areas on which we get the most positive feedback, but there is scope to do more.<\/p> <p>  Ms O'Connell might speak briefly about the hurricane, after which Mr. de B&uacute;rca might pick up on the other issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#K00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Burgess"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507190400,"counter":565,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Burgess.  As we have indicated, we provide significant support through multilateral organisations, in particular the UN.  In that context, Ireland is the fifth largest contributor to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, CERF, which provides very quick assistance when there is a spike in a particular crisis or in the event of a natural disaster, such as in the Caribbean.  The CERF has recently allocated $10 million to the Caribbean crisis.  Proportionately, therefore, Ireland's contribution amounts to approximately $660,000.  We are considering other contributions.

We are asked about this.  The dual mandate of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon, with responsibility for development and the diaspora, gives us an opportunity to look more closely at this as an aspect of our development policy.  Just as in peace building where we have been working to transfer skills and our learned experience of peace building on this island to Colombia and Mozambique, it is an area of work that can be usefully developed for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Niall Burgess"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507190400,"counter":568,"content":"<p>Malawi has now adopted a national action plan for the diaspora which has been modelled on our own and based on contacts with our system.  It also informed the decision to come here last week and look at how we managed public sector reform.<\/p> <p>  I will confine my remarks to development, education and how we tell our story because that is really important.  We can always do more.  When we were making tough choices in the past few years in the context of budgets, the development education budget was sacrificed in order that we could continue to put money into our key partner countries.  It is something we will have to do better in the next few years. <\/p> <p>  Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett made a good point about the video.  I do not know if anyone saw the RTE documentary \"The Thin Green Line\", but the public reaction was to our ambassador in Sierra Leone and the work she and her team had done there in response to the ebola crisis.  I have been told that the feature prompted telephone calls to the Department and RTE.  That shows that there is interest.  We can probably use all types of media, including video, to get the story out.  It is also about engagement with people.  In that regard, we can build on the strategy we published last year.  We have an Irish Aid visitors centre on Clonmel Street which was formerly located on O'Connell Street and people are visiting it all the time.  As well as the transition year students who visit the Department, we have also developed educational resources that students use in transition year to learn about Ireland's role in development.  We work with some of the teacher unions to build up the knowledge and resources available and the teacher unions twin with schools abroad.  These personal experiences are really important.  There is more we can do and we are open to considering any good and useful suggestions.  I hope, as the budget begins to grow in the next few years, that this will be something that we can come back to and reinvest in and build the bridge back to citizens in new and innovative ways, to tell them about the good work in which they are investing and in which they should take pride.  Anyone who is Irish and has travelled abroad and seen that stuff is an ambassador for the good work both Irish Aid and Irish development NGOs do more broadly.  We can find ways to capture that experience and get the people concerned to go and tell others about what they have seen.  People do not necessarily trust a civil servant when he or she tells them that they are doing a good job, but if somebody else can get the message across that there is good work being done, there is a great value in it.  <\/p> <p>  One of the things we have tried to do is use public events to engage people.  Africa Day is one of the events we organise, but we have had stands at the National Ploughing Championships also.  We try to meet the taxpayer and people with skills to try to engage in dialogue.  This Saturday we are organising a volunteering fair, to which people who are interested in volunteering can come and meet others who have had that experience and hear what it was like.  If they are interested, they can meet others who can bring them on that journey.  That is something we are doing, but I am sure we can do more.  To that end, we are open to considering useful ideas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. de B&uacute;rca and the Secretary General and all of his colleagues for their attendance, interaction with members and responses to the questions asked.

With my colleagues, I look forward to gaining the insights of the committee in the preparation of the new strategy statement.<br\/><br\/>As committee members are aware, in accordance with section 4(1)(<i>b<\/i>) of the Public Service Management Act 1997, as Secretary General, I am required to submit a new strategy statement to the Minister within six months after the appointment of the new Minister to have charge of the Department.  That work is under way.  In keeping with the collaborative approach outlined in A Programme for a Partnership Government and consistent with the approach taken to preparing the existing strategy statement for the period 2016 to 2019, I again wrote to seek the views of the committee.<br\/><br\/>The current strategy statement was approved by the then Taoiseach and Minister for Defence in November last year.  It followed a lengthy and comprehensive process of consultation with stakeholders.<\/p><p>For this reason, the Minister approved our proposal to follow broadly the structure of the current version for the new strategy statement.  The committee has been provided with a copy of the current statement, a briefing note and a copy of the White Paper on Defence.  The current strategy statement establishes the high level goal of the defence organisation as to provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfil all other roles assigned by Government.  This high level goal comprises three broad strategic dimensions: defence policy, ensuring the capacity to deliver and defence forces operational outputs.  Under each, a number of strategic goals are identified which in turn lead to priority objectives and actions.  <br\/><br\/>The Department has a civil-military structure and under the direction of the Minister, responsibility for implementation falls to both military and civil branches.  Implementation is overseen by the high level, joint civil-military strategic management committee on a continuous basis.  This civil-military approach ensures that both civil and military business planning follows a shared view of the strategic goals, objectives and actions.  Our combined aim is to ensure that the requirements of Government across all roles assigned are met.<br\/><br\/>As members of the joint committee will be aware, in August 2015 the White Paper on Defence was published.  This provides the policy framework for the period up to 2025.  The White Paper is developmental in nature.  The White Paper, the programme for Government and the available resource envelope will once again drive the identification of priorities over the three-year period covered by the new strategy statement.  The policy framework set out in the White Paper is flexible and responsive given the dynamic nature of the security environment.  It sets out the roles assigned to the Defence Forces as approved by Government.  As well as providing for the defence of the State from armed aggression, the roles assigned include: continued provision of supports to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the defence contribution to international peace and security; and the defence contribution to major emergencies and civil contingencies.  These non-security supports maximise the utility to the State of defence assets and improve the value for money achieved from defence expenditure.  <br\/><br\/>A key feature of the White Paper is the geopolitical and domestic security environment assessment.  This provided the basis for the defence policy response and other policy requirements that are set out and which, in turn, led to the consolidation of those requirements into revised roles for both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force. <br\/><br\/>Human resources are the key component of capability.  The White Paper sets out an ambitious programme aimed at ensuring that the defence organisation can continue to meet the challenges of a changing world.  We face HR challenges, similar to other areas of the public service, in recruitment and retention of personnel.  Military personnel have a skillset that is very attractive to prospective employers.  We have challenges in recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force.  Significant and prioritised military and civil work is under way across the full spectrum of HR matters.<br\/><br\/>On the equipment front, the immediate requirement is to fully support the Defence Forces in undertaking the tasks required of them.  Major equipment platforms will be replaced over the life-time of the White Paper.  Programmes well under way include the upgrade of the Army&rsquo;s fleet of armoured personnel carriers, the Naval Service vessel replacement programme and the replacement of the Air Corps&rsquo; Cessna fleet.<br\/><br\/>There were 88 separate White Paper projects identified to be completed over a ten-year period.  A joint civil military White Paper implementation facilitation team was established to support and monitor progress.  To date, 36 projects have been initiated and are at various stages of development. Projects were prioritised taking account of the Programme for a Partnership Government, existing workloads, available resources, linkages identified during the project planning phase and initiatives that were already under way.  <br\/><br\/>The White Paper introduced a new process of fixed cycle defence reviews to occur at three-year and six-year intervals.  I can confirm that the first such review will be commenced by the Department in July 2018 with a White Paper update and this will include a review of the geopolitical and domestic security environment.  The intention is to remain adaptable and to focus on Ireland's participation in the collective response to emerging challenges to our security.  <br\/><br\/>Our commitment to the relationship with veterans&rsquo; policies, the Defence Forces representative associations and partnership will be restated in the statement.  The development of the important contribution of Civil Defence and of the Office of Emergency Planning will be included. <br\/><br\/>The strategy statement will recognise that there are important cross-departmental dimensions to the work of defence.  Meeting our goals and objectives is often critically dependent on the inputs and co-operation of other Departments and State agencies and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Department officials and Defence Forces personnel are represented on a number of interdepartmental groups and committees which consider a range of cross-cutting issues that impact on Government.  The importance of whole-of-Government approaches to the security of the State will again be pursued.  We will continue to collaborate with a range of Departments and agencies that have security responsibilities as well as the newly-established Cabinet committee F and the Government task force on emergency planning.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue as a key strategic partner, with which we have a close and effective working relationship in areas such as UN peacekeeping, Common Security and Defence Policy, international security policy, disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control and sustainable development.  <br\/><br\/>As always, the new draft will be produced through civil-military collaboration.  While I am statutorily required to submit a strategy statement to the Minister, I will as always proceed on the basis of having an agreed approach with the Chief of Staff on the content of my proposals.  Furthermore, the Defence Forces representative associations have also been invited to contribute to the process and we look forward to receiving their views. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":575,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Quinn.

If the Government is going to drop the idea of Ireland being a neutral country and declaring it in policy paper after policy paper, we should have that discussion.

The policy position on neutrality is set out in chapter 3 of the White Paper on defence, which picks up on the global strategy put out by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as well.  In the round, the purpose of the strategy statement is to drive action and implementation.  We want to get into key performance indicators in order that they drive the business planning and so on.  It is the outcome and output stuff we are really after, which is why we do not pick one or other policy and restate policies, particularly in the strategy statement.  However, I understand the point the Senator is making about neutrality.<br\/><br\/>The conciliation and arbitration scheme, along with all public service conciliation and arbitration schemes, has come through the period of austerity and faced challenges during that time.  We have had an observer at the review that was carried out and the report that was published into the conciliation and arbitration scheme in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  I can confirm that the Minister has announced that, by the end of the year, we will be undertaking a review of the conciliation and arbitration scheme in the defence family.  It has been there since the early 1990s.  It was a sea change in the way industrial relations were conducted within defence and, in my opinion, it brought many benefits to the members of the Defence Forces and the Defences Forces as an organisation in terms of how it has improved over time.  However, we have been through a difficult time.  It is timely and we will have the terms of reference for the review of the conciliation and arbitration scheme ready shortly.  The review will be launched by the end of the year.  Work is under way on that one.  It will be one of our actions arising from the strategy statement.<br\/><br\/>I will set out the context for the climate survey.  It arose out of the independent monitoring group, which went back over 12 years and was a concerted effort by the Department and our military colleagues to address interpersonal relations, bullying and harassment within the Defence Forces, so it has a wider remit than industrial relations and conciliation and arbitration.  It is important to note that this is what that grew out of and that we do not lose sight of the underlying motivation for it.  The climate survey surveyed 10% or so of members of the Defence Forces and has raised challenges across a range of areas.  Obviously, pay is one challenge but there are a range of others in the areas of communications, leadership and so forth.  Based on our contacts with the Chief of Staff, I know that a significant amount of work has been undertaken within and by the military authorities in consultation with PDFORRA and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, in terms of the response to the climate survey and the actions taken on foot of that.  In respect of the Minister's point of view, I do not know the exact date but I know that there is a date in the diary for meeting the representative associations on the follow-up to the climate survey - the commitment given by the Minister.  I can confirm that separately.<br\/><br\/>There is no single response to the climate survey.  It covers a range of the actions that are happening in human resources such as recruitment, retention, our contact with the representative associations and the changes we are making in recruitment and so on.  One thing that is driving things on our side is the fact that many individual issues came up such as the contracts for soldiers, what are known as the post-1994 contract soldiers.  There were a range of issues.  What it comes down to is having effective workforce planning for the Defence Forces into the future.  A lot of work is ongoing, both civil and military, to ensure that those White Paper projects that deal with human resources capture and put our arms around workforce planning.  That is about analysing the gaps that are there and how best to fill them in order that we have a more coherent plan going forward.  That is quite a long-winded way of saying all that feeds into the response to the climate survey.  It is all about achieving excellence and ensuring the Defence Forces continue to be an employer of choice for young people.<br\/><br\/>The last second-hand equipment we bought consisted of the <i>L&Eacute; Ciara<\/i>and the <i>L&Eacute; Orla<\/i>and that was many years ago.  I am not aware of us procuring anything second-hand from the UK.  We put a lot of work into ensuring that the Defence Forces have the best kit that supports what they need to do.  Members know that we have a major ongoing programme of procurement for the Defence Forces, including aircraft, the ships programme and updating the armoured personnel carriers for use overseas.  That is the high-level stuff.  There is a range of more detailed stuff beneath that.  If there is anything, I can come back to the Senator regarding the recent procurement of second-hand equipment.<br\/><br\/>I am limited in what I can say about airspace.<\/p><p>What I can say is that the provision of intercepting jets or jets for Ireland was one of the issues that was considered when we were doing the White Paper.  The cost versus the benefits that could be achieved were such that it is something that we are committed to coming back to in due course.<\/p><p> With regard to overflights, the lead on that is with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is not appropriate for me to comment on that here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":581,"content":"<p>I seek a commitment.

I would agree the Irish people would abhor spending &euro;50 million or &euro;100 million on jets that would have no real value in the long run.  However, some form of multi-purpose helicopter, more often used for civilian assistance and rescue and patient transfer, would probably be something that we and the public and could support.

There are a number of issues.<\/p><p>It is important that we engage as early as possible in any of the plans around the Defence Forces.  I have greater engagement with the Defence Forces since being made defence spokesperson in this D&aacute;il and that has led to me raising major concerns about issues such as health and safety, and pay and conditions, in particular, capacity.  On some of those, I will not exercise as fully as I have in the Chamber.<\/p><p>I will concentrate on a number of points.  One I was going to raise has already been raised by Senator Daly is that neutrality should be reflected in the document.<\/p><p>The second point on that issue of neutrality is that there seems to be a clamour to get the Defence Forces involved in operations overseas which are dubious in terms of Ireland's neutrality.  I have had the argument around Operation Sophia and other operations.  The point I want to raise on this aspect is that in the past, the EU was prevented from going as far as it intended because the British, for their own selfish reasons, did not want the EU to develop its EU army capacity.  With the British now involved in Brexit, if the State wants an ally - even though for their own and totally different reasons to ours because they wanted to enhance NATO - that bulwark is gone.  Does Mr. Quinn expect that the Defence Forces or the State will come under more pressure to accede to that agenda than we have seen in recent times?<\/p><p>Another point Mr. Quinn was asked about was procurement.  Over the years I have raised the issue of the purchasing of military goods from countries which are not ethical.  In this instance, I refer to Israel and the purchase of drones from Israel.  Over the past ten years, we have purchased up to &euro;16 million worth of equipment from Israel.  There needs to be some mechanism to prevent the importation of material which is being sold as war tested.  The war that they refer to in terms of those drones is where they attacked civilians in Gaza and elsewhere, and here we have the Defence Forces purchasing such equipment.  Surely there has to be somewhere in the world where we can purchase the drones which we are only starting to develop as an arm in the Defence Forces other than those who are clearly breaching every EU trade agreement rule.  Just because the EU will not enforce that, it does not mean that we should accede to the EU cowardice on this issue.<\/p><p>A key element of a strategy for the Defence Forces that I am impressed with are the tables on the operations as an aid to the civil power.  The support from the Irish public lends a lot to those operations which are carried out.  For the Defence Forces to grow in the future, there needs to be even greater co-operation in using the military for such operations, such as inter-hospital transfers for operations and assistance in severe weather.  I would expect a greater more urgent response.  For instance, I note there were issues recently with deployment to Donegal.  There was a delay while different people decided who was insuring whom.  If that can be dealt with in advance so that there is not any delay, upon a severe weather occurrence and the chaos that entails, the Army can be <i>in situ<\/i>as quick as any other of the services.<\/p><p>Something that has caused major concern is the capacity of the Air Corps to respond to air search and rescue missions.  We saw the tragic events with the helicopter Rescue 116.  In particular, with the inter-hospital transfers, a children's hospital was told late last year that there would no longer be a guarantee of transfers for organ transplants to England.  What steps have been taken to address that and when will the issues, in terms of lack of personnel, be realised?  The Defence Forces need personnel to be trained and there are personnel leaving the Defence Forces in greater numbers than before.  When will that gap be plugged?<\/p><p>I might come back on one or two other issues.  Finally, I refer to the loss of personnel.  Among many of those who have left, the pay and conditions is a reason that is being given.<\/p><p>I know that another round of recruitment was announced either this week or last.  It seems that there is a desire out there to join the Defence Forces but that the numbers shrink by the time candidates get through the various checks and balances, training and medical tests, and then further shrink once recruits start living the life of a soldier or sailor.  We are losing many so there needs to be a greater concentration on retaining both those currently in and those in the process of joining the Defence Forces.  Otherwise we will have severe capacity problems and will not even be able to fulfil our laudable UN and other overseas missions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#Q01000","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":591,"content":"<p>We have just been listening to Irish Aid and hearing about the various programmes it has around the world.  We know that we in Ireland have a very considerable reputation when it comes to humanitarian engagement and peacekeeping.  I share the concerns of my colleagues over Irish neutrality, however.  Reading the strategy statement and looking in particular at the section under \"Partnership for Peace\" concerning military capabilities, I find that the concepts of \"peace\" and \"military\" do not sit easily together.  I know that we want to live in a conflict-free environment and everybody should be able to do so.  Despite what both the witnesses here today and the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, have said, there are concerns that there is a constant undermining and picking away at our neutrality and that before we know it we could end up in a situation that is completely at odds with it.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the witnesses could give an update on what is happening in the Mediterranean.  We had a lengthy debate on this in the D&aacute;il at one stage and many of us expressed our concerns on the changes there.  Perhaps they could also tell me when the Western Sahara engagement took place.  Is there an Irish presence in Afghanistan and Iraq as part of the various UN groups there?  Finally, some of us were in Georgia recently and saw the value of the mission there along the border with South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and the support that mission was giving to the people living in those border areas.  These people had direct contact with the mission - we met an Irish person with a military background who involved there - and we really saw the benefit in that particular situation.  Ireland's reputation is so important and respected and I do not want to see it undermined by our being absorbed into other operations where we will not be able to maintain it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#R00200","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I would like to note very positively the fact that the human rights and equality duty has been highlighted in the draft strategy.  That is something that all Departments and public bodies should place at the centre of their work.  I will touch on some of the same concerns raised by my colleagues here, but I would like some more specific detail in the responses to some of them.  Neutrality is not simply another policy.  It is, first of all, the context in which Ireland operates and has operated for a very long time.  It is also the current policy.  There is a very serious concern here, however.  I note in the strategy the line stating that \"the intention is to remain adaptable and to focus on Ireland's participation in the collective response to emerging challenges to our security.\"  It would not be appropriate for a strategy to simply anticipate that there may or may not be neutrality.  We have had recent statements from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade reiterating Irish neutrality.  Neutrality is the policy within which the Department is producing this strategy and should be at its centre, and not simply mentioned in the introduction.  I would go a bit further than Senator Daly in this regard.<\/p> <p>  It has never been more crucial that we tease out how Irish neutrality, as our current, stated form fits with a number of specific areas.  I will outline three or four areas where this needs to be addressed.  The first is how Ireland's neutrality and Ireland's Defence Forces link with peace-building.  This is very important.  Europe and Ireland must both remember that peace-building is not the same as securitisation.  It would be very useful if reference could be included in the strategy, not only to the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but also to detail on how the Defence Forces want to support Ireland's peace-building role: nuclear non-proliferation, for example; our background in cluster munitions; that body of peace-building work that Ireland has done in the world.  How does the Department support this in practical terms?  What safeguards are in place to ensure that no actions of the Irish Defence Forces will in any way compromise Ireland's international work in active peace-building, with regard to UN Security Council Resolution 1325, for example?  <\/p> <p>  There are specific areas where I believe due rigour needs to be taken and I would like to know what practical measures are in place and how might they be reflected.  Ireland has moved from an observer status to now taking up the chair of the European Union military committee.  This is obviously a great honour for Ireland but it is also a very serious responsibility in terms of our neutrality.  We previously had observer status because our neutrality was recognised as a concern.  How do we now mind that role?  In this new role Ireland will be advising Federica Mogherini, the EU Foreign Policy Chief, who, it has been widely been reported, has been looking at proposals for an EU military structure that might act autonomously from NATO.  There is a tension there that needs to be addressed.  I would like to know how it will be addressed and how Ireland will maintain that role.  There is also the question of the EU weapon fund, specifically in the context of a push for European militarisation, and the question of EU battlegroups.  These are all issues that will need more rather than less attention and slippage if we take on a senior role like this.  Operation Sophia has been mentioned.  The Minister stated in his speech recently that Ireland would not take part in aspects of Operation Sophia that lay outside of the UN mandate.  Should we be involved in Operation Sophia at all if it takes part in such actions?  Is it appropriate?  There is a question over what Ireland should do if actions take place in breach of that mandate.  <\/p> <p>  Points have also been raised on the question of equipment.  Ireland's purchases of military hardware and weaponry from Israel are a matter of concern.    I have a further concern over our support for the military hardware industry and was very concerned to read in the Cork newspapers this weekend, for example, of the involvement of the Irish Naval Service in the testing and thus effectively the promotion of military equipment.  Perhaps the witnesses might clarify whether or not we have control over where that equipment in sold and whether it is used in situations outside of the triple-lock mandate; I imagine that we do not.  Is it appropriate that we be addressing our resources towards a private company's manufacture of equipment in that way?  These are some of my central concerns.  I also think that concerns over the mandate of the British army need to be addressed.  If we have a strategy then we need to know, not just that it will be responsive, but that it recognises the key concerns and dangers currently facing us in 2017 and indicates how Ireland hopes to address them.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#R00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507190400,"counter":593,"content":"<p>The best way to start my response is to state that Ireland's policy is that of effective multilateralism.  That means participating in the international community to the greatest extent possible, both as part of our obligations to that international community and also for our own national purposes.  With regard to developments in the European Union, work in that field is all carried out under the direction of the Heads of State and Government in the European Council and within the context of the Lisbon treaty.  There are many conversations taking place at present about the changed security dynamic in the European neighbourhood and within the European Union, and the effect that this is having on security and defence perspectives within the EU.  We are working with both our defence and military staff and with our foreign affairs colleagues in Europe to present the Irish position on this.<\/p><p>Everything we do is within the scope of the treaties but there is no doubt that there is a greater focus on security and defence in the European Union and that we are participating in the conversations in that regard.  To the extent that we can, we frame those in a way which recognises national positions, including our policy of military neutrality, and the positions of others.  It is a fact that there is a major overlap in membership between the EU and NATO and that there is a major focus from other countries on ensuring there is no duplication between the two.  Most countries have only one set of military personnel for use on all fronts.  We are comfortable with the nature of the relationship between the EU and NATO because it respects the principles and separate decision-making autonomy of both bodies.  That is what is moving on there.<\/p><p> On our participation, I will go back to one point of detail.

We have participated very actively in the Common Security and Defence Policy of the European Union from day 1.  It all takes place within the context of the UN charter.  It improves our capacity to participate in peacekeeping missions and adds to the security of the European neighbourhood, thereby impacting positively back into the security of the European Union.  There is a range of structures around the Common Security and Defence Policy, including the External Action Service, the Military Committee and the military staff, but it is important to point out that when one looks at what the European Union is doing, it has what is called \"the comprehensive approach\".  This is the whole range of capabilities the European Union can deploy from aid to diplomacy, finances and military and civil emergency capability.  All of those are part of the capabilities available to the European Union to deploy.  The military is one of those and we are aware of the missions the European Union has deployed on.  We have participated proudly on all of those bar one and we work within the policy parameters set down by the Government to fulfil our obligations to the European Union in that regard.<\/p> <p>  That leads on to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's point around interaction with other militaries.  We talk internally about being a partner of choice when we are participating in overseas missions.  We will never deploy alone because we are not big enough.  We will always deploy with others.  It is very important that our colleagues in the Defence Forces can interact closely with those with whom they are deployed.  Their safety depends on it as well as the efficacy of the mission.  It comes down to very small things such as whether the wheel nuts on a truck can be used or a nozzle fitting and it goes right up to the use of ammunition, doctrine and communications.<\/p> <p>  When we are deployed with Estonians and Finns in southern Lebanon, we must be as close as we can possibly be to work with them.  Partnership for Peace is a very important part of achieving that.  Some of the work that is going on in the European Defence Agency is an important part of that also.  It is very hard to separate our participation in peacekeeping missions from having the capacity to participate effectively in those by being interoperable with others and engaging with them.  That is a key point of the business and the way we go forward in what we do.<\/p> <p>  There are no Irish Defence Forces personnel deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq.  I might have to come back to the committee on the detail of the Western Sahara MINURSO mission.  It is a long-standing UN mission and there are three Defence Forces members in Western Sahara at the moment.  All of our missions are kept under review on an ongoing basis and I can get the committee more detail should members wish to have it.  A ship is due to depart tomorrow to participate in Operation Sophia and it will hopefully be on station by the following Friday.  It is a proud day for the Naval Service as this is its first time participating in a UN-mandated mission.  We wish them well with that.  The point about Operation Sophia is that there are stages to the mandate.  As with all military participation in peacekeeping missions, nations put in caveats as to what they will and will not do, some of which is down to national policy.  Because of the triple lock, we will not participate in any part of the mission which is not covered by the UN mandate.  That is not unusual for us.  In any event, the third part of Operation Sophia has not been activated.  It is part of feet-on-the-ground in Libya.  I can come back to the committee on the detail of that.  We are participating on the high seas and it is all within the UN mandate set out for the mission.<\/p> <p>  I am bouncing around a bit but I turn to the purchase of equipment from Israel.  Members will be aware that our task is to ensure we get the best kit for our colleagues within the Defence Forces.  There is a principle which governs the way we do that, which applies to all of government, namely, the tendering process.  We have to deal impartially with all of the companies which are entitled to enter into procurement competitions.  We have to work on that basis.  Barring Israeli companies from entering tendering competitions for the provision of military goods would be akin to Ireland unilaterally placing an embargo on such goods from Israel.  This would be a foreign policy matter and outside the remit of the Department of Defence.  We work according to Government procurement rules and the EU procurement rules.  Israel is not precluded from tendering within Europe, not just in relation to defence equipment, but more widely.<\/p> <p>  Members will be well aware of the challenges we have in the Air Corps.  We had a problem with pilots for some considerable period of time.  They get fantastic training and they are really good people who are very attractive to outside employers.  With the pension arrangements in place, we have had a bleed of pilots over a long period of time.  On top of that, we had the air traffic controller situation as a result of other employers coming on the scene.  Comprehensive work is in place to get the Air Corps back up to full capacity.  Members will be aware that we made a very strong submission to the public service pay commission on pay for pilots and air traffic controllers.  The commission's report recognises that there are specific issues in defence and refers to pilots.  That is where we hope to address them quite soon.  We will get behind the issue of how to retain our pilots.<\/p> <p>  We have four air traffic controllers in training currently with up to eight more in line for training.  The aim is to get back up to full speed gradually, albeit I cannot provide an exact timeline for the committee.  It is a function of the amount of work going on in the Air Corps, but we aim to be back on schedule with air traffic controllers in the Air Corps during 2018.  I note that this afternoon five new pilots will be commissioned into the Air Corps.  The challenge is that they are young pilots and they have to develop their experience while we are losing more experienced personnel.  The challenge is to keep the experienced people.  The Minister has told us to look at the potential for re-entry, whereby pilots, in particular, who have left may wish to return.  We have been asked to find a way to take them back because of their skills and experience.  The other avenue is direct entry whereby we might be able to take in people who became pilots by other means.  We are looking at everything we can to keep and recruit pilots.<\/p> <p>  We are working very closely with the Department of Health on the restrictions on the Air Corps and their impact on inter-hospital transfer to ensure that patients can be got to the UK.  There were two out-of-hours emergency transfers in the last couple of weeks, which the Air Corps managed to carry out.  However, the challenge is that the Air Corps needs its experienced people to train up air traffic controllers and pilots.  If we expect those people to be on-call from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m., they will not be available during the day for training.  As such, we need a bit of space.<\/p><p>That is why it is a moveable target in terms of getting everybody up and running next year.  We need a bit of space to get that done.  We are working very closely with the Department of Health and HIQA on the means by which that service can be provided.  It was always the intention that the Coast Guard would be a backup and that the private sector would be a backup.  We were never a dedicated service for transfers; it was always on an as-available basis.  That would mean we would have available an aircraft, a crew and air traffic controllers.  That out-of-hours availability is certainly quite significantly reduced at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#S00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I wish to follow up on some issues, which were also mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, has repeatedly stated that the loss of highly skilled personnel is as a result of their skills being much sought after in the private sector.  I believe the Taoiseach also referred to that recently.  I know from my interaction with members of the Permanent Defence Force at local level that morale is low.  Unfortunately that is a key ingredient in losing people.  Based on the timetables of some personnel that I have seen, the work-life balance is not sustainable.  Some personnel have excessive duties.  Whenever the issue of the 9,500 that are needed and that are not there at the moment is raised in the D&aacute;il or elsewhere with the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, he continually refers to the huge numbers seeking to join the Permanent Defence Force.  I understand that very large numbers are applying online to join.  There are sequential tests in process in the recruitment campaign.  By the final stage of recruitment the numbers vary very significantly from the numbers that initially applied.<\/p> <p>  The submission by the Department of Defence to the Public Service Pay Commission mentioned retention issues; I believe the Department badly needs a retention policy.  The Permanent Defence Force has key highly trained specialists whose skill sets were hard earned at considerable cost.  The State is losing those people.  We need a policy to retain those people.  It is not just the attraction of the private sector.  In many instances the private sector may not have all the great benefits we hear about times.  The public service is also a good employer overall.  Morale is very low in the Permanent Defence Force.<\/p> <p>  As other members will have heard me say often, we are all very influenced by where we come from.  I have the privilege of representing a constituency comprising two south Ulster counties where we had a long Army tradition until, unfortunately, D&uacute;n U&iacute; N&eacute;ill Barracks was closed a number of years ago.  We will not go back on that, but it was a terrible decision.  We no longer have an Army barracks between Finner in south Donegal and Frank Aiken Barracks in Dundalk.  Unfortunately the Border narrative is coming back again in our country.  I had thought that had been removed from our psychology after 1998.  As a person who lives in a Border community and has the privilege of representing two Border counties, we need to factor in that border controls may again be imposed on our island - although we sincerely hope that will not happen.<\/p> <p>   We badly need a retention policy to retain those highly skilled, competent and dedicated people.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and others referred to the concerns everybody has over the Air Corps personnel.  Unfortunately, we had the terrible tragedy of the loss of Rescue 116 off the Erris coast.  We discussed that matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, during oral questions in the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Defence's capital review refers to &euro;28 million transferred from pay to capital.  The Minister of State will claim that the number of personnel is at approximately 9,500; I understand it is at 9,000.  Are we being given the true figures for the number of people who may be doing further training, people who may be seconded or people who may be out on sick leave?  At any time how many are available to carry out their duties?<\/p> <p>  I put the following point to the Secretary General and it should be put to the Minister of State and the Government.  Why should &euro;28 million be transferred from pay to capital?  We have an inadequate number in the Permanent Defence Force and obviously the pay and conditions are not satisfactory.  That &euro;28 million was used on new ships for the Naval Service.  None of us disagrees with upgrading the fleet.  We all appreciate the good work being done by Naval Service personnel in the Mediterranean.  On numerous occasions members of the committee have paid tribute to the personnel.  We take pride in the fact that Irish people were able to rescue people in the most terrible circumstances.<\/p> <p>  We cannot justify the transfer of &euro;28 million from pay to capital.  If the Government decides on a capital programme for fleet replacement, it is up to the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform, and Defence to fund it and not to rob the payroll budget.  Based on my interaction at local level with serving of the Permanent Defence Force and also with retired members, who still take great pride in our Defence Forces, I would say that morale is very low and it needs to be improved.  I hope that the robbing of the payroll budget will not recur. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#T00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":599,"content":"<p>There are a number of issues.  The example of the Air Corps is the one of which most people are aware.  There are problems in ordnance, engineering and other sections of the Defence Forces which are losing personnel.  The Defence Forces as a whole are under-strength.  The Reserve is another example and is well below its intended strength.  Even with the current recruitment and the one announced last week it is just running to stand still.  Part of the Secretary General's job, and our job as well, is to make the Defence Forces attractive to encourage people to join it.  Concerns about pay and conditions, stories about soldiers sleeping in cars and sailors sleeping on board because they cannot afford onshore accommodation make it unattractive.  The new fleet and new equipment help to make it attractive.  Laudable overseas operations such as the Naval Service's involvement in Operation Pontus encourage people as does all the other aid to the civil power mentioned in the Department's strategy document.<\/p> <p>  The disputes with PDFORRA or RACO are also a contributing factor.  Representative organisations feel they cannot fully engage and are not properly recognised.  There has not been proper heed of the European Court of Justice judgment on recognition of police force and army representative associations akin to trade union status.  We still await any significant movement on that.  That makes it attractive because people joining know they will have some protections for their pay and conditions when not on active service.<\/p> <p>  In the past year we saw some major movement in the restoration or at least some recognition of allowances for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for nurses.  The same type of movement has not happened for those in the Defence Forces; that needs to be accelerated.<\/p><p>Looking from the outside in, part of the problem with the Air Corps is that pilots are trained on the wrong planes.  If they are trained to be Cessna pilots, of course they are going to be attracted to the private sector.  If they were trained on purely military equipment, their skills would not be as flexible.  Considering we have very little use for a Cessna, why is our Air Corps training on one and using other equipment which does not have a military function in the way the likes of helicopters would?<\/p><p> Do the witnesses expect us to be further ahead at the end of the next recruitment drive? This week, PDFORRA said that up to 3,000 members have retired early in the last five years.  That is a huge figure.  In the recruitment process, if those who have expressed an interest are whittled down to several hundred as is envisaged, there is going to be a bigger problem for us in the years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#T00300","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":601,"content":"<p>It is very important to be clear that the policies of effective multilateralism and military neutrality are both in force.  There is not a hierarchy placing one above the other.  They are complementary policies that work very closely together.  Ireland's policy on military neutrality allowed it to play a key and effective role in pressing for multilateral initiatives on disarmament and in driving forward other peace-building initiatives globally, work of which we are very proud.  Even at this late stage, it would be very useful if the strategy was able to illustrate the complementary relationship between those two imperatives.<\/p> <p>  Operation Sophia was mentioned.  It may not be possible to answer some of my questions today but I would appreciate if we could get a written answer subsequently.  Everyone is extraordinarily proud of the work Irish ships have done in the Mediterranean, which led to the saving of 17,500 lives with one Irish vessel in action at any given time.  Under the previous EU mission, an average of five ships in action at any given time saved a total of 34,200 or so lives.  There is a concern that, on its own, Ireland has been two or three times more effective than the EU ships in terms of the saving of lives.  It is very important that we monitor and check that engaging in Operation Sophia does not make us less effective in terms of humanitarian search and rescue.  How will that be measured and tracked?<\/p> <p>  The Irish Navy seems to have been engaged in the testing and promotion of private companies' military equipment, the ultimate destination and usage of which is not known.  That is a very serious concern.  This is not suggest that Ireland is necessarily breaching anything.  However, we have a special duty at this time.  <\/p> <p>  The witness spoke at length about the EU treaties and the space within them.  It might be important to clarify that the space for Ireland's military operation - what it can and cannot do - is not solely defined by the EU treaties but by the treaties and UN mandate - the places where they overlap.  I am concerned that in some of their responses, the witnesses have said that the EU treaties permit this or do not permit that, or that they are confident something will not be outside the EU treaties.  We also have serious obligations in terms of the UN.  That is our check.  When we talk about multilateralism, I am concerned that the specific relationship of Ireland with the UN and the dual mandate is not strongly visible within the strategy.  It needs to be teased out.  We have very different political and military mandates from our EU partners.  <\/p> <p>  I strongly recommend that the strategy includes reference to how the work of the Defence Forces intersects with the work of peace-building and the guarding of appropriate good practice.  Ireland is now calling on Europe and the world to pay attention to the peace-building process in Northern Ireland, as the Chairman very eloquently described.  We have a very important situation there and know how important peace-building is.  It is vital that we maintain our international credibility in that area.  How is that being safeguarded?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#U00200","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507190400,"counter":602,"content":"<p>I will start with the point about recruitment and retention.  I agree that it is a priority to do whatever it takes to ensure that the Defence Forces can operate effectively.  Part of that is morale, part of it is recruitment, and part is retention.  It is a priority for me and for the Chief of Staff.  Turnover in the military is universally higher than is the norm in the public service.  That is part of the nature of the work and the career and, quite often, of the pension arrangements that are in place.  That is one of the issues we have always addressed.  The departures we have had for the last while are marginally higher.  A trend can be seen over the years in the numbers leaving; they are impacted by the strength of the economy in which we are working.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned that a new recruitment campaign opened in the last week.  There has been significant change.  We are going to have two recruitment campaigns per year and will seek to dovetail them with the school-leaving period and things like that.  There is a huge amount of work going on, which we will see coming through.  I am also hopeful that a smoother flow of recruitment will free up resources to focus on getting more successful recruitment into the Reserve.  We still have enough people applying to fill all the posts we have, but the overall numbers applying are falling.  We certainly have enough people applying for the cadets and the enlisted personnel.  We are working on making the recruitment process much smoother in terms of how we communicate with applicants to keep them with us so they are ready to go when we are ready to take them in.  Our statistics on the numbers leaving include 20% who leave during initial training.  That is one matter for discussion internally.  People join and find early on, for whatever reason, that military life is not for them.  That is a retention issue which we are looking at as well.<\/p> <p>  In terms of trying to get a positive message out about the Defence Forces and to address the morale issue, we know pay is only one of the factors.  It is much bigger than that.  The recent agreement we reached with the Department of Expenditure and Reform and PDFORRA has had a major impact on those recruited since 2013, with their starting pay at the end of training being around &euro;27,000.  With regard to the next public service pay round, that is for voting on by PDFORRA.  We are certainly talking to them and were at their conference just this week.  We will be meeting with them again next week on the issue of allowances and so forth.  That is an ongoing conversation that we have with PDFORRA at the moment and hopefully we will be able to progress there.<\/p> <p>  On the timing of departures, we watch closely the profile of those who are leaving to see how it can feed back into our HR strategies.<\/p><p> An enormous amount of work has been done to try to increase the number of women joining the Defence Forces.  We are still running at a rate of about 6%, but we need to increase the number applying in order to increase the number attested.  We had a meeting during the week with a UK Minister.  As the United Kingdom seems to be slightly ahead of us, we are going to talk to it about whether there are strategies it has used that we could apply.  In fairness to the Defence Forces, the communications unit has done a considerable amount of work to reach out to try to get more women to join the Defence Forces.<\/p><p> With regard to having a work-life balance and the connection to pay, there is always an element of moving members of the Defence Forces to cover brigade areas.  That is part and parcel of knowing and having an operational picture across the whole brigades area.  There is work being done on the issue of having a work-life balance.  A term used in the military is \"harmony measures\".  An example is where a young recruit is located near home.  It is a question of internal mobility and that kind of thing.<\/p><p> With regard to other measures to hold on to personnel, we are considering commissioning from the ranks in order that listed personnel can move into the commissioned ranks.  The chief has been doing a huge amount of work on the issues of diversity and inclusion to address the level of female participation, etc.  There is work under way in workforce planning, the modern term for manpower planning.<\/p><p> On the matter of specialists, including engineers, artificers in the Naval Service and pilots, our next step in part 2 is engagement with the Public Service Pay Commission.  We are working with military colleagues to provide evidence of our experiences to determine how we can interact with them.  It will very much be an evidence-based approach.<\/p><p> On the working time directive, the Minister made a commitment to PDFORRA at the conference this week.  The background work has been completed and we are working closely with the Department of Justice and Equality and the other relevant Departments to have the regulation enacted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#U00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":604,"content":"<p>The pay budget is subventing the capital-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#V00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507190400,"counter":605,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":606,"content":"<p>The sum of &euro;28 million is being taken from the pay budget.

We are currently running in and around a figure of 9,000.  There was a big intake of cadets in the past two weeks.  I suspect that we are now at a figure of just over 9,000.  We issue the numbers regularly, usually in response to parliamentary questions.  An unusual feature is that, throughout the period of austerity, there was continuous recruitment to the Defence Forces.  My understanding is it was the only part of the public service in which there was no interruption of recruitment.  That is the level of commitment to increasing numbers.  It is a fact that, to an extent, we have been standing still for the past couple of years in that the number leaving is matching the number coming in, which is a source of frustration.  The key point for me, however, in terms of what is voted for us is that we have a pay budget for 9,500 personnel and all of the attendant allowances and marginal costs.  It is really important that we keep that budget all the way along in order that when we do get to a figure of 9,500 personnel, we will be fully funded.<\/p> <p>  When it came to the ship replacement programme, we found ourselves with an excess on the pay side because we did not reach the target of 9,500 personnel.  It seemed to us that, rather than surrender it, the most sensible thing to do was to use it to gain the best traction we could in our negotiations with the builder of the ship, such that we would get the best deal.  We used the money on the capital side because we did not make it to the figure of 9,500 personnel.  I really need to stress that we have always had and have the funds for 9,500 personnel, as the Minister has said consistently.  Our ambition is to reach a figure of 9,500 personnel.  I do not believe anybody could question the effort that has gone into recruitment and the numbers we have taken on.  Considering the development we have had, whereby we are to opt for two recruitment campaigns per year, shorten the contact we have and get the fitness element running, I hope we will improve on the position during 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#V00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":608,"content":"<p>On the numbers and the recruitment campaign, is there a similar retention campaign?

A number of people who fell outside the age bracket - one in particular - have contacted me during the years.  They are graduates and fully skilled.  It was a female in one case.  Has there been any thought given to changing the cap considering that people are living longer and more active into their later years?  Some 30 or 40 years ago a 50 year old might have been considered to be unable to carry out certain tasks within the Army whereas now, because of the change in lifestyles and the wealth of our society, 60 year olds could carry them out.<\/p><p> We must capture another situation.  Many people, young people in particular, are staying longer in college.  They seem to be but I might be wrong.  When an opportunity arises to join the Defence Forces, they might be engaged already in something else but are willing to finish their course or whatever.  The cap is either 28 or 29 years of age.

Such an initiative would also address the matter of maintaining a strength of 9,500 personnel.  The change might be something that can be done quite quickly.  It would address an immediate problem but not forever more.

We cannot get around the fact that that is their role.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the Naval Service, the policy, as espoused in the White Paper and the policy to which we are working, is that the Defence Forces interact with the third level sector and with industry.  The benefit to us is early access to technology and the benefit to the company is a test bed of sorts.  There are a couple of really good examples in the Naval Service which have worked very well.  Again, there is nothing untoward.  That is the policy we are working with at the moment.<br\/><br\/>As has been said, we attended the Defence and Security Equipment International, DSEI, fair that took place in the UK.  Four or five Irish companies exhibited there.  Many of the companies, as many as 25 or 26 different international companies, from whom we procure equipment were there as well.  We really need to get out and see what is in the market to ensure we get the best procurement and best value for money for the Exchequer and taxpayers.<br\/><br\/>The presence of the Naval Service ship is an indicator of our long relationship and dates right back to the <i>L&Eacute; Niamh and L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n<\/i>.  It was great to see the pride, particularly of the members of the Defence Forces who were on the ship and the way they could demonstrate their capabilities on the ship over there.  That is the background.<br\/><br\/>I take the point that was made about multilateralism and neutrality.  We just have to see how to capture the point.  There are a whole range of policies that we in the Department of Defence work within when we engage in international missions and engage with the common security and defence policy, CSDP, in the EU.<br\/><br\/>In terms of Operation Sophia, we have always presented outcomes as we went along, and some of them were in press releases.  We will continue to do so.  That is my suggestion of the means by which we will track the impact of what they are doing when they are part of Operation Sophia in terms of the nature of the exercises or missions that they carry out while they are in theatre.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#W00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Maurice Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1507190400,"counter":628,"content":"<p>Can we get the statistics for that aspect?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2017100500002#W00700","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507190400,"counter":629,"content":"<p>Yes, certainly.

I am Gerry Mallon, chief executive officer of Ulster Bank Ireland, designated activity company, DAC.  With me today from Ulster Bank DAC are Paul Stanley, chief finance officer, Eddie Cullen, managing director, commercial banking division and Andrew Blair, head of customer debt solutions.<\/p> <p>  In my opening statement I would like to update members on the progress we have made since we last met with the committee.  I will describe some developments we have implemented across a range of services and products to improve what we do for our customers.  I will provide an update on the tracker mortgage examination and the progress we are making towards resolving that issue and I will also provide an update on Brexit preparations.<\/p> <p>  Ulster Bank is a strong bank with a long history in the Irish market and a loyal customer base.  We have provided banking services in Ireland for 180 years so far.  We are the third largest player in the Irish market and we want to grow our market share.  We are the only systemic bank operating in the Republic that has an overseas parent.  Together with our parent Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, we are developing and investing in a long term strategy for the future of Ulster Bank in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Our half year results published recently show that we are making some good in progress in building a more sustainable, safer and stronger future.  Comparing the first half of 2016 to the first half of 2017 we have increased our operating profit and reduced our operating expenses.  New lending has increased by 11%, risk weighted assets have reduced by 17.7% and customer deposit balances have risen by 10.3% compared to the first half of 2016, supporting a reduction in the loan to deposit ratio.<\/p> <p>  Our conduct and litigation charges were &euro;39 million in the first half of 2017.  This charge reflects a provision for remediation and project costs associated with legacy business issues where we believe errors may have occurred.<\/p> <p>  In the year to June of this year we saw an 11% increase in lending to personal and business customers.  We continue to see year on year growth in new mortgage lending and are targeting to lend approximately &euro;1 billion to mortgage customers in 2017.  I will provide members with more details on our mortgage services shortly.<\/p> <p>  For business customers we saw strong performance in new lending, which reflects a positive response to initiatives such as our export finance roadshow with the Irish Exporters Association, the expansion of our partnership with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI on agri-business, and the revamp of our Business Achievers portal and networking hub.  Business Achievers is a new free digital business hub powered by Ulster Bank that displays our continued support for business customers in the Irish market.<\/p> <p>  The ways in which our customers bank with us are changing radically and in the first half of 2017 we introduced a number of changes to reflect this.  In light of the rapid migration from branch transactions towards digital methods, we introduced two new customer payment systems, Apple pay and android pay, in the first half of this year.  These services, as committee members probably know, allow customers to pay for goods and services simply by waving their mobile phone over a contactless payment terminal, with security provided by a fingerprint or a code.  We want to provide banking services where and how our customers want them.  It is not simply the case that a new generation of young urban customers want to bank exclusively online while older rural based customers want to be able to call into a local branch every day of the week.  Customers want and need a combination of both.  They want fast, convenient, secure services for their day-to-day banking but they need a very different service for those significant milestones in their lives that they reach with the assistance of their bank.<\/p><p> Our branch network remains an important channel for customer engagement.  We announced in March that we would close 22 of our 110 branches in 2017.  Closing any branch is a difficult decision which we do not take lightly, but it does not end our local presence in these areas.  We are improving our retail network by spending &euro;6 million on upgrading and refurbishing branches, extending the services available through An Post for our personal and business customers and introducing other improvements such as fast business cash lodgments, bulk coin deposits and cash and cheque deposit machines.  We are adding two extra banks on wheels to serve rural locations in addition to our three existing mobile banks and appointing six new community bankers to support vulnerable customers and help customers to move towards online and mobile banking channels.<\/p><p> In the past two years, Ulster Bank has strengthened its links with the financial technology startup community through its association with Dogpatch Labs in the Custom House Quay centre, for example involving mentorship programmes for technology startups and hackathon events.  In the past month, Ulster Bank has announced Ireland&rsquo;s first open application programme interface in the banking sector.  This move will help to take open banking in Ireland from concept to reality.  To describe this concept simply, it allows one's bank to be linked with other services.  It is similar to the sharing of information that has allowed services like Hailo and MyTaxi to transform how we use taxis.  It is revolutionary, it is happening globally and it will be happening here.  The application programme interface has been developed using market-leading technology from Ulster Bank's parent company, RBS, and will give approved third parties limited access to a customer's account balance and transaction history if the customer requests it.<\/p><p> RBS and Ulster Bank invest heavily in fraud prevention and detection systems to keep our customers' accounts and information safe and secure.  Training on fraud prevention and detection is mandatory for all our employees, including those who serve our customers.  We recently appointed a new community protection adviser to support our customers and front-line teams on a range of issues, including frauds and scams.  We continue to benefit from RBS's investment in fraud surveillance and its various partnerships; for example, with the UK National Trading Standards as part of the \"friends against scams\" initiative.  This offers up-to-the-minute training for customer-facing teams and helps us to spread the scam protection message to more of our customers and their families and friends.<\/p><p> I would like to make some brief points about mortgage services.  Helping our customers to buy their own homes is one of the most important services we provide.  We have put a considerable amount of work into improving our mortgage services for customers by simplifying processes and reducing the average time spent on an application.  We have introduced a new mobile mortgage manager service, which offers customers the choice of meeting mortgage advisers in their own homes at a time that suits them.  We offer free valuations on new mortgages.  We provide a &euro;1,500 legal fee contribution to provide real help with the cost of moving home.  We have steered away from large cashback offers.  Instead, we focus on consistently offering competitive headline rates.  We offer some of the most competitive rates in the market.  We have a fixed rate that is as low as 2.6% and we have 13 different variable rates that start as low as 3%.  We also offer a 3.7% discounted rate against our standard variable rate of 4.3% for customers with an income-mandated current account.<\/p><p> We do not offer any deal to a new customer that we are not prepared to offer an existing customer.  We have a good proposition that helps existing customers on tracker rates or in negative equity to move home.  We are always working to improve our customer proposition.  We leverage the wider capabilities from RBS to do this.  We recently amended the overpayment allowance on fixed rate products to 10% per annum.  This allows customers to avail of the certainty of a fixed rate while having more flexibility to pay down the mortgage quicker.  As one of Ireland&rsquo;s leading commercial banks, we continue to play an important role in supporting the recovery of the housing market in Ireland.  This includes the provision of financing for new housing developments and accommodation sectors such as purpose-built student accommodation market to help meet current and future housing demands.  Over the last two years, we have committed financing on schemes that will deliver in excess of 1,200 new houses, as well as financing student accommodation to deliver over 1,000 new student living units.<\/p><p> I would like to report briefly on the progress that has been made in the tracker mortgage examination. The Central Bank is carrying out an industry-wide review of tracker mortgage-related issues across all Irish banks.  As part of this review, lenders including Ulster Bank were required to review their entire tracker loan books to identify customers whose contractual entitlements we failed to honour, or in whose cases we did not live up to the standards of full disclosure and transparency that we and the regulator would like to have seen.  We are required to work through four phases under this examination.  The first phase, which involved the development and submission of detailed plans, is complete.  The second phase, which involved gathering information, reviewing and submitting a report, was submitted in line with the agreed Central Bank deadline of March 2017.  The third and fourth phases are running concurrently.  The third phase, which involves calculating the level of redress and compensation, is ongoing.  The fourth phase, which involves the implementation of the redress programme, is also ongoing.<\/p><p> Our second-phase report, which was submitted to the Central Bank in line with the agreed deadline of March 2017, is being reviewed by the Central Bank.  Until the review has been concluded, the second phase will be considered to be ongoing.  Therefore, the number of affected customers may be subject to change.  When the second-phase process was under way last December, we told the committee we had identified 2,000 affected customers.  The completed second-phase report has identified a total of just under 3,500 affected customers.  In line with the process defined by the Central Bank to stop further harm, Ulster Bank has contacted and returned existing customers to their tracker mortgages.  This has not been done in the cases of 57 customers because the original tracker rate would result in a net increase in monthly payments in this small number of cases.<\/p><p> Ulster Bank has begun the third phase, which involves redress and compensation, and the fourth phase. which involves the implementation of the redress programme.  The number of customers remediated so far is small.  It is just under 40 today.  We are starting the process very slowly to test all the calculations for each customer.  We are building up a process to have a much more intensive model for calculation, contact and remediation.  The process will take a number of months.  It will be well into 2018 before all cases are addressed.  Customers will then have a further 12 months to appeal if they are unhappy with any aspect of our redress and compensation payment.  We have not concluded the process of establishing the number of customers for whom the actions of the bank caused the loss of their homes.  We have identified a small number of customers for whom this is the case.  We have made contact with them to begin the process of redress and compensation.  The numbers are currently low but that could change as we work through the process.  I will not be able to confirm the final numbers until we have completed the third phase.<\/p><p> In line with the Central Bank guidelines, we have put in place an independent process to support customers who wish to appeal.  Two independent appeals panels have been established, each of which has a qualified barrister or solicitor as chair, an accountant or actuary and a customer voice representative.  The role of the panels is to assess customer appeals in a timely way and determine whether additional redress is required.  For reasons of efficiency, one panel is dedicated to complex appeals.  An independent secretariat to support administration and customer communication has also been established.<\/p><p> I will turn now to Brexit.  Ulster Bank continues to support its customers during the period of negotiations between the UK and the EU.  As part of RBS, which is a business that focuses on the UK and Ireland while maintaining a good presence in Europe, we are working through the various exit scenarios.  We have contingencies in place to ensure we continue to provide our customers with the full range of services they require, as would be expected of any prudent business.  The fundamentals of our strategic plan remain constant.  Ulster Bank, as a bank regulated in Ireland and the EU, continues to be a core part of RBS.  We have seen a limited impact on retail customers, mainly because none of the changes associated with the UK leaving the EU have crystallised yet.  There has been a mixed response from our small and medium-sized enterprise and business customers, with some sectors affected more than others.  Ulster Bank is helping businesses to prepare for the transition through the Brexit process following the triggering of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union by the UK earlier this year.  Some of our customers are looking at expansion opportunities in the UK as a result of Brexit.  We will be seeking to help to finance and support such expansion plans.  We supported a series of nationwide seminars in association with the Irish Exporters Association which offered businesses the opportunity to meet and network, while hearing from industry and business leaders at a number of regional locations on a range of topics from Brexit to innovation to how to grow one's business.<\/p><p>Ulster Bank engages regularly with the IDA and our colleagues in RBS to help identify businesses from the UK which are considering setting up operations in Ireland with a view to providing banking products and services to them in the Republic of Ireland.<\/p><p> There are many other topics I could address, but I will conclude as I am sure we will have the opportunity cover them during the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017100500002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Mallon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1507192200,"counter":642,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Mallon and his colleagues and thank him for his opening statement and the information provided in advance of the meeting.

A lot of Ulster Bank customers are very interested in this hearing and they have been contacting members with questions and telling us their own stories about the impact this issue has had on them.  As such, it is important that we tease it out.  The headline from the presentation is that the number of impacted customers has risen by 75% from 2,000 to just under 3,500.  How did that happen and when did the bank realise the number had grown so much?  Mr. Mallon told us last December it was around 2,000.

We will provide the committee with numbers on a best-endeavours basis.<\/p> <p>  When we met last December, the one thing that was clear to us was that there was a primary cohort of approximately 2,000 customers where we believed there were issues relating to the tracker mortgage examination.  We had an estimate at that stage of the number that was going to be included in that.  We were also clear that this was a complex programme requiring the examination of tens of thousands of accounts.  There were no defined large individual cohorts, but rather there were multiple small cohorts which needed to be worked through over a period of time.  As we concluded phase 2, we worked through each of those cohorts and made a conclusion or decision as to whether people were impacted and whether there was a need for remediation.  We addressed the 2,000 as quickly as we could in December 2016 and in January and February 2017.  Identifying the remainder has been a gradual process between that point and the conclusion of phase 2 in March.  We were in a position to identify the full number in time for the conclusion of the process in March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017100500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Mallon"},{"type":"speech","time":1507192200,"counter":644,"content":"<p>When were customers put back on the correct rate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017100500002#G00400","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507192200,"counter":645,"content":"<p>The vast majority were put bank in December, January and February of the past year and the last of the 2,500 existing customers would have been concluded by March.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017100500002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Mallon"},{"type":"speech","time":1507192200,"counter":646,"content":"<p>That is March 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017100500002#G00600","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507192200,"counter":647,"content":"<p>In time for phase 2 to have been successfully submitted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017100500002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Mallon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507192200,"counter":648,"content":"<p>There were a few, as we note here, which it was not appropriate to reset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017100500002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Stanley"},{"type":"speech","time":1507192200,"counter":649,"content":"<p>That was 57.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017100500002#G00900","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507192200,"counter":650,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017100500002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Stanley"},{"type":"speech","time":1507192200,"counter":651,"content":"<p>When did the bank start its trawl?

We are not talking about 1 million, 0.5 million or hundreds of thousands of customs but 2,000 customers who in the period of the previous 12 months the bank had identified it was overcharging and it did not put them back on the correct rate.  I can only put it to Mr. Mallon that the bank has been dragging its heels on this.  It only put the last customer onto the appropriate rate, which is the first thing the Central Bank does, right before the deadline the Central Bank laid down of 31 March when the bank had to produce its plan.

If I was able to double the resources and deliver the project twice as quickly, it would not cost me any more money because we would be done more quickly.  The longer this drags on, the more it costs because we need to continue employing outside consultants and so on.  The costs escalate.  There is no incentive for us to drag our feet.

Some payments were higher or lower.  In some cases, customers are entitled to tens of thousands of euro in redress and compensation.  Others are entitled to hundreds of thousands of euro because their homes were taken from them.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned, the figures are staggering.  Some 3,500 people are affected.

We have to measure it against the other banks.  If they can deal with the complexities involved, so can Ulster Bank.  It is good that bankers have come before the committee and apologised.  I am sure customers welcome that.  However, I know, based on what I have heard from them, that those customers want their money, which the bank is holding.  Ulster Bank is still issuing letters advising customers that their accounts are in arrears.  They would not be in arrears if the bank gave them back the money it took from them in the first place.<\/p> <p>  It was stated that phase 2 is finished and that the bank submitted the report by 31 March.

This was the investigation that the Financial Conduct Authority conducted into the activities of GRG in Great Britain.  To be clear, the investigation was undertaken by the Financial Conduct Authority within the United Kingdom.  Ulster Bank chose to adopt the things RBS had committed to at that stage.  There were two parts to that.  One was to institute a new complaints process overseen by an independent third party, who was a High Court judge.  The second part was to undertake an automatic refund of any fees which could be described as complex fees, that is, ones which were perhaps beyond the transparency requirements that might have been appropriate for small and medium-sized enterprise customers.  Throughout that process since 8 November last year, we have been keeping the Central Bank informed of the progress we have made.<\/p> <p>  At this point, we have made a considerable amount of progress in terms of both complaints and the refund of complex fees.  As things stand today, I am happy to share some statistics with the committee.  We have identified 19 customers who would be entitled to a refund of a complex fee.  Of those 19 customers, four have already been refunded the amount due, totalling &euro;362,000.  A further five are in the process of returning the identification documentation we need to make those refunds.  Of the remaining ten, we are working through making contact with those customers and are at the third attempt to make contact with them to make repayment.<\/p> <p>  On complaints, at this point Ulster Bank has received 48 complaints since we went out on the website seeking complaints, which is a period of approximately nine months now.  Of those, four have already been adjudicated.  We are expecting another 13 to be adjudicated by the end of October.  That is approximately 35% of the complaints.  The complaints process is complex and it is overseen by an independent third party.  We will work our way through them as fast as we can.  Given their complexity, we expect that some of those complaints will run into the first quarter of next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017100500002#L02400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Blair"},{"type":"speech","time":1507192200,"counter":790,"content":"<p>Of the 2,140 Irish companies put into GRG, how many had receivers appointed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017100500002#L02500","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507192200,"counter":791,"content":"<p>By Ulster Bank?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017100500002#L02600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Blair"},{"type":"speech","time":1507192200,"counter":792,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017100500002#L02700","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507192200,"counter":793,"content":"<p>Approximately 100.

They will have gone to a number of banks and those banks will have ended up giving them offers.

The consequence has been that the requirement for us in respect of the Central Bank is that we be within our ceiling for the level of exemptions at the end of the year.  This year, and this is possibly coming across in many of the banks, people have seen that, because of the number of offers put out, they are not quite sure what is going to draw down and what is not.  They have coasted up towards the top of their capability in terms of our capacity to be able to offer exemptions.  That means that a number of the banks, including ours, have had to put a little bit of a brake on the exceptions while we wait to see what is in the pipeline and is actually drawn down.

Consider the case of someone who is renting consistently and meets the requirements beyond the deposit requirement, including the requirement for an average loan no more than 3.5 times one's earnings.

The number of businesses that were once viable and became non-viable because of the economic crash was extremely high.  It was an extreme time.  We supported customers over very long periods of forbearance from 2009 to 2015 and simultaneously tried to rebuild an organisation that was capable of supporting growth for our customers for the future.  Part of that process was resolving the significant overhang of customers with non-performing loans.  We could not avail of transferring assets to NAMA at the larger end, and we had to resolve the matter for ourselves, and we set about doing so with the full knowledge and understanding of both our shareholder and ultimately shareholders and the regulators.  We understand that there are customers who would prefer to be dealing with Ulster Bank still, rather than an investment fund, but we had to deal with the issues before us, which included a large overhang of customers whose situation we needed to resolve.

On the point the Senator has made about allegations in the media recently, particularly in Great Britain, I refer to what the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, stated at the time.  On 8 November RBS announced the actions it would take and those actions were undertaken voluntarily by it.  The FCA stated it had seen no evidence that the bank had artificially engineered a position to cause customers to transfer to the GRG and that any customer transferred had been exhibiting signs of financial distress but that there was no widespread practice of transferring customers for inappropriate reasons.  It went on to note that the bank's communications with customers could have been better during the transfer process.  There was a focus on pricing in Great Britain of increased risk at the expense of consideration of long-term viability.  Decisions made were not necessarily well documented and explained.  The last point was about complaints.  That is why actions were taken.<\/p> <p>  There are and have been allegations.  As Mr. Mallon said, they are allegations.  That is the position stated by the FCA in response to the decision by RBS to go voluntarily with the complaints process and the refund of fees.  Beyond that, without getting into individual cases and people talking about what happened to them, it is difficult to address.  I return to the core objective of the bank in its totality - the GRG is a division of the bank - which is to take customers who are in distress and try to find ways to restore them.  The reality is that, unfortunately, not all customers remain viable forever.  Some, in circumstances that may be driven by actions of their own or the economic environment, will prove not to be viable and incapable of being restructured.  I understand the Senator's concerns about the allegations made, but the most we can do is explain what exactly the FCA stated at the time and what its perception of the outcome was.  It could not find support for the contention made in these allegations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017100500002#Q00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Blair"},{"type":"speech","time":1507192200,"counter":956,"content":"<p>Was it purely related to Great Britain?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017100500002#Q00900","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507192200,"counter":957,"content":"<p>It was, but we voluntarily chose to apply the exact same process here.

We were not moving customers who were in the category of doing everything expected of them within the confines of the contractual arrangements we had made with them.  They were customers who had missed payments, of interest or capital, or who had breached loan covenants and needed attention.  The intent, when we moved them to the GRG, was to try to give them the support they needed to survive.  One could argue that it extended from the outset of the economic crisis in 2008 to 2015 before businesses began to see real recovery, probably in Dublin in the first place.  I am sure others know outlying areas of the country much better than I do and who will say parts of the country have still not recovered from a business viability perspective.  I understand people who run businesses have put their life, soul and blood into them and want to keep them alive, but there comes a time when any financial institution - Ulster Bank in this case - will need to make a decision on the future of these businesses and bring certainty to the situation.

These are figures from a recent report in the UK.<\/p><p>Last year Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, set aside &pound;400 million to compensate small businesses.  If you are compensating the small businesses that were affected by what happened to them in GRG, then that in itself is admitting you did not help them, that they were inappropriately put into this particular scheme in the UK and they were inappropriately then dealt with.<\/p><p>If I relate that to what is happening in Ireland, it is in effect the same thing and to a degree, and with respect to both Mr. Mallon and Blair, this is groundhog day.  It is the same thing over and over again.  I am interested in the aspect of the debate around GRG that relates to the number of businesses that were put into GRG that were associated with other businesses, other than the core business.  What efforts were made by the bank to separate out the performing loans before the person was pushed through to GRG and then out?  Why did the bank not make an effort in those years to save the better parts of the performing companies and businesses that had their accounts in the bank before you sent them all off?  It was as if a decision was made to bundle the good, bad and the ugly into one basket and send them to GRG.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017100500002#R00500","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1507192200,"counter":977,"content":"<p>Chairman, I will ask Mr. Blair to answer the second question which is about the efforts that were made to restructure those companies ahead of any portfolio sale or so on.<\/p> <p>  A remark I will make in relation to the Financial Conduct Authority FCA report - which, of course, I have not seen and which has not been published - is that the principal actions undertaken by RBS, which we are also participating in around the refund of complex fees and the establishment of a new complaints process to listen to companies who feel that they were mistreated or not treated properly at some way through the GRG process is something to which we subscribe and we are active in this process.

On the compensation amount, the &pound;400 million to which the Chairman referred, that has been set aside in order to meet the costs of the programme and also to refund the complex fees.  In the context of the complex fees, I quoted some statistics for Ulster Bank earlier.  The total amount involved is just more than &euro;1 million, including interest, and it affects 19 customers that we have identified to date.  We are very close to the end of that process.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the point raised by the Chairman about trying to separate customers that had businesses with attendant other debt that may not have related to those businesses originally but to some other activity, in many cases, property, during the period from 2008 to 2013, as I said earlier real efforts were made to try to support customers to do things that would enable them to survive.  In a normal environment some of those activities would have been to realise the assets that were creating the burden on those businesses.  In that period, the ability to realise assets, as everybody who lives in the country knows, was extraordinary limited, if not non-existent for a period probably through to the end of 2012.  If one were outside Dublin, it would be even more limited than that.  Some of the actions that would have been available to people in order to restore businesses to health were effectively closed to them.<\/p> <p>  That is the perspective I have on this which is that real efforts were made to try to support people through to viability.  The separate point, which comes up in some of the questions that have been asked, is whether we then took a decision to restore the bank to financial health and restore the balance sheet of the bank to put it in a position where it could begin to support and grow in the economy.  We took the decision to realise those assets and by that I mean the loans and we did that with the full knowledge of our shareholder and indeed the views of the regulators taken into account as a necessary step to make Ulster Bank a viable business and to make Royal Bank of Scotland a viable business.  That is why we did that.  We did not \"not seek\" opportunities to try to separate businesses and give them a future, but at the end of the day, we had to take steps to restore the viability of our own business and we did what we thought was the right thing to ensure that we could remain a systemic organisation in this country.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked about West Register, let me go back and be absolutely certain about the issue of the directorship.  I am absolutely certain as I sit here now that I never had a shareholding in West Register.  I may have been a director of that company for a short period.

I find it extraordinary.  I cannot pursue it any more because neither one of you knows anything about it.  We will pursue it again and the committee would like a comprehensive note on its function, its connection with the bank, the types of property it held or how property was transferred to it and what was expected of West Register, having had the property transferred to it.  I think it is extraordinary that the witnesses do not know.<\/p> <p>  I dispute the fact with Mr. Blair about his efforts to restructure viable businesses.  The correspondence I, as Chairman of the committee, and other members have received regarding GRG tells a different story.  It is a story of viable businesses mixed in with businesses that were in difficulty, not being separated out.<\/p><p>It is a story of the total package simply being dumped from Global Restructuring Group, GRG, to a vulture fund of some kind or another.  That may have been a piece of work the witnesses undertook to save their bank or to better their balance sheet, but it distinctly contrasts with the action they have taken on the trackers.<\/p><p> The witnesses are talking about a bad time in their bank.  I will give them an example of a bad time.  I want to tell them about a customer, and this is on the tracker issue, which does not compare with how the bank dealt with the GRG customers.  This person tells us that they overpaid their mortgage by approximately &euro;400 a month.  It is ongoing for the past seven years.  They struggle with their monthly repayments and during that time they had to assist their two children who had Asperger's syndrome.  They have gone to credit unions and banks for loans to support the care of those two children.  The person says they have gone without food, without heat in their home, without holidays, and the children of that family are suffering to this day.  They estimate they are owed approximately &euro;30,000 and, I am sure, more from the witnesses' bank, and they still have not dealt with them.  It is totally unacceptable, in any society, that the most vulnerable would be treated the way this family has been treated.<\/p><p> Do the witnesses know that in recent weeks, in the lead-up to this committee, the correspondence to the committee has peaked at an incredible high?  I examined that correspondence and took from it the basics, and what it is telling us is that the bank's help line is a farce, that it does not give the answers or any comfort as to the timeframe for dealing with the issue, whether the individual is in scope or not, the level of compensation and so on.  It is as if the bank just established it because the Central Bank said so, but the level of information is such that it is unhelpful because it adds to the frustration and anger of the person who contacts the help line in the first place.<\/p><p> Regarding help lines, I draw the witnesses' attention to other pieces of correspondence, which bear a trend across a huge number of customers.  These people have failed to deal successfully with the bank, even on the most basic pieces of information, so they have taken to employing either financial consultants, people who would assist in that regard or legal representation.  In spite of that, the bank has not responded.  Again and again, it sends out the same letters that are full of nonsense about what it is doing.  It does not answer any of the questions it has been asked and, in some of these cases, the person writing the letter tells us that the questions they have asked have not been acknowledged or answered and that the bank is not dealing with the questions in their lives that are critical to how they plan the rest of the servicing of their mortgage, and their lives.  Does that not stand in stark contrast to how the witnesses said their bank dealt with the GRG issue and then turned around and failed the ordinary citizens of this State who find themselves being pushed all over the place?  They write to us just to get the basic information.<\/p><p> I want to know what the witnesses intend to do to correct that and what they will do for individual families who find themselves in a particular set of circumstances where their quality of life is destroyed and where the children of that family are having to suffer as well.

Of the 3,500 mortgage customers in question, 1,000 or so are no longer customers of Ulster Bank.  How have they been contacted?  The bank presumably has details for some of them, but they may not be up to date.  Some of the customers may have died; some may have moved house and some may have emigrated.  Of the 1,000, with how many has Ulster Bank been in contact?  I do not mean merely writing them a letter; how many of them have actually interacted with the bank?  Are we talking about 400 or 950?  Does the bank have an ongoing relationship with most of them?  It is clearly the case that the records held by the bank of the people concerned are not as up to date as they are for existing customers.

It is one thing if the number only comes to 50, but it could be half or three quarters of the total.  Even if only one family have been affected - we have heard about many cases, as the Chairman mentioned - that family are still entitled to redress.
