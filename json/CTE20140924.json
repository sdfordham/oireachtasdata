This is the first time both of us have had the opportunity to meet the committee.  We look forward to fruitful and positive discussions on education and skills, which I know is of particular concern to each and every member present.  I would also like to acknowledge the good work done by my predecessor, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, who appeared before the joint committee on many occasions.<\/p><p>  I will as requested keep this opening statement short in order to allow more time for discussion.  As the Chairman already stated, my Department has provided some briefing slides for committee members which, together with material provided by the committee secretariat, will hopefully assist today&rsquo;s discussions.  I propose at this stage to expand only briefly on the slides provided, but I am of course happy to elaborate on any issues as they subsequently arise and to answer any questions..<\/p><p>  The gross voted expenditure allocation for my Department for 2014 is &euro;8.403 billion, made up of &euro;7.85 billion in current expenditure and &euro;546 million in capital expenditure.  Added to this is &euro;362 million in non-voted funding from the National Training Fund.  The 2014 allocation took account of current expenditure savings and expenditure reductions of some &euro;44 million, while at the same time seeking to protect front-line education services as much as possible.<\/p> <p>The pupil-teacher ratio in non-fee-charging schools at primary and post-primary levels was protected for the third year in a row, while the 2014-15 school year is expected to see approximately 1,400 additional teachers recruited to schools, providing positions for newly qualified and unemployed teachers.  Two thirds of the additional teachers will be mainstream teachers, while one third will be resource teachers supporting children with special educational needs.  In addition, the ceiling in the number of special needs assistant posts was increased by 390 posts to 10,965 posts, compared to the earlier ceiling of 10,575 posts.<\/p><p> The outputs to be achieved with the 2014 expenditure allocation were set out in the revised estimates volume for my Department.  In addition to funding the salaries of over 96,000 public servants and pensions for 42,500 pensioners - I must admit I was surprised that the figure was so high - the allocation provided for further funding to progress a number of important educational initiatives.  These include the literacy and numeracy strategy, the reform of the junior certificate and the continued roll-out of high-speed broadband to second level schools.  In addition, proceeds from the national lottery licence transaction were used to provide seed funding to allow primary schools without book rental schemes to set up such schemes.  The 2014 provision also continues to provide funding for training and reskilling, for persons in employment and for those seeking work.  In order to help tackle youth unemployment, a minimum of 2,000 places were ring-fenced in a new round of the Momentum programme - which we launched this morning - for the under 25s who are out of work, while 5,000 places were scheduled for roll-out under the Springboard programme. <\/p><p> On the capital side, the allocation for 2014 provides mainly for ongoing delivery of the five year 2012-16 school building programme, involving 275 major school building projects and an additional 80,000 school places to meet demographic increases.  The capital provision includes &euro;65 million under the Government&rsquo;s stimulus initiatives, which include funding for the development of the new DIT campus at Grangegorman, which I visited recently and found hugely impressive, and for 28 additional school building projects.<\/p><p> The latest expenditure data available for my Department relates to the period up to the end of August.  At that time, net overall voted expenditure by the Department&rsquo;s Vote was &euro;5.115 billion. This was made up of &euro;4.828 billion in current expenditure and &euro;287 million in capital.  These figures are more or less on target, with current spend just &euro;7 million behind profile while capital is &euro;6 million ahead.  <\/p><p> To date in 2014, a total of 31 large scale school capital projects, comprising 23 new school buildings and 8 large scale extensions, have been completed.  It is expected that over 40 school projects will be completed by the end of the year, including seven schools that have come on stream under the public private partnership programme.  In addition, the 2014 summer works scheme saw over 770 projects approved for works this year, with a total projected expenditure of over &euro;70 million.<\/p><p> While the end-August expenditure figures for my Department are on target, the picture painted by the end-September figures will have an important bearing on the overall picture for 2014.  This is due to the commencement of the new academic year, when the impact of additional students in schools and colleges will become known.  A clearer picture of the number of teacher retirements will also emerge at that stage.  I expect the end-year expenditure position to be quite tight, and the situation in this regard will be closely monitored by my officials over the weeks ahead.  The position emerging in the September returns will also of course have an impact on expenditure for 2015.<\/p><p> The 2015 budget will be announced in three weeks&rsquo; time on 14 October.  The earlier budget date presents particular challenges for the education sector, given that the academic year only starts in September, when a clearer picture of the student population for the year ahead emerges.  My Department will be required to make an earlier call than usual on the projected expenditure position for 2014 and its likely impact on requirements for 2015.  This requires close attention in the lead-up to the budget and, as I already indicated, places particular importance on my Department&rsquo;s end of September expenditure figures.  This is especially the case with regard to increases in student demographics, which impact on teacher numbers, capitation payments and other areas of spend on the Vote. <\/p><p> The determination of the overall budgetary strategy for 2015 will be finalised in Government discussions over the weeks ahead.  In the circumstances, the Chairman will appreciate that I am very limited in what I can say in regard to these discussions at this time. <\/p><p> I am happy, together with Minister of State, Deputy English, to respond to any matters that committee members wish to raise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014092400004#C00300","speaker":"1061","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411560600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We will now go through programme-by-programme considerations, beginning with programme A.

If that is the case, what is the total amount of net savings the Minister is seeking in the budget?<\/p><p>  I have a couple of brief questions on programme A.  They are policy issues which will feed into budget issues.  One relates to the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, working group and the new model for allocation.  I read the briefing document that the Minister received when she took up office.  It states that the new model is not expected to be implemented next year, so I presume that there will be no funding set aside for that.  The Minister might clarify that.  The briefing document she received states that the new model might not be in place until 2016-17, which she might also be able to confirm.  <\/p><p>  The other issue I want to touch on briefly concerns new teachers.<\/p> <p>There is an amendment to the Teaching Council Act coming forward which relates to the vetting of new teachers.  It only covers the teaching profession and excludes everyone else within a school setting. People like special needs assistants and caretakers will not be covered by the amendment.

It is an issue I have raised with both Ministers in the past concerning the quality and provision of transport services to schools.  There are situations where children and families are being totally discommoded.  This involves the splitting up of families in certain cases where some of the siblings have to attend one secondary school and others have to attend a different school.  This is unfair on the parents who sometimes have to try and fit in their own work schedules as well.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed urgently.  It is essential, as I have stated time and time again, that we give our children the best educational system possible and this includes the provision of a good, safe transport service.<\/p><p>  There is a situation - I hope I am forgiven for mentioning it - in the Edgeworthstown area of County Longford where five families - involving eight children in all - have no transport facilities to their designated school, Scoil Mhuire in Granard.  This issue needs to be addressed.  I have contacted the Department about it on a number of occasions.  There is a public meeting taking place on the issue next Tuesday night because we have not addressed it.  Children are not able to attend secondary school and in this day and age it is unfair on students that this should arise.  I would appreciate if this whole issue could be looked at.  Earlier today we were drawing up our schedule of invitees for the coming year.  I suggested that we invite in the personnel from the transport section of the Department of Education and Skills.  Some of the arrangements in place are totally unfair and there are simple solutions.  In the Edgeworthstown case a second bus should be provided because it is a huge health and safety issue.  It is not until something happens like what happened in County Meath a few years ago that we address problems like this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014092400006#E00200","speaker":"1062"},{"type":"speech","time":1411561200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and the Minister of State with responsibility for skills, research and innovation, Deputy Damien English, on their appointments.<\/p><p>  How many people are in education on any one day in Ireland?

Does she intend to revisit it in some way?<\/p><p>  The question of how many young, middle-aged and older people are in education is very important.

I wish to focus on the priorities for the budget for next year, and particularly on areas that have had a cut over the last few years.  What will be the Minister's priorities if indeed the Government does have more resources in the next budget?<\/p><p>  One of the areas that has taken a hit has been special needs education. Although the SNA cap was raised a little last year, the 85% rule for resource teachers means that the resources the children are getting are now no longer linked to their educational needs.  They are being affected by an arbitrary cap.  Does the Minister see this as a priority area if resources are available?  <\/p><p>  The same question applies to the National Educational Psychological Service,  which is seriously under-funded.  This issue has come up many times in the committee when we have had special needs groups in.  Parents and schools cannot get assessments through NEPS.  This creates an inequity where the only people who can get assessments are those who can afford to pay for them.  If the Government has some leeway then rather than there being competition between the two parties on tax cuts, I believe we should be reversing some of the damage that has been done to the most vulnerable over the last few years, including children with special needs.  <\/p><p>  In the same vein, the slides that we were given state that the DEIS schools have been protected over the last few years from cuts, which is not the case.  However, I have received correspondence yesterday from the school completion programme in Killinarden, which has taken cuts of 30% over the last few years.  Is that something the Minister would revisit if resources are available next year?  <\/p><p>  On the early education side, is the Minister aware of the report on the free pre-school year and its impact in disadvantaged areas, which was published last May?  The report was clear in saying that the free pre-school year has not closed the gap between children from disadvantaged areas and other children in the same age cohort.  It says that there are a number of reasons for that.  It is too late when a child is three or four years of age, he or she is already far behind.  It is only a half intervention, a half day for some of the year, and it does not engage with families.  Early education has always been the poor relation in the Minister's Department, scattered between the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Sometimes it is not clear who exactly is in charge of what.  It is an area to which we have never dedicated the kind of resources that we need, particularly from an early intervention point of view.  <\/p><p>  I would link that with the school completion programme and similar programmes, because the research to which I referred showed yet again that it is not just educational interventions in the schools that work in disadvantaged areas.  Work with families and parents, so that they can support their children, is also needed.  That is why cuts to programmes such the school completion programme, which do that type of work, are especially dangerous.  They have torn away some of the improvements that had been made.  I ask that the Minister makes that a priority.<\/p><p>  Regarding the Minister's approach to the school patronage issue,  this was identified as a particular priority by her predecessor when he took up the job as Minister for Education and Skills.  There has been virtually no progress made.  There was a report on patronage and transferring schools, and what would be done with the 1,700 schools that would remain as stand-alone schools.  We have seen two or three schools change their patronage over the last few years and that is it.  <\/p><p>  There still remains an issue, on which the Minister was quoted this morning in one of the newspapers, around the teaching of religion and how we ensure that all of our schools are welcoming to children of all backgrounds and that they make appropriate provision for them.  What would be the Minister's priorities in this regard? The former Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, was addressing that issue by divesting off some schools, creating a situation where we have the Catholic school, the Protestant school, the Educate Together school.  I believe that is going down the wrong road.  It is an issue we have discussed previously in the committee.  We end up with children segregated on religious grounds in a way that has not existed in the past, because the Catholic schools - notionally Catholic - had been taking children of all faiths and were doing their best.  Now the teachers are working in awkward situations, such as the one produced by the rule in regard to priority given to religious education, an issue on which the Minister was quoted this morning.<\/p><p>  I do not believe that a segregation system is the best way to proceed.  We need to look at how we can take all of our existing schools and make them more welcoming and how we change the rules in regard to religious education.  This was a priority for the Minister's predecessor, at least a stated priority at the start of his term.  What is the current Minister's perspective on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014092400006#E00400","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1411561800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Many of the issues have already been raised but might I ask the Minister for her views on small primary schools and the returns for 30 September pertaining to the projected numbers of incoming students?  Schools are provided with teachers depending on their projected enrolment up to 30 September and some may not reach that number.  I have been contacted by a school that will be one student short of the projected number it had hoped to get and will now lose a teacher.  A class will go from having 21 students on 24 October when the school gets the mid-term break to having 32 students when the students return.  There will be an increase of 11 students in the classroom after Hallowe'en.  There will also be eight, nine, ten and 11 year olds in that classroom which is huge pressure to put on any teacher.  This issue is also related to matters dealt with last week and the media coverage of the JobBridge scheme.  Will any exceptions be made for small schools which will not reach the quota and will have the added challenge of children of many ages in the classroom?  What are the Minister's views on the effect of JobBridge and the media coverage relating to the use of JobBridge to employ SNAs?<\/p><p>  On back to school costs, towards the end of 2013, a survey was initiated by the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, which I wholeheartedly welcomed, seeking the views of parents, particularly on the school uniform.  The results of this survey were to be reported in February 2014.  I have been trying to get information on this report and find out exactly how many schools replied.  If schools did not reply, is there anything we can do to ensure they do?  We are waiting for the parents' charter and I look forward to its publication.  In the meantime, is there any additional way - this is important in terms of school costs - that we get the views of parents and schools and increase the interaction between parents and the schools?<\/p><p>  I also wish to ask the Minister about the qualifications of teachers in schools catering for students with special needs.  I have received representations from people who have children in special schools but the teachers do not appear to have the appropriate qualifications.  The teachers have primary school teaching qualifications and they have been vetted and so forth.  However, I am of the view that teachers in schools catering for students with special needs should have training - either through their teacher training courses or an additional course - to equip them to deal with the very specific extra demands that arise in teaching children with special needs. <\/p><p> Will the Minister comment on the progress that has been made on the junior cycle?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014092400007#F00100","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1411561800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh, agus ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabh&aacute;il don bheirt seo go pearsa as bh&uacute;r bpostanna nua agus gu&iacute;m r&aacute;th D&eacute; oraibh san obair at&aacute; romhaibh.<\/p><p>  Senator O'Donnell has raised the issue of literacy and numeracy and the junior cycle and I, too, would like to hear the Minister's views on that.

It is not possible to make any further decisions on small schools until we have the appropriate information.  The matter has been discussed at considerable length.  The education and training boards, ETBs, are very important and they are just starting off this year. It is important that they are resourced properly and that they get a discrete capital budget and a discrete summer work scheme.  One matter I wish to address in particular - and this was dealt with in the briefing - is that for the third consecutive year non-fee charging schools at primary and post-primary levels were protected.

I ask because, although I have no fixed view on the matter, I wonder if that figure would be warranted having regard to the cuts that have taken place - it could go towards SNAs, for example, but that is something we could discuss.<\/p><p>  On the implementation of the action plan on bullying and schools patronage, I note from the research by DCU that 79% of teachers are aware of bullying in schools. It is clear that education is key to tackling this.  It is important that we promote an awareness of bullying and how to deal with it and how to tackle it in schools.  Is the Minister seeking to increase the allocation for the coming years for that important issue?<\/p><p>  Concerning higher education, what is the Minister's view on the present funding arrangements, in particular on student loans programmes as operated elsewhere as an alternative funding method?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014092400007#F00400","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speech","time":1411561800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>That would be programme C.

A sum of &euro;39 million was the original expenditure ceiling projected for our Department for this coming year.  That was part of the projections across all Departments that were to yield what was to be approximately &euro;2 million in cuts.  Thankfully the economy has moved on since then.  <\/p> <p>We are in a budgetary negotiation at the moment but that would have been the cut, should we have stood still in terms of the demands on expenditure and taxation, etc.  Each budget is different and we are in a different situation at the moment.  I do want to say to the committee that there are pressures, particularly demographic pressures, so there are extra costs simply because there are more children at all levels in education.  Those are not just costs around teachers and capitation, but also costs around school transport, student grants, etc.  Those demographic pressures mean that with the same amount of money as we had last year we have extra demands.

We do not expect it to be ready for next year but it could be.  The committee has seen the draft proposals.  There must be widespread consultation.  Some members of the committee are probably aware that the NCSE is holding public meetings around the country at the moment to advise parents, particularly those with younger children with special learning needs who will be entering the school system.  I cannot say for sure that it will not be next year but it is more likely to be the following year.  We have continuing upward pressures with regard to the needs of children with special educational needs.  For example, there are an extra 480 resource teachers this year and there are also extra special needs assistants, SNAs.  That is simply to deal with existing needs.<\/p><p>  There will be ongoing discussions, but I do not think it will be ready for next year.  However, I am not certain so if it is ready and if there is a general view that is the right thing to do, it may be implemented.  There is particular concern about the fact that people must get diagnoses at a very early stage and that in some cases they must pay for it even if they cannot afford it.  All these issues are of concern and they are all part of the reason this review is taking place.  However, that is as accurate as I can be on the timing.  <\/p><p>  On the vetting of new teachers, the Teaching Council only has responsibility for teachers.  There has been a problem with vetting both because of the time it takes and the need to re-do it if someone gets a new job.  The idea here is that the Teaching Council would do the vetting, so that this problem of delays for teachers would no longer be an issue.  Other people who work in schools are vetted, not through the Teaching Council, but through other systems, so anyone who works with children must be vetted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014092400008#G01900","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1411562400,"counter":47,"content":"<p>In the Minister's briefing it says that there may be a risk of delay in appointing those people because of the delays in vetting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014092400008#G02000","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1411562400,"counter":48,"content":"<p>That refers to SNAs, etc.  That is simply because of the general delay in vetting.

If we use the Teaching Council it should speed up the process specifically for teachers but the other issue is part of a general problem of delays in vetting, and we are working as a Government across Departments to address it.

I cannot deal with a specific case here as it would not be appropriate, but I have discussed this case with the Deputy and hopefully we will get an answer on that.<\/p><p>  There are pressures in this area.  The budget for school transport has gone down by 8% or 9% over the last three or four years.  There is an issue of demographics and pressure from other areas, so many changes have been  brought in.  In the 2011 budget the rules did change, which is causing much confusion.  This change also causes a situation where families might be availing of transport to one school but siblings cannot follow to the same school.  That is a difficulty.  The rules changed three years ago and that will cause a problem for a number of years while each family adapts to the new rules.<\/p><p>  The situation to which the Deputy refers is slightly different.  Generally we try to find a solution to any issue that is brought to us but we must ensure that the rules are applied in the same way across the country and are applied fairly.  I would be very strong on that; there must be fair implementation of the rules across the board.  However, if there is a situation where a problem can be solved, we will try to solve it, within the constraints.  The Deputy's situation is a little different and we will examine it.  In general it is an area under pressure.  The budget has been reduced and there was a value-for-money review back in 2011, which brought in changes.

Everybody was lifted a little bit, but the gap between the two cohorts of children was just as severe.  The lesson to be taken from that is very clear in the report that the Government commissioned.  I appreciate that decisions are being made about whether to provide a second preschool year or whether there are other priorities in child care.  If the Minister is genuinely serious about tackling disadvantage and about early intervention for children who need it most, she will pause and consider that report, instead of giving everybody a little bit in the two and a half hours.  She should establish proper early-years intervention programmes for children from disadvantaged areas and children with special needs, who are getting virtually nothing at present, as well as for areas where there have been severe cuts to programmes, such as Jigsaw in Darndale and the community cr&egrave;ches.

That is fine, we will come to that later.  On the back-to-school costs survey, the former Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, made a big brouhaha about carrying it out and publishing it.  He followed it up shortly afterwards with a big banner at the Labour Party conference about how the Labour Party is working to reduce back-to-school costs.  There has not been a word about it since.  The headlines appeared in the newspapers.  The survey was sent out and there has been no interest to find out whether it will actually be implemented, whether it had any impact on the ground or anything else.  We hear the Minister speak today about how she might consult with parents' representatives to see if they heard anything about what happened to it.  That is simply not on.  It just shows that it was nothing more than a gimmick.  What we have seen from the Government as opposed to what the Labour Party banner had said at the conference about reducing back-to-school costs, is back-to-school costs for parents increased more in the past three years than under any previous Government.  There was the withdrawal of the minor works grants and the summer works scheme, which we will deal with later, and the reduction in capitation grants which has been introduced consecutively over three years.  We also had the move by the Minister's colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, to halve the back-to-school grant at secondary level and to cut it by a third at primary level.  Overall, through all those measures, more than &euro;100 million was taken out of the pockets of schools and parents in respect of covering back-to-school costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014092400011#K00500","speaker":"999"},{"type":"speech","time":1411564200,"counter":134,"content":"<p>The Deputy said he would be brief.

A survey report came through this committee which among other issues referred to donations to schools.  There are schools in my area asking for &euro;100 per locker key.  If students do not give the &euro;100 they do not get the key.  Therefore, children have to carry their school books and school bags around until they give &euro;100.  In my area there are schools with an enrolment of between 500 and 600 pupils, therefore the cost works out at approximately &euro;50,000 to &euro;60,000.  Do the Department or the schools themselves hold accounts on these donations and where do the donations go?  It is discrimination against students and amounts to huge pressure on parents.  I have had many parents in my constituency office saying they could not afford the &euro;100 or the &euro;150 for two students.  Basically, we are going back to two for the price of one.  What is going on with these donations is scandalous.  If we were serious about the report conducted last year the Government should have said this has to stop because it is discrimination of the highest order.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, and ask him in the next 12 months to put an end to these donations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014092400011#K01100","speaker":"1079"},{"type":"speech","time":1411564200,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Jonathan O'Brien to be followed by Senator Mary Moran.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014092400011#K01200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1411564200,"counter":141,"content":"<p>That is the point I wanted to raise.  We are talking about back-to-school costs.  The largest school cost, the cost that increases year-on-year, is the voluntary contribution.  The reason it is increasing is due to the cut in budgets to schools and capitation grants and those cuts have to be made up somewhere.  Schools are operating on smaller budgets with more students and more pressures and the money has to be found somewhere.  It is being found in the pockets of parents.  That is the reality.  The Deputy is right; there are schools that are withholding keys to lockers.  One does not get a locker unless one hands over &euro;120 in some cases.  <\/p><p>  We talk about bullying and the action plan on bullying.  The knock-on effect of the policy of voluntary contributions is the poor girl or boy whose parents could not afford &euro;120 and therefore does not get a key to the locker and is identified by other students as being poor and disadvantaged.  Children being children will pick on him or her, call him or her names and bully him or her.  The Department is washing its hands of the problem while the Minister has it within her power to abolish voluntary contributions.  If she does that she will have to increase the funding provided to schools.  By not tackling this issue head on, we are not only discriminating against children we are also leading to them being bullied in school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014092400011#K01300","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411564200,"counter":142,"content":"<p>They should not be allowed to dictate who gets what and when and where.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014092400011#K01400","nonspeaker":"Senator Marie Louise O'Donnell"},{"type":"speech","time":1411564200,"counter":143,"content":"<p>That is the point I am making, that schools can hold children to ransom.

I have also seen letters seeking voluntary contributions coming from the chairperson of the parents council.  Therefore, the parents council know who has paid and who has not paid.  Can we not insist that schools complete that survey and see where all the money from the voluntary contribution is going?  Can we not stop it?  The same happened with retired teachers.  I made a strong case on the issue.  The recommendation from the Minister was that newly qualified teachers would be employed first but we cannot hold them to it.

Is there any scope within the Estimates for the current year?  Will this be a priority for next year?  The student assistance fund is discretionary funding in colleges to help students who perhaps have a grant that is inadequate.  It allows them to get extra funding through the colleges from the allocation.  It is also for those not entitled to a grant but who are in dire straits.  Some students are not entitled to a grant because they are not deemed by the Department to meet the eligibility criteria for being independent from their family but they may have had to move out.  There could be domestic violence situations and all kinds of difficulties which mean students do not strictly meet the Department's criteria but they have to live separately and are finding it difficult to cope.  They turn to college assistance offices explaining that they will have to drop out of college unless something can be done to help them.  The point of the student assistance fund was to have discretionary money to help people in difficult circumstances and hard cases.<\/p><p>  The fund was cut from &euro;8 million to &euro;6.6 million this year.  Last year the fund ran out in most colleges by November.  Students started at the end of September or the start of October and the money was gone by November.  Some people were in dire straits in February and March but the colleges could not help them because the funding was gone.  In many respects it has been a direct reflection of the other cuts that have been made in maintenance grants and so on.  This is funding of last resort for people who have been hit elsewhere but the fund has also been hit.  It is not big money.  The cut made this year was from &euro;8 million to &euro;6.6 million.  Is there any scope in the remaining budget?  The Department is ahead in some areas of expenditure and behind in others.  Does the Minister have scope to do anything with the student assistance fund for the remainder of 2014?  One of the Minister's priorities for next year should be to restore that funding.<\/p><p>  Two years ago a once-off cut of &euro;25 million was announced for the higher education institutions.  It was not restored this year.  Will it be restored next year?  It was supposed to be a once-off cut but it has been carried on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014092400014#N00500","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1411566000,"counter":218,"content":"<p>As Senator Power pointed out, &euro;25 million was taken out of the third level sector last year and the colleges were told to take it from their reserves.

What has the impact been in respect of the &euro;25 million from the previous year and the &euro;25 million that is being extracted this year?  How is that impacting on the various institutions?

As the Minister is aware, the health professions admission test was introduced some time back.  It was supposed to reform the entry process and ensure it would not be altogether based on people cramming for tests and getting the ultimate 600 points in the leaving certificate or 625 points with bonus points for mathematics.  There has been much criticism of the system to the effect that people are now getting grinds for their leaving certificate points and for their HPAT.  What is the Minister's view?  Does she intend to reform it?<\/p><p>  There was a briefing last week for graduate entry medical students.  One issue raised was the extraordinary fees those concerned must pay for graduate entry courses and how they are struggling now to repay loans after they leave.  I sent the Minister a letter on their behalf with their proposal for tax relief in the budget.  Has Minister had a chance to review that?  The graduate entry system, if used properly, is a good way of opening up access.  Aside from people who did well first time around in the leaving certificate, it allows older students to go back and apply for graduate entry level.  Initially at least it opened up access and there was far more diversity in terms of the type of students who were going into the programme from different backgrounds.  That diversity is important for medicine.  More recently, those students have been put off.  My understanding is that for this year and last year we have been getting far fewer applications from disadvantaged areas or from less-well-off students because they are concerned that they will be unable to repay their loans.  It is a major issue and I call on the Minister to consider it.<\/p><p>  One suggestion has been put forward.  Apparently there is a system whereby if a student does the training course for midwifery, the State will pay the fee if the student agrees to work within the State system for a certain time after graduating.<\/p> <p>Could we be follow this precedent?  Our country has a significant problem with training doctors who leave straight away and complete their training in Australia or elsewhere.  This creates major problems for our health service.  I hope that the Departments of Education and Skills, Health and Finance put their minds to this serious issue.  To be fair, I only wrote to the Minister this day last week after a briefing.  The reply I received from the Minister for Health was that this was solely an issue for the Department of Finance and that he had forwarded my letter to it for reply.  I was unimpressed, given how doctors leaving the system after we train them is one of our greatest health issues.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's reply will be more enlightened and engaged with the issue.  This is not just a question for the Department of Finance.  The Minister and her colleague, the Minister for Health, should be lobbying for change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2014092400014#N00800","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411566600,"counter":222,"content":"<p>Regarding Senator Power's comments, does the Department have an opinion on the banks' disgraceful behaviour in respect of postgraduate fees?  They sell loans at certain interest rates to students, some of whom are taking long courses in, for example, engineering, medicine, accountancy and veterinary medicine, but then leave them high and dry the minute they qualify and increase their interest rates by 3%, 4% or 5%.  It is amoral.  The Department of Education and Skills should take a lead or have an opinion on this matter.  The Bank of Ireland is a disgrace for young medics.  As education progresses and families lose income, they become more dependent on banks and students in certain areas must rely on grants to be able to afford university and accommodation.  After their interest rates increase, those students are beggared for the next ten years.  What kind of signal is this to young people who want to stay in and repay this country?  Senator Power is correct - those people leave.  Sometimes, they do it to leave their debts behind.  Others do it because it gives them a better chance of repaying their debts without being beggared.  I know for a fact that some must repay double what they have borrowed.  The fees are significant.<\/p><p>  We all know that a primary university degree is almost like holding a leaving certificate now.  As such, someone must do postgraduate education to move up.  Rightly so, but young people who do this are choked financially by a bank to which we gave &euro;3.75 billion to keep it open.  Recently, a graduate entering into medicine discussed this matter with the committee.  That person seems to have been left penniless.  This is just one reason for young medics leaving the country.  They will never be able to stand on their own two feet because they must give the banks their souls, breath, hearts and lungs on their borrowings.<\/p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills should have a policy or conversation on this matter.  Perhaps we could keep the interest rate at a certain level for a few years to allow people breathing space.  Currently, those rates can double within three months of qualifying.

The Higher Education Authority, HEA, recently drafted a report on student participation rates.  It showed that, while many areas had experienced increases, some seemed to have seen decreases.

The approximately 50% of students who receive grants do not pay that fee, so they are not in the mix, but fees may be a barrier to the ones just above the income threshold.  This is an issue of which I am conscious and I thank members for raising it.<\/p><p>  As the committee probably knows, the former Minister set up a group to examine the funding of higher education.

They all borrow and pay back the loans and there is nothing wrong with that.  If one wants one's child to go to university but one does not have the money, it is good that one can go to a bank and borrow the money.  However, when a student qualifies, he or she should not be choked with debt for the rest of his or her life.  It is outrageous, especially given that one can only earn 1% interest on deposits in banks at the moment but one must pay 7% to 9% interest on borrowings.  What the banks are doing to undergraduates, postgraduates and their parents is amoral.  It is a different kind of borrowing when one is borrowing for one's future education.  There is a specificity about that.  It is not about life generally but the specificity of education.  The banks have closed down so many opportunities for young people.

I very much enjoyed my time as a member of this committee and I look forward to working with colleagues in what will no doubt be a very busy period for this committee.<\/p><p>  I am very pleased to be here today to introduce to the committee two draft Government orders giving force of law in Ireland to two new double taxation agreements, or DTAs, with Thailand and Botswana, and three draft Government orders giving force of law to three protocols to the double taxation agreements with Belgium, Luxembourg and Denmark.<\/p><p>  The double taxation agreement with Thailand was signed on 4 November 2013 by the then ambassador of Ireland to Thailand, Declan Kelly.  The DTA with Botswana was signed on 11 June 2014 by the then Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello.<\/p> <p>The protocol to the DTA with Belgium was signed on the 14 April 2014 by the former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gilmore, the protocol to the DTA with Luxembourg was signed on the 27 May by Mr. Diarmuid O'Leary, ambassador of Ireland to Luxembourg, and the protocol to the DTA with Denmark was signed by me on the 22 July in the Department of Finance's offices in Dublin.<\/p><p> Double taxation agreements are widely regarded as critical items of fiscal infrastructure for developing substantial bilateral trading and investment opportunities by reducing tax impediments that might otherwise deter such cross-border activity.  For a small open economy such as ours, which is so dependent on trade and investment with other countries, continuing to expand our network of international tax agreements is not only necessary but vital.  Double taxation agreements facilitate trade and investment by providing greater certainty to taxpayers regarding their potential liability to tax in the foreign jurisdiction; allocating taxing rights between the two jurisdictions in order that the taxpayer is not subject to double taxation; reducing the risk of excessive taxation that may arise as a result of high withholding taxes; and ensuring that taxpayers are not subject to discriminatory taxation in the foreign jurisdiction.  These agreements provide benefits to both taxpayers and governments by setting out clear rules that will govern tax matters relating to cross-border trade and investment.<\/p><p> Tax treaties ensure predictability and fairness in the tax treatment of taxpayers and spell out clearly defined provisions that facilitate companies investing and doing business overseas.  This is achieved by allocating exclusive taxing rights to one country or, where both countries retain taxing rights, by requiring the country where the taxpayer is resident to grant credit against its tax for the tax paid in the other country.  Double taxation agreements cover direct taxes, which in the case of Ireland are income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  They are comprehensive in scope, covering both the taxation of companies and individuals, and are, in the main, based on the OECD model tax convention.  Apart from relieving double taxation, the agreements also include provisions dealing with non-discrimination in respect of taxation matters.  Furthermore, they include mutual agreement procedures that allow the tax authorities of both countries to consult each other in taxation matters affecting the agreement and provisions that allow for the exchange of information for the purpose of preventing tax evasion.<\/p><p> Ireland's tax treaty network compares very favourably with those of other, larger OECD countries.  It includes most of the world's major economies and accounts, in aggregate, for more than 80% of world GDP.  The Irish treaty network has grown significantly in the past three years.  We have signed comprehensive double taxation agreements with 71 countries, of which 68 are in effect, and there is a strong pipeline of agreements coming down the tracks.  The number of tax treaties has doubled in recent years.  The Minister for Finance and I will be ensuring that we continue to prioritise the further expansion of our tax treaty network in the coming months as a central element of our integrated strategy for an export-led sustainable economic recovery for Ireland.  I assure members that the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners will continue to liaise with business representative bodies in identifying other countries where tax agreements would assist Irish business.  Despite our best efforts, of course, there are some key jurisdictions with which we have yet to secure agreements.  We will continue all diplomatic efforts to get these countries to the negotiating table.<\/p><p> The select sub-committee's consideration of the international agreements is an important step in the process towards their ratification.  Draft Government orders confirming and giving effect in Ireland to the agreements were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 22 September 2014 in accordance with the provisions of section 826 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  A resolution by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approving the draft orders is required before the Government proceeds to make them.  The proposal for the D&aacute;il to approve the draft orders has been referred to the select sub-committee for its consideration.  When the select-sub-committee completes its deliberations, the draft orders will then be referred back to the D&aacute;il for approval.  Thereafter, the Government may make the orders and the agreements to which they relate will then be included in a Schedule to the Taxes Acts by means of a section in the forthcoming Finance Bill.  At that point, the Irish ratification procedures will be complete.  In the case of the bilateral agreements, as soon as both countries have completed their procedures, those agreements take effect in accordance with their entry into force provisions.<\/p><p> I commend these draft orders to the select sub-committee and I will be very happy to deal with any questions which members may wish to pose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014092400002#A00300","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411567200,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I join the Chairman in congratulating the Minister of State and wishing him well in his new role.  The matter before us is fairly straightforward but I would like to ask a couple of questions nonetheless.  The Minister of State referred to the fact that there are a number of key jurisdictions with which we do not have DTAs.  Will he provide examples of countries with which we do a significant amount of trade but with which we do not have double taxation agreements?  Will the Minister of State also indicate whether, in general, such agreements are bespoke in nature?  I accept that they run along the standard lines of the OECD template but to what extent must they be tailored to individual jurisdictions?  One of the issues highlighted in the BEPS deliverables report issued by the OECD last week is the need for a single international legal agreement.  Essentially, such an agreement would change certain elements of bilateral double taxation arrangements.  Is the Minister of State in a position to provide an indication with regard to when this will take effect in the context of Ireland's negotiations to enter into double taxation agreements with other countries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FI12014092400003#B00200","speaker":"993"},{"type":"speech","time":1411567200,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for his kind words.

South America is one location in respect of which there is a great deal of work outstanding.  The country to which we attach priority in terms of negotiating a double taxation agreement is Brazil.  Our officials and diplomats will continue to work through the relevant channels in respect of this matter.  We tend to use the standard OECD template but, on occasion, both parties to an agreement are obliged to tweak this.<\/p><p>  Work in respect of BEPS remains ongoing.  Where we are eventually going to end up remains to be seen.  Obviously, Ireland is actively engaged with the BEPS process.  Work is under way on determining the scope of a multilateral instrument - this is being termed as an OECD convention - which would facilitate countries in signing up to measures on a multilateral basis.  Ireland would be positively disposed to supporting such an agreement.  We are of the view that this matter is quite complex from a legal standpoint and that it could take some time to resolve the various issues.  We intend to continue the process of signing double taxation agreements while also fully engaging with the BEPS process.  An OECD-style convention with multilateral agreements is on the table as part of that process.

This includes provision for the creation of subsidiary bodies which could be used to implement the direct recapitalisation instrument.  The legislation also incorporates the ESM treaty, as adapted following the accession of Latvia to the ESM on 13 March 2014, into the European Stability Mechanism Act 2012.<\/p><p>  The euro area member states reached a preliminary agreement on the operational framework of the ESM direct recapitalisation instrument, DRI, on 10 June 2014.  This includes the draft guideline on financial assistance for the direct recapitalisation of institutions, which set out how the DRI will operate.  This has been provided to members.  Establishing the DRI requires a decision by mutual agreement of the ESM board of governors, subject to the completion of national approval processes, to create a new ESM instrument in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM treaty.  The aim is to have this process completed by November this year.<\/p><p>  The Attorney General has been consulted and has advised that an amendment to the ESM Act 2012 will be required to allow the Minister for Finance, as a member of the ESM board of governors, to pass the necessary resolutions.  In short, the reason we need to amend the ESM Act 2012 is twofold.  First, the ESM was established to provide loans to member states.  The DRI provides for loans to financial institutions on the basis of an application by a member state.  Second, the DRI provides that subsidiary bodies and sub-entities may be used to facilitate such investments, so we must also cover that eventuality.  While the ESM provides for limited self-amendment, for example, in Article 19 of the ESM treaty, to add to the range of financial instruments that can be used, these changes go beyond what the D&aacute;il approved in the ESM Act 2012.  That Act provided for the payment of Ireland's contributions to the ESM, and also made provision for the immunities included in the ESM treaty in Irish law.  The ESM treaty, as it stood in 2012, was annexed to the Act.<\/p><p>  Article 3 of the treaty states that the purpose of the ESM shall be \"to mobilise funding and provide stability support under strict conditionality, appropriate to the financial assistance instrument chosen, to the benefit of ESM members which are experiencing, or are threatened by, severe financing problems, if indispensable to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and of its member states\".  The key feature is that it provides for financial assistance to euro area member states.<\/p> <p>Article 19 of the ESM treaty provides that the board of governors may review the list of financial assistance instruments provided for in Articles 14 to 18 and decide to make changes.  The directory capitalisation instrument is being introduced under this article.  However, as the direct capitalisation instrument was not in existence when the ESM was adopted and as it provides for direct assistance to a financial institution, it is considered that this expands the scope of the treaty beyond what was approved by the Oireachtas in the ESM Act of 2012, and an amendment to that Act to provide for the new instrument is therefore required.  In addition, the draft guideline provides for the use of subsidiary bodies and entities of the ESM, including external investment, to conduct the actual recapitalisation.  Although the treaty provides for ESM subsidiaries, the amendment provides for their use with a direct recapitalisation instrument.<br\/>The aim of the instrument is to preserve the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and of the member states by catering for specific cases in which an ESM member experiences acute difficulties with a financial sector that cannot be remedied without significantly endangering fiscal sustainability due to a severe risk of contagion from the financial sector to the sovereign.  The use of the instrument could also be considered if other alternatives would have the effect of endangering the continuous market access of an ESM member.<br\/>The treaty as adapted following Latvia's accession to the ESM in March this year is being annexed to the ESM Act 2012 in both the Irish and English languages through this legislation to ensure the most recent version of the treaty is associated with the Act.  Latvia applied to join the ESM on 21 August 2013, arising from its imminent accession to the euro.  The arrangements for its accession to the ESM were dealt with in accordance with Article 44 of the ESM treaty.  In October 2013, the ESM board of governors - the euro area finance Ministers - approved Latvia's application to join the ESM, along with the technical terms for Latvia's accession.  Latvia joined the euro on 1 January 2014 and became the 18th member of the ESM on 13 March 2014, having deposited its instrument of accession 20 days beforehand.<br\/>As a consequence of Latvia joining the ESM, there is a need to adapt the ESM treaty to reflect this fact. The ESM treaty provides for limited self-amendment, as I mentioned.  This includes adaptations arising directly from the accession of a new member under Article 44.  Such adaptations are subject to the approval of the board of governors by mutual agreement, as indicated by Article 5.6.(l) of the treaty. The adaptations arising from Latvia's accession fall within these provisions.  These changes were agreed by the board of governors on 23 October 2013, and as there were adaptations to the text of the ESM treaty to accommodate Latvia's accession in annexes I and II, it is considered appropriate to take the opportunity of this Bill to address this.<br\/>Latvia's accession led to a number of necessary technical adaptations to the ESM treaty, including the addition of Latvia to the list of member states; the amendment of Articles 8.1 and 8.2 to increase the total authorised capital stock and value of paid-in shares by the amount of Latvia's contribution to each; the inclusion of Latvian as an official language through the addition of a new paragraph to the final part of the main text of the treaty;<i><\/i>and the amendment of Annexes I and II to the treaty to include Latvia's contribution key and share of the capital stock.  These changes come about because the technical terms of Latvia's accession to the ESM approved by the board of governors include the calculation of Latvia's capital contribution to the ESM, with the capital contribution key set at 0.2757%.  This means that Latvia's total capital subscription will be &euro;1.93 billion, including &euro;221.2 million in paid-in capital, which will be paid in five annual instalments of &euro;44.24 million.  Latvia has paid its initial instalment of paid-in capital and will make the four remaining payments annually up to 2018.<br\/>I will run through the heads of the Bill and I will then be happy to take any questions.  The heads were provided to the committee in July and the drafting process has taken place since then.  As is usual in such circumstances, the Bill when it appears will have the same content but will look more detailed and fleshed out.  Head 1 states the aim of amending the ESM Act to allow for the inclusion of an instrument for direct recapitalisation of financial institutions in beneficiary member states as part of the amendment envisaged under Article 19 of the ESM treaty.  Head 2 is to provide for amendment of the ESM to allow for the creation of the ESM subsidiary bodies, sub-entities and funds to implement direct recapitalisation.  This can include provision for participation by the private sector in such direct recapitalisation.  The purpose of this Bill is to extend the immunities of the ESM to such subsidiary bodies when they are involved with direct recapitalisation.  Head 3 indicates that the ESM treaty, as amended following Latvia's accession, is annexed to this amendment Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2014092400003#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411572000,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I welcome the officials and thank them for the presentation.

A bridge financing process is being developed to try to ensure money is available for the fund.  There will be a gradual mutualisation of the single resolution fund over the first eight years.  The first port of call of a member state will be its own national compartment.  As the years go by, there will be contributions from other national compartments.  At the end of the eight years, there will be a mutualised fund whereby, in effect, all compartments will contribute to any resolution.

We are discussing a very important subject, which is the outbreak of the ebola virus affecting countries in west Africa.  To consider this issue the joint committee has requested that representatives from four bodies meet us this afternoon.<\/p><p>  I extend the sympathy of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade to the family and friends of the Concern worker whose death was reported this morning.  His death brings ebola that bit closer to the people.  I heard the report of his death on RTE radio this morning, in which it was stated he had to go for treatment for his illness elsewhere even though he presented some of the symptoms of ebola, and that at the end of the day he was not seen and he died queueing to be tested.  This is a real sign of the chaos which exists in west Africa at present.<\/p><p>  We have a packed agenda and committee members are very anxious to hear what the witnesses have to say.  I remind committee members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even in silent mode, with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.  This is particularly important today because our proceedings are being broadcast live on Oireachtas TV.<\/p><p>  In advance of today's hearing and presentations I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br\/>I welcome all the witnesses.  We will hear first from Caitr&iacute;ona Ingoldsby from the Department of Foreign and Trade.  Her presentation will be followed by presentations from Barry Andrews of GOAL, and from Dr. Gabriel Fitzpatrick of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res.  We also have with us Dr. Colette Bonner, deputy chief medical officer from the Department of Health.  I thank her sincerely for attending because I am sure some of our members may want to ask some technical questions.  Dr. Bonner will not make a formal presentation but is at the disposal of the members.  We are also joined by Karl Gardner, director of human resources in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Nicola Brennan, senior development specialist.  They are all very welcome.<br\/>The ebola crisis that has affected Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and other regions in west Africa is a real concern to all of us in the Western world.  It is a situation that has got out of control.  We are not sure whether the statistics we are hearing about are accurate.  Some people estimate that the real figures have not been collected because of the difficulty of the terrain.  We are conscious that every district in these countries is affected, not just the urban areas.  Sometimes the rural areas are the most difficult areas to get people into because of the geography and the fact that people are concentrating on the urban areas where there are large numbers of people.  The situation is very difficult, and I am delighted that our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was able to allocate funding to help in the control of the ebola outbreak, not just in terms of money but also resources, which are extremely important.  We are hearing that many health workers do not have the training or the resources - simple items such as gloves at times - to deal with the outbreak.  Ebola is highly contagious; it is spread through bodily fluids.  We are hearing also that there is a problem with the disposal of bodies.  All of these difficulties contribute to what is happening.<br\/>The other area we are concerned about is that many of the commercial airlines have stopped flying into these regions.  We are asking doctors, nurses, health workers and aid workers to come into these areas, yet if they go in they find it very difficult to leave because flights no longer fly in and out of these regions, other than Royal Air Maroc and United Nations flights.  It is a difficult situation, and many people here do not realise the seriousness of it for health workers and all our non-governmental organisations, NGOs, working extremely hard in the region, many of whom are compromising their own safety and working extremely hard.  We have heard about some of the cases being treated but we have to pay tribute to our health, embassy and aid workers in the area.<br\/>The latest statistics indicate that by January 2015, over 1 million people could be affected by this outbreak.  That is why it is important that every country deals with it, and we are delighted to have a team of experts before the committee today.  Without further ado I call Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Ingoldsby from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014092400002#A01400","speaker":"974","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411565400,"counter":598,"content":"<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade welcomes this opportunity to brief the committee on the ongoing work being undertaken across the Department in response to the current outbreak of ebola in west Africa.  The Chairman mentioned some of the figures but I will talk about the official figures from the World Health Organization, WHO.  As of 20 September, the WHO reports that the total number of probable, confirmed and suspected cases of ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone was 5,843, with 1,680 confirmed ebola related deaths and a further 1,123 deaths where ebola is the suspected or probable cause.  That brings the total of probable, suspected or confirmed ebola related deaths in those three countries to 2,803.  Both Senegal and Nigeria have also reported cases, but it should be noted that according to the WHO, the pattern in those countries is different.  It is not one of widespread and intense transmission but rather cases of localised transmission that are linked in a transmission chain to individuals who previously were in Guinea or Liberia.<br\/>Separately, there is also a smaller outbreak of ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  There are 68 cases there as of 18 September, but this outbreak is unrelated to that affecting the west African countries, and it is that outbreak in the west African countries which poses the greatest risks and remains the clear priority for international action.<br\/>Given the complexities and the wide range of issues the ebola outbreak entails, the response of our Department to date has involved significant internal co-ordination across various divisions in our headquarters in Dublin, with multiple bilateral embassies, and our representatives in multilateral missions such as the UN in Geneva.  In terms of our external co-ordination, we are also working domestically with our colleagues across Government Departments and State agencies, particularly with our colleagues in the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.  We are also maintaining close contact with Irish NGOs and other organisations that are active in the region.  Internationally, we are actively engaged principally with EU partners, both bilaterally and through our Permanent Representation in Brussels, and through the UN system in New York and Geneva.<br\/>In terms of our Department's specific response, we can view it as being across two main pillars: the consular response and our development co-operation response.  In terms of our consular response, we are asking all Irish citizens in the affected area to register on our citizens' registration page on the Department's website at .  While this is a voluntary registration mechanism and may not represent an absolutely accurate total of the number of Irish citizens in the area at a given time, we are constantly monitoring those numbers as they change and using that information to inform both our internal co-ordination and the risk assessment element of wider domestic interdepartmental emergency planning.  It should be said that none of the most affected countries or areas are frequented by large numbers of Irish tourists or independent travellers.  As of yesterday evening, based on our citizens' register and embassy information, we have 50 Irish citizens in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.  Separately, in Nigeria and in Senegal, we have a total of 405 citizens, 165 of whom would be deemed to be in an affected area.  However, I would stress the point made earlier that the WHO deems the situation and level of risk in Nigeria as fundamentally different from that in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, and also that the number in an affected area in Nigeria appears high because the city of Lagos is deemed an affected area.<br\/>Our embassies in Freetown and Abuja are in ongoing contact with those citizens registered, and have issued clear advice to them based on updates to our travel advice and the WHO guidelines to ensure that they are aware of the precautions necessary to best ensure their health and safety.<br\/>In addition to their role in keeping Irish citizens in the area informed, more broadly, our missions in the area are playing a crucial role in information gathering, reporting and co-ordinating with local and international partners on the ground.  Our embassy in Freetown in particular is playing a key role in local co-ordination. Colleagues there are working closely with the local authorities and international partners to identify the type of assistance most needed to try to manage the current outbreak, to support the local health and government infrastructure, and to prevent further spread of the virus.<br\/>With regard to the Department&rsquo;s travel advice more generally, we continue to update the travel advice for the affected countries.  Again, this advice is firmly based on WHO guidelines and information we are receiving from a number of sources, including our missions on the ground and information from EU and other international partners.<\/p> <p>We are advising Irish citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea and we are advising those who are already in these countries to consider carefully their need to remain.  It should be said that, according to the WHO, the risk for a general traveller to the affected area of becoming infected with the ebola virus is extremely low and that health workers can protect themselves by properly applying infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients.  From the consular point of view, in addition to this threat of ebola, even if it is at a low level for our citizens, the outbreak brings further challenges in the region, including restrictions on travel and, perhaps more importantly, significant strain on the local health care systems, which are now completely overwhelmed.  Any medical emergency for an Irish citizen there for which medical treatment might ordinarily have been obtained locally could now have much more severe consequences.  Improving local medical facilities and building additional capacity in-country is a key priority for the international community in managing the current outbreak and curtailing its spread.  I will return to this aspect in a few minutes in the context of our development co-operation response, but it is probably worth noting, with regard to our consular response, that building additional treatment capacity on the ground in these areas would also have a knock-on positive impact from the point of view of protecting the welfare of any of our citizens who are there.  As part of the ongoing interdepartmental engagement, we are working with colleagues in other Departments to examine all possible options and to have protocols in place to ensure preparedness should a case arise in respect of an Irish citizen. <\/p><p> At EU level, the European Council of 30 August discussed the ebola crisis and called for \"increased coordination at EU level of the assistance provided by EU Member States\".  The Commission has been tasked with taking this EU co-ordination forward, including the co-ordination of assets that could support the evacuation of ebola-linked cases from the region.  EU partners have also been considering a French proposal for a co-ordinated EU response to medical evacuation and for the sharing of resources, expertise and information.  Under this proposal, countries with repatriation capacity will take the lead in possible evacuations on a rota basis.  In the meantime, pending the agreement of a co-ordinated EU response in respect of repatriation, we are also discussing possibilities for bilateral cooperation with international partners which have suitable repatriation capacity.<\/p><p> It is important to note that any proposed repatriation of an ill EU citizen would be a complex task requiring significant and close co-ordination between a number of actors both domestic and international.  First and foremost, we would be governed by the medical situation.  There are stringent WHO criteria in place around repatriations and each case would be different in terms of the gestation of the illness at the time the patient presented and the timeframe within which a repatriation could take place.  Such consideration would include complex factors such as the availability of necessary isolation units, medical teams and aircraft capacity and the local transport and infrastructural capacity in the particular area at the time.<\/p><p> I now move on to our development co-operation response.  Ireland has provided direct funding of &euro;350,000 to date to organisations working on the ebola response in Sierra Leone and Liberia, both of which are partner countries for Ireland.  This funding is supporting much-needed NGO-led awareness-raising programmes in local communities in affected areas.  The lack of such awareness in both countries has hampered response efforts and contributed to the spread of the virus.  Funding has also been provided to the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare for contact tracing, which is another very important aspect of the response.  This funding is in addition to Irish Aid's ongoing programmes in both countries.  In 2013, Ireland provided &euro;3.9 million in bilateral aid to Sierra Leone, with over &euro;2 million spent on health and nutrition programmes.  In the same year, Ireland provided &euro;5.6 million in bilateral aid to Liberia.  The largest part of this funding - &euro;4 million - was channelled through the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare for strengthening basic health and primary health care services.  In addition to bilateral aid, Ireland provides funding of approximately &euro;6.8 million per annum for long-term development assistance to NGOs, as well as Irish missionaries, in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.  This supports programmes in the areas of health, food and livelihoods, education and human rights.  Irish Aid is currently adopting a flexible approach in these countries to facilitate reallocation of funds towards the ebola crisis. <\/p><p> At the weekend, the Minister of State with responsibility for development, trade promotion and North-South co-operation announced an allocation of over &euro;600,000 to UNICEF to provide life-saving nutritional supplies for children affected by the ebola outbreak.  He also announced that over 42 tonnes of Irish stocks of practical items such as blankets and soap, to a total value of &euro;350,000, will be airlifted from the UN humanitarian response depot in Ghana for distribution by the World Food Programme, Goal and Concern to assist survivors of ebola and affected children in Sierra Leone.  A member of the Irish Aid rapid response corps was also deployed at the weekend to Dakar in Senegal to work with the World Food Programme to set up an air transit centre for use by the UN Humanitarian Air Service. <\/p><p> Ireland is also contributing much-needed human resources.  Through the Department of Health, two public health specialists were deployed to work with the WHO to assist efforts in both Liberia and Nigeria.  An Irish virologist is based in Guinea working under the auspices of the EU and another Irish public health specialist, Dr. Gabriel Fitzpatrick, whom the committee will hear from later on, has recently returned from working in a treatment unit in Sierra Leone with M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF.  We remain in ongoing contact with Irish and international NGOs and earlier this week hosted in our Department a well-attended briefing for NGOs on the ebola crisis.<\/p><p> At the UN, Ireland co-sponsored the Security Council resolution adopted on 19 September which called for co-ordinated action to combat the crisis and established a new UN mission, the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response.  Ireland very much welcomes this mission, which has five priorities: stopping the spread of ebola, providing treatment for affected people, supporting health and other public services in the three affected countries, maintaining stability in these countries and taking preventative action to forestall a recurrence.  The global response to the current ebola outbreak is on the agenda for a number of high-level meetings during the UN General Assembly Leader's Week this week, for which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has travelled to New York.<\/p><p> Hopefully, this gives the committee a good overview of where we are and what the Department has done so far.  We will continue to work with our missions in the area, with our international and EU partners, with our colleagues in other Departments and domestic agencies and with Irish aid organisations to ensure that Ireland's development co-operation and consular responses continue to be part of the co-ordinated international response at this time of acute need in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea in particular.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014092400003#B00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Ingoldsby","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411566000,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Ingoldsby.

I welcome Ms Jane-Ann McKenna from MSF and Ms Sinead O'Reilly from GOAL, who are accompanying our two key witnesses today.  Our two key witnesses are coming at this from two different angles - Barry Andrews, whom we all know very well, as CEO of an NGO, namely GOAL, and Dr. Gabriel Fitzpatrick, who is a medical practitioner.

Ms Sinead O'Reilly, who is our global health adviser, has been introduced to the committee.<\/p> <p>We have circulated a paper to members of the committee who will have an opportunity to read it later.  I will pick out key issues that we wish to share.<\/p><p> I wrote to the committee on 22 August in seeking to appear before it to speak about the seriousness of the outbreak of ebola.  This purpose is now redundant because everyone appreciates we are dealing with a crisis of international dimensions and an outbreak that is out of control.  People understand this is a real and dangerous issue that requires co-ordinated responses at national and international level.  This is evident in the significant announcements of the US Government in the past week or so, while today the British Government has announced a co-ordinated plan involving the National Health Service, NHS, and other key resources in the UK system.  For the first time since 2000, the UN Security Council has passed a resolution on a health issue which underlines how seriously the outbreak is being taken.  It is significant for organisations such as GOAL that there has been a call for greater non-governmental organisation, NGO, capacity in the affected areas and more medical practitioners and health officials.  GOAL will try to rise to the challenge and I want to use this platform to call on Irish health workers, including doctors, paramedics and nurses, to come forward and assist in the effort, as this is what is required.  Until now Save the Children, the Red Cross, the International Medical Corps and, particularly, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF, have been at the sharpest end of the response, but other NGOs must now come out of their comfort zones.  I take the opportunity to send a message to Irish health worker who wish to come to GOAL.  We will talk to them because their help is desperately needed, if they have the capacity to assist in the coming months.  We aim to assist in the effort, with our partners, the US and British Governments.<\/p><p> When I visited Sierra Leone last weekend, I saw the situation at first hand - our workers have been there since 1999 and 200 GOAL staff members are in place.  They have been engaged in development work, as committee members saw on their visit two years ago.  GOAL members of staff have now turned their work into an emergency response, although the work is difficult.  However, it is even more difficult for workers in Liberia where the health system has almost completely collapsed.  The thoughts of everyone at GOAL are focused on the Concern worker who passed away over the weekend in a suspected case of ebola.  GOAL and Concern work closely together in Sierra Leone and have done so for many years.<\/p><p> Another purpose of this presentation is to call on the Irish Government to prepare and publish a national response plan.  We have heard details of this plan today and appreciate the various moving parts of the response.  The plan is encouraging.  I had the good fortune to meet the ambassador in Freetown and she has had an influence on NGOs and the Government that goes far beyond the call of duty.  One cannot help but be proud of her contribution.  The Irish Government should publish a national response plan, which would be in keeping with what the World Health Organization and the UN Security Council requested.  Earlier responses were based on earlier projections for the development of the disease.  Two weeks ago the worst case scenario was 20,000 cases in the next six to none months, but this is expected to change significantly in the coming weeks.  Yesterday a worst case scenario was outlined, based on the current trajectory, of 1.4 million cases.  The Irish Government has done much up to this point, but the time is right for a national response plan that would pull together and deploy military, health and other resources.  That is how we will fulfil our obligations to the multilateral organisations to which we belong.<\/p><p> During my brief visit to Sierra Leone I was in awe of the health workers from the Red Cross, Kings College, London and from MSF who I met on the aeroplane.  Their total dedication and selflessness were evident.  Occasionally the aid community gets a hard time which sometimes is deserved, but situations such as this, when individuals answer the call of a country in its darkest hour, show the aid community at its best.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014092400004#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411566600,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I thank committee members for giving me this opportunity.  I have just returned having spent one month working as a doctor and an epidemiologist with M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, Doctors Without Borders, in Kailahun, Sierra Leone where it built an 80-bed treatment centre. It is one of six such centres operated by it in the west African region.<\/p><p>  During my time at the ebola treatment centre I witnessed some of the most heartbreaking scenes I had ever encountered.  On many occasions I helped with triage and the admittance of patients to the centre.  This job entailed reviewing people arriving at the centre and deciding who to admit.  I remember a mother who had arrived with all four of her children, the youngest of whom was under two years of age.  They were all sick and the father was already dead.  The mother was terrified as she knew something awful had infected her family and within days all were dead.  I saw ebola cause heavily pregnant women to curl up and die.  I watched in despair as brothers and sisters passed away side by side within hours of each other.  I recall admitting entire families to the treatment centre and watching very few leave.  A significant proportion of admissions were of children and seeing them die was a damning sight, as their suffering cannot be described.<\/p><p>  I worked as an epidemiologist at the MSF treatment centre, which involved trying to figure out how ebola was spreading in the community and, crucially, predicting where new cases might occur.  I regularly travelled in a two vehicle convoy to remote jungle regions looking for potential cases.  One day I arrived at a designated village after a three hour journey.  I spoke to the village chief to obtain his permission to talk to the villagers.  He was honest and stated he did not know how many were sick because he was too scared to check in case he contracted ebola.  We were directed to a suspect house and as I approached, I could see an ill lady sitting outside in a chair.  She was trying to breastfeed her infant son who was crying.  I asked her to stand in order that we could take her temperature, but she was incapable of doing so.  Instead bloody diarrhoea poured down the insides of her legs.  She was too exhausted to care, but, despite her condition, she held her child as tightly as possible.  When we eventually managed to take her temperature, it was over 38 degrees.  I spoke to her husband and indicated that it was most likely that his wife had ebola.  He broke down crying, as he did not want his wife to leave, but he did not want her to stay either owing to the risk of infection for the rest of the family.  This conflict of emotions caused him to fall to his knees on the ground in desperation.  The mother continued to embrace her child but eventually agreed to accompany us to the MSF treatment centre, leaving her family behind.  I took the husband's mobile phone number and promised to telephone him every day with an update on his wife's condition.  Less than 48 hours later we called him with the news that she had died.  The separation of families in the community during this outbreak is a devastating daily fact of life.<\/p> <p>During my work at the MSF treatment centre it was clear that a large number of health care staff from Sierra Leone were infected with the ebola virus and subsequently died.  In the MSF centre we treated doctors, nurses, laboratory technicians and ambulance drivers from local hospitals and local health care centres.  It was an extremely disturbing sight to see health care colleagues die from this disease.  <\/p><p> On a personal level, I worked with one of the nurses in the MSF treatment centre who, unfortunately, contracted and died from the virus at the end of August.  He was a very hard-working individual who tended to his patients with the utmost care and was admired by all members of staff.  He was born in and grew up in Sierra Leone and immediately signed up to work with the MSF facility when it opened as he knew these types of facilities were critical to stopping the outbreak.  We admitted him to our centre on a Saturday morning and the died the following Wednesday evening.  <\/p><p> The case fatality rate at the ebola treatment centre in Kailahun was a little less than 70%.  This means that 7 out of 10 people confirmed to have the disease died within five days of being admitted to the centre.  I sometimes helped with the removal of bodies from the wards and saw how this affects other patients in those wards.  During the last week of August a 60 year old lady passed away.  Along with a team of four other staff I helped to prepare her body.  We sprayed it in chlorine, wrapped it in plastic and carried the body from the ward.  I knew the surrounding patients were terrified.  This was another of their neighbours gone.<\/p><p> During my work in remote villages in eastern Sierra Leone it was impossible to ignore that the normal health care system was failing to function.  I have met patients who cannot get access to standard drugs for malaria or simple bacterial infections.  Government-run clinics were turning away patients fearing they had ebola when in fact they had other infections which could have easily been treated.  This developing situation is causing an unknown number of deaths in the community.  The one amazing story to come from the ebola treatment centre is that of the survivors.  During the time I worked there more than 90 patients survived ebola.  I recall the first time I saw a survivor leave the centre.  She danced out the front-door as she collected her MSF laboratory certificate which confirmed that she no longer had the disease.  Every survivor is exceptional.  <\/p><p> The current ebola outbreak is unprecedented in location and scale.  There are almost 300 international staff from 70 different countries and more than 2,000 national staff from the affected countries working in MSF ebola treatment centres across the affected region.  To date, MSF has treated more than half of all confirmed ebola cases during this outbreak.  It is difficult to understand why one single NGO has been asked to carry so much of the burden of responding to this outbreak while other international organisations have not scaled up their interventions.  MSF staff are manning the front-line against this ever-spreading ebola outbreak.  As a consequence, a number of MSF staff have contracted the illness and died.  The world knows how to stop this epidemic.  We just need to do it.  MSF is stretched beyond capacity.  Identifying and treating cases in appropriate management centres in parallel with effective contact tracing and community sensitisation are at the core of what is required but this is not being done.  We cannot wait any longer.  With each day that passes the outbreak grows in size and complexity.  This simply means more families will die. <\/p><p> Western Governments have been preoccupied with preventing an ebola case from entering their territory.  While this is understandable it does not negate their duty to assist with this public health emergency of international concern.  MSF has repeatedly asked countries which have significant civilian and military outbreak control assets to deploy them in a co-ordinated manner across the affected region.  Specifically, MSF has requested the immediate scaling up of isolation centres, the deployment of mobile laboratories beside these isolation centres, the establishment of dedicated air bridges to move personnel and equipment between affected areas in West Africa, and the building of a regional network of field hospitals to treat infected medical colleagues.  Some countries have responded to this call.  However, more need to do so.  MSF asks the Irish Government to follow the lead of countries that have committed to join the fight against ebola with concrete action on the ground.  We are asking it to mobilise all possible resources, financial and human, to help bring to an end this medical emergency.  We are grateful for all efforts already expended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014092400005#D00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Fitzpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411567200,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Fitzpatrick and Mr. Barry Andrews for their presentations, which paint a disturbing and graphic picture of what they witnessed during their time spent at the MSF centres.

Reference was made to survivors.  I am unsure if these people survived following treatment or without it.

It is not that the treatment is a cure for ebola it is simply a case of the earlier the intervention the greater the chance of survival.  We have not noticed a difference between the number of females, males, adults or children dying from the virus.

I take this opportunity to thank everybody working in this area in exceptionally difficult circumstances, including members of our own NGOs and Department officials.<\/p><p>  The number of identified cases of ebola to date and the expected loss of life between now and January is frightening.  It must be a wake up call to the international community.  It is a pity the public has not heard the presentations made here today.  I know people would be as moved by them as we have been.  Mr. Andrews said that the World Health Organisation deemed the current situation as a public health emergency of international concern.  Surely, in responding to a crisis of that magnitude speed is of the essence.  I recently read some research on infectious diseases carried out by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, a quotation from which states: \"The window for controlling this outbreak is closing\".<\/p><p>  International co-ordination is key to dealing in a meaningful way with this crisis.<\/p> <p>The current piecemeal approach will not resolve it.  I ask Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Ingoldsby or her colleagues if they have any indication whether a political will exists in the European Union to put together a European rapid reaction force to help the humanitarian situation in west Africa.  Quite a number of European countries are assessing the resources available to them to help fight this disease.  In many instances the work of putting together a meaningful response is only at a planning stage.  I refer to a comment day or two ago by the Italian Presidency of the European Union that only four or five countries in Europe are equipped and that the Presidency will work to co-ordinate the aid effort.  If there was ever a tardy response to a humanitarian crisis that comment from the Presidency of the EU surely indicates that the urgency we all want to see is missing from the efforts to support the people working in exceptionally difficult circumstances.<\/p><p> Mr. Barry Andrews said in his presentation that the British National Health Service has announced a co-ordinated plan for medical workers.  If the details of that co-ordination are available, could it be used as a prototype or model for our response if the Department of Health and the HSE are willing to allow workers to spend a month or two in the area?<\/p><p> Is there a good co-ordinated effort in the region to ensure that the best return is being achieved from the work of so many NGOs and the assistance given by different governments?  Dr. Gabriel Fitzpatrick gave a harrowing commentary on the month he spent working in the region putting his expertise and skills to use and on which I compliment him.  He stated that children made up a significant proportion of admissions.  Is it true that the age cohort comprising children up to middle-aged adults is the most affected by this disease?<\/p><p> Is the global pharmaceutical industry making a contribution towards fighting this disease?  If all the financial and human resources were in place in those regions tomorrow, is the supply of medication and drugs an issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014092400006#E00500","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411567800,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegation.  Many of us will have no concept of the impact of the ebola outbreak on so many people.  It seems to be that to combat the disease there is a need to go against the natural human instinct to comfort a person in distress.  For example, if someone is crying, the instinct is to go to them and put one's arms around them.  The carers are dying because they are close to the victims.<\/p><p>  I refer to the fear associated with this virus.  I remember the attitude in Dublin to HIV-AIDS when those who died were being buried in sealed coffins.  I remember the fear in communities at that time which I presume could be replicated a thousand times in the case of the ebola virus.  People with HIV-AIDS said that they missed the close human contact when people would not hug them.  In the case of HIV-AIDS we have moved beyond that attitude but the ebola virus terrifies people and they are looking to us to come up with solutions.  Mr. Andrews has spoken about the recruitment programme.  If young people are looking for role models they should not look at politicians or pop stars but instead they should look at the people volunteering to work on the ground to deal with this crisis.<\/p><p>  Education is an important tool in the fight against this virus but I ask how can this be achieved in the countries dealing with the ebola virus where the infrastructure seems to have broken down.  A representative of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res explained that much of their work involved setting up incinerators to burn clothing as such facilities and structures had broken down or were non-existent.  The United States is considering sending more than 3,000 troops to the region.  Would such action be useful?  Does MSF require the assistance of such a force to physically install treatment centres?  Freetown has one treatment centre for 1 million people and it is reported that people have been turned away from the centre.  Is this the case in many of the treatment centres?  Victims are going home to be cared for by people who do not have protective equipment such as gloves and aprons and the virus is spread as a result.<\/p><p>  How is the education programme delivered to the people?  Are radio broadcasts used?  Is terror spreading among the people in the way that people in Dublin were terrified by HIV-AIDS?  I refer to Spanish and American health workers who have been transported back to their own countries for treatment.  I ask how is this viewed by the local population.  Do the local people think that these victims are being treated abroad with a secret cure and does it cause resentment?  I refer to Cuba sending 62 doctors and 103 nurses to the affected region.  How many people would be required for the Irish project?<\/p><p>  Sierra Leone imposed a national lock-down to identify and isolate new cases of the virus and its 6 million population were confined in their homes over the weekend.  The authorities declared the lock-down a success.  Has the delegation any information on the success or otherwise of this lock-down?  I ask the delegates to comment on the report that some NGOs criticised the lock-down saying that it destroys trust between patients and doctors.  Is a lock-down an effective policy?  The situation is similar in Nigeria.  I refer to the heavy lifting which MSF was required to undertake.  I apologise for asking so many questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014092400007#F00200","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1411567800,"counter":611,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates and I thank them for explaining the seriousness of the situation in a meaningful and forceful way.

I lived in Africa for four years and know it very well.  We returned relatively recently from Sierra Leone.  I thank Mr. Andrews, who applauded the work of our embassy in Freetown.  In our last meeting I specifically asked about the welfare of our staff.  At the time three women were employed, one of whom is now the ambassador, and they are phenomenal workers.  I hope to hear in the answer session that they have been fully briefed on the nature of the illness and are protected or know how to take the proper precautions.  As was said, they interact with government ministers in the field.  We met a nun in the hospital for the disadvantaged and saw the health services.<\/p><p>  Quite frankly, the hospitals we saw before the outbreak of ebola were pathetic.  We saw huge numbers of mothers feeding their babies at a clinic.  There were health services in place but they looked rather unhealthy.  We visited a hospital in Freetown which was not a hospital as we would know St. James's Hospital or St. Vincent's hospital to be.  GOAL has asked medical professionals to volunteer, which I support.  We have statistics on the deaths of front-line workers.  I remember being emotional when I heard that the doctor who led the campaign against ebola in Sierra Leone was infected.  There was a major debate about whether he should be given drugs.  How can the board reassure any voluntary nurse or health care worker who may want to volunteer for humanitarian work that the systems in Africa are capable of protecting their welfare?  The figures relating to the deaths of nurses and front-line workers such as ambulance workers are frightening.  If they are not protected and operating within the proper guidelines it will mitigate against those who wish to volunteer.<\/p><p>  Is the fact that the area of Liberia affected is war-torn and the infrastructure very weak a contributory factor?  What was the strategy of the three-day lockdown in Sierra Leone, and did the delegation support it?  What was its purpose and did it succeed?  Is it a plan that can be mimicked across the board?<\/p><p>  I refer to the departmental presentation which referred to ebola in Nigeria and the Congo.

I visited Sierra Leone to examine it as a post-conflict country.  It faces a range of issues, difficulties and problems in terms of health and education, and is now dealing with ebola, which compounds the other problems.<\/p><p>  I refer to the need to consider the ebola issue in terms of other major health issues such as malaria and the number of people dying from starvation.  One of the witnesses referred to Irish Aid reconsidering the reallocation of funding.  I do not think we can afford to reallocate current funding.  Rather we need to find additional funding.  We cannot afford to take money from areas where it is badly needed.<\/p><p>  I read about inefficiency at local level and slowness at international level.

It was said that the world knows what to do to solve the problem and it is a question of providing more treatment centres and tracing contacts and so on.  What exactly happens in treatment centres?

Deputy Byrne asked a question I was going to ask, but I will ask it in another way.  We all hope there will be a positive response to the call made by Mr. Andrews and Dr. Fitzpatrick for Irish doctors, nurses and health professionals to volunteer.

On the first question, the treatment centre that was opened at the weekend in Freetown is, in fact, a Sierra Leone run centre.  To the best of my knowledge, the local ministry is involved in that.  That is a strong local response and it has to be acknowledged.  There is no doubt that the local administration is doing everything within its power and deploying all the resources at its call to contain the transmission of the illness.<\/p><p>  Obviously, I defer to Dr. Fitzpatrick on the vast majority of these questions.  Ms O'Reilly might want to come in as well.  It is a fact that every 30 days delay in funding will double the cost in the requirement of medical staff.  Some 70% of cases need to be hospitalised and at present less than 40% are.  It takes six weeks at a minimum to build a medical treatment centre.  Therefore, mathematics tells one that it is out of control.  It is hard to catch up with it.  Therefore, people are thinking in terms of care in the community.  That is a developing area.<\/p><p>  The WHO designated this as a public health emergency of international concern on 8 August, and since then much has happened in terms of our understanding and the dimensions and projections.  The NHS has developed a response and has created a web portal for anybody interested in volunteering, and no doubt the HSE could do something similar.<\/p><p>  As to the question about the safety of individuals who volunteer, aid workers work in difficult circumstances, not only in Sierra Leone but in the massive humanitarian responses in Syria and the famine conditions in South Sudan.  These all are challenging conditions and aid workers put themselves in those circumstances because of vocation and their commitment to their work.  We manage risk to the best of our ability.  We cannot eliminate risk in those circumstance and volunteers understand that to be the case.<\/p><p>  Deputy Crowe asked the question about the role of education.  MSF, as I said, is at the sharp end of this in terms of treatment, but we also need to have the educational element because it is counter-intuitive to talk about not touching and caring for a dying relative.  It runs completely against any human instinct anybody has.  It is a cultural norm not only of west Africa.  It is the same everywhere.  It is a considerable challenge to break down that cultural practice.  That is one of the key jobs GOAL has been doing over the past three or four months, since May when the outbreak began.  There are more details about that in our submission to the committee today.<\/p><p>  Deputy Crowe asked a tough question as to why we NGOs are not doing the work, that MSF put it up to us and we should lift our game.  We are trying to do that.  We see that the dimensions of it are much greater than probably earlier anticipated and we do not shrink back from that call.  Deputy Eric Byrne asked about the conditions and I will let Dr. Fitzpatrick deal with that.<\/p><p>  On the question from Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on Irish Aid funding being reallocated, such reallocation is useful.  Effectively, the longer-term development work that the committee might have seen when it visited two years ago is more or less suspended at present.  It will be useful for GOAL, Concern and the other agencies which are funded through Irish Aid if that can be allocated now to this particular response because we are building isolation units where the diagnoses take place.  If an individual is diagnosed with ebola, he or she is sent to the treatment centres.  At present, however, these centres are full.  Any funding we can get access to will assist us in that work of building isolation centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014092400009#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411569000,"counter":621,"content":"<p>Education is something on which GOAL is working.

We also need to look at door-to-door work with community members, individuals and community leaders about how to change attitudes and beliefs around ebola, and that is something we are trying to work on.<br\/>It needs both.  The health system is being destroyed in Liberia and Sierra Leone because the health system is trying to deal with ebola.

When I was going into very remote regions of Sierra Leone looking for cases, I was being told initially that there were no cases in the village I was going to.  When I would turn up in the village, I would find a number of cases.  This would happen regularly, day in, day out.  One has various models predicting how many cases will occur in the next three months or six months, but we know from basic information of going into villages and finding cases that nobody has told us about previously that there are a lot more cases than are documented.<\/p><p>  Ebola is a viral haemorrhagic fever.  MSF has been containing ebola outbreaks since the 1970s.  If one looks at the literature, one will see that every time an ebola outbreak or a viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak occurred in Africa, it was MSF dealing with it.  MSF controlled those outbreaks and performed effectively because the outbreaks were small.  The major components were building the treatment centre, going out into the community, educating the community, bringing those sick cases into the ebola treatment centre, following up all the contacts of those cases in the community, and doing that for 21 days.  We have been doing that for decades with viral haemorrhagic fever such as ebola, and it works.  That is why I stated the world knows what to do.  We need to do it.<\/p><p>  However, this is a totally different ball game we are dealing with.  The scale is unprecedented and we cannot do what we could do previously in terms of building enough treatment centres, enough case finding and enough contact tracing.  We cannot do it.  From being on the ground, as many will agree, the NGOs cannot deal with this either.  That is why we are making this unusual call to get the military from larger countries involved with this outbreak.  We need military organisation to set up large numbers of ebola treatment centres across the region.  The NGOs there at present cannot do that and that is what we need.<\/p><p>  Obviously, Ireland would not be in a position to provide a large-scale military biohazard capacity simply because we are a small nation, but there are larger nations.<\/p> <p>We welcome the response from the US, which is sending 3,000 personnel to the area and setting up 17 ebola treatment centres, with possibly 100 beds in each centre.  That is the sort of response we need.  No response can be too big at this time, because we do not know how big the problem is.  We do not have all the information.<\/p><p> A question was asked in regard to the benefit of an ebola treatment centre.  Obviously, patients who arrive into an ebola treatment centre earlier have a marginally improved chance of survival, but that is not the main reason for bringing people to these centres.  We are bringing patients into the ebola treatment centres to try to stop them spreading the virus among families and friends who visit them.  We are asking the patients affected to come with us in our ambulance to our ebola treatment centre to save members of their community.  This has worked previously, but the scale of the spread of the virus is much larger this time.<\/p><p> In the Irish context and in regard to staff, while there are many NGOs in the world, very few of them have experience with treating and containing viral haemorrhagic fevers such as ebola.  We believe it is a good idea that if countries are sending out staff, they should send them out with organisations that have a track record of dealing with this issue in order that they will know they will be working in a relatively safe environment and with people who have done this previously.<\/p><p> On the issue of ebola in Nigeria versus in Sierra Leone and Liberia, there are five different types of ebola.  We can take the fingerprint of each of those types and tell which ebola is which.  The ebola in Nigeria and in Sierra Leone has the same fingerprint.  It is the same type of ebola, but the response in both countries has been hugely different.  Nigeria is a much richer country than Sierra Leone.  It has a stronger, though not perfect, public health infrastructure and has been able to respond more swiftly and widely to the cases that arrived in the country than Sierra Leone was.<\/p><p> In regard to diagnosing ebola, we have case definitions we try to disperse within the community in order that people with certain symptoms and signs will respond to our invitation and come to our treatment centre.  When they arrive, we will assess them and make a medical judgment as to whether they fit the case definition.  If they fit the case definition, we will admit them and perform the ebola test to see whether they are positive or negative.  If they are positive, they will be admitted to the confirmed tents and if negative, they will be sent home.  Prototype rapid diagnostic tests for ebola are in development and, when developed, these will mean we can take a finger prick of blood, put it on a small card device and see from the lines that develop whether ebola is present.  These tests would be similar to the tests available for malaria, but they have yet to be validated.<\/p><p> The question as to how Ireland can respond in this situation has been asked repeatedly.  First, it can make funds available to organisations working on the ground and, second, it can funnel experienced staff from within our health care system through agencies we know are safe.  It is not ideal to send staff out without the backup of an agency with a track record of working in the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014092400009#H00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Fitzpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411569600,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Fitzpatrick.

I believe the HSE has sent a paper to its management team to see whether there is a way it can seek staff who may be interested in travelling to these regions to provide cover, but I do not know whether there has been an outcome to that yet.  I support Dr. Fitzpatrick's suggestion that any staff who come forward should be funnelled through an experienced organisation that is used to dealing with this kind of emergency situation.<\/p><p>  It is clear that the systems in Liberia and Sierra Leone are underdeveloped.  Part of the reason for this is that these are post-war territories.  It is well known in terms of epidemiology that severe infectious diseases can spread more rapidly in those type of environments where health care systems are underdeveloped.  Therefore, how the disease is spreading so rapidly is understandable.  The identification and isolation of cases and prevention of transmission is the way to stop its spread.<\/p><p>  We have not spoken much about the development of a vaccine for ebola.  I believe the WHO has spearheaded work in this area, but I cannot say when a vaccine will become available.  An effort is being made to release a vaccine for ebola as soon as possible.

How best can we provide information to communities in these countries who are affected or likely to become affected, particularly in Sierra Leone which is densely populated and has poor sanitary, water and hygiene services?  It would be easier for communities in rural areas to isolate themselves.  In those circumstances, what advice can be given to the people on how best to protect themselves?

I completely agree.  Lagos is a city teeming with a phenomenal number of people, and with ebola cases confirmed in Nigeria, there is significant potential for spread.  While governments can cover up information to a certain extent, if ebola were spreading rapidly through Nigeria, as it is through Liberia, we would know about it through social media and other sources.  However, we are not seeing it.  I am not saying the cases reported in Nigeria are all the cases there are, as we do not know.  However, a situation like that in Liberia is not happening in Nigeria.  While I worked in Sierra Leone I had a mobile phone from the local telephone company, and approximately twice a day I received a message telling me to watch out for ebola.  The government is using mobile technology to send health promotion messages about ebola.  How effective it is is another question.<\/p><p>  In mid-August there was a lock-down in Sierra Leone and I was there for that.  The only effect we saw was a dip in cases for two to three days after the lock-down, followed by a spike in cases seven to ten days after the lock-down.  This fits in with the typical incubation period of ebola, which is approximately seven to ten days, and up to a maximum of 21 days.  Most NGOs would agree that the quarantine that is being effected in those areas is of no use whatsoever and spreads fear among the local population.<\/p><p>  There will always be members of any community who, when they see a lot of foreigners arrive in 4X4 vehicles and the new disease arrive at approximately the same time, will ask whether these people are bringing it.  MSF has hundreds of health promotion workers in eastern Sierra Leone and we are trying our best to get the message out that NGOs are not bringing ebola in and to get the basic knowledge of ebola into the community.

We collect epidemiological and outcome data.  When collecting the data we look for risk factors that we find recurring for patients who contract ebola.  Two major risk factors stand out and will be published in scientific journals by MSF in the near future.  One of these risk factors is close family contacts when family members of patients clean away vomit and diarrhoea without gloves or aprons.  This is the primary type of intimate contact we are seeing.  The second is in health care facilities where doctors are physically examining patients without gloves or appropriate protective equipment when the patients are actively having gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea.  Ebola loves compassion and people's need to help close family members.  We particularly see it with children, and 25% of admissions to our facility are aged under 18.  When we see children come in, we know older family members will be following closely, because when children are ill, their parents and older siblings will help them and clean away those bodily fluids they are, unfortunately, producing.<\/p><p>  Although there is no treatment for ebola, there is a reduction in mortality if people arrive early.  There are different results for different areas for a large number of reasons.  In the centre where I worked, there was a 10% to 20% reduction in the chance of mortality among those who came in early.  That is because we give people anti-malarial treatment, a broad-spectrum antibiotic such as cephalosporin, oral rehydration and, if required, intravenous rehydration.  These are not treatments but they can help some patients over the edge from becoming somebody who may die to becoming somebody who can be a survivor.  It is a gentle move along the way to helping them, not a treatment.  There are treatments in the pipeline.  There is hyperimmune serum for people who have recovered, various types of monoclonal antibodies and trial vaccines.<\/p> <p>What worries me about this is that people may think there are treatments coming down the line and that we do not have to worry about the outbreak.  They may believe that if we focus on treatments, they will come on stream and that the outbreak will be dealt with.  The problem is that, even if these treatments work - I hope they will - it will be months at a minimum before they are available on the front lines of the outbreak.  That is why we keep going back to the basics of outbreak control, which are finding cases in the community, bringing those affected to the ebola treatment centres, following up on contacts and educating the community.  Unfortunately, as I said before, this task is now too big for any NGO.  We need to be bigger in terms of our intervention such as involving the US military and its dedication of more than 3,000 personnel.  We hope this will be followed up by other organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014092400011#K00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Gabriel Fitzpatrick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411570800,"counter":638,"content":"<p>Was the vaccine used on the American doctor successful?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014092400012#L00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411570800,"counter":639,"content":"<p>Obviously, I have no available scientific paper on these vaccines because they have not been subject to large trials.

Deputy Brendan Smith asked about the international response.  The recent adoption of the UN Security Council resolution and the establishment of the new UN mission indicate the seriousness with which the international community is treating the issue.  The appointment of Dr. David Nabarro to lead the response co-ordination at the WHO and the United Nations is also a very important development.  In 2005 he was the United Nations' senior co-ordinator during the avian influenza pandemic.  I hope the timing is right in that this is UN General Assembly Leader's Week.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, is in attendance and a number of high level meetings are taking place, including one called by the UN Secretary General, as well as a transatlantic meeting hosted by the US Secretary of State, Mr. John Kerry.  The European Union has announced funding of &euro;140 million in additional development aid to go towards strengthening health systems, setting up mobile laboratories and accelerating vaccine innovation.  The United Kingdom has announced that it will host an international donor conference in London at the beginning of October to further raise awareness and seek additional funding.  All of these developments are pointing in the right direction and I hope we will see better international co-ordination of the response to the crisis.<\/p><p>  Deputies Se&aacute;n Crowe and Bernard J. Durkan asked about the education campaign.  We absolutely agree that education in local areas is key, which is why Irish Aid has given &euro;350,000 specifically for that purpose.  This feeds into the questions about recent developments in Sierra Leone raised by Deputies Eric Byrne and Se&aacute;n Crowe.  I was in touch with our ambassador in Freetown this morning to ask whether the recent campaign there was successful.  She said initial reports, including the results of a monitoring exercise conducted by the UN development programme, suggested the campaign was a success.  It was a house-to-house sensitisation campaign and apparently 85% of households in the country had been reached with education messages and soap.  That might sound simplistic, but soap is so important in the fight against ebola.  There is an ebola hotline in Sierra Leone and the number of calls to the hotline increased, including calls about suspected cases and requests for assistance with burials.  The ambassador's initial assessment was that the campaign had certainly been successful in galvanising local momentum in trying to curtail the outbreak.<\/p><p>  Deputy Eric Byrne asked a question about the situation in Nigeria.  Dr. Fitzpatrick has already answered it, but I would add that the main differences are scale and methods of transmission.<\/p><p>  Mr. Gardner will deal with the question of the safety of our own staff.

In conjunction with the HSE, we have sent personal protective equipment which Dr. Fitzpatrick has showed the staff how to use.  As soap is in very short supply in Sierra Leone, we have sent hand sanitisers, which are a key weapon in the fight against infection.  Anyone arriving at the embassy is asked to sanitise his or her hands and make sure he or she follows basic hygiene protocols.  Understandably, in the early days staff at the embassy had a number of questions which the HSE was able to answer.  It provided the information required.  The staff have passed on the information to Irish citizens in the region.  It is all about education and sharing information, not just with the local population but also with anyone who comes in contact with the mission.  We are in ongoing contact with our staff and very aware that they are working in a very difficult environment.

That is our initial response.  As  an organisation, we are very flexible in terms of the funding we have allocated to a number of our partners which are working in the countries affected.  We are open to requests from them for a reallocation of funds because a number of development activities, including some in our own bilateral aid programme, are not going to happen in Sierra Leone and Liberia as a result of the crisis.  The funding for these activities which has been approved can be reallocated quickly.  That is our first line and an important response.  In addition, the Minister is actively considering further funding contributions to keep treatment facilities in priority areas operational and enable them to address current and future case loads.  Funding is also being considered for a contact tracing service, a key prevention mechanism.   One of the key issues in the longer term will be the secondary impact of the pandemic in terms of its impact on health and education systems and food security.

We must pay tribute to all the NGOs and Irish NGOs, as well as our embassy staff.<br\/>I also thank the officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which is a major player, for their attendance, and I thank Dr. Bonner from the Department of Health, who made a contribution as well.  All are major players in our co-ordinated approach.<br\/>The three actions encouraged by all the witnesses this afternoon are important.  The first is a recognition of the need for a larger-scale military response.  Both Mr. Andrews and Dr. Fitzpatrick have said that it is very important for countries to respond.  The Americans have responded, so we will encourage more of the larger countries to send in a large military force to help co-ordinate the crisis.<br\/>Both organisations recognised the need for additional funding.  Ms Ingoldsby said that the Minister was considering more additional funding to deal with the outbreak.  That is important and we are delighted to hear it.  Obviously, funding, resources and equipment are extremely important.  As Dr. Fitzpatrick has said, some health workers have to work without gloves and the basic essentials necessary to deal with the ebola outbreak.  In our future discussions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister of State and the Secretary General of the Department, who are due to come before the committee shortly, we will raise these issues with them.<br\/>As Mr. Andrews from GOAL said, there is a need for trained health care personnel.  This is a view that was outlined by Dr. Fitzpatrick as well.  It is extremely important that such personnel be made available through organisations with a proven track record.  GOAL has a proven track record in that area.  There is also a need to put in place a central evacuation system at an EU level.  Of course, getting in and out is important, as I said at the beginning of the meeting, now that many of the commercial airlines have ceased flying in the region.  Dr. Fitzpatrick referred to this matter as well.  Aid workers must be able to get in and out of the region in cases of emergency, etc.  The UN is probably doing some of this type of work at the moment, but mobility needs to be increased.<br\/>The committee will take on board the suggestions made by the witnesses.  The timing of this meeting was important given the current state of the ebola crisis in west Africa.  We will take on board the suggestions made to the Department.  I am delighted that the Department is represented here today.  We thank GOAL and <font color=\"#2F2F2F\">M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res for attending, and I am sure other agencies want to attend.  The crisis is one that we will revisit in the coming months, given the statistics provided by Washington and the World Health Organization which showed what is happening and what could happen.  The crisis could even get worse in 2015 and it is definitely an issue that we will revisit, monitor and keep in touch about.<\/font><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  I thank all of the delegations for their work in west Africa, particularly Dr. Fitzpatrick, who has spent some time there, and the other health care workers, who put their safety at risk.

The service was set up 20 years ago, its remit being to offer immediate support and assistance to visitors to the country who became victims of crime.<\/p> <p>It is widely accepted that tourists are targeted for crime.  They are in unfamiliar surroundings and are easily identifiable.  They are often carrying large amounts of cash and valuables and being on holiday they are relaxed and at ease and therefore potentially more vulnerable.  Often their own behaviour inadvertently results in them being victimised. <br\/>Tourists who are victims of crime require immediate practical assistance as they have different needs and a different set of challenges to those of residents of the country who become victims of crime. They may not speak the language; they may not have access to information and they may be travelling on their own.  They will most likely be distressed and many if not all formal procedures will be different to those at home.  Many tourists are left stranded without the means to support themselves and this adds enormously to their difficulties. <br\/>One of the main aims of the service is to minimise the consequences of crime both emotionally and financially.  In order to achieve this, ITAS mediates with the Garda, embassies, airlines and other agencies, for those who need assistance.  We also work closely with the tourism and hospitality industry to meet the immediate needs of tourists who are left stranded as a result of crime.  Through the goodwill of the industry, ITAS offers complimentary accommodation, meals, transport and other relevant support in situations where tourists require this emergency assistance.  ITAS offers a free and confidential service and operates seven days a week throughout the year.  Two full-time staff are employed by ITAS and nine part-time staff are employed through the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s community employment scheme.  We have a number of volunteers that can provide translations and interpreting if required over the telephone. <br\/>The service deals with all types of crime - thefts, serious assaults and even homicide.  However, the majority of tourists who seek assistance from ITAS are victims of theft. Our main priority is to address tourists&rsquo; immediate needs.  In doing this we allow them to regain control of the situation in which they find themselves.  Since its inception ITAS has assisted nearly 13,000 tourists, 87% of whom continued their holiday plans. <br\/>For 14 years, ITAS had its office in the Garda headquarters in Harcourt Square, Dublin 2, which was ideal for the seven day a week service.  Since 2009 ITAS has been operating out of two locations.  From Monday to Friday we have an office in the Refugee Appeals Tribunal building in Hanover Street East, Dublin 2, and at weekends and public holidays we have an office in the reception area of Store Street Garda station. This is very confusing and affects the continuity of the service.  The main office is very difficult to find and for a tourist who has been a victim of crime and not familiar with the city it poses serious problems.  It is also in an area that is prone to criminal damage and vandalism.  While we are grateful to all involved for accommodating the service, the situation is far from ideal.  In order to best assist tourists, we require a city centre location which is accessible seven days a week.  We intend to raise the issue with the Department but any support the committee can provide would be appreciated. <br\/>The 2012 EU directive establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime must be implemented by EU member states including Ireland by 16 November 2015.  The directive is legally binding and will ensure that all victims of crime will be entitled to the same rights, support and protection, regardless of where in the European Union the crime was committed.  Among the many new rights is the right of the victim to receive information throughout the criminal justice process.  The onus will be on the state to ensure that victims are kept informed about any developments in their case.  It also establishes an obligation on member states to inform victims about support services and other relevant information when reporting a crime.  <br\/>Many victims find it difficult to receive information about their case.  When a tourist returns to his or her home country, contacting the Garda station for information can be very costly and time consuming as in many cases the garda is not on duty.  There is currently no way to contact the Garda or Garda station via e-mail.  The UK has introduced TrackMyCrime, a service that allows victims of crime to access the progress of the investigation of their crime as well as contact the officer leading the investigation.  This would be useful for all victims of crime but particularly so in cross border cases.<br\/>Between 85% and 90% of tourists who receive assistance from ITAS are informed of the service by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Even though we receive great co-operation from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, ITAS only assists between 10% and 12% of all tourists who report a crime in Ireland.  We know from previous research that 96% of tourist victims of crime who received support from ITAS said that they would still recommend Ireland as a tourist destination.  This is an excellent indicator of the positive role the service plays in managing negative experiences. <br\/>The directive requires all member states to facilitate referrals from the police and other relevant agencies to victim support services.  The introduction of data protection legislation saw the reduction in referrals of victims to victim support services and as such a reduction in the number of victims accessing support.  Currently, garda&iacute; must seek consent from victims prior to referral to support services.  This process is subjective and some victims may not be asked if they want to access support services.  Also the approach by which they are informed about services may deter them from seeking help.<font color=\"#4181C0\"><\/font><br\/>We believe victims of crime should automatically be referred to support services unless they express a wish not to be referred.  Tourists by their very nature require immediate assistance in the aftermath of crime.  With the introduction of the directive, all victims have the right to access support services. We look forward to receiving information from the Department and-or relevant agencies on the facilitation of referrals and we will work in conjunction with them if required to assist in any way that we can in this process.  <br\/>ITAS is a registered charity and receives funding from both public and private sources.  In 2013, ITAS&rsquo; income was &euro;112,000.  This was not sufficient to cover its costs.  In the past number of years the company&rsquo;s income has reduced by approximately 20%.  ITAS has assisted a greater number of tourists in this time with fewer resources at its disposal.  With a potential 90% increase in referrals to the service, extra financial resources are not only required for the effective operation of the service but for its survival.  <br\/>ITAS is recognised as leading the field in Europe in terms of the assistance it provides to tourist victims of crime.  In the past we have had interested parties on research visits from England, Austria, Portugal, Malta and New Zealand.  Currently we are offering information and advice to victim support in England and Scotland as they plan on setting up a similar service to assist visitors to their countries who become victims of crime. <br\/>We are honoured by the awards that ITAS has gained internationally.  In 2004, Ann Meade, a founding member, was awarded an MBE in recognition of the service provided to British visitors and in 2008 Bernard Lavelle, manager and former volunteer, was made a <i>cavaliere<\/i>in the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity by the President of Italy for the support which ITAS has provided to its citizens.  Later this year President Michael D. Higgins will host an event to mark the 20th anniversary of ITAS at &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  The service that ITAS provides makes a positive difference to the experiences of tourist victim of crime.

This issue is also a matter for the National Transport Authority and has been raised with it.  Little is done because the tourist returns home, but such crime is not good for our tourism image.  It is particularly damaging when it happens in a confined area around the city centre.  Crime against tourists is just one of the problems that exists on the red Luas line, but has ITAS ever raised the issue with the NTA or the Luas operators?

I remind those present to switch off their mobile phones.  We are pleased to welcome today Mr. Paul Kenny, Pensions Ombudsman, who will make a presentation on the role and remit of the ombudsman and the challenges facing his organisation in light of the proposed amalgamations.  He is accompanied today by Ms Joan Bray, senior investigator.  I welcome them and thank them for forwarding their presentation which has been circulated to members.  Mr. Kenny was appointed Pensions Ombudsman in 2003 and reappointed in 2009.  The role of the Pensions Ombudsman is to investigate complaints of financial loss due to maladministration and disputes of fact or law in relation to certain pension retirement schemes.  The Pensions Ombudsman acts as an impartial adjudicator and is completely independent in the performance of these functions.  Many of our members are eager to hear the presentation and engage with the representatives.<br\/>I must inform witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act, 2009 they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014092400003#D00100","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411571400,"counter":724,"content":"<p>The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman was established under Part 11 of the Pensions Act 1990 as inserted by the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002.  The object was to permit the grant of redress.  Although the Pensions Board established by the Pensions Act 1990 had powers of investigation, it had no power to grant redress where a person had suffered financial loss.  The Pensions Ombudsman is a statutory officer and the employees of the office are civil servants in the service of the State.  The Pensions Ombudsman investigates and decides complaints and disputes from individuals about their occupational pension schemes, that is, employer-sponsored rather than personal pensions, personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, which were also established by the 2002 Act, and trust retirement annuity contracts.  These are contracts intended for groups of self-employed people in the same type of employment.  For example, the Law Society caters for solicitors who want to opt in to the scheme.  These are held under trust.  We award redress where maladministration results in financial loss.<\/p><p>  The Pensions Ombudsman is completely independent and impartial.  We aim to resolve complaints impartially, informally and quickly.  If we cannot assist with the particular complaint, we explain why and we may suggest other avenues for resolving the matter.  There is no charge to the public for the service provided.  As part of the public service reform plan, the Government decided in 2013 that the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman and the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau would amalgamate.  We will address that later.<\/p><p>  Determinations of the Pensions Ombudsman are binding on all parties to a complaint or dispute subject to the right of appeal to the High Court.  I prefer less formal intervention or mediation, where possible, as it achieves faster and better results than a formal determination.<\/p> <p>A formal determination generally leaves one party dissatisfied.<\/p><p> I was originally appointed in 2003 and reappointed in 2009.  I was due to retire on age grounds in 2013 but was reappointed to assist with the proposed merger of the offices.<\/p><p> A person can complain to the Pensions Ombudsman if he or she believes he or she has suffered financial loss because of poor administration of an occupational pension scheme, PRSA or trust retirement annuity contract.  Those eligible to complain are a member, a former or potential member, or someone who claims the right to be a member of a pension scheme; a surviving dependant or legal personal representative of a member who has died; a person claiming to be a member or a surviving dependant; and a widow or widower of a deceased member or contributor to a PRSA regardless of whether they claim to be dependent.  If the person eligible to complain dies, is under 18, or is otherwise unable to act for himself or herself, then the complaint may be made by that individual's personal representative, or by a relative or other suitable person, including, for example, a trade union official, a public representative, an agency such as Citizens Information or MABS.  Without claiming to be at a financial loss, anyone eligible to complain can refer a dispute of fact or law to the Pensions Ombudsman.  Complaints are usually made against those responsible for the management of occupational pension schemes and PRSAs.  A complaint may be against those who are, or have been, trustees, managers of schemes, employers, former employers and administrators, including PRSA providers.<\/p><p> The Pensions Ombudsman also investigates disputes of fact or law concerning pension schemes, between members and others entitled to benefit from the schemes, and trustees, managers or employers.  The question of jurisdiction is to be determined by the Pensions Ombudsman and that determination is final.  There is no appeal against the determination of jurisdiction.<\/p><p> To succeed with a complaint, it is not enough that the complainant does not agree with a decision by those managing a scheme or a PRSA.  The complainant must have reason to believe that the decision was not properly made or implemented and must have sustained actual financial loss to obtain redress.  Redress in this case is limited to the actual loss of scheme benefit and there is no facility to make an award for inconvenience or even expense incurred in pursuing a complaint.<\/p><p> Even where there is no financial loss, the Pensions Ombudsman may give whatever directions he considers necessary or expedient for the satisfaction of a complaint or dispute.  No determination may be made, however, which has the effect of changing the rules of a scheme or granting the complainant more than the rules entitle him to.  Neither may he substitute his decision for one properly taken under a discretionary power.<\/p><p> Disputes of fact or law usually arise out of a complaint of poor administration, without needing a separate investigation.  Whether a complaint involves bad administration or a dispute of fact or law is for the Pensions Ombudsman to decide.  He cannot investigate any matter that is before a court.<\/p><p> When he receives a complaint submission, the Pensions Ombudsman must then decide whether the matter is one that he can deal with.  If he cannot investigate a complaint or dispute, the complainant will be told as soon as the preliminary examination of the complaint is finished.  This could happen because the matter is not on the list of matters the Pensions Ombudsman is allowed to look at, or because the time limits set out in the Pensions Act have expired.  If there is another ombudsman or authority that may be able to look at the complaint, the Pensions Ombudsman may seek permission to forward the details to that other body.  If the ombudsman decides to investigate the complaint or dispute, the complainant may be asked for further information.  Other parties to the complaint must be sent copies of the submission made to the ombudsman, and parties are required to name any other person whom they consider may be affected by the outcome of the complaint or dispute.<\/p><p> Generally speaking, investigations are conducted by correspondence and telephone.  The Pensions Ombudsman may hold an oral hearing under oath if there are matters that cannot be ascertained from the papers in the case, if the good name of someone is impugned and he or she wants the right to clear it, or if the credibility of witnesses needs to be tested.  In practice, oral hearings are rare.  Statements or admissions made by parties in the course of an investigation may not be used against them in a criminal prosecution.<\/p><p> The amount of time it takes to investigate will depend on how complicated the matter is.  When the Pensions Ombudsman is near the end of an investigation, he may give a preliminary view to all parties to the complaint or dispute.  This will list the facts as they have been found during the investigation and the ombudsman's view on how he is likely to rule on the matter.  At that stage the parties will have a chance to provide any further information or evidence they feel is important to the case.  The Pensions Ombudsman will not give a preliminary view in all cases, only those where he feels it right to do so.  He will then make a final ruling on the issue that is the subject of the complaint or dispute.<\/p><p> Financial redress may be awarded in a case where the Pensions Ombudsman decides that the complainant has suffered a loss of entitlement due to the poor administration of a pension scheme or a PRSA.  He may make a ruling even if the complaint is withdrawn during the investigation on the basis that the person complained against has as much right to have the matter decided as the person who has made the complaint.  A determination, if made, is legally binding on all parties, subject to the right of appeal to the High Court.  If a determination is not complied with, action for enforcement may be brought in the Circuit Court, either by the aggrieved party or by me.<\/p><p> I also have power to bring prosecutions against persons who have been requested, and have failed, to provide documents or information in the course of an investigation.  Failure to comply with such requests is a criminal offence under the Pensions Acts.  I can also bring an action in the Circuit Court to compel discovery of information unless that information is the subject of legal or professional privilege.  Jurisdiction of the Pensions Ombudsman extends to all occupational pension schemes, including those of the public service, and those responsible for the administration of schemes, including employers, trustees and a great many bodies which provide services to pension schemes.<\/p><p> I want to mention a few concerns and challenges.  There is currently a steering group, comprising representatives of the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman, the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau, the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Social Protection, working on the legislative, administrative, logistical and other measures that will be needed to achieve the amalgamation of the offices.  I note that amalgamation has been announced as part of the legislation programme for 2015.  I believe it was announced the day before yesterday.<\/p><p> The legislation governing the two offices is complex and there are differences between them in terms of time limits, jurisdiction and so on, many of which will have to be retained for legal and technical reasons.  The work involved in preparing for the merger will place additional demands on both offices.  In the meantime we have suffered from staff shortages, as vacancies have not been filled and the number of complaints received has remained steady for the past couple of years, although the numbers are not as high as they were in 2013.  I have included some statistics at the end of the submission concerning the number of complaints received.<\/p><p> In the context of the review, the powers of the ombudsmen are being examined in detail and, when this examination is completed, recommendations will be made on legislative changes that will be required.  Currently, back-office functions such as paying bills, wages and so on are provided to our office by the Department of Social Protection.  IS services and HR backup are also included.  It is expected that these functions will be provided in the future by resources already available to Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau.<\/p><p> The Pensions Ombudsman has absolute privilege in terms of the law on defamation in respect of any report he may publish on an investigation.  However, case studies published in annual reports of the office are drafted in a manner which protects the anonymity of parties.  This is because if there is too much detail, it is too easy to identify a person, particularly in Ireland.  The office is subject to the Freedom of Information Acts, but the files concerning examination and investigation of complaints and disputes are exempt.  I am, however, concerned about attempts by some individuals to use data protection legislation as a back door to getting information that they could not obtain under freedom of information and which has been given to us in the course of an investigation on a strictly confidential basis.  Such information can be very sensitive from a commercial and personal point of view.<\/p><p> The budget of the office is small at about &euro;1 million.  Of course, the gross cost is more if one takes into account the work the Department of Social Protection does for us.  Approximately 70% of the &euro;1 million goes on staff costs.  A major item is legal expenses, which cannot be predicted in advance because we cannot determine who might appeal against us.  So far we have won most appeals taken against us and costs recovered have been paid directly back to the Exchequer.  Some costs may not be recoverable, such as when a lay litigant brings an appeal and does not have the means to pay legal costs.<\/p> <p>I am also concerned about the number of appeals brought by arms of the State against determinations because, regardless of the outcome of those appeals, the costs of both sides have to the borne by the taxpayer.  I will be happy to respond to any questions members of the committee may wish to put to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014092400003#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kenny","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411572300,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kenny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014092400005#F00200","speaker":"998"},{"type":"speech","time":1411572300,"counter":728,"content":"<p>I thank the ombudsman for his presentation.

It also has the power to bring prosecutions in the District Court or through the Director of Public Prosecutions in the Circuit Court if the case is serious enough.  It has brought a number of prosecutions, in particular in cases where contributions have been deducted from pension scheme members and retained or misappropriated by employers and not remitted to pension schemes.  That was notorious in the construction industry in the early days of my office and the collapse of the construction industry in the wake of the general collapse in the economy aggravated the problem because quite a number of the firms involved went into liquidation or simply threw away the keys and walked.  Quite a number of people have been out of pocket as a result.<\/p><p>  There have also been a number of tragic cases involving building workers who have died and, because their contributions were not up to date, their families did not receive the mortality benefits they were due.  In the course of our investigations we have come across a number of cases where people have tried to fool us as to their past behaviour.  One such firm, which we found against, went so far as to ask for a judicial review in the High Court and we have reported in an annual report that Mr. Justice Hedigan said that the conduct of the applicant, namely, the building firm in question, had been characterised throughout by fraud and deceit.  We have had quite of number of such cases.  The non-remittance of contributions is not confined to the construction industry.

What we deal with is much more nebulous, and the people in jurisdiction include employers, for example, which range from Frisby &amp;amp; Co. with two employees to the ESB, and they all have different needs and different ways of operating.  Trustees can range from individual small companies to professional trustee companies, and in between there will be groups of individuals appointed as trustees, including member trustees of the larger pension schemes and so on.  The parties we deal with are very different and if the problems we have to deal with in pension schemes become fully fledged investigations, which, as I mentioned, we try to avoid if possible, they are much more complicated.  The investigations sometimes go on for quite a long time because of the complexity of the issues involved.<\/p><p>  In terms of our philosophical approach, there is no difference.

There are slight differences in that the Financial Services Ombudsman, for example, can make an award for pain and suffering, distress and so on; we cannot do that.  There is a financial limit to the awards the Financial Services Ombudsman can make.  In principle there is no limit to the award I can make; it is whatever it costs to put the issue right.  Whereas we can only deal with individual members and contributors, the Financial Services Ombudsman has the power to take complaints from small companies whose turnover is under &euro;3 million; that is the difference between us.<\/p><p>  We would not differ significantly in our approach to the way we investigate matters.  There have been appeals to the High Court which were decided differently in our two cases.  I have tried to limit the operation of oral hearings as much as possible because they are extremely expensive and largely unnecessary.  Only in cases where there is a dire necessity to hold an oral hearing will I do so, but some of the judgments of the High Court in the case of the Financial Services Ombudsman have suggested that he should grant an oral hearing almost on request.  Some of the later judgments have toned that down somewhat, but some of the earlier ones painted him into a corner which he probably would prefer not to be in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014092400006#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Kenny"},{"type":"speech","time":1411572900,"counter":741,"content":"<p>When this amalgamated office is established - one assumes the legislation will be passed, with some amendments - is it a strict amalgamation of the two businesses, so to speak - pensions and financial services - or will it be something different?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2014092400006#G00400","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411572900,"counter":742,"content":"<p>It will be a hybrid.

We are all members of what was formerly the British and Irish Ombudsman Association and is now simply the Ombudsman Association.  It is the policy of the Ombudsman Association that, where possible, if public services are devolved into the private sector - that is, where the responsibility for a public service is retained by a public body but contracted out to a private provider - then the ombudsman should retain jurisdiction over that service.  In such cases, the ultimate responsibility for providing the service will rest with a local authority or similar, even though the day-to-day provision is done by somebody else in the private sector.  In other words, the service remains a public service.  There is a case to be made for that approach.  The issue arises much more often in the United Kingdom, where the authorities were much quicker to privatise everything in sight than we have been.

As it is an independent and objective body, it is important that there be a high threshold for rejecting a recommendation of an ombudsman.

We do not make recommendations lightly and I certainly do not make determinations lightly.  I try to solve problems, if possible, by lifting the telephone and telling people what is coming down the tracks and asking if they want to do something about.

I wish to advise that the statement that I am about to make is that of the council's executive and not the elected members.  The statement, for the most part, reiterates and updates my submission to the  joint committee on 30 June of this year.<\/p><p>  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is fully supportive of the national ports policy and has engaged with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport since the policy was launched last year.  I view D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour as a valuable and integral asset of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown as a county and of the town of D&uacute;n Laoghaire as well as the greater Dublin region.<\/p><p>  The council has commenced a formal engagement with D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company.  A working transition steering committee now meets regularly to enable the transition of functions from the Minister to the chief executive of the local authority.  The steering committee is currently in the process of engaging due diligence expertise, having received confirmation from the Department that it will fund the exercise.  It is anticipated that the process will run alongside the work of the transition group and will highlight any areas for attention or concern prior to the transfer.<\/p><p>  Having reviewed the general scheme of the harbours (amendment) Bill 2014 and the associated regulatory impact analysis, my comments are as follows.  Heads 1 to 6, inclusive, are noted and we have no comment.  With regard to head 7, in the explanatory notes it is clear that control of the port is to transfer to the local authority.  However, as it currently stands, the board has no vacancies as all positions have been filled.  In effect, the new shareholder of the local authority will have no ability to appoint members to the board of the company until 2016.  The explanatory note to subhead (3)(c) states that ministerial appointments of directors will no longer apply, yet the authority for this function is not expressly indicated in the heads.  In my opinion, that should be done in the Act and not in company fillings as envisaged.  Consideration should be given by the joint committee to affording the chief executive an opportunity to appoint supplemental board members in the short term to ensure a smooth transition.  This has been the subject of discussion with Department officials and they have indicated that they will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.  It should also be noted that any reference to county or city manager should now be replaced with the new title of chief executive.  I note that it is not intended that the Minister retain any corporate governance function or oversight of the company, and that these areas will be the sole responsibility of the local authority.  It would be desirable that some guidance or mandatory obligations in the area of corporate governance apply, expressly and by law, to the company.  That means obligations consistent with those applicable to the council staff with regard to ethics, particularly the code of conduct and the Local Government Act 2001.  In this regard the joint committee may wish to consider requiring that the statutory ethics provisions of Part 15 of the Local Government Act apply to the company.  The matter has been discussed with Departmental officials and could be addressed in sections 27 to 29, inclusive, of the Harbours Act 1996.<\/p> <p>It is further noted that there is no reference in the scheme as to whether sections 139, 140 or 183 of the Local Government Act 2001 will apply in regard to the operation of the company.  The joint committee might wish to consider the implications of same.<br\/>Heads 8 to 10 are noted and we have no comment.  In head 11 it is noted that the Minister's powers to issue directions are limited as described in head 11(1) and these are <i>sui generis <\/i>to the development of harbours and safety in the context of the national ports policy rather than relating to specific locations.<br\/><i><\/i>In Part 3, heads 12 to 16, the council has already expressed a preference for the process in Part 2 of the general scheme and does not propose to comment on Part 3.  Part 4 does not relate to D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour and Part 5, head 19, does not apply to the harbour.  On head 20, it is noted that this provision maintains the exclusion of elected members from being directors of a company established in accordance with Part 2, as has been the case since 2009.  Heads 21 to 23 are noted and we have no comment.  On head 24, the council notes this provision and that there is an extant request made under the Harbours Acts to extend the limits of D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour from 600 m to 1500 m.  The council is supportive of this request as it will facilitate the continuing development of the cruise business in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Head 25 is noted and we have no comment.<br\/>It should be noted that, following recent discussions with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and having reviewed a document entitled &ldquo;Likely required Ministerial reference changes on foot of a company transferred under Head 7&rdquo;, dated 30 July 2014, there appears to be a significant transfer of oversight responsibilities and autonomy from the Minister to local councils, which we have been seeking in our discussions.  In particular, there are the proposed changes to sections 27, 28 and 29 of the Harbours Act 1996.<br\/>The issue mentioned earlier regarding control, under Part 2, appears to be addressed in head 17(3).  However, the proposed changes are silent on the existing company board composition and whether the chief executive will have the power to remove existing directors upon assuming responsibility for the company.  Clarification is also required regarding the terminology used when redrafting the legislation.  For example, where the words &quot;local authority&quot; are used, does that refer to the elected council or the chief executive?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400003#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Philomena Poole","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411548000,"counter":819,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Bradshaw from Galway Harbour Company to make his presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400004#D00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411548000,"counter":820,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak this morning.  We are not legislators or legal people so my presentation is about the context in which the port of Galway will operate following the transfer of the shareholding to Galway City Council.  We are very much aware of the proposed changes and are kept well informed by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We take a positive view of the changes.<br\/>The steering group for ourselves and Galway City Council has been appointed.  The committee will already have received a copy of our report relating to the Bill and, second, a copy of a submission to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on the transfer of control of ports of regional significance to local authorities.<br\/>The port of Galway is a progressive and forward-thinking port with major ambition for expansion.  This ambition is strongly supported by the current and past boards.  The port is a gated medieval port operating for just four hours per day, with a maximum capacity to handle ships of not more than 7,000 tonnes.  Despite this, the port has been profitable every year since its incorporation in 1996.  There was an exception in 2012 due to necessary works associated with the Volvo Ocean Race stopover.  At this stage, however, the port is not fit for purpose.  What business could be sustainable if it were only open for four hours per day?<br\/>The port has applied to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for planning permission for an extension to the port which will involve the formation of approximately 24 hectares of new land and 660 m of deep-water quays.  The result will be a modern port capable of facilitating ships with a tonnage in excess of 30,000 tonnes and the world's largest cruise liners.  Unfortunately, we recently had the experience of the <i>Crystal Symphony<\/i>, which came into the bay and anchored off Mutton Island but was unable to bring its 1,500 passengers ashore due to weather conditions and the fact that it could not berth.  That is an ongoing problem and a major disadvantage.  The development of the new port will allow, in turn, the development and rejuvenation of the inner dock area of 32 acres which is located in the city centre.  The plans in that respect are for arts and tourist facilities and living accommodation.  Connected to Galway Harbour Company is the Galway Harbour Company Enterprise Park of 40 acres, in which 500 individuals are employed.  A further 500 jobs are projected to result from the port extension.  In addition, 200 jobs will be created during construction.<br\/>The national ports policy, NPP, which was published in 2013, designated the Port of Galway as a port of regional significance or in the third level of commercial ports in Ireland.  This designation was not welcome, as it clearly placed the port at a disadvantage in terms of competing with national ports - that is, tier 1 and tier 2 ports.  More importantly, it excluded the port from any possible development funding from the European Union, such as TEN-T funding.  The port is the largest port in Ireland to be excluded from possible European funding.  As the only designated commercial port in the west of Ireland and with a catchment area extending from Clare to Donegal and east to the midlands, the need for a proper commercial tier 2 national port in the region is obvious.  In addition, Galway city is the third largest urban area in the country, with a commercial port operating since the Middle Ages.  Notwithstanding these issues, the port has worked constructively with Galway City Council, the proposed new shareholder, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in implementing the change of shareholder.  It has also been very much involved in its remit under the plan for the provision of marine and leisure facilities.<br\/>It is worth mentioning the visit of the Volvo Ocean Race on two occasions, in 2009 and 2012.  In 2012 the port of Galway hosted the final leg of the race and was adjudged the best stopover of the race.  The economic benefit to Galway was enormous, with more than 500,000 people visiting the event, including 100,000 overseas visitors, and &euro;60.5 million spent, with an input of &euro;6.5 million by local enterprise.  We hope to get the race back again.  We have strong support in that regard from all local entities.  We have bid for the Tall Ships Race for 2018.  We are ambitious in that regard.<br\/>There are critical issues.  With regard to port expansion, there is no provision or safeguard in the Bill to allow for the proposed and ongoing planning application to be brought to fruition.  Over &euro;3 million has been spent on the planning process to date, but this is not recognised in the national ports policy.  The NPP has identified the tier 1 and tier 2 ports as the lead ports in providing deep-water facilities in the State.  The contradiction is that the port of Galway holds permission from the Government to apply for deep-water facilities as part of the port extension.  The port requires in-built confirmation that the completion of the project would not be stymied by the new shareholder or the fact that the port is not a tier 1 or tier 2 port.<br\/>As I understand it, the port of Galway will continue to be governed by the Harbours Act 1996 and amendments to that Act.  Are the amendments fully compatible with the Local Authority Acts?  Will the fact that Galway City Council, in its role as shareholder, is governed by the Local Authority Acts have an effect on the port of Galway?<br\/>The election of directors is a vital decision making process for a commercial enterprise.  What will the process be?  Will the chief executive of Galway City Council have the power to appoint directors?  Will the council members have an input?  Will the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government or the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport have a veto?  The most important question is one of suitability, which is not always the case for the appointment as a director.  There is a need for directors with specific skill sets.  The process must be open, transparent and accountable.  This is particularly true where the executive team is small in number.  For example, in the port of Galway the only two executives are Captain Sheridan and myself.<br\/>With regard to funding, most people would question the funding for the development of the port, which in phase one will amount to almost &euro;52 million.  This has always been a difficult issue and, in terms of approval, a protracted process.  What level of decision making, if any, will the new shareholder have in approving funding for the port?  More importantly, could it be a dissenting voice?  As the funding for the proposed extension of the port of Galway will be dependent on significant borrowings, it is essential that the decision-making principles be clear and unambiguous.  Will the shareholder be in a position to grant some form of funding for port development?<\/p> <p>This is disallowed under the national ports policy.<\/p><p> It is essential that the non-national ports remain competitive and fit for purpose.  Many local exporters and importers require the retention of commercial ports in their areas if they are to continue to trade competitively.  Travelling to tier 1 or tier 2 ports would result in prohibitive costs for many port users in the western region.  The Bill should not or cannot be allowed to give tier 1 and 2 ports a totally dominant position in the marketplace.<\/p><p> The Port of Galway has ambitions to become a tier 2 port in the short to medium term.  There must be a mechanism to allow for a port to be upgraded to a higher level.  No such facility has been included in the proposed legislation.  This is a very important issue from the point of view of the Port of Galway, particularly if the extension of the harbour proceeds.<\/p><p> I am aware that this matter is covered under other legislation, but the issue relating to the foreshore is a major one for many ports and remains a problem, particularly in a legacy context.  There is no mention of this matter in the proposed amendments.<\/p><p> From our perspective, some of the most important people with whom we deal are the members of our staff and we did ask them to contribute their views on the national ports policy.  Staff are a vital ingredient in the management and development of any port.  The position is no different when it comes to the Port of Galway.  We have an excellent and dedicated staff and they articulated their view on the port by saying: \"The ports of Regional Significance are just that i.e. significant and they must be allowed to play their part in the ongoing development of regional\/economic policies while at the same time protecting the rights of employees.\"<\/p><p> Regional ports of significance should remain significant contributors and driving forces of the local economies they serve.  Any decision or legislation that would reduce the economic influence of these ports should be shelved.  Failure to develop the Port of Galway would have a devastating effect on many local industries that ply their trade through the port.  The consequence would be a major loss of employment in areas that are already unemployment black-spots and ravaged by emigration.  I thank the Chair for his indulgence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400004#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamon Bradshaw","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411548600,"counter":822,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to come before the committee.  I am just going to say a few words before I hand over to Mr. Howard Knott, our director of trade and facilitation, in order to provide a bit of context about our organisation.  The Irish Exporters Association, IEA, is a national membership organisation and represents small, one-man operations right up to some of the largest FDI-based companies in Ireland, many of which are engaged in exporting and importing.  In addition, there are those companies which import and add value to products for re-exporting them.  Many of our members are logistics companies, while others are involved with national infrastructure around exporting, be it the airports, the ports or the rail network.  Our view is informed by the way in which the organisation is constructed.  We previously made submissions in respect of Competition in the Irish Ports Sector, which was published in 2013 by the Competition Authority, the national ports policy and the scheme of the Bill before the committee.  In addition, we have issued a lot of publications in this area.  These include our Trade and Transport Analysis.<\/p><p>  I will now hand over to Mr. Knott, who is our director of trade facilitation and who is involved in all of our activities in respect of transportation, logistics, ports, harbours, rail, freight and air.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400005#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Simon McKeever"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411548600,"counter":823,"content":"<p>I will outline the IEA's understanding of Ireland's freight logistics problem.  The transport-related elements in the distribution of products made in Ireland and consumed elsewhere varies widely and can be up to 40% of the final value of the goods.  This is, in part, due to our location as an island off the coast of Europe but also to relatively high domestic freight transport costs.  A fairly small, dispersed population makes the achievement of logistics efficiencies more difficult.  Food, pharma and an increasing number of other export categories now require low-carbon and product-traceable supply chains.  Some of the IEA's activities which are focused on meeting these issues include the establishment and management of world-leading a good distribution practice, training and certification programme, which has been rolled out in recent years and which is currently the subject of a considerable upgrade; the setting up and driving of the IEA Rail Freight Group, which has proved particularly successful in the context of companies in the north-west region; and active participation in EU-backed logistics-focused projects under the Interreg IV, North-West Europe and Atlantic ARC programmes.  Within the latter, ports and distribution centres are key to the development of efficient intermodal distribution.  As these projects conclude, we will bring much of what we have learned back to Ireland.<\/p><p>  I wish to make some general comments on the published general scheme of the Bill.  The IEA welcomes the overall shape of the ports policy as announced in 2013 and as given effect to in the draft legislation.  Particularly important is the consistency with the European Commission's EU ports policy of 2013.  This consistency optimises the potential for Irish ports and the links thereto, both on the land side and the sea side, in securing EU funding assistance.  This should also inform Irish road and rail infrastructure development linked to ports.  As a result of the fact that they are not considered port companies within the terms of the draft legislation under discussion, both Rosslare Europort and Greenore have not been included in its provisions.  These are both vital ports and we ask that they not be forgotten.<\/p><p>  While the regional ports are small-volume facilities in the context of the overall picture relating to shipping, they play a vital role in the handling of bulk products such as grain, fertiliser, animal feed, construction materials, steel, paper, reusable waste, etc.  During the recession, some of the traffic handled through these smaller ports migrated to their larger counterparts.  However, as the 2013 Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO figures show, major volume increases are now being experienced at the regional ports.  As the larger ports become busier, it becomes more convenient to bring certain materials in through the regional ports.  The IEA believes that it is of paramount importance to ensure that the planned changes relating to bringing these ports and their port companies under local authority control should not do anything to diminish the potential of any port to develop new shipping traffic or compete with ports that are currently larger.<\/p><p>  I will now deal with matters specific to the draft legislation.  Part II, head 8 deals with the future transfer of shares.  The IEA supports the proposed ministerial involvement in such activity.  Part II, head 9 relates to dividend policy.  Port cost competitiveness is vital for trade and this dividend requirement should not be allowed to push up prices or reduce investment in the ports concerned.  Part II, head 11 covers general ministerial powers and is vital to secure the safety of operation in ports and facilitate logical development.  Part III, head 12 deals with the transfer and dissolution of port companies.  The IEA is concerned that a port's activities may become lost within the general activities of the local authority concerned and that very specific port management and operation skills will also be lost as a result.  Part V, head 19 involves the amendment of section 30 of the principal Act.  We broadly support the requirements relating to directors, as set down, but are concerned, particularly in the case of smaller ports, about the prohibition on people who are engaged in work at the port concerned from serving on its board.  Part V, head 20, involves the amendment of section 34 of the principal Act.  The IEA supports the prohibition on directors serving on port company boards once they are elected to the Oireachtas or the European Parliament.<\/p><p>  I thank the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400005#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Howard Knott"},{"type":"speech","time":1411548600,"counter":824,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McKeever and Mr. Knott for their presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400005#E00400","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411548600,"counter":825,"content":"<p>The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport welcomes the opportunity to make a presentation to the committee in respect of the general scheme of the Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2014.  We also appreciate the earlier invitation we received in the context of making a written submission to the committee.<\/p><p>  The institute has no issue of principle with regard to the proposal to transfer a number of regional ports to local authority ownership and control.<\/p> <p>The purpose of our written submission to the committee was to air some practical concerns and raise some matters of detail concerning the general scheme.  <br\/>The regional ports are currently commercial State bodies which have a large degree of commercial freedom and are not subject to the detailed controls on staffing, pay and finances which apply to non-commercial State bodies.  The ports being transferred, and particularly those that will remain as independent companies under head 7, should continue to have the commercial freedom afforded to other State commercial companies.  The bigger regional ports in particular must be able to compete for business on a level playing field without unnecessary constraints being placed on them and they should be subject to no greater State control than the larger tier 1 and tier 2 ports with which they compete.<br\/>The regulatory impact assessment accompanying the general scheme indicates that it has already been agreed that Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Galway should continue as port companies in the ownership of the relevant local authorities - that is the head 7 transfer process.  If this decision has already been taken - we would support it - the Bill should be amended to explicitly provide for it.  We suggest a form of wording in our written submission.<br\/>It is not clear which, if any, of the provisions of Part 2 of the Harbours Act 1996 will apply once the port companies are transferred to local authority ownership.  These provisions relate to the corporate governance of port companies and cover matters such as the contents of the memorandum and articles of association, the composition of the board, the appointment of the chief executive, borrowing, accounts and audit.  The institute is anxious to ensure that the commercial mandate of these companies is protected and enhanced, that they will operate at arm&rsquo;s length from their local authority owners and that they will be structured and governed in a way that does not act as an impediment to potential future private investment. <br\/>It is also important to ensure continuing good corporate governance and effective performance oversight of these companies.  For example, section 30 of the Harbours Act 1996 relating to the composition of the board might continue to apply together with the modifications proposed in head 19(2).  The power of the board to appoint the chief executive should also be retained.  Where port companies are dissolved and absorbed into local authorities, it will also be important that arrangements be put in place to enable port operations to continue on a commercial basis.<br\/>Head 11 proposes to give the Minister very wide general powers of direction in respect of port companies transferred to local authority ownership.  These powers could potentially be used to impose substantial financial obligations on the companies and their local authority owners - for example, in a direction relating to the development of harbours, or safety, security or navigation.  Exchequer financial support is unlikely to be available in those circumstances as there is a long-standing policy of not providing State financial aid to port companies. <br\/>The proposed power of direction is a significant policy departure because it will give the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, as distinct from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, power to issue a direction to a body which is owned by a local authority or to the local authority itself.  If the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport was to issue a direction at present, he would be doing so as the <i>de facto<\/i>owner of the port companies and would therefore have a direct concern for the financial or other consequences.  However, he will have no such constraint when these companies are in local authority ownership.  At a minimum, the head should be amended to require the Minister to consider the potential financial consequences of any proposed direction, to consult with the port company before making a direction and to obtain the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to any direction he proposes to make.<br\/>Head 8 prevents the disposal of shares in a local-authority-owned port without the prior written approval of the Minister.  However, there is nothing in the proposed law which would prevent a local authority from deciding to cease the provision of port services.  It could, for example, decide to cease the handling of commercial cargo and operate a port as a leisure facility.  This could have potential implications for national ports policy.  Perhaps the Minister should retain some residual powers in this regard, as the powers of direction under head 11 cannot be used in such circumstances.  Subhead (4) states that the Minister's power of direction cannot be exercised in respect of the performance of functions in particular circumstances.  The exercise of any residual power should, of course, have to take account of the commercial and financial realities faced by a local authority in reaching a decision on the future of a port.<br\/>The proposal to limit directors to a maximum of two terms is unduly restrictive and should be reconsidered.  The Minister currently has discretion to appoint directors for a maximum term of five years, but there is nothing to stop the Minister from making appointments for shorter terms, and this is sometimes done for public appointments.  There is also a commitment in the national ports policy to the staggering of board appointments to provide for a more managed turnover of directors.  This means that, initially at least, some directors will have to be appointed for shorter terms of, say, three or four years.  If it is proposed to include limits on the length of service of board members, we strongly suggest that they be expressed in years rather than terms.  It is desirable that chairpersons should have served on the board for a period before assuming the chair, and we therefore suggest that any limits imposed on chairpersons should take this into account.  The limits should apply to worker directors in the same way as all other board members.<br\/>Subhead 19(6) should be much more clearly expressed.  It appears from the explanatory notes that it is intended to address potential conflicts of interest for board members and to preclude membership of boards by persons or employees of persons who provided a significant commercial service to a port company within the previous three years.  While we support measures to prevent board members with material conflicts of interest from being appointed, the existing provisions in section 11 of the Harbours (Amendment) Act 2009 are ill-conceived and should not be retained in the new legislation.  For example, it is generally accepted that 12 months is an appropriate maximum period to preclude former employees from taking up a new employment which involves a material conflict of interest.  A similar term would be appropriate for directors.  Yet under the existing provisions in the 2009 Act, somebody no longer employed by a company which provided significant commercial services to a port company would be precluded from board membership for three years.  Any employee or former employee of a company which provided significant commercial services to a port company would be precluded from board membership even if that person had no direct working relationship with that port company or potentially even if he or she worked in another jurisdiction.  It is also significant that one could have port users that are very significant players but there is no restriction on, for example, somebody who provides 20% or 30% of the trade of a particular port from being involved in the directorship, so I think the provisions relating to a conflict of interest need to be rethought.<br\/>We suggest that a more appropriate approach be adopted which relates directly to the individual being considered for appointment to the board.  The test should be whether the person being considered for appointment has or could be perceived to have a material conflict of interest if appointed to the board.  This is a more appropriate test and will avoid the unnecessary exclusion of persons well qualified to serve on the board.  <br\/>The regulatory impact assessment gives no real consideration to the financial circumstances of both the port companies to be transferred and the local authorities to which they are to be transferred.  Will the ports be a financial burden on the local authorities?  Have the local authorities the capacity to provide or generate from other sources any investment finance that might be required for the future development of these ports or to cover pre-existing deficits?  This is particularly important since it is Government policy not to provide funding to commercial ports and because the ports to be transferred may not be in sufficiently robust financial health to generate the necessary investment finance from internal resources alone.  It is noteworthy from appendix A of the regulatory impact assessment that four of the five ports to be transferred incurred net losses in recent years.<br\/>The ministerial statement accompanying the publication of the draft general scheme stated that the Bill would not affect Rosslare Europort as it is not subject to the Harbours Acts.  The 2013 ports policy statement undertook to publish a pathway for the port by the end of last year following receipt of advice from an external consultancy study.  The joint committee might explore with the Department what, if any, conclusions have been reached in respect of the future ownership and development of Rosslare Europort.<br\/>Do any of the recommendations of the Competition Authority's recent study of competition in the ports sector require a legislative response?  For example, recommendation 4 of that study suggests that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport &quot;should mandate the promotion of effective intra-port competition as a key objective for port authorities that is imposed by legislation or regulation as appropriate&quot;.  How is it proposed to give effect to this recommendation?<br\/>Some other more detailed points are raised in our written submission, but I do not propose to comment on them here, although I will be happy to answer any questions in respect of them or any aspect of my oral presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400005#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Mangan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411549200,"counter":827,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mangan.

I will be parochial in regard to my response to some of the comments made.  In my view, the counties of Kerry, Clare and Limerick are very much in the west of Ireland and anybody who suggests their location has changed should look again at their geography.  The Shannon Foynes Port Company in my constituency is a tier one port of national importance.<\/p><p>  I direct my comments now at the suggestion from the Galway people here that existing policy may be against what they are trying to achieve.  I looked at the annual report of the Galway Harbour Company before coming to this meeting and noted it had a total income last year of &euro;3.19 million.  Over half of that income was derived from non-port activities.  Some &euro;1.1 million came from rental income and &euro;845,000 came from car parking charges.  The contrast between what the Galway Harbour Company suggests and what is happening in the west further down the coast, in Shannon Foynes, could not be more stark.<\/p><p>  Shannon Foynes Port Company handles approximately 10 million tonnes of cargo per year, approximately 15% of our national tonnage.  Galway Harbour Company accounts for only 1% of national tonnage, with just under 500,000 tonnes.  Shannon Foynes Port Company is open 364 days a year and has no difficulties in regard to berthing.  It can berth ships of over 200 m with 10.5 m of draught.  It is the deepest port in the country and does not have the constraints the Galway Harbour Company has.  It is for that reason it has been designated a tier one port.<\/p><p>  It is correct that there will be issues in regard to attracting investment into Galway.  The main reason for difficulties with attracting investment into a second port in the west is that the facilities envisaged are already available in the west.  We will have three ports of strategic national importance, one in the east, one in the south and one in the west.  A motorway is under construction between Limerick and Galway and a report is currently being commissioned by the NRA to upgrade the N69 into Foynes.  CIE has also already done some work in regard to reopening the railway line into Foynes.<\/p><p>  I looked at the Galway Harbour Company prospectus for years one to five in the development of Galway harbour and much of the work envisaged there has already been done 40 miles down the road in Limerick, Foynes, Shannon, Tarbert and Moneypoint.  I cannot understand why there is difficulty in accepting the Government's policy in regard to the tier status of Galway port, given it handles only 1% of the national tonnage and has 13 people working there on an average salary of &euro;90,000 a year.  I feel the biggest hindrance Galway Harbour Company faces in regard to the development of its plans is dredging.  It will have to put considerable capital investment into dredging and this will require significant outside investment.  This can come from the State or A.N. other, but the State has already made its position clear.  <\/p><p>  Would Galway City and County Councils be averse to joining Limerick City and County Councils and Clare County Council with a view to establishing a clear transportation hub on the Shannon estuary akin to what has been done at Shannon Airport?  We cannot have international airports at every crossroads and by the same token the size of the country places a limit on the number of ports of strategic national importance we can have, particularly in view of the investment required.  This is unnecessary when there is a port 40 miles down the road that already deals with significant tonnage.  Some of the largest ships in the world currently sail into Moneypoint, Foynes and Aughinish Island.  <\/p><p>  The Galway Harbour Company plan is very ambitious, but it bears no resemblance to what the Government is trying to achieve in its ports policy.  Rather, it flies in the face of that policy.  There is a reluctance to accept the fact that Galway has just 1% of the national tonnage and less than 50% of its income, &euro;1.29 million, is derived from port activity.  Instead, it believes it is in the wrong tier.  I find that difficult to accept.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400007#G00200","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1411549800,"counter":833,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Donovan has certainly been upfront.

If D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council could extend its limits, this would open more options, such as cruise businesses or similar.  Will funding be available for development and where will it come from?  Perhaps the different ports could submit some sort of business plan that would indicate to us how they would like to see their ports expand.  Otherwise it is difficult to envisage any development.

It is a long way from Shannon Foynes to Donegal, to north Mayo or to Sligo. <\/p> <p>It is not 40 miles from Galway to Shannon Foynes Port Company.  It is quite a way down the road so to say that is incorrect.<\/p><p> There are important issues to be addressed.  We are a very positive port in terms of what we are trying to achieve.  The rail link into Shannon Foynes is not open.  The rail link into Galway Port is open.  There is a road network into Galway; there is not a road network into Shannon Foynes.  I am not being negative about Shannon Foynes.  I do not have anything against Shannon Foynes; I support it in everything it tries to do.  However, in terms of what we have tried to achieve, mention was made of car parking and rental income but if members look deeper into our accounts they will see that much of that rental income comes from our customers who are based in our enterprise park.  The statement that the vast majority of the 500 people who work in the enterprise park work in companies that bring their products in and out through the port and are related to the port is incorrect.<\/p><p> Members will see from the figures in recent years that we have moved our import and export turnover back to in excess of what would be classified as non-core income.  The Port of Galway has existed since medieval times.  If Deputy O'Donovan could confirm to me that he could run any business that would open for four hours per day, I would like to hear it.  It cannot happen.  We are restricted to a tonnage of 7,000 tonnes.  Fewer ships of that size are being built.  Our customers are asking us to provide bigger ships to allow them bring their products into Galway.  Many of our customers could not move their business to any other port because the actual cost of transferring it to other ports would mean the business would not be viable, the exports would not take place and employment would suffer as a result.<\/p><p> There are many reasons we need a port extension in Galway.  We are working with the national ports policy in that we have 32 acres of inner city land which, in our view, should be developed for what is requested in the ports policy statement, that is, development of the tourist trade.  In the past 12 months, we have produced many reports in terms of cost-benefit analysis and so forth - funding strategy documents - that clearly indicate it is a viable proposition.  That has been accepted in terms of the cost-benefit analysis incorporating the west of Ireland.  The west is a very large area to cover.  It is far removed from Shannon Foynes and it should, and will in due course, have a port of which it can be truly proud.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400007#G01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamon Bradshaw","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411550400,"counter":846,"content":"<p>Does anyone else wish to comment on any of the questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400008#H00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411550400,"counter":847,"content":"<p>If I may, I will add to some of the points made by Mr. Bradshaw.  On the reference to dredging, Galway is probably the most fortuitous port in the country in that our dredging requirements are on a cycle of every 12 to 14 years.  Many of the other ports, for example, Waterford, would have to dredge the equivalent of every year that we do on a 12 to 14 year cycle.  Dredging, therefore, is not an issue in Galway.<\/p><p>  It was mentioned that from a petroleum perspective Galway is a port of national strategic importance and that during the extreme weather conditions in the winter of 2010, Galway was the stand-by port for the capital.  Many of the oil tankers were rerouted to Galway to provide fuel to keep the capital energised and functioning during that period.  <\/p><p>  As Mr. Bradshaw mentioned, the Volvo Ocean Race in 2009 delivered &euro;55 million into the city and the region, and again in 2012.  To do that we had to close the port, with the agreement and support of our customers.  That was a huge ask, but we did it.  During the darkest hour of Ireland's history in terms of the financial mess we were in, the Volvo Ocean Race in 2009 lifted the spirits of the nation.  That would not have happened were it not for the ambition of the port company and the volunteer army behind it that had the ambition to take on an event like the ocean race.  The largest sporting event in 2012 was the London Olympics, the second was the European Cup Final in Kiev, and the third was the Volvo Ocean Race in Galway.

If one is in a private commercial company, however, making decisions can be done quickly in response to the needs as perceived.

The Bill does not reinvent the wheel.  Under the Harbours Acts of 1946, which will be repealed by the legislation, and 1996, some 13 regional harbours transferred to local authorities.  The closest port to me, which is in Bantry Bay, recently transferred to the Port of Cork.  Have representatives of D&uacute;n-Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council met their counterparts in the local authorities that assumed control of these 13 harbours to discuss technical issues, funding, corporate governance, etc.?

A significant number of ports were transferred into local authority control under previous legislation.  While I am not an expert on fisheries, fishery ports such as Killybegs and Castletownbere operate under a slightly different model from other ports, one which involves the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In general terms, what we have heard from those involved in exports is that the ports that transferred have functioned well because they are small ports serving their local communities and doing what they have always done.  These ports have not appeared on the national radar to any significant degree.  Apart from locals and those involved in sailing, most people will not be aware of Clogherhead, Annagassan and similar ports.<\/p><p>  This legislation deals with chunky and substantial ports such as Drogheda, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, New Ross and Galway.  While these are small ports in the greater scale of things, if one strips out the large cargo items from some of the larger ports, for example, the ore that moves through Shannon-Foynes Port and the oil that moves in and out of Dublin and Cork ports, especially the latter, one finds that the difference between many of the larger and smaller ports in terms of the general cargo they carry is not significant.<\/p><p>  None of the ports with which we are concerned currently have car or freight ferries running, nor do they have container vessels carrying containers in and out.  One needs to have a serious throughput for these types of activity and the tier 1 and 2 ports can handle these types of traffic.  There is, however, a substantial amount of traffic related to the agriculture and construction sectors for which local ports are vital.  While it may not be appropriate to make this point, the domestic waste issues that have arisen in recent years, specifically the need to avoid landfill, mean that considerable amounts of waste have been exported for use as fuel, particularly to the Baltic countries.  The use of smaller ports for this purpose has provided a great boost to the business of some of them.  However, this development also highlights one of the dangers in this discussion, namely, that this traffic may only go through a port if the local authority grants it a licence to do so.  As a result of the legislation, the port owner and licensing authority will become very close.  It is important, therefore, to create a Chinese wall between a local authority's port activities and its other activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400009#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Howard Knott"},{"type":"speech","time":1411551000,"counter":857,"content":"<p>I ask Ms Poole to respond to the questions relating to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400009#J00700","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411551000,"counter":858,"content":"<p>Two specific issues were raised, the first of which related to whether discussions had taken place with other ports.

This development is much needed and although Galway Harbour Company only provides for a small percentage of the national tonnage it does play a very valuable role in the economy of the city and region from Galway across Connacht to Connemara and up as far as Mayo.  I had the pleasure of spending a weekend in Galway with some of the largest cruise line operators in the world who had been invited over by the harbour company.   Some of the largest ones were based in Miami, companies like Crystal Cruises and Royal Caribbean.  They spent several days in Clare, Galway city, Connemara and Westport, and they were simply blown away by what they experienced.  They were actually competing with one another to support and contribute financially to the development of the harbour in Galway.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach is on record as having stated his support for the development of Galway harbour.

It is regrettable that Deputy O'Donovan chose to leave the meeting.  Getting parochial is fine and he is fully entitled to support his local port of Shannon Foynes but I always believe that to promote oneself one does not have to attack somebody else and he tried to do a hatchet job on Galway.  I agree with my colleague that he must be concerned about Galway getting planning approval or perhaps he is acting on behalf of Shannon Foynes in that they are concerned that the Galway expansion would go ahead.<\/p><p>  I addressed the Merchant Shipping Bill in the D&aacute;il last week, when I invited the new Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, to come to Galway to see the plans.  He indicated that he would be happy to do so and I presume that can be arranged with the witnesses.  The Galway Harbour Company has been hindered by its current gates.  The potential of this development for the port is astronomical, not just in increased shipping but also in the tourism sector and the cruise liners.  Other ports could not compete with that because Galway port is at the heart of the city.  It is within walking distance or a very short bus journey from Eyre Square for tourists.  We have seen many tourism initiatives in recent years such as the Wild Atlantic Way and similar.  The captain spoke about the Volvo ocean race which was a huge success.  Part of that success was due to the fact that the port is at the heart of the city.  It would not have worked if the port was 50 miles away.  People within the city could come out and experience the Volvo ocean race.  <\/p><p>  Will port policy hinder planning permission or, if secure planning permission is secured, will this strengthen the case for having the port policy changed?  Will the envisaged co-operation with Galway City Council help in terms of redevelopment of the inner dock, which has great tourism potential?  Is the funding dependent on a move to tier 2 or are there any alternatives?  If tiers 1 to 3, inclusive, are not used as criteria, what should be used?  Mr. Bradshaw referred on the change of status to a mechanism to allow for the port to be upgraded to a higher level and pointed out that no such facility is included in the proposed legislation.  On what basis or according to what criteria might this be allowed?  Should it be based on expansion plans, for example?  There has to be something to go to Government with and expansion plans would be one possibility.  I reiterate my support for the plans.

Some of the issues are also of more general resonance.  I very much welcome the move to put these ports under local authority control, certainly in D&uacute;n Laoghaire's case it is something I have urged for a while.  It was very unclear what the harbour's objective was, and putting it under local authority control clarifies somewhat what we see as its objective.  However I still have a lot of questions and I am interested to hear what people have to say.<\/p> <p>For example, the Minister has indicated that a choice confronts us when we move a port under local authority control, in that it should either be fully under local authority control or be a corporate subsidiary.  Some speakers have suggested that it should be the corporate subsidiary model with a strong commercial focus.  I will be honest, in that I do not favour that option, although I would like to hear the witnesses' responses.  The point of claiming a port is of regional significance is that it is an important part of our regional infrastructure.  As such, to judge or run it on the basis of a narrow commercial mandate instead of recognising that its contribution is of regional significance to its town and region is to miss the point.  This port will make a contribution to D&uacute;n Laoghaire and all of the region - the situation elsewhere is similar - that cannot be quantified on the company's balance sheets.  If we do not understand this, we are missing the point.  This is how to get the balance.<\/p><p> This brings me to the issue of governance structures, in which regard I am particularly interested in hearing what the D&uacute;n Laoghaire delegation has to say.  The overwhelming feeling in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is that the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company has been a law unto itself and is insulated from the local community's opinions on what is the right way to develop the harbour so that it might complement and contribute to the town and local area.  It has managed to alienate its own workforce spectacularly to the point of there being legal cases, industrial relations issues, etc.  What does the council have to say about this matter?  What will be the workers' status?  Some protection has been afforded to those who are subject to previous terms and conditions under the Harbours Act, but will new employees be treated as council employees?  The council has asked questions about whether its elected members or executive will be in charge.  The Minister will have considerable powers under Part II's head 11, in that he can issue directions.  Will the show be run by the council's executive or elected members or can it all be overridden by ministerial directive?  We need clarity and more democratic control, that is, a greater emphasis on elected members, public participation and people with expertise in the various fields in which the harbour operates.  All of these harbours seem to operate a balance of different interests.  They are working harbours, amenity harbours and, in many cases, heritage harbours, to name just three of the legs on which they stand.  We need experts in these areas as well as people who are accountable to and heedful of the local community in terms of how they balance these aspects and pursue objectives.<\/p><p> In D&uacute;n Laoghaire's case, many bad mistakes have been made in this regard.  The terminal on the Carlisle pier, including a train station that was of historic significance for the entire country because it was one of the main exit points of the diaspora, was knocked down.  This was a disastrous decision.  If I remember correctly, there was not even permission to knock it down.  There is a major controversy surrounding the plan to put a floating swimming pool off the east pier.  There is no public mandate for that.  How many master plans have we had for the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company?  We have had plans for ten-storey apartment blocks on the Carlisle pier and new housing developments in the harbour.  None of these has come to anything, yet they have wasted hundreds of thousands of euro.<\/p><p> Will we have a governance structure that genuinely listens to the local community and regional interests and is sensitive to the regional and local importance of the harbour instead of a structure that is a law unto itself and has a narrow commercial mandate?  If the company is seen in the latter terms, it will not be able to sustain itself.  This belief is borne out by the fact that the company is making a loss.  We must understand the situation in a different context if we are to make it work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400010#K00500","speaker":"1003","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411552200,"counter":866,"content":"<p>The witnesses will be glad to hear that all of the Galway Deputies are<i>ad idem<\/i>on the importance of Galway Harbour.  We do not seem to be facing the difficulties experienced in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.<br\/>I become worried when the policies being developed are based on the <i>status quo<\/i>.  It happened during our time in government and is happening again, in that policies are not drafted based on an objective analysis of balanced regional development, but to preserve and confirm the <i>status quo<\/i>.  The problem is that, if one continues doing this, one doubles one problems.  Dublin cannot handle everyone who is trying to live there.  All of the jobs are in Dublin, but there are not enough housing or services.  Other parts of the country could do with having extra people but are not getting any because they are not seeing development.  We should be serious about balanced regional development and not base the future on historical events.<br\/>Due to the port gates and the fact that it is tidal, Galway Harbour cannot operate to the same capacity as a modern port.  These are physical constraints.  It is like having a large factory into which only tiny vans are allowed because its gates are not wide enough to take an articulated lorry.  Obviously, one should widen the gates immediately to bring in the big trucks.  Therefore, the port needs to be developed physically.<br\/>Interestingly, Killybegs is a fishing port, yet it is receiving cruise liners.  We should not always limit initiatives to a predetermined Government plan for the future.  Everyone accepts that human endeavour can often overcome considerable adversity and engender great success despite the prognoses of the Jonahs around the place.<br\/>Deputy O'Donovan's comments were interesting and left me pondering the Chairman.  This is the same argument that we heard about Knock Airport, namely, that Knock and Shannon could not survive.  However, Knock Airport has taught many people lessons in efficiency.  If one is hungry enough and serves a large enough area, even if its population is dispersed, one can survive.<br\/>We should consider Galway Harbour's strengths.  When the port is developed, one will be able to walk off a boat into the city centre.  When we were considering this plan five or seven years ago, that aspect was a major attraction, as no one coming off a cruise liner would need to be bussed anywhere to access the city.  Due to this factor and the attractiveness of Galway city centre, the port will be a magnet for cruise liners.<br\/>It has been interesting to note the hungry timber mills in the west importing timber through Galway and exporting timber that they cannot use.  The port is exporting lime from Cong, County Mayo, to Scotland.  This is an interesting case and works because there is not much lime in Scotland and bringing it from England by truck would cost more.<br\/>Many possibilities have been mentioned, but there is a common denominator - to use my comparison, if one cannot bring a truck in and is confined to using a mini-bus, one cannot get the business.<\/p> <p>In my view, two competitive ports in the west of Ireland would only add to each other.  We are always of the view in the west that if somebody gets something, somebody else cannot get it.  We do not say, &quot;Hang on, let us look logically at this.  Let us look at the size of the area we are talking about.&quot;  The length of a straight line up the west coast - I am not talking about all the indentation - from north Donegal to the south coast is one and a half times the length of the east coast.  That is a fact.  I was looking at distances by road.  It is 169 km from Belfast to Dublin;  154 km from Dublin to Rosslare; 117 km from Rosslare to Waterford; 120 km from Waterford to Cork; 107 km from Cork to Foynes and 131 km from Foynes to Galway, which is longer than Waterford to Cork, Cork to Foynes or Rosslare to Waterford.  It is 273 km from Galway to Derry, which is the next nearest port up the west coast.  If one eliminates Foynes to Galway, one is talking about 400 km to Derry.  We need a port on the west coast and Galway is the major city there.<br\/>Unfortunately, I cannot wait for the reply, in which I am very interested, as we have another bit of business that we are all being called to from Galway.  Galway is very busy today.  As Deputy Kyne said, the major point is that some of the issues are policy ones, including whether Galway should be a potential tier 2 port.  I understand it is a policy to get EU grants for the development of the port.  Those are policy issues as opposed to legislative ones.<br\/>My next issue is what proposals there are in the legislation that will be inimical to the interests of Galway.  Do the witnesses think it is a good idea to transfer Galway from a semi-State company under the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to being a body under the control of the local authority?  If they do, why do they think that when nobody is suggesting transferring the other major ports to local authority ownership?  It seems to me that in making the decision the Government is of the view that there is no future for local authorities except to do small things and the big future is for the few remaining ports which will all be on the south west to east coast.  I would be interested to hear whether the witnesses think the transfer is a good idea.  If it is not, we should hear that from them.<br\/>I often remember that many years ago we were handling about 20,000 tonnes of timber under the ECC, with which the witnesses will be familiar.  I remember the forestry people saying that 30,000 tonnes was too ambitious.  They wanted at that time to preserve the <i>status quo<\/i>.  The view was that the guys who were there were fine, but no one should be allowed in to compete.  That mill is now at 300,000 tonnes.  We are getting timber.  It is not right, therefore, to allow a policy to develop to preserve a <i>status quo<\/i>which seems never to see that there is potential and energy there that will defy all the odds and be highly successful if a level playing pitch is created.  If we do not have that belief, we will never develop the country in a fair, balanced way for the good of both the east and west coasts.  The way we are developing will lead to so much weight on the east coast that it will fall into the Irish Sea eventually.  Everything is being pulled to this side of the country.  As someone who grew up in Dublin and who has a great love for this city, I note that many of the amenities I knew in the city growing up have been destroyed by overly rapid expansion out into some of the fantastic recreation areas that used to exist beyond Stillorgan.  Those places are now all brick, mortar and tar.  It would have been better for Ireland if we had more balanced development and we should not pull back from it now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400011#L00200","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411552800,"counter":868,"content":"<p>Many points were made there, mainly directed at D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and Galway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400012#M00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411552800,"counter":869,"content":"<p>To look back to 2013 when the ports policy was first mooted, at that time there was a call for comment from a number of bodies.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council was one of the bodies which made a submission.  In common with the other local authorities with ports, we stated that it should be a separate legal entity for a number of reasons.  It would avoid any TUPE or HR issues and it was also good to retain a commercial focus, particularly in relation to the cruise business and the town as a developing town and, indeed, the region.  As such, being a separate entity, the employees will not transfer to the local authority and will remain as part of the board's responsibility.  The due diligence process which is about to be initiated and which will be done through the transition group is the mechanism for declaring any issues that may come up whether of a commercial, financial or legal nature.  They will have to be addressed either prior to the mechanism for taking over or there will have to be a mechanism to address them in the future.  They cannot just be exposed and left there if there are any.  Whichever mechanism is chosen, whether it is a reserved or executive function, we would simply say as a local authority that there needs to be clarity.  We need to not be caught in ambiguity when there are very significant decisions to be made in relation to the port.  That would just be our call that there be clarity about whether they are executive or reserved functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400012#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Philomena Poole"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411552800,"counter":870,"content":"<p>Deputy Ellis asked a few questions before he left including whether the enterprise park would be doubled with the new port.  It would and a further 500 jobs are envisaged in that respect.  The Port of Galway has a regional focus and very little of the produce going through the port - approximately 600,000 tonnes - comes from the city itself.  The majority of the produce comes from outlying areas, including Mayo and County Galway in particular.  The funding of a port of regional significance is much more difficult than funding a tier 1 or tier 2 port.  The reasons are obvious.  Investors will be much more attracted to investing into ports which carry much larger volumes.  They will see the potential there.  In our case, what we have decided to do is get our planning permission at which stage we will have a product we can offer.  We have gone through significant research and the production of various funding strategy documents to demonstrate that we can fund the development of the port and we are comfortable that it can be achieved.<\/p><p>  Governance issues were raised.  Clarity is vital when one is running a commercial entity.  It is vital from the point of view of the port of Galway that we are clear where responsibilities lie and who are the decision makers.  Is it within the local authority?  Is it within the executive of the local authority or does it rest with the councillors?  That is very important from our point of view.  Clarity on governance issues is vital to the running of a commercial entity in a very difficult environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400012#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eamon Bradshaw"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411552800,"counter":871,"content":"<p>I would like to comment on Deputy Boyd Barrett's earlier remarks.<\/p> <p>I agree wholeheartedly with him that a port and a harbour involves much more than the shipping of goods.  It is an amenity facility and often a very important part of the heritage.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire is a very good example of that and it is important that the transfer to local authorities allows the opportunity to consider the development of the port area in a much more holistic way than might have been possible to date, given that there have been separate entities.<\/p><p> Nonetheless, my concern is in regard to ports, shipping, transport and so on.  If these ports are not able to operate commercially in that part of their business, they will simply sink without trace.  As I said earlier, they are competing with big beasts who have much deeper pockets and are becoming increasingly dominant in the market, and they must be enabled to compete in that market.  That is not to take away from the other functions they have and finding ways of carrying out those functions but, ultimately, they start off as a harbour that moves goods through and back.  If they are not able to do that competitively, and if they are not able to offer the services that are required by shippers and freight forwarders, they will disappear.  That has to be one of the factors.  The challenge for the local authorities is how to develop all the aspects of a harbour while ensuring they continue to operate commercially as transport entities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400012#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Mangan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411553400,"counter":873,"content":"<p>I will deal with some of the remaining points.  One of the useful items in the draft is the facility where a particular business opportunity arises and with that opportunity comes the potential of investment by a third party to facilitate it.  The new port companies operating within the council can consider that opportunity, so it can become part of the port going forward.  This would allow the smaller regional ports, which will not be single-business focused but will probably be focused on a relatively small number of businesses, to become real specialists in a particular area.  The history of a great number of ports outside Ireland is that they become experts in handling, say, equipment for wind farms, which is outside the normal run of things.  Why not get the wind farm people to put in the money?  I would not get hung up on the point that if a regional port is in this new environment, it is necessarily totally unable to secure funding.<\/p><p>  Another issue arises from the various comments around the table.  One of the things we mentioned in our submission is that the IEA has become involved over the years in a number of EU-supported logistics-focused projects, whether that is west-east across Europe or along the Atlantic arc.  In doing so, one interacts with people from ports elsewhere.  It is instructive that the European model supports can be quite different from what we have in Ireland, and the Irish model can be quite different from what they have in Britain.  Before the Bill is finalised, it probably behoves the powers that be to consider whether we are missing something here.  For example, are we looking at the way municipal governance operates in a port like Rotterdam?  While that may sound ridiculous, governance there is very much controlled by and under the authority of the local government.  It is not necessarily only a small issue.<\/p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the dangers of the focus on Dublin and this is something we would like to come back to in due course.  There is a consultation process ongoing under the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport at the moment about infrastructure investment for transport over the next 40 years.  On a fairly quick reading of that, it would seem it has a very strong focus towards transport to and from Dublin and less of a focus on transport elsewhere.  If these regional ports, about which we are all concerned, are to really thrive, they must have good road and rail infrastructure into those ports so they can serve their communities.<\/p><p>  We must ensure that we treat the ports discussion on an all-island basis.  The ports of Northern Ireland are just as important to Irish exporters and importers as those that are domiciled in the republic.  Again, the lessons of the ports there should be taken on board.<\/p><p>  On a point that addresses some of the issues raised in the ports policy document, there is a provision that the Irish Maritime Development Office, which is now related to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, should have an oversight function regarding the competitiveness of each and every port and how they are doing in an international league table.  This is very important and might answer some of the worries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400013#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Howard Knott"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1411553400,"counter":874,"content":"<p>It is worth noting what is the definition of a port.  A port is no different from a motorway in that it is a piece of infrastructure that facilitates the movement of goods and people.  In the Galway case, it is an infrastructural deficit which makes up the shortfall in that the port has outgrown itself.  Given its medieval harbour, the points raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett about heritage ports might offer new opportunities for Galway.<\/p><p>  I believe there is too much emphasis and a bit of a hang-up on the strength of the balance sheet of the port companies when we look at these issues.  In fact, it is the economic benefit that it brings to the region.  Not all ports are profitable.  For example, the port of Miami is propped up to the tune of &euro;9 million each year by the city of Miami because of the benefit the 4 million passengers who run through the cruise terminal there bring to the city and the region.  The ports are there for the benefit of the economics of the region rather than the balance sheet of the port company.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014092400013#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian Sheridan"},{"type":"speech","time":1411553400,"counter":875,"content":"<p>Do the witnesses see Galway Port being able to develop to its maximum potential under the legislation as proposed at present?
