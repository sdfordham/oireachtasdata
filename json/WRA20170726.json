They provide detailed estimates of major accounting items, such as output, input costs, gross and net value added and operating surplus. The results are transmitted to Eurostat for publication on the European database, and are also published by the CSO in the <i>Output, Input &amp;amp; Income in Agriculture <\/i>release three times a year (i.e. an advance estimate in December, preliminary estimate the following March and final estimate in June).<\/p><p>The estimates are based on data from a combination of sources including administrative data, industry sources and several statistical surveys, conducted by the CSO, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) and Teagasc.

Typically in any one year there can also be between 60 &ndash; 90 investigations of serious and fatal accidents on farms.  The number of overall farm inspections and investigations\u00a0carried out since 2013 and the number of NACE Category A (Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing) inspections and investigations by county are set out in Appendices\u00a01 and\u00a02 below.<\/p><p>The HSA&rsquo;s database cannot break the number of farm inspections down by county.  However it can break down the number of inspections and investigations carried out since 2013 by county for NACE (European industrial activity classification) Sector A which covers Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing.  The county figures are given in the table and are higher than those for just farms.  Typically the total NACE A county figures are over 90% farm inspections with forestry and fishing figures being higher in the counties where these activities are concentrated.  As an inspector may cover more than one county he\/she may concentrate on different counties in different years.<\/p><p>The HSA plans to carry out 2,000 farm, 50 forestry and 50 fishing inspections in 2017.<\/p><p>Since 2014 the HSA has redirected some of its inspection resources to engaging directly with farmers on other accident prevention initiatives.  In 2017 HSA inspectors have participated in over 80 Teagasc organised Knowledge Transfer Group meetings, farm safety walks and presentations to farmers, many of which are organised by the farming representative bodies.

Apart from\u00a0significant losses to the Exchequer that can arise\u00a0from cases of so-called bogus self-employment, the practice has serious implications from an employment rights perspective.  In this respect, it is important that individuals are correctly designated regarding their employment status so that those who ought to be designated as employees are not deprived of their employment rights.  This is particularly the case for vulnerable workers who may not feel in a position to object to certain arrangements.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has a well-resourced labour inspectorate, which\u00a0forms part of the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and there are\u00a0existing mechanisms in place to determine the employment status of individuals or groups.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  WRC Inspections are undertaken on the basis of risk analysis which identifies certain sectors, as a result of complaints received and on a routine basis.  Where the WRC inspection service discover or issues are raised in relation to bogus self-employment or bogus sub-contracting, they are forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners and\/or the Department of Social Protection (Scope Section) for investigation either solely by the recipient, or jointly with the Workplace Relations Commission.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In most cases\u00a0it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed.  Where there is doubt in relation to the employment status of an individual the relevant Departments and Agencies will have regard to the Code of Practice for Determining Employment or Self-Employment Status of Individuals.  This Code was drawn up and agreed in 2007 by the relevant Government Departments with ICTU and IBEC.<\/p>  <p>  Where an individual believes they are being deprived of employment rights applicable to employees they may refer a complaint to the WRC where the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication leading to a decision that is enforceable through the District Court.  Complaints can be made on a single complaint form available at the WRC&rsquo;s website www.workplacerelations.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The WRC&rsquo;s Customer Service Section, which\u00a0 provides information to both employers and employees in relation to employment and industrial relations rights and obligations, can be contacted at Lo-call: 1890 80 80 90 or 059-9178990.<\/p>  <p>  An interdepartmental working group, comprising officials from the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, has been examining the emergence of new forms of employment arrangements, which are sometimes called &lsquo;disguised employment&rsquo;.  These includes arrangements i) where an individual, who would otherwise be an employee, establishes a company to provide their services employment and ii) where an individual, who is dependent on and under the control of a single employer in the same manner as an employee, is classified as self-employed. <\/p>  <p>  The working group sought the views of interested parties and stakeholders through a public consultation.  The consultation received 23 submissions from interested parties, including employers, trade unions, professional bodies and individuals. The working group is preparing a report which will present the views of these organisations and individuals, together with an analysis of the issues arising.

Taxpayers are choosing different channels to the traditional 'walk-in' services and are getting the information and assistance they require in a way that better meets their needs.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue is responding to the changing taxpayer requirements and has introduced an appointments service in a number of public offices in recent years, including the Dundalk office with effect from 17th July 2017.  \u00a0A dedicated telephone line is available for making appointments and appointments are\u00a0facilitated on a basis agreed with the taxpayer in each instance.

Revenue continues to enhance its service offering and the channels through which taxpayers can obtain information and\/or engage with them.

Many taxpayers prefer, and indeed expect, to do business online.  To meet that need, Revenue has in place modern, high-quality, accessible and user-friendly online services, so that taxpayers can manage their tax affairs at a time that best meets their needs.  Revenue continues to enhance those services, as evidenced by recent on-line developments that include the facility for PAYE customers to file their tax returns online; the 'myaccount' service, eTax Clearance and the 'MyEnquiries' secure online enquiry facility.  The introduction of a Business Taxes service and consistent opening hours across the telephone services has also provided greater certainty for taxpayers. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the circumstances of elderly customers and those with limited, or no, access to internet facilities is fully accommodated in the arrangements now in place and there is no difficulty arranging an appointment in such instances.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I am informed by Revenue that a significant process of engagement with staff was undertaken in advance of the implementation of the new service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600008#WRF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":243,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600008#WRF01400"},{"type":"question","counter":244,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[35422\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600008#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he was consulted on the withdrawal of the seafarers allowance for the workers of a company (details supplied) in 2013; the reason the seafarers allowance was taken away from the workers when it had previously been granted; the person who ultimately made the decision to withdraw the allowance; if it can be brought back for those workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":245,"content":"<p>The Seafarers&rsquo; Allowance is granted to individuals who meet the qualifying conditions as set out in Section 472B of the Taxes Consolidation Acts 1997.  \u00a0In order to qualify for the allowance, a taxpayer must be a &ldquo;qualifying individual&rdquo; who holds a &ldquo;qualifying employment &hellip;.&hellip; the duties of which are performed wholly on board a sea-going ship on an international voyage&rdquo;.  \u00a0The applicant must be absent from the State on an international voyage (a voyage that begins or ends in a port outside Ireland) for at least 161 days in the course of a tax year.

In essence the ICF is a consumer protection mechanism which is also found in Member States across the EU and elsewhere.  The ICF is currently maintained and administered under the control of the President of the High Court acting through the Accountant of the Courts of Justice.<\/p>  <p>  The ICF is funded by a levy on non-life insurance policies, not just on motor insurance policies.  There are some exclusions to this such as health and marine insurance policies.  The current ICF levy has been in place since it was re-introduced on 1 January 2012 and was put in place because of the insolvent nature of Quinn Insurance and the need to protect the policyholders of the company.  Prior to its re-introduction, the levy was applied once before, between 1984 and 1993, to meet the liabilities of an insolvent insurer following the collapse of PMPA.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland (the Bank) is required to carry out an assessment of the ICF on an annual basis pursuant to section 6(8) of the Insurance Act 1964, as amended.  On the 4th November 2011 the Bank published a levy notice requiring non-life insurance companies to pay a 2% levy on insurance premiums in respect of new business and renewals with an inception date on or after 1 January 2012.  This notice remains in force until amended by a further notice.  The last assessment was carried out by the Bank in October 2016. <\/p>  <p>  The 2% levy is calculated as a percentage determined by the Bank based on the aggregate of the gross premiums\u00a0paid to insurers in respect of policies issued in relation to risks in the State.\u00a0  The current ICF levy generates in the region of &euro;70 million per year.<\/p>  <p>  To date, the Exchequer has advanced in excess of &euro;1 billion to the ICF on which a commercial rate of interest is applied.  As of 31st December 2016, the balance owed to the exchequer was &euro;833 million.  Until all advances outstanding from the Exchequer to the ICF are fully repaid, continued financial support for the ICF in the form of a levy\u00a0will be required.  Based on the current amount raised by the levy, it is likely to take between 10 to 12 years \u00a0for the Exchequer to be repaid.  However, this estimate assumes that no further advances to the ICF will be required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600008#WRF03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electric Vehicles","counter":268,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600008#WRF04000"},{"type":"question","counter":269,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[34957\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600008#WRF04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will make the provision of electric car charging points in work car parks exempt from being treated as a benefit-in-kind for PAYE, PRSI and USC purposes to encourage the use of electric cars for environmental purposes by more employers and employees.","asker":"1215","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":270,"content":"<p>An interdepartmental Low-Emitting Vehicles (LEV) taskforce has been established to consider a full suite of potential measures to expedite the deployment of low carbon technologies, particularly electric vehicles, under a commitment outlined in the Programme for\u00a0a Partnership\u00a0Government. <\/p>  <p>  One of the potential policy instruments being considered by the taskforce is the role of taxation, including benefit-in-kind, to assist in the accelerated adoption of electric vehicles.

Prior to 2000, income tax allowed for full joint assessment of married couples, meaning that the earner in a single-income couple could use the combined tax credits and standard rate band available to the couple &ndash; i.e. double the personal tax credit and rate band available to a single earner.\u00a0 As a result, where the primary earner of a couple had sufficient income to use the available reliefs in full, the second earner faced the marginal rate of tax from the first pound of income earned, and this could act as a disincentive to workforce participation for second earners.<\/p>  <p>  A process of moving towards an individualised system of income taxation began in the 2000-01 tax year with the stated economic objectives of increasing labour force participation and reducing the numbers of workers paying the higher rates of income tax.\u00a0 A fully individualised system would have resulted in a two-parent, single-earner family having the same net income as a single individual from a gross wage &ndash; i.e. it would no longer be possible for the tax bands and allowances of the non-earning spouse to be used by the earning spouse.\u00a0 However, in recognition of the choices made by families in relation to caring responsibilities, the Home Carer Credit (HCC) (or Home Carer&rsquo;s Allowance as it was then) was introduced in tandem with the move towards individualisation in order to benefit families where one spouse works primarily in the home to care for children or other dependants.\u00a0 The HCC was increased in both Budgets 2016 and 2017 and now stands at &euro;1,100 per annum.\u00a0 It may be claimed in full where the home carer&rsquo;s income is below &euro;7,200 per year, and on a reduced tapered basis where the home carer earns up to &euro;9,200 per year. <\/p>  <p>  The Dependent Relative Tax Credit pre-dates the HCC and may be claimed by an individual who maintains a dependant relative at his or her own expense. \u00a0The dependant relative can be an individual unable to maintain themselves due to old age or infirmity; a widowed parent; or a child on whom the claimant depends due to old age or infirmity, and the credit cannot be claimed where the dependant relative&rsquo;s income exceeds &euro;14,504.<\/p>  <p>  The credit has remained unchanged for many years and the current rate of this tax credit is &euro;70 per annum.\u00a0 The credit has remained unchanged in recent years as there are inherent limitations in the potential for the tax system to be an effective policy tool, particularly when looking at individuals who may be working on a part-time basis while caring for a dependant relative.\u00a0 In general, a single employee will only enter the income tax net when income exceeds &euro;16,500, so an increase in a tax credit would have no potential to benefit individuals earning less than that amount.\u00a0 For this reason, direct expenditure measures can be a more effective policy tool than tax reliefs in providing support to individuals on lower income levels.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to any future increases to the Home Carer Credit, any such announcements would normally be made as part of the Budget and I am not inclined to diverge from this practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600009#WRG00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Costs","counter":297,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600009#WRG01000"},{"type":"question","counter":298,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[35318\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600009#WRG01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the specific steps he has taken to reduce and curtail the spiralling costs of car insurance and HGV insurance;

The CCMA\u00a0sets out the four-step MARP\u00a0process that\u00a0must be followed when dealing with a mortgage arrears case:<\/p><p>Step 1: Communicate with borrower;<\/p><p>Step 2: Gather financial information;<\/p><p>Step 3: Assess the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances; and<\/p><p>Step 4: Propose a resolution.<\/p><p>Each regulated entity must consider the borrower&rsquo;s situation in the context of the solutions they provide, which may differ from firm to firm.\u00a0 The CCMA includes requirements that arrangements be sustainable and based on a full assessment of the individual circumstances of the borrower.\u00a0 While\u00a0the CCMA does not prescribe the solution which must be offered in a particular case, it does provide that a\u00a0regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where it\u00a0has made every reasonable effort\u00a0to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower (or his\/her nominated representative), and the specific timeframes set out in the CCMA have been adhered to or the borrower has been classified as &quot;not co-operating&quot; under the provisions of the CCMA.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Outside of the CCMA process, the statutory insolvency framework and its various options will also be available to people with unsustainable levels of personal debt.

However,\u00a0the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing) Act 2015 (&ldquo;the 2015 Act&rdquo;) was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans are sold\u00a0to\u00a0an unregulated firm.\u00a0 The Act provides any loans which are purchased by an unregulated firm must be serviced by a &quot;credit servicing firm&quot; which is authorised by the Central Bank\u00a0to conduct credit servicing activities. \u00a0Such credit servicing firms must act in accordance with the requirements of Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  Therefore, this ensures that consumers, whose loans have been\u00a0sold to an unregulated\u00a0firm, nevertheless maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct (such as the CCMA) issued by the Central Bank.<\/p><p>From the enactment of the 2015 Act, regulated entities are required to comply with the requirements of financial services legislation including the Central Bank&rsquo;s Statutory Codes of Conduct (including the CCMA, where relevant) in respect of any credit servicing activities (as defined in the Act) it performs.

It is important to recognise that this is a projected surplus - it will only materialise after NAMA&rsquo;s debt is fully repaid and NAMA&rsquo;s ongoing work is completed.  NAMA held cash reserves of circa &euro;1.6 billion at the end of 2016\u00a0and\u00a0requires these reserves to fund its ongoing operating costs and to progress its ongoing deleveraging, Dublin Docklands SDZ\u00a0and residential funding programmes in the interim period to 2020.  It is only through the successful completion of these objectives that NAMA anticipates that the estimated surplus will be available for return to the State by 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  NAMA currently has\u00a0&euro;500m (2%) of\u00a0its original &euro;30.2bn senior debt and &euro;1.6bn of subordinated debt remaining outstanding.  NAMA is structured in such a way that the debt it issued to purchase the acquired loans was not treated as part of Ireland&rsquo;s General Government Debt under European accounting rules.  NAMA Group entities are therefore 51% privately owned and operate to return dividends to its shareholders.  The return to the private investors is an annual dividend linked to the Irish Government Bond yield at the time of dividend declaration, with the potential of an additional 10% (capped)\u00a0of the contributed capital sum.  As per section 60(2) of the\u00a0NAMA\u00a0Act 2009,\u00a0NAMA\u00a0may, following consultation with the Minister for Finance, use surplus funds to redeem and cancel its\u00a0debt and &ldquo;transfer any surplus funds remaining after that redemption to the Central Fund&rdquo;.  In practice, this means that surplus funds\u00a0may only be returned to the Central Fund once all NAMA's\u00a0obligations have\u00a0been repaid in full and in order of seniority: <\/p>  <p>  1.

NAMA have also advised that the Residential and Docklands SDZ funding programmes are unlikely to be completed before 2020.  Thus, I do not currently envisage a situation where NAMA will complete its work early as the Deputy suggests.<\/p>  <p>  As has been discussed with Eurostat, from an accounting perspective, once the senior debt, subordinated debt, and private investors have been repaid then NAMA (the Agency), which is in Government, would be the sole shareholder and, as such, NAMA (the SPV) would then become classified into the Government sector, having no effect on the General Government Balance.

The initial focus of the Working Group was the problem of rising motor insurance premiums and a broad range of issues affecting the cost of motor insurance were examined. <\/p>  <p>  The Working Group&rsquo;s Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  The Report makes 33 recommendations with 71 associated actions to be carried out in agreed timeframes, which are clearly set out in an Action Plan.  Some 45 of these action points are due to be implemented by the end of this year with the remainder scheduled for completion before the conclusion of 2018. <\/p>  <p>  There is a commitment within the Report that the Working Group will prepare quarterly updates on its progress and the first such update was published in early May.  The second quarterly update was published on the Department's website on 21 July 2017 and shows the progress to date on the overall implementation of the recommendations, with a particular focus on the 17 action points which were due for completion in the second quarter of 2017.  All 17 of these action points have been completed by their deadline. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the most recent CSO data (for June) indicates that motor insurance premiums have reduced by 10.2% year-on-year.  I do, however, accept that while CSO statistics indicate a greater degree of stability on an overall basis, these figures only represent a broad average and that there are many people who are still seeing increases.  I take the view that while the greater stability in pricing is a good thing, premiums are still at a very high level.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  However, I believe that the implementation of the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance will make a difference to the pricing of insurance premiums over the next 18 months.  I also believe that the Setanta judgment, by finding that MIBI is not liable to meet third party claims, removes a major uncertainty from industry, which I would expect to be reflected in pricing in the short to medium term. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, in January, the Cost of Insurance Working Group embarked on its second phase to examine issues around the cost of insurance for businesses, specifically Employer Liability (EL) Insurance and Public Liability (PL) Insurance.  It is envisaged that the final results of this second phase will take the form of an addendum to the existing Report.  As with the first phase, the aim is for all relevant bodies and stakeholders to work together in order to deliver fairer premiums for businesses without unnecessary delay.  It is hoped that a final report will be published in the autumn.<\/p>  <p>  The Working Group is building upon the previous work done in the motor phase in order to determine how it can be applied in the employer liability and public liability insurance claims areas particularly in relation to:<\/p>  <p>  - Personal Injury data and information<\/p>  <p>  - Effects of legal costs and litigation processes on insurance costs<\/p>  <p>  - Current claims compensation arrangements and cost of claims<\/p>  <p>  - Impact of unlawful activity on insurance sector<\/p>  <p>  The Working Group is also considering the impact of the cost of insurance on the competitiveness of particular business sectors, the impact of health and safety issues on the cost of insurance and other market issues.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Working Group has met nine times this year and has held extensive consultations with a range of stakeholders including the Hotels Federation of Ireland, IBEC, ISME, the Vintners&rsquo; Federation of Ireland (VFI), the Licensed Vintners&rsquo; Association (LVA), the Retail Grocery Dairy &amp;amp; Allied Trades Association (RGDATA), Chambers Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority.

The rights for the State to\u00a0appoint\u00a0Public Interest\u00a0Directors\u00a0to the boards\u00a0of\u00a0the Covered Institutions were derived from the terms\u00a0of\u00a0the guarantee schemes introduced in 2008 and extend over the period\u00a0of\u00a0the guarantee.  The last\u00a0of the guaranteed liabilities are due to mature between now and Spring 2018 and as such I do not expect to make any new\u00a0appointments of\u00a0Public Interest\u00a0Directors\u00a0to the boards\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0banks.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Going forward however, the State does have the ability to\u00a0appoint directors\u00a0to the\u00a0banks\u00a0in which it has large equity ownership positions.

Access is not always feasible because of a range of issues such as ongoing conservation works, physical location, risks associated with dangerous structures and restrictions imposed in some cases by landowners who may wish to limit access, either temporarily or more longer term, because of insurance fears, livestock etc.  OPW estimates that approx 10 - 15% of the accessible National Monument sites in its care are not available at any given time for these such reasons.<\/p>  <p>  While many sites are obviously open to visitors with Guides services and visitor facilities; the majority of properties within the heritage portfolio are largely unattended.

The Revised Estimates Volume for Public Services 2017 (REV) provided additional details in relation to these\u00a0Estimates and also reflected additional allocations of\u00a0just over &euro;40 million\u00a0to take account of changes since Budget day, with the most significant being that in relation to the Garda pay following the recommendations by the Labour Court.<\/p>  <p>  Departments are required to manage expenditure within the allocations set out in the REV and agreed by the\u00a0D&aacute;il.  Where new priorities emerge in the course of the year which must be met within the approved allocation for each Department, any reallocation of funding from one area, where there\u00a0may be\u00a0an emerging underspend, to meet\u00a0such new priorities would be made in accordance with Public Financial Procedures.<\/p>  <p>  Following the\u00a0Labour Court Recommendations with respect to Garda pay the Government had to act to ensure that the Lansdowne Road Agreement would remain intact.\u00a0\u00a0The agreement reached, to bring forward by five months, from September to April, pay increases due under the Lansdowne Road,\u00a0has a cost in 2017 of &euro;0.12 billion.  As outlined in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report, at this stage three months of this additional cost is reflected in expenditure to the end of June with the cost arising this year\u00a0to be met from available public resources taking into account the scope for reallocation of expenditure arising from the emerging expenditure position later in the year. This position will be monitored closely in order to assess how to meet any additional funding requirements where the need arises. <\/p>  <p>  Turning to the Christmas Bonus, the position for 2017 is essentially unchanged from the position that prevailed for the last three years.  The Christmas Bonus to long-term Social Welfare recipients had been\u00a0abolished in 2009. On Budget day in October 2014,\u00a0it was announced that a 25% Christmas Bonus would be paid\u00a0in December of that year.\u00a0 On Budget day in October 2015, a Christmas Bonus of 75% was announced. Demonstrating the Government's commitment to our most vulnerable citizens,\u00a0an increased 85% bonus was paid in 2016 as set out in\u00a0my Estimates Statement on Budget day last year.  In each of these years, the REV\u00a0did not include a specific allocation in respect of a Social Welfare Christmas bonus, in line with the practice\u00a0that such payments\u00a0are funded based on the fiscal position at Budget time.  The payment of a Christmas Bonus\u00a0has required a Supplementary Estimate in each of the last three years.\u00a0In\u00a02016 the Department of Social Protection\u00a0required a Supplementary Estimate of\u00a0&euro;109 million to provide for the Christmas Bonus,\u00a0with a broadly similar amount being paid from the funds available in the Social Insurance Fund.  The\u00a0extent to which a Supplementary Estimate would be required to fund a decision in relation to a Christmas Bonus would depend on the\u00a0projected outturn at\u00a0Budget time in relation to spending in the Department of Social Protection, which in net terms at the end of June\u00a0was &euro;41 million below profile, and also the surplus on the Social Insurance Fund, which as outlined in the June Analytical Exchequer Statement was &euro;132 million ahead of profile, driven by strong growth in PRSI receipts.  The approach to be adopted in relation to meeting the funding requirements of a decision in relation to a Christmas Bonus in 2017 will therefore follow the approach adopted in the last three years.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the specific issue of refunds of water charges, which will be in effect a one-off charge in the year of payment, it is anticipated\u00a0that the\u00a0cost arising this year in relation to\u00a0the refund of water charges\u00a0will be met within\u00a0available Exchequer resources taking into account the revenue,\u00a0expenditure and overall fiscal policy position later in the year.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600015#WRN03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Lansdowne Road Agreement","counter":651,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600015#WRN03200"},{"type":"question","counter":652,"qnumday":239,"qnumall":"[36011\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600015#WRN03300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the cost in 2017 of the movement forward of Lansdowne Road payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":653,"content":"<p>The Labour Court Recommendation on Garda pay issued on 3rd of November 2016 had serious implications for the continued viability of the Lansdowne Road Agreement.<\/p><p>After engagement with the Public Service Committee of ICTU and in acknowledgement of the anomaly that has arisen in the context of the Labour Court Recommendation concerned, the Government in its capacity as the public service employer, agreed to an increase in annualised salaries of &euro;1,000 for the period April to August 2017 inclusive for:<\/p><p>- those on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000;<\/p><p>- who are parties to the Lansdowne Road Agreement; and<\/p><p>- who do not stand to benefit from the Labour Court recommendations (CD\/16\/321 &amp;amp; CD\/16\/322) issued in respect of the Garda Associations.<\/p><p>The additional cost arising in 2017 is &euro;120 million.

For candidates who meet this requirement, the GAMSAT is then used to select students.  A minimum score of 55 was required in 2016 to receive an offer of a place.  The level of points required depends on the demand for places.  Details of the GAMSAT application process and the issuing of candidate results are available on the CAO website.<\/p>  <p>  The Disability Access Route to Education (DARE) offers reduced points places to school leavers with a disability, under the age of 23 as of 1 January 2017, who have been educationally impacted as a result of that disability.  Each participating institution has a reserved number of places to offer eligible DARE applicants at lower or reduced Leaving Certificate points.  Applicants must meet the\u00a0minimum entry requirements and any specific programme\u00a0requirements before being considered for a DARE reduced points offer.<\/p>  <p>  The reduction in points for DARE places can vary each year.  The number of points a particular course is reduced by is dependent on a number of factors, such as the overall number of places on the course, the number of reserved DARE places and the number of DARE eligible applicants competing for these reserved places.  Information on the number of reduced points places available per course and the method used by colleges for selecting eligible DARE students for those places is available on participating HEI websites.<\/p>  <p>  Undergraduate Medicine is provided in UCD, UCC, NUIG, TCD and the RCSI.

A large part of work of the Transitions Reform Group has been the reform of the Leaving Certificate Grading and the Common Points scale for admission to higher education.  Following extensive research and consultation, it was agreed to broaden the Leaving Certificate grading bands.  The number of grade bands was reduced from 14 to 8 to ease the pressure on students to achieve marginal gains in examinations and to encourage better engagement with each subject.  The broader grade bands also bring Ireland more in line with international best practice in other countries.  The Common Points Scale, which is\u00a0used by the CAO for entry to higher education\u00a0has also been revised.  The new Common Points Scale will apply to all applicants in 2017, so it will be a level playing field for everyone applying through the CAO system for a higher education place.<\/p>  <p>  The points for Medicine may be different but not necessarily lower, it depends on the number of applicants, and all candidates will be competing using the revised Leaving Certificate points system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600017#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Adult Education Provision","counter":747,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600017#WRP00800"},{"type":"question","counter":748,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[35128\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600017#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if funding can be resumed for a literacy programme (details supplied).","asker":"1362","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":749,"content":"<p>The City of Dublin Education and Training Board (CDETB) provide courses to TARGET's learners\u00a0under the Adult Literacy and Community Education budgets.

My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is actively assisting schools and school communities\u00a0in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  A key theme of my Department&rsquo;s 2017 Action Plan for Education is the support of wellbeing initiatives to ensure that mental resilience and personal wellbeing are integral parts of the education and training system.  Specifically, the Plan commits to the commencement of the roll-out of the Friends for Life programme and the\u00a0Incredible Years Classroom Management programme to teachers in all DEIS schools.  NEPS will deliver both programmes commencing in the autumn and are currently in the process of recruiting\u00a0an additional 11\u00a0psychologist staff to undertake this work.<\/p>  <p>  It is planned that during the coming academic year, some 40 Friends programmes will be organised involving some 1,000 primary and post-primary teachers and\u00a050 Incredible Years programmes will be offered to some 1,000 primary school teachers at\u00a0the commencement of a three year roll-out of the training.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department will be in touch with the individual to further discuss the\u00a0supports which have been outlined.<\/p>  <p>  It is open to the interested part to make a submission to\u00a0my Department which will be considered and responded to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600017#WRP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":753,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600017#WRP01400"},{"type":"question","counter":754,"qnumday":273,"qnumall":"[35161\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600017#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the construction of a secondary school will commence on the old greyhound track in Harold's Cross; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":755,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the acquisition of the former greyhound stadium\u00a0at Harold's Cross by the Department is currently at the conveyancing stage.<\/p><p>The acquisition of the property and the development of school infrastructure on the site\u00a0is contingent upon a change to the current zoning.<\/p><p>The statutory\u00a0process required\u00a0in respect of a\u00a0variation to the Dublin City Development plan is currently underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600017#WRP01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Staff","counter":756,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600017#WRP01700"},{"type":"question","counter":757,"qnumday":274,"qnumall":"[35210\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600017#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason a school (details supplied) will be losing a special needs assistant for the 2017-18 school year; if this decision can be reviewed in view of the fact that the school has been sanctioned SNA access for an additional four children since its last SNA allocation was made; his views on whether this level of allocation is sufficient to ensure the children who require assistance receive an appropriate level of support; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":758,"content":"<p>I recently announced that\u00a0an additional 975 SNA posts will be available for allocation to schools from September 2017 which is a 7.5% increase to meet the demands for the new school year.

It also provides funding for school buildings to ensure accommodations for students and teachers at the school and classroom level as well as enhanced capitation levels for students in special schools and classes, specialist transport arrangements, Special Arrangements for State Examinations; ESF Aided Fund for Students with Disabilities at 3rd level; Vocational Training for people with disabilities and in Adult Education &ndash; once off projects for disability in education.<\/p>  <p>  Preparation and planning are key to a successful transition from school.  In January 2016 the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) published transition guidelines for children with special needs.  These wide-ranging and comprehensive guidelines provide advice and tips for parents, students and schools covering the transitions between all stages of education, including the transition to further education or work - Guidelines on Planning for Life after School.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE in association with the National Disability Authority (NDA) has also published an information booklet about the full range of post-school education and training options for adults and school leavers with disabilities.  The NCSE booklet contains summary information on all of the main programmes and supports available to students with disabilities.  It also provides convenient links and signposts to where more information and guidance on these programmes can be found.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health and Children\/Health Service Executive assumes direct responsibility for young adults with special educational needs who are over 18 years.  My Department may allocate funding towards an education component of such provision.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0A key feature of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education (2015-2019) is the inclusion of targets to increase participation in higher education by people with disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities also plays a key role in helping to build the skill and education levels of people with disabilities.  The Fund, which is managed by the Higher Education Authority on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills, provides supports for full time students with disabilities to help them access and complete courses in our further and higher education institutions.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department has a number of strategies and initiatives in place to build links between education providers and employers so as to ensure that education and training for all learners, including people with disabilities, is aligned to the skill requirements of the workplace.  This includes the new National Skills Strategy 2025, which was launched in January 2016.

Details of the special education teaching allocations have also been published on the NCSE website.<\/p>  <p>  The aim of this new model is to deliver better outcomes for children with special educational needs.  Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children.<\/p>  <p>  No school, including the school to which the Deputy has referred, will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016\/17 school year.<\/p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011.<\/p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government.  The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular school referred to by the Deputy, under the old allocation model, this school had a Learning Support allocation of 10 hours for the 2016\/17 school year, which combined with 8.50 resource teaching hours allocated to the school by the National Council for Special Education, gave a total allocation to the school of 18.50 additional teaching hours for the 2016\/17 school year.<\/p>  <p>  The profiled allocation for the school, including the additional baseline provision, for 2017\/18 amounts to 15 hours in total.  However, the school has maintained its existing level of allocation of 18.50 hours which includes a retained amount of 3.50 and a baseline amount of 1.83 hours.  Accordingly, the school has been allocated some 5.33 hours more than its profile indicates.<\/p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools are provided with a total allocation to meet the needs of all children in the school who have special educational needs.<\/p>  <p>  Under the new model resources are based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.<\/p>  <p>  The new allocations to schools will include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including pupils who may receive a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school.<\/p>  <p>  All allocations to schools include a supplementary provision, which has been referred to as the &lsquo;baseline allocation&rsquo; which is allocated over and above the profiled allocation.<\/p>  <p>  For students who start school from September 2017, with a specific diagnosis, either in junior infants or transferring from another school, the resources they need will already be in the school under the new model.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE published details of an appeals process on the NCSE website: www.ncse.ie whereby schools could appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017\/18 allocation.<\/p>  <p>  Schools who wished to appeal were asked to submit appeals March 31st 2017.<\/p>  <p>  DES Circulars 0013\/2017 and 0014\/2017 outlined the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of the submission of an appeal, schools were asked to read carefully the DES circulars and in particular the relevant section, which relate to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE will advise schools of the outcome of the appeals as soon as possible.  The NCSE has confirmed that the school referred to in this question has not submitted an appeal.<\/p>  <p>  The model will allow for some additional provision for Developing schools or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior, beyond what would be expected through normal demographic growth, prior to the next review of the model.  The DES is currently developing the criteria in this regard and schools will be notified of the qualifying criteria for this in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  The model will also allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or emergency circumstances arising over the course of the model.  The NCSE, through its regional support services, will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may consideration be given to an additional allocation of hours be made to the school.<\/p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs have also now been published and are available on my Departments website.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600017#WRP06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Student Support Schemes","counter":801,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600018#WRQ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":802,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[35345\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600018#WRQ00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the recent decision by the Institute of Technology, Tallaght to reject all recent child care tenders and advertise again and that this will inevitably mean no child care on the campus for the immediate future; if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that this will impact on parents who are students in the college (details supplied); and if he will write to the college outlining his concerns.","asker":"1309","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":803,"content":"<p>The principle support provided by my\u00a0Department in financial terms is the student grant scheme, which makes available means-tested financial assistance to students in further and higher education.

The process spans the curriculum in schools, whole school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional support for teachers.  It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.<\/p>  <p>  To support schools, my Department has produced and distributed the Well-Being in Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2015). These guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners, and by current research. They assist schools and the school community in (a) supporting and responding to the mental health and well-being needs of our children and (b) in providing a safe and supportive environment for building life skills and resilience and a strong sense of connectedness to school.  My Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is actively assisting schools and school communities in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  All primary and post-primary initial teacher education programmes include the study of psychology of education and sociology of education.  All primary initial teacher education programmes include the implementation of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum which is taught at all class levels. The SPHE curriculum provides particular opportunities to foster the personal development, wellbeing, and social and emotional health of the individual child.<\/p>  <p>  Professional development services are provided by my Department to support teachers in addressing and dealing with mental health issues. At primary level, continuing professional development (CPD) is provided through:<\/p>  <p>  - NEPS, which provides guidance for schools in managing and responding to critical incidents; and training in the delivery by teachers of programmes, including the Incredible Years programme, which aims to prevent and treat young children's behaviour problems and promote their social, emotional, and academic competence<\/p>  <p>  - The Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) provides professional development support to teachers and schools to develop and promote student health and wellbeing, including mental health, in the context of a positive health promoting school environment.<\/p>  <p>  - The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Support Service, will support teachers in addressing the needs of pupils with special educational needs, including needs which relate to their mental health. <\/p>  <p>  - Supports are also provided through the Association of Teachers' Education Centres in Ireland (ATECI) summer courses, the Irish Primary Principals Network (IPPN), the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals (NAPD) and the Centre for School Leadership. <\/p>  <p>  At post- primary level, the new Framework for Junior Cycle (2015) places a clear emphasis on overall student health and well-being:  The Framework has eight key skills, which are to be embedded in every new Junior Cycle subject and short course, including the key skills of \"Managing Myself\" and \"Staying Well\".  <\/p>  <p>  The Framework includes an area of learning called Wellbeing, encompassing Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE), Physical Education (PE) and Civic Social and Political Education (CSPE) and to support its introduction in post-primary schools in September coming, a comprehensive programme of CPD has been drawn up by my Department's support services. The supports to be delivered during the 2017\/18 school year will include whole school CPD on Wellbeing in Junior Cycle, seminars for teachers of SPHE on Mental Health, Gender and Sexual Orientation and Substance Use and seminars for designated liaison persons in schools on Child Protection, Anti Bullying and a Whole School approach to Mental Health. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that CPD for teachers is not compulsory. However, at post-primary level it is intended that all teachers in schools participating in whole school CPD will receive CPD in Wellbeing in 2017\/18. It is anticipated that the significant majority of post-primary schools will avail of such CPD.<\/p>  <p>  A key theme of my Department's 2017 Action Plan for Education is the support of wellbeing initiatives to ensure that mental resilience and personal wellbeing are integral parts of the education and training system. Specifically, the Plan commits to the commencement of the roll-out of the Friends for Life programme and the Incredible Years Classroom Management programme to teachers in all DEIS schools. NEPS will deliver both programmes commencing in the autumn and are currently in the process of recruiting an additional 11 psychologist staff to undertake this work.<\/p>  <p>  It is planned that during the coming academic year, some 40 Friends programmes will be organised involving some 1,000 primary and post-primary teachers and 50 Incredible Years programmes will be offered to some 1,000 primary school teachers at the commencement of a three year roll-out of the training.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600019#WRR00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Guidelines on Mental Health","counter":867,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600019#WRR01000"},{"type":"question","counter":868,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[35706\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600019#WRR01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the resources schools receive to adhere to the well-being guidelines for both primary and post-primary schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1239","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":869,"content":"<p>My Department promotes a comprehensive and whole of school approach to the promotion of wellbeing and positive mental health.

This approach spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support, pastoral care, guidance counselling and the provision of professional development for teachers.  It also involves accessing other supports such as educational psychology services and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.  Additionally, schools engage in a wide range of sport and cultural activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth. The whole staff shares responsibility for general student wellbeing.<\/p>  <p>  The Well-being in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013) and Well-being in Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion (2015) provide a framework for schools to present in an integrated way their existing good practice. The Guidelines promote social and emotional learning, and mental health and direct then to new practices, as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  The European wide HSE supported Health Promoting School Process (HSP) is also outlined, and the Well-being Guidelines show how the HSP can be introduced to schools to complement existing good practice. The Guidelines outline how schools support young people through early intervention and prevention, modelled on the NEPS Continuum of Support tiered approach.  <\/p>  <p>  The Guidelines build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the systematic implementation of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the whole-school guidance plan, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process. Information is also provided on how to access support from the Professional Development Service for Teachers' SPHE Support Service and other external agencies and support services. <\/p>  <p>  More recently, my Department's Action Plan for Education 2017 promotes wellbeing as one of its key goals. Other actions, in addition to those outlined above, relating to wellbeing and mental health in the primary school sector include: <\/p>  <p>  - Developing an integrated programme of support for all schools to implement the Wellbeing Guidelines and an implementation plan for roll-out of this programme to all primary and post-primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  - Increasing the capacity of NEPS: an enhanced educational psychological service to schools, through the appointment of an additional 10 educational psychologists.  The focus of this additional support will be on extending the delivery of training to teachers in DEIS schools in two specific evidence-informed programmes &ndash; the Incredible Years Teacher Programme and the Friends programmes  &ndash; the Friends programme, when delivered by trained teachers, reduces anxiety and promotes coping, resilience and school-connectedness in children and young people in the primary and post-primary schools, while the Incredible Years Teacher programme strengthens the social and emotional competence of primary school children whose teacher has completed the programme. <\/p>  <p>  There will be a suite of Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) supports provided to post-primary schools to enable them to implement the new National Council for Curriculum and Assessment's Wellbeing Guidelines for Junior Cycle which are being introduced from this September for first years.  These supports will range from a full day whole staff professional activity event, workshops varying in length from 2 hours to 1 day. The workshops will address the needs of both mainstream and special schools. There will be a dedicated wellbeing section on the JCT website full of resources to assist the implementation of wellbeing within the junior cycle. JCT will liaise closely with National Educational Psychological Service and the Health Service Executive as they develop their involvement in this very sensitive area<\/p>  <p>  Measures announced by my Department as part of Budget 2016 and 2017 mean that 400 guidance posts, or two thirds of the guidance allocation that was withdrawn in Budget 2012, will be restored to post-primary schools from September 2017.  All of these 400 posts are allocated separately and transparently on the staffing schedule of posts for schools.  The pupil teacher ratio (PTR) will revert to 19:1 with effect from September 2017 with the guidance allocation shown separately on the staffing schedules and will represent 0.4 of the PTR for each school.  There is now an obligation on schools to ensure that the hours are used for guidance activities. Principals may decide to allocate more hours to guidance activities than the amount allocated on the schedule; they cannot decide to allocate fewer. <\/p>  <p>  While most of the 400 posts restored over the past two years are likely to be allocated to guidance counsellors, schools may decide, in the context of their guidance plans, to allocate some resources to others who may also play a role in delivering guidance in the schools.  However, my Department has made it clear that schools' guidance plans should include specified time allocation for guidance counsellors to be available for one-to-one guidance counselling and time allocation for the role in supporting the organisation and work of the Student Support Team.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600019#WRR01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Facilities Provision","counter":870,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600019#WRR01300"},{"type":"question","counter":871,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[35744\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600019#WRR01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Question No. 167 of 5 May 2017, if the proposal in respect of the management of the facility has been received by his Department; if so, whether the details of the proposal can be made available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":872,"content":"<p>As advised in my response to Question No. 167 of 03 May last, my Department contributed towards the capital cost of the sports hall for the school referred to.

These Circulars set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.<\/p><p>The revised allocation\u00a0model replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.<\/p><p>The new model provides one single allocation to schools based on the profile. Schools will be frontloaded with resources to provide additional\u00a0teaching support to all pupils who need such support.\u00a0<\/p><p>The NCSE notified all schools of their special education teaching allocations for September\u00a02017 on 7 March 2017.<\/p><p>The NCSE\u00a0also published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: www.ncse.ie.  Schools who wished to submit an appeal were asked to do so by 31 March 2017. <\/p><p>In relation to the particular school referred to by the Deputy, under the old allocation model, this school had a\u00a0Learning Support\u00a0allocation\u00a0of\u00a040 hours for the 2016\/17 school year, which combined with 13.60 resource teaching hours allocated to the school by the National Council for Special Education,\u00a0gave\u00a0a total allocation to the school of\u00a053.60 additional teaching hours for the 2016\/17 school year.<\/p><p>The profiled allocation for the school, including the additional baseline provision, for 2017\/18 amounts to 47.50 hours in total.  However, the school has maintained its existing level of allocation of 53.60 hours which includes a retained amount of 6.10 and a baseline amount of 16.73 hours.  Accordingly, the school has been allocated some 22.83 hours more than its profile indicates. <\/p><p>Schools could appeal\u00a0whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017\/18 allocation.<\/p><p>DES Circulars 0013\/2017 and 0014\/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.<\/p><p>In advance of any\u00a0submission of an appeal, schools were asked to read carefully the DES Circulars and in particular the relevant sections, which relate to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.<\/p><p>The NCSE is now concluding the appeal process and it is hoped that decisions will issue to schools in the coming days.<\/p><p>The model\u00a0will\u00a0also allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances\u00a0or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very\u00a0substantially prior to the next review of the model.<\/p><p>It is acknowledged that there are circumstances which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process put in place by the NCSE in March 2017(NCSE 03\/2017) to support the new special education teaching model.  This includes circumstances where the school profile significantly changes following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increase year on year.<\/p><p>Schools have recently been advised of the qualifying criteria for\u00a0such allocations.  Schools who qualify for additional allocations on the grounds that they will receive additional developing posts in accordance with the primary and post primary staffing schedules for 2017, will also provisionally\u00a0receive additional special education teaching allocations, less any retained element\u00a0contained within their profiled allocation.<\/p><p>Schools which have qualified for additional allocations on the grounds of developing status will be notified of these allocations.<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very\u00a0significantly since the allocation was made to the school,\u00a0may\u00a0an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. <\/p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs have also now been published and are available on my Departments website.<\/p><p>The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600020#WRS04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":967,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600020#WRS05000"},{"type":"question","counter":968,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[36155\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600020#WRS05100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the details of each body or organisation that is scheduled to receive in excess of &euro;1 million from his Department's Vote of expenditure or the group of Votes of expenditure connected with his Department in 2017 for the provision of services by the body or the organisation concerned; the amount involved in each case; if there is a signed service level agreement in place in respect of the services to be carried out by these bodies or organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":969,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available.\u00a0 Officials in my Department are collating the information and I will arrange to have it\u00a0forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it\u00a0becomes available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600020#WRS05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Property","counter":970,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600020#WRS05300"},{"type":"question","counter":971,"qnumday":346,"qnumall":"[36237\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600020#WRS05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"his plans to seek further clarification from the Christian Brothers in relation to a claim made by the congregation in correspondence to a person (details supplied) of 3 July 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":972,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that in the response sent by the Congregation of Christian Brothers to my Department on 3 July\u00a0stating that the surplus lands at Clonkeen College have been sold, the Congregation stated and I quote \"The surplus lands at Clonkeen College have been sold.

Under this scheme, my Department provides funding of &euro;16 million annually to primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme.  <\/p><p>A survey from Barnardos indicates that it would require an additional\u00a0investment of\u00a0around &euro;40 million per annum to provide all school children with free school books.  This\u00a0should not be taken to mean that this organisation does not see the value of school book rental schemes.

This\u00a0figure takes into account the resulting reduction to my Department's Student Grant Scheme budget.  <\/p><p>With regard to funding towards tuition fees at undergraduate level, my\u00a0Department\u00a0provided funding of &euro;280m in the academic year 2015\/16 under the\u00a0free fees schemes.  <\/p><p><b>Restoring the capitation grant to pre-2008 levels<\/b><\/p><p>The figure provided in the table above is based on the cost associated with restoring capitation rates for Primary and Post-Primary schools in the Free Education Scheme to 2010 levels which are higher than those that were in place in 2008.  <\/p><p>The process is underway for restoring grant funding that is used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff.  The ancillary grant was increased by &euro;6 in 2016 and &euro;5 in 2017 in order to enable primary schools implement the arbitration salary increase for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers and to also implement the restoration of salary for cleaners arising from the unwinding of FEMPI legislation.  A similar type approach in relation to improvements in grant funding was applied, as appropriate, at post-primary level.  <\/p><p><b>Restoring student grants to pre-2008 levels.<\/b><\/p><p>It is not possible to definitively calculate the cost of the various adjustments that have been made to the student support system since 2008, particularly in light of the demographic changes that have taken place.  <\/p><p>To put it in context, in 2008\/09 there were 57,261 students who benefitted from grant support at a cost of &euro;264m, whereas in 2015\/16 there were 80,622 students in receipt of grant support at a cost of &euro;388m.  <\/p><p>It is estimated, however that it would cost in excess of &euro;100m to reverse all of the adjustments that have been made to the student grant scheme since 2008.  <\/p><p>**  <b>Abolishing student fees for all EU post graduate students.<\/b><\/p><p>The cost to the State associated with the abolition of postgraduate fees is dependent on varying factors associated with type study i.e. full-time or part-time, varying fees associated with different course types and higher fees for international students.  However, based on the fact that the academic year 2015\/16, there were 11,975 EU students registered on postgraduate courses, and using the average cost of an EU postgraduate course, the estimated cost to the State of abolishing fees for EU postgraduate students would be &euro;83m.  It should also be noted that under my Department's Student Grant Scheme, funding of &euro;12m was provided for postgraduate tuition fees in 2015\/16; taking this into account, the net additional cost to my Department would therefore be in the region of &euro;71m.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600021#WRT01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Costs","counter":992,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600021#WRT01400"},{"type":"question","counter":993,"qnumday":353,"qnumall":"[36393\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600021#WRT01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the amount it would cost to remove fees for those engaged in part-time third-level education and to allow part-time third-level students access to SUSI grants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":994,"content":"<p>Fees for part-time courses are a matter for the relevant institutions.

These supports will range from a full day whole staff professional activity event, workshops varying in length from 2 hours to 1 day.  The workshops will address the needs of both mainstream and special schools.  There will be a dedicated wellbeing section on the JCT website full of resources to assist the implementation of wellbeing within the junior cycle.

The focus of this additional support will be on extending the delivery of training to teachers in DEIS schools in two specific evidence-informed programmes - the Incredible Years Teacher Programme and the Friends programmes - the Friends programme, when delivered by trained teachers, reduces anxiety and promotes coping, resilience and school-connectedness in children and young people in the primary and post-primary schools, while the Incredible Years Teacher programme strengthens the social and emotional competence of primary school children whose teacher has completed the programme.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600021#WRT05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":1031,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600021#WRT05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1032,"qnumday":366,"qnumall":"[36482\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600021#WRT05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the new resource allocation model; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1293"},{"type":"question","counter":1033,"qnumday":367,"qnumall":"[36483\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600021#WRT05500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the process by which appeals may be made by schools against resource allocation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1034,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that DES Circular 0013\/2017 for primary schools and 0014\/2017 for post primary schools were published on 7th March 2017.  <\/p><p>These Circulars set out the details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools.  <\/p><p>The revised allocation\u00a0model replaces the generalised allocation process at primary and post primary school level for learning support and high incidence special educational needs, and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) allocation process which provided additional resource teaching supports to schools, to support pupils assessed as having Low Incidence disabilities.  <\/p><p>The new model provides one single allocation to schools based on the profile.

This includes circumstances where the school profile significantly changes following the allocation process e.g., a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increase year on year.  <\/p><p>Schools have recently been advised of the qualifying criteria for\u00a0such allocations.\u00a0Schools who qualify for additional allocations on the grounds that they will receive additional developing posts in accordance with the primary and post primary staffing schedules for 2017, will also provisionally\u00a0receive additional special education teaching allocations, less any retained element\u00a0contained within their profiled allocation.  <\/p><p>Schools which have qualified for additional allocations on the grounds of developing status will\u00a0 be notified of these allocations.  <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.<\/p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreements have, to date, restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the proposed pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the starting salary of a new teacher from 1 January 2018 will be &euro;35,958 and from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.<\/p>  <p>  Further to the this newly recruited teachers\u00a0benefit from\u00a0the terms of the Ward circular\u00a0which reduced the\u00a0qualifying period for a CID and the removal of the career break and secondment categories of objective grounds which had previously prevented some teachers from gaining CIDs.  In addition to earlier permanency, other\u00a0measures\u00a0of benefit to newly recruited teachers\u00a0include a revised sequence for the filling of posts to enable fixed-term and part-time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more quickly and easier than before.<\/p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or do not work at all.  It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.<\/p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the recently concluded draft Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision in relation to new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the Agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600022#WRU02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":1060,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600022#WRU02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1061,"qnumday":376,"qnumall":"[36551\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600022#WRU02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the way in which he is addressing the requirement for additional second level school places in Newbridge, County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1257","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1062,"content":"<p>My Department's Six-Year Capital Programme priorities building projects for\u00a0areas of demographic growth.

Irish observers participate primarily in missions organised by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).<\/p><p>The election roster was established in May 2013 for a period of five years, following a review of the previous roster and a public call for applicants.  An independent appraisal and ranking of all 263 eligible applicants was undertaken by two assessors external to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, against the four criteria specifically related to election observation.  These criteria were: experience of election observation; knowledge of human rights and \/or governance issues; language skills; and experience of challenging environments.<\/p><p>Following the independent appraisal process, an election observation panel of 200 members was established in May 2013 for a five-year period, with a reserve panel of 10.  The roster currently stands at 194 members, the reserve panel having been fully utilised.  I am confident that the current roster is well equipped to deal with the requirements of the EU and the OSCE missions.<\/p><p>During the call for applications for membership of the roster, three late applications were permitted and these applications were subject to the same rigorous appraisal as all others.  On foot of the appraisal process, these applicants were ranked high enough to be included in the roster of 200 members.<\/p><p>All members of the roster are invited to apply to participate in any mission to which Ireland proposes to deploy observers following a request by the EU or OSCE.  To date, 133 members of the current roster have taken part in missions.  61 members have not yet done so.  A significant factor in this is that the number of applicants for election missions is nearly always higher that the number of available places.  I understand that some 29 members of the current roster have yet to apply to participate in a mission, which represents under 15% of the membership.<\/p><p>Officials will shortly begin working on the criteria and methodology for the call for applications for the next election observation, and they will consult nationally and internationally.

Protecting the gains of the peace process is a central priority for the Government in dealing with Brexit.  This includes: ensuring that all provisions of the Good Friday Agreement are fully respected and upheld; avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland and; maintaining the Common Travel Area.<\/p>  <p>  A key feature of my role involves representing Ireland at the General Affairs Council (Art. 50), which provides political oversight of the Article 50 negotiations as they proceed, and prepares the work of the European Council (Art. 50), where Ireland is represented by the Taoiseach.  The most recent General Affairs Council (Article 50) was held on Tuesday 20 June, where I and the other EU27 Ministers received a short update from Michel Barnier on the launch of the negotiations with the UK which had taken place the day before.<\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s key priorities and concerns   are understood by our partners, the Government has undertaken an intensive campaign of engagement with our EU partners and the EU Institutions.

I have already held bilateral meetings with a number of my EU colleagues since assuming my new role, including with the EU&rsquo;s lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, as well with my Estonian, Luxembourg, French, Slovak, Belgian and Spanish counterparts.

It is important to make sufficient progress on the exit issues, including citizens&rsquo; rights, the financial settlement and the Irish specific issues, in phase one of the negotiations so that parallel discussions can begin in phase two on the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK, including on trade, as well as on effective transitional arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  Engagement with the UK, in particular on Irish-specific issues, is also important.  In this regard, I met the UK&rsquo;s Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, David Davis, in London on 6 July and more recently, I met the UK&rsquo;s Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson in the margins of the Foreign Affairs Council on 17 July.

The past months have seen almost daily mass protests and violence in Venezuela, resulting in dozens of deaths in clashes between security forces and opposition demonstrators.  The reported human rights violations, excessive use of force, and mass detentions are unacceptable.  I condemn unreservedly any act of intimidation or violence perpetrated against those seeking to defend or exercise their rights, whether in Venezuela or elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s view is that the establishment of a clear electoral calendar, the reopening of dialogue, and the full restoration of the country&rsquo;s democratic institutions will be critical to achieving a settlement to the crisis.  This was made clear when the situation in Venezuela was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in May 2017.  Ireland and other EU member states used this opportunity to condemn the use of force in Venezuela and urge the Government and opposition to seek peaceful and democratic solutions through dialogue.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Constituent Assembly, I share the view expressed by Federica Mogherini, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, in her press conference following the Foreign Affairs Council last week.  The convening of a Constituent Assembly risks further polarising Venezuela and increasing confrontation in the country.  The focus of all political actors should instead be on finding ways to create the conditions to resume efforts towards a peaceful negotiated solution.<\/p>  <p>  While Ireland does not have diplomatic representation in Venezuela, officials at my Department and at our Embassy in Mexico, which has responsibility for Venezuela, will continue to monitor the situation closely.  Ireland will continue to work with EU partners in trying to urge a peaceful, negotiated settlement to the crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600023#WRV04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukrainian Conflict","counter":1148,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600023#WRV04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1149,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[35855\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600023#WRV04600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on recent developments in Ukraine, the declaration of a new state of Malorossiya and the efforts that are being made by the international community and the European Union to safeguard the Minsk peace deal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":1150,"content":"<p>The conflict in eastern Ukraine - now in its fourth year - has resulted in over 10,000 deaths, forced 1.7 million people to flee their homes and left an estimated 3.5 million in need of humanitarian assistance.<\/p>  <p>  Despite numerous commitments to a ceasefire, the security situation in eastern Ukraine remains fragile.

The Common Travel Area pre-dates Irish and UK membership of the EU and is not dependent on EU membership.  The Common Travel Area is particularly important in underpinning the Northern Ireland peace process and relations on the island of Ireland.  The EU Negotiation Guidelines and negotiating directives provide for the recognition of existing agreements and arrangements between Ireland and the UK, such as the Common Travel Area, which are in conformity with EU law. <\/p>  <p>  The UK Government notification letter which formally triggered Article 50 placed a strong emphasis on the &ldquo;unique relationship&rdquo; between these two islands.  The letter confirmed that the UK Government wishes to avoid a return to a hard border, to maintain the Common Travel Area, and to uphold the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  As agreed, the Irish-specific issues were discussed as part of the second round of negotiations between the EU and the UK which took place last week.  This included an exchange on the Common Travel Area.  The discussion centred on assessing the extent of common understanding on the issues, with agreement to do further work ahead of the next round of talks.  I am satisfied with the direction of the discussions.  My officials continue to be in good and close contact with the EU Task Force.<\/p>  <p>As part of the Government&rsquo;s ongoing efforts to ensure that the issues unique to Ireland are prioritised in the Brexit negotiations, I have held bilateral meetings with a number of my EU colleagues since assuming my new role, including with the EU&rsquo;s lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, as well with my Estonian, Luxembourg, French, Slovak, Belgian and Spanish counterparts.

The current roster was established in May 2013 for a period of five years following a review of the previous roster and a public call for applicants.<\/p><p>The number of observers deployed on missions varies from year to year, depending on the number of elections, the interest in participating, and the number of Irish nominees selected for EU missions.

To date in 2017, 18 have been deployed on 6 missions.

The Irish Focal Points are an Assistant Principal and an Executive Officer who are in regular contact with the OSCE and EU election Focal Points and also participate in the European Observation network, which brings together election observation Focal Points from all EU Member States, Norway, Switzerland and Canada.

The Deputy will appreciate, of course, that any decisions in respect of prosecutions are a matter solely for the Director of Public Prosecutions, who acts independently in accordance with the law.

An independent panel consisting of two senior counsel and five junior counsel was established for that purpose.  To ensure that the independence of the review process was preserved retired High Court Judge, Mr. Justice Roderick Murphy, oversaw the preparation of summaries and recommendations in the notification letters of the outcome of the process.  His role was to independently vouch for the fact that the summaries of conclusions and the reasoning behind them were a fair reflection of the advice which has been made available to my Department by the Panel. <\/p>  <p>  It was open to the independent counsel of the Independent Review Mechanism to make any recommendation that they saw fit.  Having examined this particular case the recommendation was that there was no further action to be taken by me.

The independent counsel's recommendation was accepted and the reasons for this conclusion were communicated to the person referred to by the Deputy in November 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate also that in respect of the data protection issue that he has raised, this would be a matter for the Data Protection Commissioner who is independent in the performance of her functions in accordance with Data Protection Acts. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600025#WRX02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Recruitment","counter":1246,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600025#WRX03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1247,"qnumday":440,"qnumall":"[34937\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600025#WRX03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of extra garda&iacute; that have been recruited in the current D&aacute;il term; if that figure meets the 15,000 pledged in the Programme for a Partnership Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1353","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1248,"content":"<p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.

It is Ireland's statutory regulator for charitable organisations and is an independent regulatory agency under the aegis of my Department.  Its mission is to regulate the charity sector in the public interest to ensure compliance with the law and to support best practice in the governance, management and administration of charities.<\/p>  <p>  Part 6 of the Charities Act 2009 provided for the dissolution of the former Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland and the transfer of the functions of the Commissioners to the Regulator.  This included the Commissioners' role regarding the Common Investment Fund which had been established by the Commissioners in 1985 for the management of assets which had been entrusted to them for charitable purposes pursuant to Section 31 of the Charities Act 1961.  It should be pointed out that in many cases the assets concerned would have been donated or bequeathed in trust by individuals for charitable purposes and were invested in the Fund on that basis.  However, it might be noted that in a majority of cases assets contained in the Fund would not have been invested by individual charitable organisations.  Rather the assets would have been entrusted to the Commissioners to be managed for the benefit of charitable organisations.  I should point out that the functions relating to the Common Investment Fund are a matter for the Charities Regulator and under Section 14(3) of the Charities Act 2009, the Regulator is independent in the performance of its functions.  Accordingly, I as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no role in relation to the matter.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Charities Regulator that it does not have information available as to whether or not any charitable organisations which are funded by the Health Service Executive under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004 hold, or benefit from, investments in the Common Investment Fund.  The Regulator has also advised me that no new investor has been admitted to the Common Investment Fund since June 2012.  I understand that the Authority has instigated a strategic review of the Common Investment Fund which includes a long term sustainability policy, with a responsible investment focus indicative of best practice for responsible investment globally.  In the interim, the Authority took a decision on 20 June 2017 to divest the Common Investment Fund of tobacco-related stocks.  As of 22 June 2017, no tobacco-related stocks were held in the Fund.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600025#WRX04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service","counter":1260,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600025#WRX04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1261,"qnumday":446,"qnumall":"[35042\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600025#WRX04700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he has engaged directly with the Courts Service on the appropriateness of its investments in the tobacco industry; if he has discussed this matter with the Minister for Health; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1262,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, the High Court has jurisdiction in wards of court matters and management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions under the Courts Service Act 1998.<\/p>  <p>  The courts have a custodial role in relation to funds that are lodged in court pursuant to Court Orders or in compliance with legislative requirements.

Based on current valuations this represents &euro;8.7 million, or approx 0.5% of the total value of court funds. <\/p>  <p>  The Courts Service has advised that it consulted with their fund managers and that it may not be possible to exclude tobacco stocks from the current fund or index, as there are other investors involved whose agreement would be required to change the investment strategy.

Successful applicants are advised by letter of my intention to grant citizenship and they are requested to submit the prescribed fee and any other relevant documents.

In other instances the applicant may request that a hold be put on their application, for example where they may have returned to their country of origin for a prolonged period, to facilitate them in making arrangements to return to reside in the State, or where they have difficulty in obtaining satisfactory evidence of their identity or nationality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600026#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Personal Insolvency Act","counter":1282,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600026#WRY00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1283,"qnumday":453,"qnumall":"[35130\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600026#WRY00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to section 115A of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 and section 21 of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015, the number of appeals to the court regarding the rejection of an insolvency proposal by a creditor submitted to date in 2017; the details of the outcome in each; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment.<\/p>  <p>  There are three levels of privilege - basic, standard and enhanced, with different criteria and privileges associated with each level of regime.  The list of privileges additional to core privileges varies between prisons, and within different areas of a prison, depending on the operational and infrastructure requirements of each prison.  Experience in other jurisdictions has shown that a tiered incentivised regime structure is a hugely valuable addition to prisons in the context of maintaining good order, and in motivating prisoners to partake in constructive activities.  Since the introduction of the Incentivised Regimes Programme, the Irish Prison Service has witnessed a considerable reduction in assaults in prisons.

Those resolutions require the Tribunal to report to the Clerk of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with its findings and recommendations.  Therefore, I do not propose to say or do anything which could be interpreted as impinging on its independence.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will also be aware it is the Garda Commissioner who has statutory responsibility  to carry on and manage and control generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, the putting in place of internal structures to service the Tribunal is a matter for the Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter. The question of Government approval does not arise.  Similarly, the selection of personnel to support those structures is a matter for the Commissioner.  I do not believe that it would be proper for me as Minister to prescribe the approach which is taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na towards the Tribunal.  Indeed, I would be open to criticism if I were to seek to influence how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fulfil their duties to the Tribunal.  <\/p><p>As previously advised in reply to Parliamentary Questions No. 62 of 1 June 2017 and Nos. 762 to 778 of 20 June 2017, the Government has been anxious to ensure that the Disclosures Tribunal receives the greatest degree of assistance possible from all parties, not least An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to that end, has been supportive of the Commissioner in ensuring that she has the resources at her disposal to service the Tribunal in a timely and effective manner.  In light of the importance of the Tribunal and the urgency of its work, it was agreed that arrangements should be put in place without delay to facilitate that work.  The Commissioner identified a requirement that could best be met by the re-engagement of a small number of retired persons and my Department approved this in February 2017, subject to formal sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which was conveyed in May 2017.  The formal sanction provided for the engagement of three persons (<font color=\"#001A26\">i.e. two retired members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and one civilian)<\/font>for up to 9 months for the purposes of servicing the Tribunal.  I am advised that the services of two former members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been engaged for a period of nine months from March to November 2017 and that their contracts fully comply with pension abatement regulations.  These contracts were initially for a period of six months to the August but have recently been extended to the end of November.  My Department was not consulted nor should it have been in relation to the selection of the particular individuals concerned.<\/p><p>The rehiring of persons on a contract basis does not require the approval of either the Policing Authority or the Government.  Neither is there a requirement to tender for the purposes of rehiring retired individuals on a temporary basis. <\/p><p>Approval was also granted to retain the services of a solicitor which would require a procurement process and the involvement of the Office of Government Procurement.  In the event, those services are being provided by the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Commissioner has not availed of the sanction to date. <\/p><p>I am informed that the work of the two retired members supports the Disclosure Tribunal Co-Ordination Office based in Garda Headquarters which is staffed by one full-time member, seconded temporarily from the Office of Corporate Communications, to whom the normal supervisory rules apply. That Office will assist any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, serving and retired, irrespective of rank in relation to the Tribunal.  A number of additional personnel are facilitating the work of this office on an ad hoc basis as requirements dictate.  I am further informed that liaison persons have been nominated from relevant sections\/Regions to deal with specific requests from the Tribunal.  Funding for the Co-Ordination Office is met from the overall Garda budget.<\/p><p>It should be understood that the provision of these additional resources is to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an organisation is able to cooperate with the Tribunal to the fullest extent, without unduly affecting the ability of the organisation to continue to carry out its normal vital work.  That said, there is nothing in the arrangements put in place by the Commissioner to prevent, nor could they, the right of any individual member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to make any representations they see fit, relevant to its terms of reference, to the Tribunal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600027#WRZ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Operations","counter":1356,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600027#WRZ03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1357,"qnumday":488,"qnumall":"[35402\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600027#WRZ03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 623 of 28 June 2005 (details supplied), his plans to amend same for record of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.","asker":"1309","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1358,"content":"<p>I refer the Deputy to the response to Question No. 132 of 21 March 2017 and to previous questions which set out the position in respect of this matter.

Under the Act, a new single application procedure was introduced under which all aspects of a person's claim (asylum, subsidiary protection and permission to remain) are considered together by the International Protection Office (IPO) rather than sequentially as heretofore.  The IPO replaced the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) from the commencement date.  The Chief International Protection Officer (CIPO) and the International Protection Officers in the IPO are independent by law in the exercise of their international protection functions.

The role of the Inspectorate is to promote efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Inspectorate undertakes analysis of policies and procedures in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and benchmarks them against the best practices and standards of comparable police services. <\/p><p>  While the Garda Inspectorate has no statutory responsibility for the monitoring of the implementation of recommendations made in its reports, a process to do so was established with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2008 which resulted in the publication of status implementation update reports twice a year on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s website.  The last such regular update was published in November 2013 when, I understand, the process was interrupted due to pressure of work.  However, the Inspectorate and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are now working towards the production, in tabular form, of a document which will indicate the position regarding the implementation of recommendations contained in a number of Inspectorate reports up to and including the Crime Investigation report.  Once completed, the results will be published on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>  With regard to the Garda Inspectorate Report on Crime Investigation 2014, I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the Garda Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 will address many of the detailed recommendations highlighted in the Garda Inspectorate's 2014 Report on Crime Investigation.  The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner has established a Strategic Transformation Office to plan and oversee the implementation of the Garda Modernisation and Renewal Programme and oversee the work to address many of the recommendations made by the Inspectorate in its report on Crime Investigation, including those relating to the recording and classification of crime.  Taking account of the number and complexity of many of the recommendations in the report, full implementation is being pursued on a phased basis. I regret that the table requested by the Deputy is not readily available in the format he is seeking, however, I have requested some additional information from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the Report and I will contact the Deputy again when this information is to hand. <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, I am informed that important strategic issues currently being addressed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the context of the Report include:<\/p><p>- A new Performance Accountability and Learning Framework, (and IT system); <\/p><p>- A Control Room Strategy to provide for centralised handling of all requests for service from the public, linked to a modern Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system; <\/p><p>- Improved arrangements for Rosters and Duty Management; and<\/p><p>- Enhancements to Incident Management, Investigation Management and Victim Engagement. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the majority of recommendations arising from this Report fall to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to examine and implement in the first instance.  However, there are a small number of these recommendations relevant to my Department for which work has been ongoing since the publication of the Report.  Several of these are being advanced under the ambit of the Criminal Justice Strategic Committee (CJSC), which was founded in 2015 to drive enhanced co-operation and collaborative change across the criminal justice sector.  The establishment of the CJSC itself in fact implements one of the recommendations of the Inspectorate report on Crime Investigation.<\/p><p>The CJSC is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes the Heads of the various executive bodies across the Criminal Justice sector, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Policing Authority.  The committee is also attended by members of my Department&rsquo;s Management Board with responsibilities in the criminal justice area. <\/p><p>  The CJSC oversees an ongoing work programme of initiatives to improve the exchange of information, expertise and ideas across the justice sector, and to identify and accelerate reforms that require structured inter-agency co-operation.  Several of these initiatives specifically address recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate&rsquo;s Report.<\/p><p>  In addition, yesterday I published the report of the CSO-led Expert Group on Crime Statistics, which was established in 2014 on foot of the Garda Inspectorate Report on Crime Investigation.  This report specifically addresses six recommendations in the Garda Inspectorate Report and directly relates to the compilation of crime statistics.  <\/p><p>  It should also be noted that the statutory position regarding the monitoring of the implementation of recommendations made in Inspectorate reports has changed.  Section 117(A) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act provides for a role for the Policing Authority in monitoring the measures taken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement the recommendations contained in reports prepared by the Inspectorate, and in line with this provision the Authority has been requested to monitor the implementation of the 2015 Garda Inspectorate report 'Changing Policing in Ireland'. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600028#WRAA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Car Theft","counter":1390,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600028#WRAA02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1391,"qnumday":499,"qnumall":"[35603\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600028#WRAA02700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the penalties applying to the possession and-or use of signal blockers with the capability of interfering with and preventing a motorist locking a vehicle remotely and which have been used recently in theft from vehicles.","asker":"1222","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1392,"content":"<p>I have requested a report from the Garda authorities in relation to this matter and I will contact the Deputy directly when the report is to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600028#WRAA02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1393,"content":"<p>Question No. 500 answered with Question No. 470.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Probate Applications","counter":1394,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600028#WRAA03000"},{"type":"question","counter":1395,"qnumday":501,"qnumall":"[35645\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600028#WRAA03100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"for the average waiting times for Dublin and each of the district probate registries for grants of representation and applications lodged by a solicitor, and the additional resources that have been provided to reduce these waiting times.","asker":"1222","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1396,"content":"<p>The Probate Office is an office of the High Court and management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions under the Courts Service Act 1998.

It is anticipated that the average processing time in dealing with applications received from solicitors in the Sligo District Probate Office will improve significantly over the next two months following the completion of training of a new staff member.<\/p><p>The Courts Service continues to keep the staffing of Courts Service offices, including District Probate Registries under review, and depending on specific circumstances, additional resources may be provided, subject to the necessary funding being available.<table><tr><th>District Probate Offices<\/th><th>Applications from solicitors - Average time from first receipt to issue a grant of Probate\/letters of administration <\/th><th>Applications from Personal Applicants - Average time from first receipt to issue a grant of Probate\/letters of administration<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan<\/td><td>8 weeks<\/td><td>8 weeks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dundalk<\/td><td>8 - 10  weeks<\/td><td>4 - 8 weeks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mullingar<\/td><td>4 - 6 weeks<\/td><td>6 &ndash; 8 weeks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clonmel<\/td><td>4 weeks<\/td><td>N\/A &ndash; personal applicant service not available at present<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny<\/td><td>8 -10 weeks <\/td><td>8 - 10 weeks <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford<\/td><td>4  weeks<\/td><td>4 weeks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford<\/td><td>2-3 weeks<\/td><td>2 -3 weeks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>14 weeks<\/td><td>14 weeks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tralee<\/td><td>5 weeks<\/td><td>5 weeks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>6 weeks<\/td><td>4 weeks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Letterkenny<\/td><td>8- 12 weeks<\/td><td>12-16 weeks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo<\/td><td>20 weeks<\/td><td>4-8 weeks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Castlebar<\/td><td>10-12 weeks<\/td><td>14-16 weeks<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway<\/td><td>16 weeks<\/td><td>16 weeks<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600028#WRAA03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legal Aid Service Data","counter":1397,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600028#WRAA03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1398,"qnumday":502,"qnumall":"[35662\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600028#WRAA03400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons on the waiting list for free legal aid and advice, and the average waiting time by area.","asker":"1222","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":1399,"qnumday":578,"qnumall":"[36444\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600028#WRAA03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons awaiting an appointment for free legal aid services in each county; the average waiting time for an appointment; and the timeframe each person has been waiting, in tabular form.","asker":"1330","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1400,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 502 and 578 together.<\/p><p>The Legal Aid Board provides civil legal aid and advice pursuant to the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 to 2016. <\/p><p>I am conscious that there are significant demands on the Board and that this gives rise to waiting times for certain services at most of the Board&rsquo;s law centres.  However, waiting times have been markedly reduced over recent years due to measures introduced by the Board and the Deputy will be glad to know that the Board&rsquo;s budget was increased by &euro;4.15m in 2017. <\/p><p>I know that the Board is extremely conscious of the fact that delays in service can lead to further difficulties not just for the client but also for children, the wider family and the community, as well as the courts system.  In this regard, the Board continues to provide a priority service in respect of a number of areas such as domestic violence, child abduction, child care, and asylum and related matters.  In addition, a person admitted to the Abhaile scheme does not need to wait before they are seen by a solicitor for legal advice.  All other applications are placed on the waiting list.<\/p><p>An application for civil legal aid and advice can be made at any Legal Aid Board law centre, regardless of the county of residence of the applicant.  For that reason, statistics in relation to applications and waiting times are maintained by law centrerather than county.  The following table sets out the waiting times for civil legal services as of the 1July 2017 by law centre.  I am informed that some law centres operate a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach, which involves giving an applicant a short consultation (45 minutes) for legal advice.  Those persons remain on the Board&rsquo;s waiting list if they require further legal services and the wait time for this is indicated by the second column.

This comprehensive operation is supported by the enhanced Government investment in Garda resources, including an additional allocation of &euro;88.5 million for overtime in 2017.  We have also invested heavily in the Garda fleet, with over 720 new vehicles coming on stream since the start of 2015 and a provision of &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles under the Capital Plan 2016-2021. <\/p>  <p>  The additional investments in policing make it possible to maintain and extend a range of intensive policing operations, including the continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor.  Under Operation Thor we have seen over 74,000 targeted checkpoints and 52,400 crime prevention patrols nationwide.  This concentrated policing activity has produced in the region of 4,400 arrests and 4,900 charges covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences. <\/p>  <p>  It is also encouraging to note that since the launch of the operation, the burglary figures in particular have shown a significant downward trend.  Indeed, the CSO official recorded crime statistics for Q4 of 2016 in respect of Co. Tipperary show decreases in a number of the main categories of crime for example: burglary (16%), robbery (10%), theft (5%) and public order offences (17%) for the twelve months of 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, all of which parallels the implementation of Operation Thor.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme (2016-2021) places a strong emphasis on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.  In this regard, community policing is a key aspect of the Garda approach to the prevention and detection of crime.  All Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises.  Garda&iacute; engage with a wide range of community based groups, as well in more formal settings such as Joint Policing Committees, to ensure that local issues can be aired and appropriate partnerships formed with communities to address matters of concern.  Garda&iacute; also support over 3,700 Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch Schemes nationwide, and these form an important partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent crime and protect communities, especially the elderly and more vulnerable persons.  In addition, the Garda Text Alert Scheme provides an effective means for Garda&iacute; to communicate crime prevention information to local communities. <\/p>  <p>  Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's ongoing commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. The Government plans to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan which is in train within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Approximately 300 appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600028#WRAA04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Service Data","counter":1410,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600028#WRAA04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1411,"qnumday":506,"qnumall":"[35711\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600028#WRAA04700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the annual exchequer funding provided to the Courts Services for 2017 and in each of the past ten years, in tabular form.","asker":"1288","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1412,"content":"<p>The funding to agencies under the remit of my Department is provided through the annual estimates process.

The Policing Authority assumed responsibility for undertaking these competitions on 1 January 2017 and, coinciding with that date, the eligibility criteria were extended to include any member of the PSNI not below the rank of inspector who has served not less than 2 years in that rank.  Previously, they were confined to those in the rank immediately below.   The 2005 Act also provides for the secondment from the PSNI to certain ranks in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for a period not exceeding 3 years.  I have been informed by the Commissioner that there are currently no police officers serving in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on secondment from police services outside the State. <\/p>  <p>  Also of relevance is the statutory provision for former members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be re-appointed to the organisation.  The most recent applications in this respect concern former members who departed to serve in police services in Australia and have gained valuable skills and experience from that service and wish to re-join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals with appropriate policing experience and qualifications gained in other jurisdictions may also be suitable for appointment to various civilian roles available within the Garda organisation.

Many of the likes and dislikes expressed by the children were also identified and addressed in the recommendations of the McMahon Report.  In implementing those recommendations  we have taken the views of children as expressed in this report into account.<\/p><p>The International Protection Act 2015 introduced the single application procedure for international protection.  This replaces the sequential processing system and is the single biggest reform in this area for the past twenty years.  Since January 2017, all applications for international protection are being processed under the new single applications procedure.  In responding to length of time issues, the Department, in addition to implementing the single procedure, proactively engaged in an examination of cases of those longest in the system.  These cases have been expedited resulting in substantial numbers of people who were greater than five years in the system now dealt with.  It is estimated that almost all of those identified in the Report as being over 5 years in the Direct Provision system and who do not have any impediments, such as ongoing judicial reviews, have now had their cases processed to completion. <\/p><p>A range of measures have been put in place to ensure that the principle of the best interests of the child can be effectively implemented from the single application procedure to living in centres.  There is ongoing implementation of the child protection and welfare policy in all accommodation centres under the direct supervision of an officer seconded to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) from TUSLA.  In addition to this, an officer seconded from the Department of Education and Skills to RIA oversees the enrolment of children in accommodation centres across the country as they link in with local schools. In addition, the remit of the Ombudsman for Children has been extended to include children in state provided accommodation centres. <\/p><p>My Department continues to work with Contractors at a number of centres (both State owned and commercial) to commence projects for independent living for residents.  This is a follow on from the provision of this facility at Mosney and Ballyhaunis. This will include home cooking within the family accommodation units in some instances and access to communal cooking stations for residents in other instances.  These projects allow adult family members to cook for themselves and their families rather than availing of the central catering services provided at the centres.  These projects will be reviewed and refined with a view to their application across the entire accommodation portfolio where feasible.  It should be noted that these projects can involve structural works and due regard needs to be taken of fire safety legislation and planning requirements.<\/p><p>The 2016 annual report from the Reception and Integration Agency of the Department contains a detailed listing of the on-site and off-site facilities available for children who are living in State provided accommodation.

The powers available to Garda&iacute; support them in addressing anti-social behaviours, including the prevention of nuisance or annoyance to others and forestalling damage to property or a breach of the peace. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains committed to tackling public disorder and anti-social behaviour by working with communities to reduce this type of behaviour and enhance community safety. The Garda approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities, businesses (in particular the night time economy) and other stakeholders to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Garda National Model of Community Policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.  Clear objectives are set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.  All Garda&iacute; have a role to play in Community Policing in carrying out their duties.  In addition, the National Community Policing Office, attached to the Garda Community Relations Bureau, captures best practice in community policing initiatives and disseminates these practices through its communication network. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021, published on 9 June 2016, places a strong emphasis on developing and supporting the\u00a0community policing\u00a0ethos of the organisation and enhancing the current delivery model so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security.\u00a0 It will result in the introduction of multi-skilled Community Policing Teams in every District. Community Policing Teams will be made-up of Garda&iacute; from a number of different units who will work with the local community to prevent and detect crime.  Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities and will enhance the provision of effective Community Policing throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's ongoing commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. The Government plans to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan which is in train within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1509,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 537, 538, and Nos 565 to 572, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Accounts Committee published a report of its examination of matters in relation to financial procedures at the Garda College, Templemore on 18 July last.  It follows from the Interim Audit Report prepared by the Garda Internal Audit Section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and published by the Garda Commissioner last March.  The PAC report makes a number of findings and recommendations in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department.  Those findings and recommendations will be carefully examined with a view to identifying what follow up is appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda authorities have publicly stated that they understand the gravity of the issues identified in the Interim Audit Report and are taking comprehensive steps to progress its recommendations as quickly as possible.  A high level Steering Committee, chaired by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Chief Administrative Officer, and including a representative from my Department is overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the Interim Audit Report.  That work will continue as a matter of priority with a view to completion by year end.  Although I would prefer that this work could be brought to a conclusion more quickly, the reality is that unravelling the funding model put in place in the College in the late 1980s has raised complex legal issues that have taken time to resolve through engagement with the Office of the Attorney General. <\/p>  <p>  The independent Policing Authority is also overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of the Interim Audit Report and is expected to submit its first report on this matter to me shortly.  I have referred the PAC report to the Authority in order that it can take it into account as part of its ongoing work in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The PAC report makes a number of findings in relation to my Department and, in particular, in relation to its oversight of financial matters within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These findings will be examined to determine whether any enhancements are required to existing oversight arrangements within the parameters of the statutory framework set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  It is important, however, to recall that under the Act it is the Garda Commissioner who is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote and is in law responsible for ensuring that the appropriate controls apply to expenditure within the organisation.  The Commissioner is supported in that role by a Finance Directorate headed by an Executive Director of Finance and an Internal Audit Unit.  The Head of the Garda Internal Audit reports to an independent statutory Audit Committee appointed by the Policing Authority and comprising a majority of external persons.  That Committee has responsibility, amongst other things, to advise the Commissioner, as the accounting officer, on governance and financial matters relating to her functions.  Similar to all accounting officers, the Commissioner is responsible for the preparation of an annual Appropriation Account, which is then audited and reported on, by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his annual report each year. <\/p>  <p>  In this context the finding by the Committee that my Department failed in not informing the Garda Internal Audit Unit when it became aware of issues in relation to the College in September 2015 is not clear.  The Committee appears to be suggesting that my Department should, when issues of concern arise, seek to circumvent the Commissioner who has, as the Deputy will be aware, statutory responsibility for controlling and directing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and instead engage directly with her Head of Internal Audit or the Audit Committee which advises her.  In any event, and as outlined in its evidence to the Committee, my Department was informed in early October 2015 by the Garda authorities that the Garda Audit Committee had been apprised of the issues at its September meeting.  The Head of Internal Audit reports to the Committee and attends such meetings.  In these circumstances the need to inform the Head of Internal Audit did not arise.<\/p>  <p>  The fact that the Garda Commissioner is in law the Accounting Officer does not, of course, relieve my Department of its oversight role in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Indeed, new structures have been put in place in recent years to strengthen oversight with the introduction of a formal governance agreement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Governance Framework Agreement makes provision, amongst other things, for regular governance meetings between the Secretary General of my Department and the Commissioner as well as tripartite meetings involving my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Authority.  In this context, senior officials meet monthly with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a senior management level to oversee progress on strategic and resource matters.  In addition, arrangements are in place for quarterly meetings involving my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Authority in the context of the Authority's statutory functions in relation to providing advice regarding Garda resources.  Specifically in relation to financial matters, the Executive Director of Finance in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, together with the other Heads of Finance for each Vote Body in the Justice Group, attend a monthly Financial Management Committee, chaired by the Assistant Secretary Corporate Affairs in the Department.  If these arrangements can be strengthened in someway to enhance their effectiveness, while at the same time respecting the statutory framework in the 2005 Act and not trespassing on either the Commissioner's operational independence or her legal responsibilities as Accounting Officer, that will be done. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also, of course, be aware the Commission on the Future of Policing is examining the totality of the oversight architecture in relation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na including the Authority, the Garda Inspectorate and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and also my Department and is due to report by September 2018. <\/p>  <p>  I also note the findings in relation to my Department's records.  In so far as records relating to the preparations for the hand-over in July 2006 of the Accounting Officer role to the Commissioner are concerned, the Department retains its records in accordance with its obligations to do so.  In an effort to assist the Committee, the Department sought to identify whether the issues relating to the College surfaced at that time.  This exercise did not identify any relevant records on this specific point.  In relation to the absence of records concerning the origins of the funding arrangements, including the establishment of the Sportsfield Company, an extensive trawl of several thousand Departmental records going back some 30 years did not identify any relevant records.  I do not believe that one can extrapolate from this to draw any conclusions in relation to corporate governance standards in the Department today but my Department will of course continue to provide every possible assistance to the Committee. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to whether the Commissioner should have informed the then Minister of the issues arising under section 41 of the 2005 Act, it remains the case that while section 41 places a requirement on the Commissioner to report certain matters to the Minister, it is ultimately a matter for the judgement of the Commissioner as to when to make reports specifically citing that section of the Act.  It is not simply a question of legal judgement - it is a question of determining whether a particular set of circumstances fall within the criteria set out in the Act.  The Commissioner judged in this instance that further information required to be gathered before a decision could be taken on the making of a section 41 report.  I do not propose to seek to second guess her decision.<\/p>  <p>  I mention these matters to provide some context to the Committee's findings and recommendations.  The consideration and implementation of many of them will fall to Commissioner as Accounting Officer subject to appropriate oversight by my Department and the Policing Authority.  Those directly relating to my Department will, as I have said be carefully examined to see what action is required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600030#WRCC02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1510,"content":"<p>Question No. 539 answered with Question No. 465.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":1511,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600030#WRCC03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1512,"qnumday":540,"qnumall":"[35974\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600030#WRCC03300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of knives seized by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Dublin region in 2015, 2016 and to date in 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1513,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, a comprehensive and robust legal framework is in place with respect to knife crime including heavy penalties for breaches of the laws concerned.

In this regard, the Commissioner has advised that some initiatives will be implemented in the short to medium term, while others will require a number of years to implement fully.  Given the highly complex nature of the Programme, timelines for projects may move for a number of reasons including, for example, extended scope or procurement phase, unforeseen delays or changes to the strategic priorities of the organisation.<\/p><p>The Investigations Management System, planned for implementation in late 2018, will standardise, digitise and support the management of all investigations arising from a PULSE incident.  The system will support the allocation and management of all jobs and allocation of roles and documentation relating to the running and completion of an investigation.  It will also maintain a full history of the chain of events for an investigation, information and evidence gathered and decisions made. I am advised that work is progressing in relation to the system and that contacts are ongoing with relevant stakeholders.  In the meantime, PULSE has been enhanced with new incident management functionality to enable Garda supervisors monitor the progress of incidents from initial data input right through to court outcome stage. This is an interim step pending the implementation of the Investigations Management System.  <\/p><p>I understand An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na currently deploys a mix of Regional and Divisional Control Room models across the organisation.  The Control Room Strategy, in the long term, will introduce a new Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system.  Pending the introduction of the new system, the following interim projects have been established to address any gaps in collating data and to provide a more professional and consistent service across the country: <\/p><p>-  CAD Part 1<b><\/b>will ensure that all calls from the public to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are accurately tracked and managed and supported by a Regional Control Room Model.  The CAD Part 1 project will extend the Cork CAD system to incorporate the Kerry Division, thereby ensuring a standardised approach across the southern region. This project is due for deployment later in 2017.  <b><font color=\"#00204F\"> <\/font><\/b><\/p><p>-  ERC1 (Electronic RC1) is an initiative which facilitates the implementation of the overall Control Room Strategy initiative.  This is an interim solution that provides Divisions without the current CAD system with the functionality to record, store, retrieve and update information regarding requests for service from the public in an electronic format. ERC1 will assist in standardising the call handling and incident recording procedures prior to the deployment of the complete Control Room Strategy.  ERC1 commenced as a pilot in the Mullingar Division in 2016 and a national roll out of ERC1 to all Divisions without CAD (14 Divisions in total with ERC1) was completed during the week ending 1 June last.<\/p><p>As part of the longer-term strategy, Control Room technology will be significantly enhanced.  The CAD Part 2 project will identify a suitable CAD system tailored to fit the specific needs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the ultimate objective of providing a better response to victims of crime and delivering a more seamless service to the public. This new CAD system will integrate current and future Garda IT systems i.e. PULSE, Rosters and Duty Management, Contact Management, etc. to provide a holistic view of the organisation's information. <\/p><p>Some other key ICT projects which are currently being advanced are set out below:<\/p><p>-  The Enterprise Content Management project is intended to provide a single repository for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to securely store and manage content. I understand from the Garda authorities that this project will shortly go live in the Eastern Region following the completion of training in these areas. The system will then be systematically rolled out nationwide.<\/p><p>-  A new Property and Exhibits Management System will be used to record all property and exhibits which come into Garda possession and manage them throughout their lifecycle within the organisation from scene to court. This system is planned to go live later this year. <\/p><p>-  In the area of Victims Services, PULSE has been updated to include Individual Victim Assessment and Victim Engagement screens to record information about the victim themselves and any Garda interaction or engagement with the victim. <\/p><p>-  The e-Vetting system provides online processing of applications for Garda vetting for persons working with children and vulnerable persons and is now fully operational. This system won the national eGovernment Award for 2017. <\/p><p>-  A project to implement a new Rosters and Duty Management System is currently under way and it is planned to commence a pilot of the system in the first half of 2018. This system will support the management of the new rosters in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to manage the deployment of human resources on a day to day and also on a strategic long term basis.<\/p><p>-  A new Anti-Money Laundering application (GoAML) which will support Financial Intelligence Units to counter terrorist financing and money laundering was implemented in June 2017. <\/p><p>-  A project to enhance Network Access to Rural Locations is a planned initiative under the Modernisation and Renewal Programme. This initiative has identified the locations that do not currently have access to PULSE, Garda e-mail and portal, and where appropriate will provide connectivity. Work on this project is well advanced and over 100 additional stations have now been added to the Garda network.<\/p><p>-  A project to provide mobile access, via a smartphone device, to all Garda information systems, including PULSE, is currently being advanced.<\/p><p>In addition An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in collaboration with my Department, is actively progressing a number of EU ICT projects to improve police co-operation and increase border security within the EU.  These include:<\/p><p>-  implementation of the FIND solution which is now operational enabling the Garda National Immigration Bureau to query the Interpol Stolen Lost Travel Document Database (STLD)<\/p><p>-  implementation of PRUM, which is planned to go live early in 2018, and will deliver enhancements to the Automated Finger Printing System to step up cross-border cooperation in relation to terrorism, crime and illegal immigration, and <\/p><p>-  implementation of the Schengen Information System, which is planned to be ready for evaluation by the EU Commission by mid 2019, and which will enable the rapid dissemination of information pertaining to terrorist threats and other subversive  and non-subversive crime types across members states of the European Union.  <\/p><p>The Government is highly supportive of these initiatives and this is underpinned by significant Government investment under the Capital Plan of some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600031#WRDD01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Reorganisation","counter":1559,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600031#WRDD01500"},{"type":"question","counter":1560,"qnumday":556,"qnumall":"[36097\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600031#WRDD01600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the establishment by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of protective service units in each region; the number in place and the regions in which they are located","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1561,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and Units and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to supporting this strategy, and in March 2015 a number of Garda units were brought together to leverage their experience and expertise in investigating serious crimes against the person including sexual offences to form the Garda National Protective Services Bureau (GNPSB) led by a Chief Superintendent. <\/p>  <p>  The GNPSB is a specialist team dedicated to making sure each and every complaint relating to child protection, human trafficking, domestic and sexual violence is thoroughly investigated and handled correctly.

This is an essential feature of the strong community policing ethos which has long been central to policing in this jurisdiction.  The Deputy will be aware that as part of the overall strategy to oppose criminality, the Garda authorities pursue a range of partnerships with community stakeholders for example, the well established Community Alert Programme and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme to name but a few.  I have sought a report from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the number now in place, and their location, and I will contact the Deputy again when this information is to hand.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. <\/p>  <p>  Underpinning all of these measures is the Government's ongoing commitment to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The Government plans to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan which is in train within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Programme has been formed based on recommendations made in 44 reports, both internal and external, developed over the preceding ten years as well as extended periods of consultation and workshops with senior leadership within the organisation.  The MRP aims to deliver on its objective through the realisation of a number of key outcomes described in detail throughout the chapters of the Programme launch document.  The Strategic Transformation Office (STO) has been established to oversee governance and delivery of the projects that form the MRP.<\/p>  <p>  With more than 80 initiatives and 135 projects, the MRP will strengthen the service An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides and ensure that they can deal with any emerging issues into the future.  Due to the scale of the programme, a phased planning approach is essential; some initiatives will be implemented in the short to medium term, while others will require a number of years to implement fully.  Given the highly complex nature of the MRP, timelines for projects may move for a number of reasons including extended scope or procurement phase, unforeseen delays to risks or issues or changes to the strategic priorities of the organisation. <\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na works closely with my Department and the DPP, Irish Prison Service and Probation Service to tackle crime and reduce reoffending rates.  I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will use Offender and Case Management programmes, in conjunction with the Courts, Probation Service, HSE and TUSLA, to manage prolific and high risk offenders in the community to reduce re-offending. <\/p>  <p>  The Offender Management initiative under the MRP is currently comprised of two projects, namely JARC and SAOR.<\/p>  <p>  -  JARC is a Joint Agency Approach to Crime  where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prisons Service and the Probation Service work together to move repeat offenders  away from crime.  The implementation of this project under the MRP will further develop and implement operational processes to manage nominated prolific offenders in co-operation with these agencies<\/p>  <p>  -  SAOR is a Strategic Approach to Offender Recidivism which aims to reduce recidivism through the training of Case Managers for the organisation.  Successful implementation of this project will ensure the effective management and implementation of case managers and improved inter agency co-operation.<\/p>  <p>  The above programmes will continue to be rolled out throughout 2017. The various programmes within JARC are in an evaluation process and it is expected that the  evaluations of the three initial programmes will be completed before the end of this year. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, a Youth JARC project was initiated earlier this year which looks at the most prolific offenders aged between 16-21 and is being piloted in Blanchardstown and in Mayfield and Gurranabraher in Cork.  The selection process of the first youths for the project is under way at present.  The aim of the project, like the adult JARC, is to take a multi-agency approach to intervening in order to reduce their level of offending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600031#WRDD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":1575,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600031#WRDD03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1576,"qnumday":562,"qnumall":"[36122\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600031#WRDD03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"his plans for the reopening of the closed Garda stations in Donegal in view of the Government&rsquo;s decision to reopen a Garda station in south County Dublin recently; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1289","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1577,"content":"<p>The Deputy will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is primarily responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I, as Minister, have no role in the matter.

I am informed by the Garda authorities that the closures have allowed front line Garda to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility and in a more focused fashion particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Programme for a Partnership Government, the Government is committed to launching a pilot scheme to reopen six Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.  At its meeting on 13 June 2017, the Government noted the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s interim Report which analysed population and crime trends and, taking account of the availability of stations for reuse, makes a number of recommendations including that Stepaside Station in County Dublin be reopened on a pilot basis.  The report also indicates that the Commissioner is likely, subject to further analysis, to recommend the reopening of Leighlinbridge, County Carlow and Donard, County Wicklow in her final report.  If a second station is to be reopened in Dublin, the Commissioner has indicated that, subject to further analysis, the former station at Rush, County Dublin will be recommended for reopening. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has, accordingly, agreed in principle to the reopening of Stepaside Garda Station on a pilot basis as soon as any necessary preparatory works have been completed and the Commissioner&rsquo;s final recommendation in relation to Rush, Leighlinbridge and Donard Garda Stations is expected to be received shortly.  <\/p>  <p>  Following any decision to reopen the former stations, the Garda authorities will work closely with the Office of Public Works in relation to any necessary preparatory works required to progress the reopenings.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate is, at the request of the Policing Authority, examining the dispersal and use of resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities with a view to making recommendations to provide a more effective, visible and responsive policing service.

The programme, which mirrors many of the actions set out in the Civil Service Renewal Plan, covers areas such as culture; leadership and structure; audit and risk management; corporate functions and IT systems; and external benchmarks. <\/p><p>Significant progress has been made in implementing these recommendations as outlined below and the work of embedding and sustaining the changes continues to be prioritised in my Department.  Regular updates have been published on my Department's website.  The following recommendations have been implemented in the Department: <\/p><p>-  The Department&rsquo;s Management Advisory Committee was reconstituted as a Management Board, new personnel were appointed, both from within the Department and externally, and lateral mobility put into effect.  A new Deputy Secretary post was created in April 2015 to provide more cohesive leadership across the criminal justice portfolio and a Secretary General was permanently appointed in October 2016.  Both I and the Minister of State for Equality, Immigration and integration meet on a monthly basis with the full Management Board.<\/p><p>-  Following consultation with staff and stakeholders, a Culture and Values Charter was published in 2016 with the objective of fostering a more open, listening organisational culture. These values have been signed off by the Department's leadership team and are fed into all induction and leadership training with a view to informing the way in which the Department communicates with staff and stakeholders.  It is recognised that changes to organisational culture takes sustained effort over time and a cross grade team, led by the Secretary General, is working to ensure that this continues to be embedded in the organisation.<\/p><p>-  Robust supporting processes have been put in place to enhance leadership and oversight of the Department and wider sector and to facilitate more effective management and governance of the strategic objectives. A Corporate Governance Framework for the Department was published in April 2016.  Since 2015 an annual Strategic Implementation Plan has been published, which draws together in one single plan all of the strategic priorities across the Department. To support the Management Board in its oversight of this programme, a programme management reporting system has been implemented, providing the Management Board with information and status updates on strategic actions across all of the Department's programmes; In addition, progress reports are published on the Department's website.<\/p><p>-  Risk management processes have been significantly strengthened and the Department's Audit Committee which has a majority of external members has reviewed its processes in line with the recommendations. <\/p><p>-  Since March 2014, the Department has also put in place revised systems and procedures to ensure all correspondence is handled appropriately which specifies that high-priority correspondence is brought to the attention of both myself and relevant officials and followed up in a timely manner.<\/p><p>-  The Report made several recommendations regarding relationship management and oversight of Agencies, all of which have been implemented. Agency performance and governance arrangements have been formalised and strengthened through formal Oversight\/Performance\/Service Delivery Agreements and Frameworks<b><\/b>agreed with 24 key agencies including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In addition, as the Deputy is aware, the Policing Authority was established in January 2016 to bring a new and dedicated layer of public accountability to the administration of policing services and provide additional impetus to drive necessary changes in the policing system and its practices. <\/p><p>-  Formal structures have been put in place to support communication and collaboration with the agencies in the Justice and Equality sector: the Civil Agencies Network covers a range of diverse agencies and meets quarterly to share information and best practise while the Criminal Justice Strategic Committee comprising the heads of all the relevant agencies was established in 2015.  The Strategic Committee also meets quarterly and is driving effective collaboration through a detailed work-plan on a range of shared interests from international cooperation, data needs and interoperability to leadership development and victims services.<\/p><p>-  A programme of work in regard to Data and Information has been developed and is being taken forward in cooperation with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, including a system providing real time support to the front-line Joint Agency Response to Crime (JARC) programme, the rollout of an e-Submissions system and the development of the Justice and Equality Hub, to facilitate better collaboration and information sharing between the Department and its stakeholders and the provision of data and management information to support the development of more evidence based policy.<\/p><p>-  Several of the Review Group's recommendations related to Human Resources management and the Department held an open competition last year to appoint a professional Head of Strategic Human Resources.  Following this appointment, a three year workforce plan has been developed which directly supports the Department&rsquo;s 2016-19 Strategy and informs recruitment and deployment of available resources to effectively deliver on the Department's business objectives as well as identifying training needs.  The 2017 training plan includes risk management, customer service, leadership development and performance management.  The Department is also developing its HR capacity, including the recent implementation of a business partner model to try to ensure that the business needs, including managed mobility and succession planning, are being met by HR.  A HR strategy is being prepared which will build on the changes implemented since the Toland Report and which will reflect the internal Change Programme, the forthcoming Civil Service HR strategy and public service reform.<\/p><p>-  A Head of Communications was appointed and a strategy covering internal and external communications in support of the change programme was published in 2016.<\/p><p>-  New structured governance arrangements with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have also been introduced.  A Governance Framework Document is in place which makes provision, amongst other things, for regular meetings involving my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority.  Officials also meet monthly with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to oversee progress on strategic and resource matters.  In addition, arrangements are in place for quarterly meetings involving the Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Policing Authority in the context of the Authority's statutory functions in relation to advising the Minister with regard to Garda resources.<\/p><p>In terms of recommendations not yet implemented, the Review Group recommended the development of a HR strategy which is in preparation in parallel with the overall Civil Service HR Strategy as mentioned above.  It also recommended changes to the Department&rsquo;s structure but was not definitive on the detail of this.  The Department&rsquo;s structure has been reviewed in recent months and a number of options for structural changes are under consideration.  Given the need to deal with a considerable workload on hand, it is envisaged that structural change will be implemented on a phased basis, commencing in Quarter 4 this year. It should be noted that despite concerns expressed by the Review Group about the breadth of its responsibilities, my Department's remit continued to expand significantly in recent years with responsibility assigned in 2015 for additional agencies including the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland.  In addition the Charities Regulator, the Policing Authority and the Legal Services Regulatory Authority have all been established in recent years.<\/p><p>In addition to the ongoing reforms in the policing area, achieving better collaborative practice and parallel to implementing the major change programme, the Deputy will be aware of the volume of work delivered over the past 3 years on the Department's business agenda across very significant areas of public life. Major achievements include the Children and Family Relationship Act 2015, the Marriage Equality Referendum, International Protection Act 2015 incorporating a single applications procedure and implementation of the McMahon report recommendations, progressing the implementation of the EU Victims Directive, establishment of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) to meet Ireland&rsquo;s international humanitarian obligations, amongst many others.<\/p><p>Finally, I should add that my Department is taking stock of the change programme to assess progress to date and to identify priorities for the next phase of improvement to ensure the measures outlined above are embedded and sustained and the drive for continuous improvement is maintained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600031#WRDD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1581,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600031#WRDD03700"},{"type":"question","counter":1582,"qnumday":564,"qnumall":"[36161\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600031#WRDD03800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the details of each body or organisation that is scheduled to receive in excess of &euro;1 million from his Department's Vote of expenditure or the group of Votes of expenditure connected with his Department in 2017 for the provision of services by the body or the organisation concerned; the amount involved in each case; if there is a signed service level agreement in place in respect of the services to be carried out by these bodies or organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1583,"content":"<p>The information requested is being compiled and verified in my Department.

A copy is reproduced below for reference.  <\/p><p><i><\/i>I am informed that the queues to which the Deputy refers do not arise as a result of the operation of immigration controls at Dublin Airport but are rather a consequence of other factors outside the control of the service.  As regards throughput generally for incoming passengers to Dublin Airport, information supplied by the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) in relation to queue times for arriving passengers at the Airport shows that over 90% of all travellers are processed through immigration control in a matter of minutes, with the percentage figure being even higher for passengers of EU nationalities.  This is in the context of passenger numbers at Dublin Airport reaching record levels last year with almost 28 million passengers using the Airport.<\/p><p>However, there are specific pressure points outside of the control of the immigration authorities that can create some delay.  Typically, this arises when a very high number of flights arrive within a specific time period (which happens at Terminal 1 in the late evening period) and the consequent increased passenger numbers within these peak times, can impact on queuing times over these periods.  This situation is compounded when, in addition to scheduled arrivals, delayed flights also land during these peak periods.<\/p><p>Additional staff have been recruited for the Airport and the allocation of immigration personnel is designed to have the maximum number of staff on duty during these peak periods so that all available immigration booths are operational at these times.  The number of available booths is a function of the physical infrastructure at the Terminal.  Every effort is made by immigration officers to exercise their function as speedily as possible consistent with the requirement to protect our borders and facilitate legitimate travellers.<\/p><p>While the immigration authorities at Dublin Airport have no control over the number of flights or their arrival times, they have an excellent relationship with the Dublin Airport Authority and air carriers and work closely together across a number of fronts to address capacity and queue management issues where they arise, to alleviate congestion and maximise passenger throughput thus ensuring that waiting times are kept to a minimum.<\/p><p>I might add that a procurement exercise has been recently completed for the deployment of a permanent electronic-Gate facility at Dublin Airpor<b>t.  <\/b>The new electronic Gates are expected to be available for use by passengers in the Autumn.  However, while the introduction of the electronic gates should contribute overall to increased immigration processing capacity, the facility is primarily an immigration control facility rather than a queue management tool aimed at addressing spikes in passenger arrivals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600032#WREE05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":1635,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600032#WREE05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1636,"qnumday":591,"qnumall":"[36600\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600032#WREE05300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the Garda numbers for each of the Garda districts in a Galway city and county in each of the years 2000 to 2015, respectively; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1637,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.

Furthermore when allocations are taking place comprehensive consultation is carried out with local management during which all factors are taken into consideration.  Where a deficiency in resources is identified the matter is considered fully and addressed accordingly.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p>  <p>  I have been informed that the number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Galway Division on the 30 June 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 571 with 32 Garda Reserves and 46 civilians.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p>  <p>  This plan is progressing apace.

I am also informed that a further 400 Garda recruits are scheduled to attest later this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end - an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.

The Court itself recognises the complexities around this issue in that it acknowledges the Executive function in not only controlling who should enter the State but also to regulate the activities of non-citizens while in the State and has had to consider the distinctions of rights between citizens and non-citizens in the context of Article 40.1 of the Constitution.  It has concluded that in an international protection system with no temporal limit on the decision making process, an absolute prohibition on the right to work is contrary to the right to seek employment under the Constitution.  The Court recognises that this is a matter for the Executive and Legislature to consider and accordingly has adjourned consideration of the Order the Court should make for a period of six months.  The State will make submissions to the Court in relation to the format of the Order of the Court is to make at the appropriate time.  In the interim, the legal status as regards access to the labour market for international protection applicants remains unchanged, as set out in Section 16(3)(b) of the International Protection Act 2015.  The final report on the implementation of the MacMahon Report which sets out in detail that 98% of the recommendations are fully or partially implemented reflects the judgement's impact on the area of right to work.<\/p>  <p>  One of the principal recommendations of the MacMahon Report was to implement a new single application procedure.  The aim of the International Protection Act 2015, which was commenced at the end of last year, is to process cases as quickly as possible so that in due course as cases on hand are cleared, persons in need of international protection are granted status quickly, thereby giving those who qualify an automatic right to work. In many EU Member States, the right to work is not an unfettered right, often arising after a particular period of time - usually 9 months to a year - and in many instances may be limited to particular job categories, the withdrawal of other financial supports, etc.  All of these matters are being carefully considered as to their impact and to reflect the existing requirements  placed on those who come to Ireland as lawful economic migrants, by an inter-Departmental Taskforce which will report back to Government in the Autumn.<\/p>  <p>  The judgement has significant legal, economic, policy and operational considerations, many of which impact across a range of Government Departments and services.  For this reason, a whole of Government approach has been adopted to examine the implications of the judgment and to propose appropriate solutions as quickly as possible.  The Taskforce, appointed by Government, will examine all of the available legal options to comply with the judgment, including the possibility of an opt-in to the recast Reception Conditions Directive (2013\/33\/EU).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600033#WRFF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Expenditure","counter":1651,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600033#WRFF01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1652,"qnumday":596,"qnumall":"[36662\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600033#WRFF01500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 57 of 1 June 2017, if he will supply the details of the costs associated to the contracts awarded to a company (details supplied) since 2011 by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1653,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner is the accounting officer for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote. <\/p><p>I have asked the Garda Commissioner for the specific information requested and when it is to hand I will inform the Deputy accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600033#WRFF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":1655,"qnumday":597,"qnumall":"[36663\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600033#WRFF01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 86 of 12 April 2017, if he will seek an answer from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relating to the cost of all Garda overtime and the overtime hours claimed for each of the years 2012 to 2016, respectively; and the checks in place to ensure garda&iacute; have completed overtime claimed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1355","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1656,"content":"<p>I would inform the Deputy that, by letter of 21 April 2017, the T&aacute;naiste provided him with the information sought in Parliamentary Question No. 86 of 12 April 2017.

A person may be refused permission to enter the State based on one or more of these grounds. Immigration officers are required to provide a written notice to the person refused entry that sets out the reasons for the decision.  In all cases, removals from the State are conducted in accordance with the law.  Translation facilities are available where necessary.   An immigration officer before confirming a decision to refuse permission will consult with his or her Supervisor.<\/p>  <p>  Section 5 of the Immigration Act 2003 (as amended by the International Protection Act, 2015), contains the main provisions dealing with the removal from the State of persons refused leave to land and specifies that a person to whom this section applies may be arrested by an immigration officer or a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and detained in a prescribed place of detention for the purpose of facilitating their removal from the State, which must be as soon as is practicable.  It is the practice to remove persons from the State on the next available flight.  Arrest, detention and removals from the State are essentially operational matters for the Garda National Immigration Bureau who work closely with civilian immigration officers on these matters.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to Brazilian nationals, they are not subject to any Irish entry visa requirement.  However, every non-national (whether visa required or not) coming by air or sea from a place outside the State is required, on arrival in the State, to present himself or herself to an immigration officer and apply for permission to enter the State.  The immigration officer will make all necessary enquiries and checks to ensure that the person meets the entry requirements for the intended purpose of stay.<\/p>  <p>  More generally Ireland operates a fair, secure and effective immigration system, and indeed, the Irish immigration system is one of the least burdensome for visitors. Immigration officers respect the dignity of all persons they engage with and carry out their functions with professionalism and care.  It is equally expected that persons seeking entry to the State provide accurate and full information as to the purpose of their entry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600033#WRFF02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Deportation Orders","counter":1660,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600033#WRFF02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1661,"qnumday":599,"qnumall":"[36666\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600033#WRFF02400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when he expects an appropriate facility for persons awaiting deportation will be completed in Dublin airport.","asker":"1257","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1662,"content":"<p>The development phase of a project, which is under the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and delivered in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, is due to commence at Dublin Airport in September, 2017.

Thus, naming the hospitals and maternity units where such events occurred would not meet the Data Protection standards required for protection of otherwise identifiable patient information (Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, Section 5(h)); such statistics are not, therefore, publicly available.<\/p><p>The Deputy may wish to note updated statistical information published by MDE Ireland for December 2016: <\/p><p>'For the years 2012-2014, a total of 22 maternal deaths, occurring during or within 42 days of pregnancy end, were identified by MDE Ireland.  Of these 22 deaths, 20 were classified as direct or indirect maternal deaths among 204,999 maternities, giving a maternal mortality rate (MMR) of 9.8 per 100,000 maternities.  A further 2 maternal deaths were attributed to coincidental cases'.  <\/p><p>Per MDE Ireland, classification of maternal deaths for the triennium 2012-2014 has now been compiled in line with the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidance on classification of maternal moratality, (ICD-MM, WHO 2012)  'in recognition of the importance of maternal suicide and its direct link to pregnancy'.  This reclassification has resulted in a change in the ratios of direct and indirect maternal deaths in this period compared to the previous classification system, the UK Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths (CEMD) which used a disease based classification system but no change in the overall statistics.  The Deputy will find further detail at the following link:<i>.<\/i><\/p><p>A maternal death is classified as a Serious Reportable Event (SRE) and as such must be reported through the national Incident management System (NIMS) within 24 hours, investigations commenced within 48 hours of the organisation becoming aware of the incident, and investigations completed within four months of commencement.  I understand that maternal deaths are reported to the Coroner a a 'rule of practice'.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive (HSE) Irish Maternity Indicator System (IMIS) second National Report (2015), published in October 2016, provides national results for 30 metrics from all public maternity units and hospitals for 2015.  Senior managers in hospitals are now using IMIS to monitor and manage their hospital activities and continue to take measures to improve the quality of their data and their data collection and reporting processes as well as measures to improve the quality of care delivered.  It is the intention this year, following a review of IMIS in collaboration with staff in the maternity units, to refine definitions of the existing metrics and extend the range of these measurements.  IMIS data is also being used to populate the monthly Maternity Patient Safety Statements, as recommended by the Chief Medical Officer's 2014 Report into perinatal deaths at Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  The IMIS information system supercedes earlier annual reporting as referenced by the Deputy. <\/p><p>The Government is committed to the progressive development of maternity services.  In 2016, Ireland&rsquo;s first National Maternity Strategy was published, followed by the HSE&rsquo;s National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death and HIQA&rsquo;s National Standards for Safer Better Maternity Services.  In 2017, a National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme has been established within the HSE to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services across primary, community and acute care. <\/p><p>The safety of all users of our maternity services is of paramount importance.  The above initiatives and ongoing developments represent key building blocks to facilitate the provision of a consistently safe and high quality maternity service.<\/p><p>Finally, in relation to the publication of individual maternity unit reports I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600035#WRHH05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Data","counter":1812,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600035#WRHH05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1813,"qnumday":651,"qnumall":"[34910\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600035#WRHH05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to reduce the number of GP's availing of the medical card or GP visitor card scheme in Strokestown, Elphin and Ballaghadereen to one doctor per town; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1814,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600035#WRHH05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospitals Discharges","counter":1815,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600035#WRHH05600"},{"type":"question","counter":1816,"qnumday":652,"qnumall":"[34914\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600035#WRHH05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the case of a person (details supplied); the steps being taken to address the crisis that has arisen; when the person can expect to be discharged; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1817,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600035#WRHH05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Patient Data","counter":1818,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600035#WRHH05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1819,"qnumday":653,"qnumall":"[34915\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600035#WRHH06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons in the psychiatric department at University Hospital Galway that are medically fit for discharge but cannot be discharged for reasons external to the hospital, including the absence of appropriate accommodation; the reasons for preventing discharge; the steps being taken to solve these difficulties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1820,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600035#WRHH06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1822,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600036#WRJJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1823,"qnumday":654,"qnumall":"[34919\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600036#WRJJ00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) that was assessed for a serious back problem in 2014 will be called for surgery.","asker":"1268","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1824,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

During 2016, the Department of Health convened a cross-sectoral Steering Group to begin work on the development of this Framework. <\/p>  <p>  Work on the draft framework is well advanced and a stakeholder consultation process on the draft commenced in June.  It is anticipated that the finalised framework, and an associated high-level implementation plan, will be submitted to the Minister for Health in September 2017. <\/p>  <p>  Recruitment of nurses and midwives is challenging in rural and urban areas at present due to a range of factors, including an international shortage and intense global competition.  Under proposals formulated at the WRC between this Department, DPER, the HSE, the INMO and SIPTU in February and March this year it was agreed that management would increase the HSE&rsquo;s National Workforce Plan for nurses and midwives in 2017 through a broad range of initiatives that will result in the delivery of 1,208 additional permanent posts.  These initiatives include  the conversion of agency employed staff into HSE direct employees and offering all graduating nurses and midwives full time contracts.  Other key measures agreed to support recruitment and retention include maternity leave cover; a career break scheme; 130 additional undergraduate places in 2017; enhanced rates of pay for retirees who return to work and offering nurses and midwives improved educational opportunities and career pathways.  Recruitment measures include careers days, HSE attendance at national and international recruitment fairs, and a communication from the National Director for HR to all Nursing and Midwifery Graduates.<\/p>  <p>  There has been significant improvements in the numbers employed in the public health service in the past three years, including nursing in the Dublin North East Hospital Group.

Similarly, the number of consultants has increased nationally from 2,587 in June 2014 to 2,883 in June 2017, while the number of NCHDs has increased from 4,943 to 6,058.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600036#WRJJ03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Care Services Provision","counter":1854,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600036#WRJJ03400"},{"type":"question","counter":1855,"qnumday":664,"qnumall":"[34962\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600036#WRJJ03500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason no supports are being given to persons (details supplied).

For that reason, developing a new statutory scheme will be an important step in ensuring that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home care services.  It will also help to improve access to the home care services that people need, in an affordable and sustainable way.  The system of regulation for home care will help to ensure that the public can be confident that the services provided are of a high standard.<\/p><p>As an initial step, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake an evidence review of the home care systems that are in place in four other European countries.  This review was published on 11 April.  The Review will help us to learn from the experiences of other jurisdictions and will inform the debate and future consideration of approaches to formal home care financing and regulation here in Ireland.<\/p><p>Another important step in this process is the public consultation on home care services which I, along with Minister Harris, launched on 6 July.  The purpose of this consultation is to allow all those who have views on this topic to have their say, including older people themselves, their families, and healthcare workers.

The HSE works alongside the Irish College of General Practitioners in actively recruiting and training GP trainees.  At present, GP training is delivered by 14 separate GP training programmes throughout the country.  GP training programmes are of 4 years duration and all trainees are required to complete 2 years in a hospital setting and 2 years in general practice with a GP trainer.<\/p><p>It would not be possible to increase the number of training places this year on the scale suggested by the Deputy for a number of reasons.  Firstly, the candidate selection process for 2017 has been completed and the programme commenced earlier this month.  To facilitate such an increase it would be also be necessary to recruit and train additional GP trainers and provide additional doctor training posts in the hospital setting.  Instead, the aim is to increase the number of GP training places on an incremental basis over <\/p><p>The annual number of training places available has been increased from 120 in 2009 to 170 in 2017. The Government is committed to further increasing this number in future years.<\/p><p>In relation to costs, year 1 and year 2 of training, GP trainees are based in acute hospitals and fill vacancies at Senior House Officer (SHO) level.  The cost for the 1<sup>st<\/sup>and 2<sup>nd<\/sup>years of training when trainees are based in hospitals is approximately &euro;100,000 per trainee per annum.  The cost for the 3<sup>rd<\/sup>and 4<sup>th<\/sup>years of training when trainees are based in the GP practices in the community is approximately &euro;110,000 per trainee per annum.  The overall cost of expanding GP training by a further 200 places would also depend on the cost of various training inputs required. The Department does not hold that specific data.<\/p><p>In 2016 the HSE and the ICGP agreed in principle to transfer operational responsibility for GP training from the HSE to the ICGP and to restructure the organisation of training programmes so as to maximise efficiency and provide a basis for further expansion.  Significant progress has been made in advancing implementation of these changes, though some practical matters are still in the process of being resolved by the HSE and the ICGP.  This transfer would also likely have implications on the average cost of GP training per trainee per annum.<\/p><p>Officials from my Department and the HSE are working closely with the ICGP to put in place arrangements which will ensure that the future GP workforce needs, including GP training are met.

I look forward to constructive and positive engagements with a view to achieving a satisfactory outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600041#WROO04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":2123,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600041#WROO04300"},{"type":"question","counter":2124,"qnumday":768,"qnumall":"[35319\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600041#WROO04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if all ambulances have satnav systems fitted; if not, the reason therefore; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1232","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2125,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600041#WROO04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Newborn Screening Cards","counter":2126,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600041#WROO04600"},{"type":"question","counter":2127,"qnumday":769,"qnumall":"[35320\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600041#WROO04700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans further to the report on the newborn screening card archive forum; the position regarding the next steps in the process in dealing with the so called Guthrie cards and data protection; the timeframe for same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":2128,"qnumday":770,"qnumall":"[35321\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600041#WROO04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current policy for the retention of newborn screening cards; his plans to change this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2129,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 769 and 770 together.<\/p>  <p>  In late 2009, a complaint was made to the Data Protection Commissioner regarding the indefinite retention of the Newborn Screening Cards (the cards) without consent, which constituted a breach of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. The complaint was upheld by the Commissioner, who ruled that the Newborn Screening Card archive be destroyed.  A policy was developed to address both the legal and ethical requirements of the National Newborn Bloodspot Screening Programme (the programme).<\/p>  <p>  The policy required changes to the programme including retention of the cards for 10 years with consent; and that cards older than 10 years would be destroyed (disposed of in the child&rsquo;s 11th year). This policy was implemented on 1 July 2011, and provides that parent(s)\/guardian(s) are given an information leaflet regarding the programme.<\/p>  <p>  At the time the blood sample is taken (heal prick test), the parent\/guardian gives explicit written consent confirming that she\/he has received the Parent Information Leaflet; verifies that the details for the baby on the card are correct; consents to the baby being screened and that during the retention period, the card can only be used:<\/p>  <p>  i) to check the baby&rsquo;s results;<\/p>  <p>  ii)  for other tests recommended by the child&rsquo;s doctor, for which the parent(s) permission will be sought;<\/p>  <p>  iii) for quality assurance to develop and improve the screening programme and the health of babies and families in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The agreed policy also required that cards older than 10 years would be disposed of.<\/p>  <p>  The State remains in breach of both European Union and national data protection legislation in relation to the retention of the cards without consent. The primary intention of the programme is to screen all newborn infants in the State for six conditions and has an uptake of 99.9%. As the most successful public health initiative, it is in the public interest that this level of uptake continues and that public trust and confidence in the programme is neither compromised nor undermined in any way. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health hosted the Forum in October 2016 to provide participants from a broad range of areas with the opportunity to engage in dialogue with international experts regarding the retention and possible secondary uses, including research using cards from the archive and in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The themes in the Forum report together with international evidence are being considered by officials in my Department to inform policy options to seal the outstanding breach of the Data Protection legislation regarding the cards retained without consent and to provide prospectively for the future retention, storage and potential secondary uses of the cards.

The HSE, based on the demographic profile of current GMS GPs, expects that approximately 157 GPs may retire on age grounds between 2017 and 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practicing GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible\/shared GMS\/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of enhanced supports for rural GP practices.

By May 2017, the HSE had delivered a total of 217 dementia-specific intensive homecare packages at an average cost of &euro;953 per week.  There are currently 122 people with dementia in receipt of an Intensive Home Care Package with a further 16 approved and 12 applications in progress.  In addition to the Intensive Home Care Packages the HSE has continued to provide mainstream home help and routine Home Care packages to people with dementia whose needs have been assessed as requiring these supports and within available resources. Up to 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from Intensive Home Care Packages over the lifetime of the implementation programme. <\/p>  <p>  It is Government policy that, wherever possible and appropriate, people should be cared for in their own homes and communities, and the National Dementia Strategy specifically restates this commitment to those living with dementia. <\/p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are working on a mid-term review of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy which will be published in the Autumn and will identify the achievements so far and set out the further work that is required to implement the Strategy over the next 12 months and beyond.  The resources required for the ongoing implementation of the Strategy can only be considered in the context of the Estimates and Budget process.  The mid-term review will assist in identifying further actions required and will be helpful in the context of budgetary considerations. <\/p>  <p>  I confirm receipt of the organisation's pre-budget submission to my Department.

There is emerging evidence that this can be applied to support a wide range of medical conditions including mental health, care of the elderly and other chronic conditions that require constant monitoring.  This can be beneficial where care is required in remote locations.  Teleconsultations can have benefits for patients with a known relationship with their GPs and many practitioners consult for follow-up or triage with their own patients by phone or text at present.  However, teleconsultations could pose risks for those patients who have not been evaluated and examined in a face-to-face manner. <\/p>  <p>  The eHealth strategy envisages providing the necessary technology and infrastructure to support the wider use of telemedicine where clinicians and health care providers can support the business need.  There are no plans at present to include teleconsultations under the current medical card or GP visit card schemes.  While teleconsultation services are being provided by some practitioners, these are being implemented on a pilot basis.  The widespread deployment of teleconsultations in primary and other care settings will need evaluation in terms of patient safety, clinical effectiveness and cost in order to ensure public policy goals are being met.  There will also be a need for guidance and clinical protocols around the appropriate use of teleconsultations to be developed as well as retraining and education of staff and patients. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the GP Out-of-Hours services, a national review of the current services is currently underway and is expected to be completed shortly.

The next phase of engagement on a new GP contract has commenced and I look forward to constructive and positive engagement in the months ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600042#WRPP04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Strategies","counter":2176,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600042#WRPP04100"},{"type":"question","counter":2177,"qnumday":787,"qnumall":"[35350\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600042#WRPP04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress made to date on the eHealth Strategy for Ireland, specifically with regard to teleconsultations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2178,"content":"<p>The Departments eHealth Strategy for Ireland outlined the case for better deployment and use of ICT in the health sector.

The HSE has not formally wrote to me or the Department yet in relation to resource requirements.  However, following my appointment as Minister of State for Mental Health and Older People I have met and been briefed by officials from both the Department and the HSE on relevant issues including in particular the demand for the home care which continues to grow in parallel with the increasing numbers of older people.  In the context of these discussions the HSE provided an outline of requirements.  The HSE will be engaging further on these issues with my Department over the coming months in the context of the budget process.<\/p><p>The overall funding for Services for Older People is &euro;765 million in 2017 with &euro;367m for direct funding of Home Help and Home Care Packages.  A further &euro;9m supported by HSE and Atlantic Philanthropies will provide Intensive Home Care Packages (IHCPs) for people with more complex needs.  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2017 provides for a target of 10.57 million Home Help Hours to support about 49,000 people, 16,750<b><\/b>Home Care Packages<b><\/b>and<b><\/b>190<b><\/b>Intensive Home Care Packages for clients with complex needs including <b>60 <\/b>clients with dementia supported with co-funding from Atlantic Philanthropies under the Irish National Dementia Strategy.  This represents a significant increase on home care in comparison to last year&rsquo;s Service Plan, which had an original target of 10.4 million hours home help and 15,450 Home Care Packages.<\/p><p>Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for Home Care continues to grow.  It is important to note that the allocation of funding for home care across the system, though significant, is finite and services must therefore be delivered within the funding available.  The level of activity and associated costs must be managed in a way that ensures that those with the greatest needs are supported and that the overall expenditure on home care services by the HSE does not exceed the available funding.<\/p><p>The Programme for Government commits to increasing funding for Home Care Packages and Home Help every year.  The planning and management of future health expenditure will be considered as part of the annual estimates and budgetary process which seeks to balance available funding across all of the various service areas to achieve the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of service users and prioritise areas of greatest need.<\/p><p>Finally I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to promoting care in the community for older people so that they can continue to live in their own homes for as long as possible.  On 6 July Minister Harris and I announced the opening of a public consultation on home care services.  The purpose of this consultation is to allow all those who have views on this topic to have their say, including older people themselves, their families, and healthcare workers.  The Department wants to find out what people think about current home care services and would also like to hear the public&rsquo;s views on what the future scheme should look like.  I strongly urge all those with an interest in home care services to make a submission to the consultation.  The consultation is an important step to inform the development of a Statutory Scheme for homecare, which is being prioritised by my Department.  The development of such a Scheme will improve the operation of the homecare system and access to services that people need in an affordable and sustainable way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600045#WRSS01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Funding","counter":2319,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600045#WRSS01900"},{"type":"question","counter":2320,"qnumday":839,"qnumall":"[35563\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600045#WRSS02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the HSE has written to him or his officials regarding the lack of funding to meet the extra demand in health services particularly in acute hospital services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2321,"content":"<p>My Department is in regular communication and continues to work closely with the HSE regarding delivery of the National Service Plan 2017, and planning for 2018.

The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services will be a key element in facilitating this process.<\/p>  <p>  The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions.  A new contract should be flexible and be able to respond to the changing nature of the GP workforce.

According to the manufacturer&rsquo;s website &ldquo;Epidiolex development is initially concentrating on severe, orphan, early-onset, treatment-resistant epilepsy syndromes including Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and Infantile Spasms (IS)&rdquo;.<\/p><p>Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the market the manufacturer must seek an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), or in the case of certain medicines, the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  To my knowledge, no application for a marketing authorisation for Epidiolex has yet been submitted by the product manufacturer GW Pharmaceuticals to either the HPRA or the EMA.<\/p><p>In February I published the HPRA report &lsquo;Cannabis for Medical Use - A Scientific Review&rsquo;, on foot of which I committed to the implementation of a Cannabis for Medical Use Access Programme, in line with the HPRA&rsquo;s recommendations.  In March I established the Cannabis for Medical Use Expert Reference Group to advise on the development of the Access Programme.  The Expert Group is chaired by Dr Mair&iacute;n Ryan, Director of Health Technology Assessment at the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), and comprises representation from the areas of oncology, palliative care, anaesthesiology, general practice, adult neurology, paediatric neurology, multiple sclerosis, psychiatry, pharmacy, patients, and ethics as well as representatives from HIQA&rsquo;s Health Technology Assessment Directorate, the HPRA, the National Medicines Information Centre and the Department of Health. <\/p><p>The Expert Group is tasked with the development of operational guidance for healthcare professionals treating patients through the Access Programme.  A critical requirement for the successful establishment of a Cannabis for Medical Use Access Programme is meaningful engagement with representative bodies, clinicians, patients, and pharmacists so that these groups are integral to the drafting of operational clinical guidance.<\/p><p>The draft Clinical Guidance on the Medical Use of Cannabis developed by the Expert Group is out for consultation.  The clinical guidance will include the forms of medicinal cannabis that will be permitted for use under the access programme and will outline the requirements for education of healthcare professionals and patients, as well as ethical implications of such a scheme.  The systematic process employed to develop this guidance is based on the National Standards for Clinical Practice Guidance Development.  This work will take a number of months to complete.<\/p><p>It is important to draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland (RCPI) statement, released in March 2017, on the use of cannabis products in the treatment of severe epilepsy in children and adults.  In this statement the consultants involved in the treatment of epilepsy state that <i>&quot;currently the main barrier to the prescribing of cannabis derivatives for epilepsy is the lack of clinical evidence of its long-term efficacy, as well as lack of data on long-term side effects.&rdquo;<\/i>The position of the RCPI further demonstrates the importance of any discussions relating to a patient&rsquo;s care being conducted in the clinical setting in consultation with the expert clinicians, the patient and their family. <\/p><p>It is the professional decision of the clinician, in consultation with their patient, to prescribe or not prescribe any particular treatment for a patient under their care.  The independence of the doctor-patient relationship is a fundamental principle upon which medical practice is based.

The Chief Medical Officer has advised that the granting of such a licence must be premised on an appropriate application being submitted to the Department of Health, which is endorsed by a consultant who is responsible for the management of the patient and who is prepared to monitor the effects of the treatment over time.  The Minister for Health has no role in the clinical decision-making process.  <\/p>  <p>  A licence application endorsed by the patient&rsquo;s medical consultant and submitted under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, use must include:<\/p>  <p>  - an outline of the treatment the patient has received to date and justification from the doctor as to why it is appropriate in their patient&rsquo;s specific circumstances to prescribe a cannabis-based product;<\/p>  <p>  - details of the cannabis-based product which it is proposed to prescribe and administer to the patient;<\/p>  <p>  - the source of the cannabis-based product;<\/p>  <p>  - arrangements for the ongoing monitoring and care of the patient once the cannabis-based treatment has been initiated.<\/p>  <p>  Where consultants require further information or clarification in relation to the licence application process, he or she should contact the Department of Health directly.  Ultimately it is the decision of the clinician, in consultation with their patient, to prescribe or not prescribe a particular treatment for a patient under their care.  It is the decision of the medical practitioner to make an application to the Minister for Health for such a licence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600055#WRCCC02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Staff Recruitment","counter":2886,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600055#WRCCC02800"},{"type":"question","counter":2887,"qnumday":1046,"qnumall":"[36254\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600055#WRCCC02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason for the delay in appointing nurses that have retired but are now willing to return to the profession; the reason nurses such as these early retirees are not actively encouraged back into the workforce, especially in cases in which there is a skills shortage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1289","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2888,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600055#WRCCC03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Support Services Provision","counter":2889,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600055#WRCCC03100"},{"type":"question","counter":2890,"qnumday":1047,"qnumall":"[36255\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600055#WRCCC03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when full-time residential care will be approved for a person (details supplied);; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":2891,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

This Implementation Programme represents a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with the Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m and the HSE &euro;15.5m.<\/p>  <p>  Key elements of the initiative include:<\/p>  <p>  - the roll-out of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Home Care Packages for people with dementia valued at &euro;22.1 million over a three year period;<\/p>  <p>  - the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, to include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points valued at &euro;1.2 million;<\/p>  <p>  - measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia valued at &euro;2.7 million.<\/p>  <p>  The roll out of Intensive Home Care packages commenced in January 2015 and monitoring of the allocation and uptake of these packages to persons with dementia is ongoing.  By end of June 2017, the HSE had delivered a total of 227 dementia-specific intensive homecare packages at an average cost of &euro;953 per week.  There are currently 132 people with dementia in receipt of an Intensive Home Care Package with a further 12 approved.  In addition to the Intensive Home Care Packages the HSE has continued to provide mainstream home help and routine Home Care packages to people with dementia whose needs have been assessed as requiring these supports and within available resources.  Up to 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from Intensive Home Care Packages over the lifetime of the implementation programme. <\/p>  <p>  It is Government policy that, wherever possible and appropriate, people should be cared for in their own homes and communities, and the National Dementia Strategy specifically restates this commitment to those living with dementia. <\/p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are working on a mid-term review of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy which will be published in the Autumn and will identify the achievements so far and set out the further work that is required to implement the Strategy over the next 12 months and beyond.

These improvements are shaped by my Departments Healthy Eating Guidelines, which were updated in 2016.<\/p><p>Patient nutrition and catering in Acute Hospitals are managed locally within the HSE.  However as part of the HSE Healthy Ireland implementation, plans at hospital group level, with the support of the Acute Hospitals division, and the Health and Wellbeing division have identified two strategic actions to improve food and nutrition in hospitals.  These are:<\/p><p>- the development of a Food and Nutrition Policy and Implementation Plan for  hospitals.  This will support all hospitals, through their nutrition and hydration steering committees, to provide leadership and promote and sustain improvement in relation to nutrition and hydration.  This includes the nutritional analysis of menus, protected mealtimes, malnutrition screening, therapeutic diets and assistance with eating as well as the healthier food environment for staff and visitors.<\/p><p>Many hospitals are implementing some of these initiatives already and the HSE will provide a forum to share best practice between Acute Hospitals and drive improvements where needed in 2017 and 2018.<\/p><p>A project dietitian to lead on the development of a Food and Nutrition Policy in the HSE has recently been appointed and commenced work on this project.  This builds on the HSE commitment to providing healthier food environments for staff and visitors by the implementing C<i>alorie Posting on Menus<\/i>in all hospitals and the ongoing implementation of the HSE Healthier vending policy.<\/p><p>- The second project involves working with the Department of Health through the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC).  In October 2015, a guideline for the Prevention and Treatment of Under-nutrition in the Acute Care Setting was prioritised by the NCEC to be developed as a national clinical guideline.  This will ensure malnutrition screening and assessment is in place and appropriate early identification and referral on to services when required.  Work on developing the guideline is underway by a multidisciplinary guideline development group.  Five meetings have been held to date and the clinical and economic evidence are currently being assessed.  The final guideline will contain recommendations on prevention and treatment of under-nutrition and be supported by a budget impact analysis and an implementation plan.  The guideline will undergo quality assurance by the NCEC and it is planned to publish in 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600059#WRGGG04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"question","counter":3133,"qnumday":1130,"qnumall":"[36617\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600059#WRGGG04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the hospital groups and hospitals within each that have completed calorie posting.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":3134,"content":"<p>In response to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600059#WRGGG04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Breastfeeding Data","counter":3135,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600059#WRGGG04700"},{"type":"question","counter":3136,"qnumday":1131,"qnumall":"[36618\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600059#WRGGG04800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the percentage of babies breastfed exclusively and not exclusively at first PHN visit; and the percentage of babies breastfed exclusively and not exclusively at the three month PHN developmental check.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":3137,"content":"<p>As the Deputy's question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600059#WRGGG04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":3138,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600059#WRGGG05000"},{"type":"question","counter":3139,"qnumday":1132,"qnumall":"[36619\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600059#WRGGG05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of local and national partnership plans developed and agreed under the dementia understand together campaign.

Article 2 of the Convention precludes countries from fishing in another country&rsquo;s 0-6m zone.\u00a0 However, Article 9 of the Convention gave countries the option to come to arrangements with their neighbours to allow access inside the 0-6 nautical mile zone if so desired.\u00a0 This was the basis for the Voisinage \u00a0arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  The UK Government had been intimating its intention to withdraw from the Convention for some time.\u00a0 It is nonetheless unwelcome and unhelpful as it suggests a signal of the UK intent to take a hard line on\u00a0fisheries\u00a0in the context of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are no immediate direct impacts for the Irish fishing industry from this action as it will not take effect for two years and the Irish fleet is not significantly dependant on this access. The Irish fleet is heavily dependent on access to the UK 12 to 200 mile zone.<\/p>  <p>  Any longer term impacts will only become clear in the overall context of the Brexit negotiations. It is the message of intent and the potential implications of that intent in the wider 12 to 200 mile zone that causes concern for the negotiations to come.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke with Secretary of State Michael Gove recently and stressed to him the importance of long established fishing patterns by the Irish fishing fleet and the importance of these being acknowledged and protected in the context of Brexit.<\/p>  <p>  As the negotiations develop, unilateral sectoral announcements, like this one, will be dealt with, as this will be, within the Brexit negotiation process and there will be no room, or indeed intent, to address issues in isolation.<\/p>  <p>  I am working closely with our fishing industry and held a detailed public discussion with stakeholders last month in Galway.\u00a0 I will remain in close contact with\u00a0fisheries\u00a0stakeholders as the issues develop and work with them and my fellow\u00a0fisheries\u00a0Ministers in the EU to ensure that we are all fully prepared for what are likely to be extremely complex negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The UK has stated it wants to retain the voisinage arrangements element of the London Fisheries Convention. \u00a0It remains to be seen if it can legally do this. \u00a0On the all-island basis, however, there is still merit that we should reflect on an all-island approach to these matters. \u00a0As I said at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine recently, we will have to reflect on all relevant issues in the context of Brexit negotiations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600061#WRJJJ02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Payments","counter":3220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600061#WRJJJ03000"},{"type":"question","counter":3221,"qnumday":1164,"qnumall":"[34940\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600061#WRJJJ03100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Clare will receive a GLAS payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1274","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3222,"content":"<p>The person named was approved into GLAS 1 with a contract commencement date of the 1 October 2015 and has received full entitlements in respect of the 2015 scheme year.<\/p><p>During the 2016 prepayment checking process issues were identified with\u00a0Forestry in the parcels claimed for under the\u00a0Low-input Permanent Pasture and Protection of Watercourses from Bovines actions.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Department officials are actively working to resolve these issues with a view to further processing the application for payment at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600061#WRJJJ03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Breeding Regulations","counter":3223,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600061#WRJJJ03300"},{"type":"question","counter":3224,"qnumday":1165,"qnumall":"[34942\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600061#WRJJJ03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will grant pedigree status to a breed of cattle (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3225,"content":"<p>The Droimeann Cattle Breeding Society Ltd. was approved on 4 November 2016 to maintain the herdbook for the Droimeann breed in Ireland under European Communities (Bovine Breeding) Regulations 2009 (SI 19 of 2009).

To fish for mussel seed, Irish-registered sea-fishing boats require an authorisation under section 13 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  Authorisations are only provided to those boats which are directly connected with a bottom grown mussel aquaculture operator who holds a mussel seed \"allocation\" for his or her aquaculture site or boats that are contracted to fish on behalf of same.  An allocation restricts the amount (tonnes) of mussel seed that may be relayed onto a given site.  Boats from Northern Ireland require equivalent licenses from DAERA NI to take part in the fishery and must meet corresponding regulatory requirements. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware on 27 October 2016, the Supreme Court issued a judgment in a case taken by a number of mussel seed fishermen (Barlow &amp;amp; ors -v- Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine &amp;amp; ors [2016] IESC 62, 27th October 2016).  In the judgment, the Supreme Court found that fishing by Northern Ireland boats within the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State under the Voisinage arrangements is not permitted by law.  The Voisinage arrangements are long-standing reciprocal arrangements which allow fishing boats from Northern Ireland access to fish within the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State and vice versa.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the Supreme Court upheld the High Court finding that the Voisinage arrangements are not invalid but that, as it stands, there is insufficient provision for them in domestic law.  The Supreme Court in fact noted that the arrangements were a sensible recognition at official level of practice and tradition, where fishing boats traditionally fished neighbouring waters.<\/p>  <p>  The application of the judgment is to all fishing by Northern Irish fishing boats in the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone, measured from the baselines, relying on the Voisinage arrangements.  Foreign fishing vessels are not permitted to fish inside the baselines.  Fishing activities that have a legal basis are not affected, such as those reliant on the access arrangements to Ireland's 6 to 12 nautical mile zone set out in Regulation (EU) No. 1380\/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council.<\/p>  <p>  The Government approved the publication of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill to address issues raised by the Supreme Court judgment of 27 October 2016, in so far as it relates to access for NI vessels.  If enacted and commenced, the Bill will give the Voisinage arrangements a proper legal footing.  The Bill was published in February 2017 and is available on the Oireachtas website.  The Bill has been debated in the Seanad and now is at Committee Stage there.<\/p>  <p>  While the Bill proposes to restore access to Northern Ireland boats to fish, under the terms of the Voisinage arrangements, boats that make use of this access are subject to the same rules and conditions that apply to Irish sea-fishing boats.  The Bill itself does not apply the specific conditions.  Therefore, other parallel associated measures will be required to ensure that rules and conditions in place for Irish sea-fishing boats are appropriately applied to Northern Ireland boats fishing under the Voisinage arrangements.<\/p>  <p>  The process of identifying which conditions may need to be applied is under way.  The conditions will include such restrictions as currently apply to Irish sea-fishing boats.  When the necessary measures have been identified, the most appropriate mechanisms for applying them to Northern Ireland boats will be determined.  The objective will be for these measures to come into effect at the same time as a commencement order for the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  Together, the Bill and the associated measures will re-establish the status quo for fishing access that existed under the Voisinage arrangements before the Supreme Court's judgment on 27 October 2016.  The only difference will be that the Voisinage arrangements will be provided for within a legislative framework.<\/p>  <p>  Access for Irish sea-fishing boats to the fishery, subject the conditions set out above, remains unaffected.  It is open to the persons concerned to apply to register the fishing boat in the Irish fishing fleet subject to satisfying the criteria which govern that process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600062#WRKKK04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Applications","counter":3290,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600062#WRKKK04100"},{"type":"question","counter":3291,"qnumday":1187,"qnumall":"[35421\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600062#WRKKK04200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason incorrect information was given to a person (details supplied) in County Mayo regarding their GLAS payment; the reason the person was informed that it would be paid in the next payment run when this was clearly not the case; and when this application will be finalised in view of the fact the lack of payment to this person is causing undue financial hardship.","asker":"1334","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3292,"content":"<p>The person named was approved into GLAS 1 with a contract commencement date of 1 October 2015 and has been paid in full in respect of the 2015 scheme year.<\/p>  <p>  The holding of the person named was selected for on-farm inspection resulting in the imposition of a penalty requiring further processing before payment can issue.

The rate of accidents on farms remains far too high and safety is a critical issue facing farming today.  Statistics show that accidents on farms cause more workplace deaths than all other occupations combined.  To date this year there have been 14 fatal farm accidents on Irish farms.  These 14 fatal farm accidents account for over\u00a048\u00a0percent of all fatal work accidents so far in 2017, while farming accounts for less than 6 percent of the workforce.<\/p>  <p>  Farm safety is an integral part of the TAMS II farm safety schemes run by my Department.  As part of these schemes there is a wide range of safety related investments that farmers may undertake.  Further it is a requirement that all farmers applying for grant-aid under the TAMS II schemes have completed a minimum of a half-day course on farm safety before they can draw down funding.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the TAMS II schemes, there is a mandatory Health and Safety element included in all Knowledge Transfer Groups under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme.  These groups will directly engage in the region of 20,000 farmers with farm safety.<\/p>  <p>  Safety must become an integral part of farming culture.  While there are many risks in farming, farming does not have to be a dangerous occupation.  Behavioural change is what is required to prevent many accidents.  It is a case of being aware of the dangers and taking the time to do what is necessary to minimise the risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600063#WRLLL03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Data","counter":3342,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600063#WRLLL03200"},{"type":"question","counter":3343,"qnumday":1204,"qnumall":"[35995\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600063#WRLLL03300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the average full year payment to farmers under GLAS 1, GLAS 2 and GLAS 3, respectively; the amount paid out under this scheme to date in 2017 from its inception; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3344,"content":"<p>Based on the current participation levels in GLAS 1 and 2, the average annual contract value, excluding GLAS +\u00a0is &euro;4,200.\u00a0 The average annual contract value will increase when GLAS+ payments are fully processed\u00a0and the processing of \u00a0GLAS 3 contracts to payment may also impact on the average payment.

This is a very important sector to the agricultural economy, making a vital contribution to both the food and feedstuffs sector.  While I am keenly aware that the very difficult harvest conditions of September 2016 posed additional problems for many growers, it was important that any measure put in place was focused and targeted at those most impacted whilst also ensuring prudent expenditure of public finances.  I am satisfied that the measure I have introduced addresses both of these requirements.<\/p>  <p>  This measure will provide a financial contribution of up to &euro;200 per hectare up to a maximum of 35 hectares per eligible applicant towards the cost of uninsured spring cereals crop losses in excess of 30% by yield.  Particularly hard hit growers who experienced cereal crop losses in excess of 50% will benefit from an additional &euro;100 per hectare.  Application forms including details on eligibility for the Crop Loss Support Measure are now available on my Department&rsquo;s website and from the Department&rsquo;s local office network.  Closing date for submission of applications will be Friday 25 August.<\/p>  <p>  This new support measure, together with the Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme I introduced last autumn, the current Tillage investment scheme under TAMS II that I introduced earlier this year and provisions supportive of the tillage sector under the GLAS scheme will, when taken together, provide significant support for this essential sector and further underline my ongoing support to securing its future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600064#WRMMM02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"TAMS Applications Data","counter":3397,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600064#WRMMM02600"},{"type":"question","counter":3398,"qnumday":1222,"qnumall":"[36682\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600064#WRMMM02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of applications received under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme 2 by county, in tabular form; the number of approved applications by county; the number of payment claims logged by county; the number of payment claims that have been approved for payment by county; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":3399,"content":"<p>The information requested on the TAMS II Scheme\u00a0is shown in the following table.

The Paris Agreement, which entered into force in November 2016, aims to limit global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with an ambition of 1.5 degrees Celsius.  The Agreement is designed to meet this objective through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by all parties to the agreement.  In this regard, the European Union submitted an NDC committing to a reduction of at least 40% in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, which will be met through reductions of 43% in the Emission Trading System (ETS) and 30% in the non-ETS sector compared with 2005 levels. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland will contribute to the Paris Agreement via the NDC tabled by the EU on behalf of its Member States.  The specific details of Ireland's contribution to the overall 30% reduction in the non-ETS sector, as well as the contributions to be made by other Member States, is currently being negotiated between the EU and its Member States in the context of the European Commission's Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) Proposal which was published in July 2016.\u00a0 Targets have been proposed for Member States based on GDP per capita and the cost-effectiveness of domestic emissions reductions within individual Member States, with the starting point based on average emissions over the period 2016 to 2018.  In the case of Ireland, a target of 39% has been proposed, which has been adjusted downwards to 30% to reflect the cost-effectiveness of measures within the Irish economy.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Commission proposal recognises different Member States' circumstances and the need to provide flexibility to reduce emissions as cost-effectively as possible in the context of the overall EU target.

At the Environment Council meeting of Monday 19 June, my EU counterparts and I reviewed progress to date and emphasised the need to prioritise a successful conclusion to these negotiations which retains a high environmental ambition for the EU, but provides each Member State the capacity to contribute to that ambition in a cost-effective and fair manner.<\/p>  <p>  The incoming Estonian Presidency has indicated a desire to reach agreement\u00a0in the Council, allowing negotiations with the European Parliament to commence during its term. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600065#WRNNN04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry","counter":3481,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600065#WRNNN04500"},{"type":"question","counter":3482,"qnumday":1249,"qnumall":"[35141\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600065#WRNNN04600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his plans to establish an eel hardship package for eel fishermen; if so, his further plans to ensure the heritage of eel fishermen will be preserved in co-operation between fishermen and Inland Fisheries Ireland heritage fisheries tourism to ensure the knowledge, history and methods are preserved for future generations and for scientific and tourism heritage programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1220","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":3483,"content":"<p>I\u00a0refer the Deputy to the reply\u00a0to Question No. 1022 on 13 July 2017.<\/p><p>The primary consideration of Inland Fisheries Ireland in the issue of public\u00a0licences for eel fishing was the availability of an exploitable surplus of stock.\u00a0\u00a0The knowledge and methods used by fishermen are preserved to some extent by the trap and transport operation managed by ESB under Ireland's Eel Management Plan.\u00a0 Under this\u00a0operation, a number of former eel fishermen are employed to catch eel and transport them around hydro-electric stations to mitigate their impact as barriers to escapement and migration.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600065#WRNNN04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1314"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Disposal","counter":3484,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600065#WRNNN04800"},{"type":"question","counter":3485,"qnumday":1250,"qnumall":"[35187\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600065#WRNNN04900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the locations to which the brown waste that is collected by bin companies is brought; and the end use of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":3486,"content":"<p>In order to maximise the resource potential and minimise disposal of our waste, the European Union (Household Food Waste and Bio-waste) Regulations 2015 build on the Waste Management (Food Waste) Regulations 2009.

The Environmental Protection Agency recently published\u00a0Compost and Anaerobic Digestion (AD) Statistics\u00a0for 2015 which highlighted the following trends:<\/p><p>- The quantity of waste accepted for treatment at composting and AD plants increased from 271 ktonnes in 2013 to 300 ktonnes in 2015 (11% increase);<\/p><p>- Composting was the dominant treatment activity (&amp;gt;80% of tonnage accepted);<\/p><p>- The quantity of brown bin waste accepted rose with 114 ktonnes in 2013 and 143 ktonnes in 2015 (25% increase) reflecting the implementation of the Household Food Waste Regulations.<\/p><p>The treatment and management of waste material, including food waste is subject to a registration and permitting system by local authorities or licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as appropriate, and governed by the Waste Management (Facility Permit &amp;amp; Registration) Regulations 2007 or the Waste Management (Licensing) Regulations 2004.  For a composting, biogas or similar site to be classed as an authorised facility under the Food Waste Regulations, it must be both authorised for the treatment of food waste and be subject to an EPA licence, waste facility permit or a certificate of registration as appropriate. <\/p><p>An inventory of such sites authorised by local authorities per region may be accessed at  while details regarding authorised facilities operating under a waste licence are available on the EPA&rsquo;s website at<i><\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600065#WRNNN05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry","counter":3487,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600065#WRNNN05100"},{"type":"question","counter":3488,"qnumday":1251,"qnumall":"[35280\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600065#WRNNN05200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when a review of the salmon fishing drift net ban which was imposed on inshore fishermen in 2006 will occur (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1263","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":3489,"qnumday":1252,"qnumall":"[35281\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600065#WRNNN05300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if he will consider a pilot project in which a number of fishermen from each county would take part in a scheme overseen by the Marine Institute to ascertain sea stocks, the results of which would determine the need for a salmon fishing drift net ban on the inshore fishing community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1263","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":3490,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1251 and 1252 together. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis.  This management is carried out by Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI), the State Agency with statutory responsibility for inland fisheries.  The management\u00a0policy is based on the fact that each of Ireland&rsquo;s 147 salmon rivers, river sections, estuaries etc. has its own genetically unique stock of salmon which migrates to sea as juveniles and returns to the same river in adulthood to spawn and create the next generation of fish exclusive to that river. <\/p>  <p>  IFI is supported in its management role by scientific advice from Ireland&rsquo;s Standing Scientific Committee.  IFI also draws on international advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). \u00a0Research in coastal areas and in the marine environment concentrates on increasing knowledge of migratory patterns, marine based mortality and return rates to home rivers as stock assessments can only be carried out on the individual stock in each river. <\/p>  <p>  The Atlantic salmon is a protected species under the EU Habitats Directive with which Ireland&rsquo;s current salmon management regime complies.  In order to align fully with the Directive and the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation (NASCO) principles and in view of a sharp decline in salmon stocks, the Irish Government closed mixed stock fisheries in 2007 including coastal and offshore fishing for salmon.  Harvest fisheries are now only allowed on individual river stocks which are shown to have a surplus and in estuaries where the stocks from individual rivers entering the estuary are each meeting their individual conservation limits.<\/p>  <p>  A Salmon Hardship Scheme was introduced in 2007 under which, fishermen active in the commercial salmon fishery could opt to permanently\u00a0cease fishing.  In excess of &euro;25 million was allocated to the scheme to facilitate payments to fishermen, with a further &euro;5 million provided for community development projects.\u00a0 The scheme closed for applications on 31 December 2007 and ceased in 2008 with all funds expended.\u00a0 It is considered that river stocks would be in a far more perilous state if the closure of mixed stock fisheries had not been implemented. <\/p>  <p>  During migration from rivers to marine feeding grounds, salmon from both rivers in Ireland and rivers in other countries travel through Ireland&rsquo;s coastal waters.  These \"mixed stocks\" pose particular difficulties for management as they contain individual fish often from a wide range of rivers some of which are below sustainable reproductive capacity.  Any deviation from current policy would be contrary to the international independent scientific advice as the &ldquo;home river&rdquo; of off-shore salmon cannot be identified and it is not possible to disaggregate the individuals or stock groups at sea.<\/p>  <p>  Such a move could potentially lead to conflict with EU and international obligations on grounds of not protecting vulnerable Irish and international salmon stocks.  The conservation imperative demands that current salmon stocks are not further eroded by mismanagement or inappropriate exploitation, whether via angling, commercial fisheries in rivers inland or through the operation of indiscriminate mixed stock fisheries at sea or in estuaries. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to international agreements entered into at EU level and at NASCO and the prohibition of mixed stock fisheries is a key element of international best practice in salmon conservation and management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600065#WRNNN05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1314"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Projects","counter":3491,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600065#WRNNN05600"},{"type":"question","counter":3492,"qnumday":1253,"qnumall":"[35812\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600065#WRNNN05700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the grant schemes that exist for persons wishing to establish renewable energy projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":3493,"qnumday":1299,"qnumall":"[35814\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600065#WRNNN05800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the grant schemes that exist for persons or communities wishing to establish renewable energy projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":3494,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1253 and 1299 together.  <\/p><p>Current financial supports for renewable electricity projects are provided via the Renewable Electricity Feed In Tariff (REFIT) schemes, which support renewable electricity generated and exported into the national grid.

Neither I nor the Department have a statutory authority to direct eir in this regard. <\/p><p>Quarterly updates on progress of the eir 300k rollout will be published on my Departments website.\u00a0 The Quarter\u00a02 figures have been verified by my Department and the eir rollout\u00a0is in line with the Commitment Agreement.<\/p><p>In April I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie.<\/i>This map finalises the\u00a0State Intervention Area for the procurement process and is an important milestone in the procurement process.  The Map\u00a0shows the extent of \u00a0the State Intervention area and also the areas targeted for commercial services.<\/p><p>- The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,<\/p><p>- The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process. <\/p><p>The Map, which is searchable by address or eircode, has been developed by my Department using\u00a0extensive information obtained from commercial operators.  A computer algorithm was not used to create the High Speed Broadband Map.<\/p><p>Information on whether specific premises are in a BLUE or AMBER area can be obtained by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering the premises eircode at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie. <\/i>The map will be updated to show quarterly progress of the eir rollout.<\/p><p>The position in relation to the areas referred to by the Deputies is set out below.<\/p><p>The map shows that the\u00a0townland of Ballinter Co Meath comprise\u00a059 premises. \u00a049% of these premises (or 29) fall within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and the end of 2018 (LIGHT BLUE on map) area\u00a0while the remaining 51% (or 30) premises fall within the State Intervention under the NBP.<\/p><p>The map shows that 100% of the townland of Kilmurry (Ed Innfield) Co Kildare fall within eir's plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and the end of 2018 (Light BLUE on map).<\/p><p>The map shows that 87% of the townland of Ardkilly Cork (or 59 premises) including the area known locally as Sandycove falls within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver rural high speed broadband between now and the end of 2018 (Light BLUE on map) while the remaining 13% (or 9) of the premises within this townland falls within\u00a0the State Intervention under the NBP. \u00a0In addition 100% of the townland of Ballynabooly Cork comprising 17 premises\u00a0falls with the AMBER area and will be part of the State intervention under the NBP.<\/p><p>A\u00a0full set of county statistics are available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>.<\/p><p>Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available from eir at<i><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">\u00a0<\/font><\/i>.<\/p><p>I encourage members of the general public\u00a0who are in a BLUE area but who\u00a0cannot access a high speed broadband service\u00a0to contact my Department at <i>broadband@dccae.gov.ie<\/i>. quoting their eircode and query details.<\/p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The State Intervention network will be a wholesale network and retail service providers will be able to use the network to provide enhanced broadband services to their customers.\u00a0<\/p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. \u00a0The three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.<\/p><p>With the finalisation of the map and following extensive dialogue with bidders, the procurement is progressing to the next stage.\u00a0 On 20 June 2017\u00a0my\u00a0Department wrote to the three bidders in the NBP procurement process inviting them to submit their &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo;.\u00a0 The 'Detailed Solutions' stage is the last stage of the procurement process before Final Tenders.\u00a0<\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  The Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.<\/p><p>The rate of demand for data services has increased\u00a0exponentially in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for\u00a0telecommunication operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force\u00a0to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is available on my\u00a0Department's website.<\/p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum created by the Task Force, I established an Implementation Group\u00a0to drive and monitor the implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery.  This group will be formally reporting every 90 days on progress made on all actions.\u00a0 I published the first such quarterly progress report on 13th June 2017, which is available on my Department's website\u00a0at<i><\/i>and which shows that considerable progress has been made, particularly in relation to the implementation of actions identified for Q1 2017. <\/p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg recently announced the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, which means an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The Regulator has awarded 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band which will provide a degree of stability and create future investment certainty.  Spectrum was also awarded in\u00a0lots\u00a0covering 9 urban and rural regions across the country.<\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.<\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600066#WROOO03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Disposal","counter":3527,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600066#WROOO03400"},{"type":"question","counter":3528,"qnumday":1263,"qnumall":"[34968\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600066#WROOO03500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the level and type of lobbying that the waste industry has carried out in the past 12 months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":3529,"content":"<p>The Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 provides that the Standards in Public Office Commission, an independent body, is the Registrar of Lobbying.

The design of the new scheme is underway, and includes an extensive independent economic appraisal.  This appraisal involves comparing the cost of supporting Solar\u00a0PV (both rooftop and ground mounted), offshore wind, onshore wind and a range of other commercial renewable technologies, to ensure that\u00a0the\u00a0new scheme\u00a0delivers value for money for energy users whilst also delivering on the energy pillars of sustainability and security of supply.

I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services to particular locations.<\/p>  <p>  Any customer across Ireland who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance.  If this fails to resolve matters, customers can and should refer a complaint to ComReg, which will investigate the service provider's compliance with its contractual obligations.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the independence of ComReg, I recognise the frustration experienced across Ireland where telecommunications networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  In that regard, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I\u00a0established the Task Force to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers, prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The December 2016 report of the Taskforce is available on my Department's website.<\/p>  <p>  The Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders to produce the report which contains 40 actions to alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland.  An Implementation Group has been established to drive and monitor implementation of the actions, bringing together all key stakeholders responsible for delivery.\u00a0 On\u00a020 July, I\u00a0published the second quarterly progress report, which is available on my Department's website.  It shows that the momentum built up in Q1 has continued, with further good progress made in Q2.  I am also pleased at the sustained level of engagement between action owners and industry.<\/p>  <p>  This work will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, following regulations which I signed last year, ComReg&rsquo;s recent announcement of the results of its auction for the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band will mean an 86% increase in spectrum capacity to meet the growing demand for mobile and wireless broadband services across rural and urban areas.  The award of 15 year licences for the rights of use in this band will provide stability and create future investment certainty.

Consequently, measures to maintain, enhance and diversify the post office network are fundamentally a matter for An Post.<\/p>  <p>  It is Government policy that An Post remains a strong, viable company, in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and that it maintains a nationwide customer-focused network of post offices in the community.  The Deputy will be aware that a fundamental review of An Post, including the post office network, which will identify the strategic changes and restructuring necessary to maintain the company on a sound financial footing, is ongoing.<\/p>  <p>  Transforming the postal business will be difficult and will require tough decisions, but\u00a0any new changes will be designed to make An Post fit for a future in which the organisation can be confident, robust and a winner in the digital world.  Government policy is to offer Government services online.  In time, it is likely that this will represent the default option in accessing services.  For the foreseeable future, however, a segment of the population will not be comfortable or able to access services digitally.  I believe that the post office network is the obvious choice for citizens as the offline gateway, with its nationwide network and existing strong relationship with offline citizens.

Currently the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme (WHS) provides &lsquo;shallow measures&rsquo; to the majority of applicants.  The WHS scheme is free of charge to eligible applicants.  These shallower measures include attic and cavity wall insulation, draught proofing, lagging jackets, low energy light bulbs and energy advice.  This\u00a0package\u00a0currently costs the\u00a0Exchequer around &euro;3,000 per home.  In extreme cases where the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland\u00a0(SEAI)\u00a0surveyor deems a home to be in particularly bad condition deeper measures such as doors and windows, and other forms of insulation,\u00a0may be carried out.  In making this assessment, a surveyor will look at factors including the age of the home, the construction of the wall, the age of the heating system or where one is absent.  <\/p><p>The reason that these deeper measures are reserved for the most inefficient and poorly insulated homes is that they cost well in excess of the measures currently offered.  Were they to be offered as standard, the number of people who could be helped each year would be significantly lower.  Indeed, the measures currently offered under the WHS were selected as the best balance that could be achieved between the resources that the Exchequer can provide to the scheme, the number of homes that can receive support and the energy savings that can be delivered.  In short, the measures supported are those that can deliver the most energy savings at the lowest cost to the highest number of people.<\/p><p>SEAI procures a panel of contractors to deliver the measures under the WHS.

The An Post Group lost &euro;13.7 million in 2016 with the core mails business losing over &euro;30m.  The financials reflect the fact that An Post has entered a period of long term structural decline in its mails business mainly due to the impact of e-substitution on mail volumes.  The same trend is apparent\u00a0in the post office business which, in turn, has impacted on the level of income available to IPU members.  These difficulties prompted the various reviews of the network in recent years which aimed to set out a series of measures to secure the future of the network.<\/p>  <p>  The scale of the financial challenges facing An Post\u00a0has necessitated a fundamental review of the company, including the post office network, in order to devise and implement a strategy to secure a sustainable future for An Post, it&rsquo;s employees and postmasters.<\/p>  <p>  Naturally, the outcome of the review will impact on the extent to which the recommendations contained in the various reports on the network\u00a0can be implemented.<\/p>  <p>  We all agree that transforming the postal business will be difficult and will require tough decisions but the new changes will be designed to make An Post fit for a future where the organisation can be confident, robust, begin growing again and be a winner in the digital world.  Government policy is to offer Government services online and, in time, it is likely that this will represent the default option for accessing services.  For the foreseeable future, however, a segment of the population is not comfortable or able to access services digitally.

Under the 1991 Act, as amended by the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, Tusla - the Child and Family Agency has a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  The Child Care Act 1991 is the key piece of legislation whereby the State, as a last resort and in the common good, may intervene to supply the place of parents. <\/p><p><i><\/i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People contains a specific commitment - under the outcome of children being safe and protected from harm - to &lsquo;review and reform, as necessary, the Child Care Act, 1991'.  This includes an examination of possible amendments of existing provisions in some instances, and also the addition of new developments in other areas. <\/p><p>My Department is undertaking a review of the Child Care Act 1991 and is embarking on a consultation process.  This will include an open policy debate in September.  My Department is seeking to ensure that this review results in a child-centred structure and is working closely with Tusla to help identify key themes and areas for reform and development.  Wider consultation with stakeholders will also inform the review. <\/p><p>The Child and Family Agency's powers to investigate allegations of abuse derive from section 3 of the Child Care Act, 1991.  Section 3 states as follows:<\/p><blockquote>&ldquo;(3) (1) It shall be a function of the Child and Family Agency to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.<br \/><br \/>(2) In the performance of this function, the Child and Family Agency shall:<br \/><br \/>(a) take such steps as it considers requisite to identify children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and co-ordinate information from all relevant sources relating to children;<br \/><br \/>(b) having regard to the rights and duties of parents, whether under the Constitution or otherwise:<br \/><br \/>(i) regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration, and<br \/><br \/>(ii) in so far as is practicable, give due consideration, having regard to his age and understanding, to the wishes of the child; and<br \/><br \/>(c) have regard to the principle that it is generally in the best interests of a child to be brought up in his own family.&quot;<\/blockquote><p>This statutory framework provides Tusla with the authority and obligation to investigate allegations of concern.  This position is reflected in case law.  For example, the High Court judgement of Mr. Justice Barr in MQ v Gleeson accepted that there was a duty on the health board [now Tusla] to investigate allegations of child abuse and the judgement effectively set out the parameters of that statutory duty.  Judge Barr also found that the duty imposed on the Health Board [now Tusla] related not just to &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; children who were identified or identifiable but also to children who may be subject to a specific potential future risk.<\/p><p>In assessing allegations of abuse, Tusla is required to take full account of natural justice and the constitutional rights of the accused.  In this context, and in order to assist staff in fulfilling the Agency's obligations under section 3, I am advised that a Tusla  internal protocol, which sets out the policy and procedures for staff to follow when responding to allegations of child abuse and neglect, is currently being updated and will be launched later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600074#WRWWW05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts Data","counter":3948,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600074#WRWWW05500"},{"type":"question","counter":3949,"qnumday":1433,"qnumall":"[35222\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600074#WRWWW05600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if all security and contract cleaning companies that have obtained contracts from her Department and agencies under the aegis of her Department under public procurement rules are paying the legal employment regulation order, ERO, hourly rate to their security and contract cleaning employees; the steps she has taken to confirm full compliance with the ERO system; if she has cancelled contracts with companies that have been found to be in breach of the ERO system since 1 October 2015; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1325","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":3950,"content":"<p>All cleaning contractors for my Department are being paid, equal to or above, the legal Employment Regulation Order (ERO) hourly rate.

I have also secured an additional once-off payment of &euro;3.5m in respect of the More Affordable Childcare measures being implemented by providers from this September.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the necessity of administrative demands on providers, whilst my Department is seeking to minimise the red-tape or burden on providers, it is important that appropriate governance and compliance standards are met where exchequer funding is being used.<\/p>  <p>  The various childcare schemes were introduced some years ago on an administrative basis, in response to immediate, identified needs.  They were put in place within very short timescales, with limited resources to manage them to today&rsquo;s standard of financial and administrative compliance.  The schemes have benefited tens of thousands of families, helping parents to seek training and employment in circumstances where they would otherwise have been unable to work outside the home.  They have also benefited children by providing early care and education.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the services that have been funded are operated by small, locally based providers, and some are overseen by voluntary boards, which would not have the resources or expertise for extensive financial or administrative procedures.  With this in mind, my Department has always tried to balance the need for straightforward rules and reasonably simple procedures with the requirements of financial accountability in using taxpayer&rsquo;s money.  Working with community and voluntary organisations and a range of small to larger private services has enabled my Department to reach vulnerable children and families, most in need, all around the country.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been working for some time to ensure appropriate financial and administrative compliance in the use of childcare investment, balanced with sufficient flexibility to enable small local providers or not for profit organisations to meet important needs of young families.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the financial and administrative issues arising will be addressed when the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) is put in place on a statutory basis, replacing the existing administratively based schemes.  I am committed to introducing the ACS as soon as possible, and am working on the legislation, business processes and ICT system necessary for a robust well-functioning scheme.  The new single scheme should be administratively less complex for providers, whilst strong on governance and compliance requirements to protect exchequer investment.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of the ACS, my Department has taken a number of important steps.  It has:<\/p>  <p>-  Put significantly increased staffing resources in place to put the schemes on a more robust footing<\/p>  <p>-  Revised grant agreements with providers, strengthening provision of financial reporting<\/p>  <p>-  Prepared improved scheme rules which were published this week to accompany the schemes, giving greater clarity about providers&rsquo; record keeping and reporting responsibilities<\/p>  <p>-  Commenced the commissioning of work to review, refine and implement governance and financial accountability capacity within the EY sector<\/p>  <p>-  Increased the number of unannounced visits by Pobal (which operates the schemes on behalf of the Department) especially in areas of particular concern and compliance: and<\/p>  <p>-  Ensured a substantially expanded compliance programme by Pobal since 2016.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has sought to balance administrative, governance and compliance demands on providers with supports such as the non-contact payments, support from the 30 City and County Childcare Committees across the country, and other quality initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  Managing the administrative burden on providers, whilst meeting governance and compliance requirements, is an important and complex task for my Department.

My Department will spend approximately &euro;232 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 428,000 customers.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen significantly each year, as the number of eligible customers grew.  At the end of September 2013 there were almost 396,000 receiving the telephone allowance compared to approximately 316,000 people in 2007.  This was an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum.<\/p>  <p>  The value of the telephone allowance in 2012 was &euro;270 per annum.

It makes the former notion of an allowance covering handset rental, standing charges and a number of calls somewhat outdated, when similar assistance can be achieved by increasing the rate of core payments, which benefit people regardless of whether they have a landline or not, and which can be spent by the recipients either on their landline-related costs, or on something else of their own choosing.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and strives to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years was given.  This increased the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  There was also a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.<\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, there was a further increase in the rate of State pensions by &euro;5, which has increased the maximum personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;227, and of the maximum rate of the contributory pension to &euro;238.30.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, over the past two Budgets, the maximum weekly rate for State Pensions has increased by &euro;8 per week, along with pro-rata increases for Increases for Qualified Adults.

The service is delivered by two companies, Seetec Ltd and Turas Nua Ltd.<\/p>  <p>  At present there are over 450 full-time equivalent personal advisers (excluding administrative and support staff) working with both JobPath providers.  The JobPath providers were required to set out their approach to recruitment and training of staff as part of the procurement process and the proposals submitted were taken into account in the assessment of tenders.  As there are two providers the proposals differed somewhat but shared many common characteristics including a multi-stage recruitment process of interviews and assessment centres, and a requirement for candidates to demonstrate specific experience, skills and competencies in areas such as knowledge of local labour market conditions, recruitment practice, customer service, use of IT systems, rapport building and interpersonal skills, and problem solving. <\/p>  <p>  Similarly the training programmes for staff within the JobPath providers share common characteristics including training modules of induction, skills\/competency development, on the job mentoring\/coaching and the opportunity for professional accreditation. <\/p>  <p>  The employers of case officers\/personal advisors, including the Department itself and the Local Employment Service providers do not specify particular qualifications as a pre-requisite to appointment to the role of case officer\/personal advisor. <\/p>  <p>  The JobPath Satisfaction Study, published earlier this year, shows that an overall majority of JobPath participants agreed that the staff are good at their jobs (95% for Seetec staff, 93% for Turas Nua staff).<\/p>  <p>  The Department has built a number of checks into the JobPath including on-site inspections and independent surveys of client experience\/satisfaction with the service provided by the JobPath contractors.  Failure to demonstrate satisfactory performance can lead to the application of payment penalties and potentially to cancellation of contracts.  These checks and measures are in addition to the performance control inherent in the payment by results nature of the contracts. <\/p>  <p>  For the purposes of the JobPath service all long-term unemployed jobseekers on the Live Register are categorised into groups based on their duration of unemployment (e.g. 1- 2 years, 2 &ndash; 3 years etc.).  Selection for referral to the JobPath provider is by means of stratified random sampling using these groupings; the objective being to ensure equity in selection and also that people referred to JobPath are a representative of the long term cohort on the Live Register. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the Department&rsquo;s policies on activation, jobseekers aged 62 and over are not subject to the commencement of mandatory activation measures.  As such, jobseekers already over the age of 62 are exempt from selection for referral to JobPath. <\/p>  <p>  However, where a jobseeker has been selected for any activation programme and reaches 62 years of age while on the programme they are expected to complete it.<\/p>  <p>  The duration of a person's jobseeker claim is recorded in terms of days of unemployment.  Jobseeker Allowance claims are made up of continuous periods of unemployment.  Any two such periods not separated by more than 52 weeks is considered to be the same continuous period of unemployment - this is known as linking the claim.  Long-term jobseekers that may have left the live register to go into employment are still considered to be long-term if they reopen their claim within the 52 weeks.  They retain certain entitlements (for example no waiting days and other supplemental benefits) and are available for selection for activation services including JobPath. <\/p>  <p>  Customers who have not been in full time employment but are returning to Jobseeker&rsquo;s payments from other departmental employment schemes, for example community employment and T&Uacute;S are also eligible for selection for JobPath.<\/p>  <p>  Information is shared with these two companies to enable them to provide employment services on behalf of the Department.  The purpose of sharing this information is to assist in the development of tailored personal progression plans for each jobseeker in order to support them back into paid employment.  As part of the contracts for the provision of these services, there are strict obligations placed on these providers by the Department in terms of data protection.  It should be noted that the contracts in place are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Ireland and the courts of Ireland have exclusive jurisdiction over these contracts.  The companies are also contractually required to register with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and are subject to the same provisions of data protection legislation as Departmental staff.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600077#WRZZZ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Appeals","counter":4084,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600077#WRZZZ03900"},{"type":"question","counter":4085,"qnumday":1485,"qnumall":"[35151\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600077#WRZZZ04000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if he will investigate the delay regarding a carer's allowance appeal by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1323","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":4086,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that the appeal from the person concerned was referred to an Appeals Officer who has decided to hold an oral hearing in this case on 10th August 2017.

My Department has contracted two companies, Turas Nua Limited and Seetec Limited, to deliver JobPath services.  The contracts are for four years comprising with a two year &lsquo;run-off&rsquo; period (during which time no additional clients will be referred).  As the Deputy will be aware JobPath commenced in July 2015, therefore client referrals will continue until 2019 and the &ldquo;run-off&rdquo; period will continue until 2021.<\/p><p>For the purposes of the JobPath service all long-term unemployed jobseekers on the Live Register are categorised into groups based on their duration of unemployment (e.g. 1- 2 years, 2 &ndash; 3 years etc.).  Selection for referral to the JobPath provider is by means of stratified random sampling using these groupings; the objective being to ensure equity in selection and also that people referred to JobPath are a representative of the long-term cohort on the Live Register.<\/p><p>The duration of a person's JA claim is recorded in terms of days of unemployment.  Jobseeker Allowance claims are made up of continuous periods of unemployment.  Any two such periods not separated by more than 52 weeks is considered to be the same continuous period of unemployment - this is known as linking the claims.  Long-term jobseekers that may have left the live register to go into employment for less than a year are still considered to be long-term if they reopen their claim within that period.  They retain certain entitlements (for example no waiting days and other supplemental benefits) and are available for selection for activation services including JobPath.<\/p><p>Customers who have not been in full-time employment but are returning to a Jobseeker&rsquo;s payment from other departmental employment schemes, for example community employment and T&Uacute;S are also eligible for selection for JobPath.<\/p><p>As part of the JobPath process each person is assigned a personal advisor who assesses their skills, qualifications and experience with a particular focus on identifying skill deficits. <\/p><p>JobPath providers arrange for the delivery of a broad range of education and training courses.  Some of these are provided in-house while others are provided by specialist training providers including the Education and Training Boards (ETBs).  In-house courses include CV preparation, interview skills and confidence coaching.  External courses include such subjects as adult literacy, IT and various construction related skills.  In addition JobPath participants may also apply for the Back to Education Allowance Scheme in order to pursue second and third-level courses. <\/p><p>The Department will extend the period for receipt of the JobPath activation service for up to 6 months while a customer pursues an externally delivered approved course, during that time the JobPath companies remain in contact with the person to provide any support they need whilst on the course.<\/p><p>For any long-term programmes of education such as a third-level course the client is withdrawn from JobPath with no financial benefit to the JobPath provider.  Customers who are commencing courses and have been approved for the Back to Education Allowance are not required to engage with the JobPath service. <\/p><p>The JobPath model has a number of key features which enables my Department to monitor all aspects of the service provider&rsquo;s performance and ensure contract compliance. <\/p><p>Every participant is provided with a service guarantee - a baseline level of service covering frequency of engagement, personal progression planning, geographic accessibility and in-employment support.  This is to prevent so called &lsquo;parking&rsquo; of clients. <\/p><p>Providers are obliged to accept all clients referred by the Department and have no role in the selection of clients which prevents &lsquo;cream-skimming&rsquo; of the employable jobseekers in preference to jobseekers that are more distant from the labour market.  The period of engagement with the service for any individual jobseeker is 52 weeks.  Participation is mandatory for those who are referred. <\/p><p>Fees are paid on the basis of performance.  With the exception of the initial registration fee, payments are made only when a client has achieved sustained employment.  All the initial set up costs have been borne by the JobPath providers.<\/p><p>The service providers are subject to regular audits and inspections.  In addition my Department commissions regular, independent, Customer Satisfaction Surveys to ensure that services are being delivered satisfactorily. <\/p><p>It is important to note that failure to achieve satisfactory customer ratings and\/or failure to achieve employment placement targets may result in reductions of fees paid via the use of retention fees - in effect these are penalties that reduce fees paid by up to 15%.  Where Contractors do not address the issue that gives rise to use of retention fees to the satisfaction of the Department, the Department has the right to terminate the contract. <\/p><p>Regular on-site checks and inspections are carried out to ensure that JobPath is delivered in accordance with the contract.  To date, 37 on-site inspections have been carried out at provider service delivery locations around the country.<\/p><p>The inspections monitor compliance with the service level agreement and the contract generally, including the suitability and standard of accommodation, staffing levels, Irish language compliance, customer service and customer feedback, checking the client&rsquo;s Personal Progression Plan, Review Meetings compliance, the checking of Job Sustainment Fee Evidence Types and Exit Plans.  <\/p><p>JobPath is a payment by results model and all set-up and day-to-day operational costs are borne by the companies.  Payments are made on a phased basis over a 12 month period in respect of each jobseeker placed into sustained employment.  Accordingly the contractors will not be able to fully recover their costs unless they help a sufficient number of jobseekers to secure employment and then support them to sustain that employment over a 12 month period. <\/p><p>JobPath is assessed on an on-going basis through regular inspections and performance reporting.  My Department has begun publishing a performance report for the service on a quarterly basis.  The most recent report was published on the Department&rsquo;s website in June and can be accessed at - .<\/p><p>It is intended that a full econometric evaluation of the service will commence in early 2018.<\/p><p>The outcomes of the customer satisfaction survey, also published in January, indicate that jobseekers are having a positive experience with the service.  For example, jobseekers felt that they were receiving a good service (with 71 to 86% satisfaction vs. 5 &ndash; 8% dissatisfaction) and that the staff of the service made them feel valued (90+ %).  Finally, the Department intends to commission a full econometric evaluation of the service towards the end of 2017, when a sufficient number of jobseekers will have completed their engagement period with the service and when a robust set of outcome data will be available to facilitate the analysis. <\/p><p>A complaint is defined as &ldquo;an expression of dissatisfaction, measurable by reference to service standards, and requiring a response.&rdquo;  Issues covered by the complaint process may include delays, mistakes and poor customer service and also complaints made under Sections 25, 26, 27 and 28 of the Disability Act, 2005.  To date 108,343 Jobseekers have been referred to the service, with 342 complaints received in total.<\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s contract with the JobPath provider requires them to have a comprehensive Complaints Procedure and this is advertised in every provider location.  The procedure contains levels of escalation whereby complaints are dealt with at a level of authority appropriate to the complaint and ensuring that matters are fully addressed.<\/p><p>The JobPath providers log and record all complaints they receive and submit the total twice monthly to my Department.  Likewise, my Department log and record all complaints received directly in respect of the JobPath service and forward them to the JobPath provider in line with their contract obligations.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600078#WRAAAA05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":4166,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600079#WRBBBB00400"},{"type":"question","counter":4167,"qnumday":1517,"qnumall":"[35718\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600079#WRBBBB00500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason, under the Data Protection Act, information from her Department was provided to Turas Nua as in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":4168,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s Public Employment Service (PES) is managed by my Department and delivered directly by its own Intreo service as well as by contracted private providers i.e. companies delivering the Local Employment Service (LES) , Job Club and JobPath services. <\/p>  <p>  These providers act as agents of the Department for the purpose of delivering these services and are subject to strict obligations imposed by the Department in terms of data protection.

This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI on a Pay-As-You-Go basis, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  Rowing back on these changes, which have already been legislated for, would undermine that sustainability, to the detriment of current workers.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be borne in mind that these changes are modest in the context of increasing longevity among older people, and the duration of the average pension is still expected to increase based on current trends.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600079#WRBBBB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Invalidity Pension Reviews","counter":4196,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600079#WRBBBB03600"},{"type":"question","counter":4197,"qnumday":1529,"qnumall":"[35927\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600079#WRBBBB03700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason an invalidity pension was refused to a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":4198,"content":"<p>Invalidity pension (IP) is a payment for people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or incapacity and who satisfy the pay related social insurance (PRSI) contribution conditions.<\/p><p>The gentleman referred to was refused IP on the grounds that he is working a farm of land.

We are extremely sorry for any worry or concern this may cause to parents\/guardians of children with additional care needs.  At present it is taking 20 weeks on average to finalise an application.  Applications are processed in date of receipt order.  There are a number of factors that have contributed to the extended time required to process claims;  <\/p>  <p>  First, there is a significant increase in the volume of applications being received.  The numbers applying for DCA have increased significantly since 2009, when the Department took over administration of the scheme from the HSE.  The year on year increase in volumes over recent years has consistently been in the 15-20% range due to an increase in population and more awareness of the scheme.  Over 1,000 claims were received in May, along with a further 700 in June; whereas the average would have been 400 per month a few years ago. <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, following a High Court ruling in 2016, there is now a need for the Department&rsquo;s medical assessors to provide the deciding officer with a more detailed opinion on the child&rsquo;s eligibility for the scheme and for the deciding officer in turn to provide more detailed reasons for their decision when communicating this to the customer.  These factors have resulted in the time taken to finalise applications increasing significantly and as a result the numbers being processed have reduced and the timescale to finalise each application has increased<\/p>  <p>  Corrective actions are being taken, with additional deciding officers recently assigned to work on the scheme.

The completed review will be published in the third quarter of 2017. <\/p>  <p>  The findings of the Review will play an important role in informing the overall debate on policy developments in relation to the Social Insurance Fund in the years ahead including the financial sustainability of the Fund given the expected demographic challenges and consideration of extending the scope of benefits for workers generally, including the self-employed.<\/p>  <p>  I am giving consideration to commencing a public consultation on the levels and types of other benefits which individuals would reasonably expect in the future, how such payments should be funded and by whom as well the appropriateness of the current benefit structure.

Details of rent supplement recipients and expenditure under the scheme for the period from 2013 to date are provided in the attached tabular statement.  Rent supplement&rsquo;s outturn forecast is calculated based on its expected level of activity taking into account transfers to, and the impact of, the housing assistance payment scheme (HAP) for the period under review.  Rent supplement forecast outturn for 2018 will be determined as part of the budgetary process in consultation with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government which has responsibility for HAP and other social housing solutions.<\/p><p>Rent supplement customer numbers have declined during the period commencing December 2013 (c.79,800) to June, 2017 (c. 41,200).  The strategic initiative of returning rent supplement to its original purpose, that of a short-term income support, facilitated by the introduction of the HAP scheme has been the main driver in rent supplement&rsquo;s base decline.  Other contributory factors include the continuing improvement in the economy leading to fewer people seeking support due to retaining and securing long-term employment allied with more people exiting rent supplement through activation and securing job opportunities.  The strategic goal is to transfer all long-term tenancies from rent supplement to HAP by 2020. <\/p><p>There are currently over 24,700 active HAP tenancy arrangements of which approximately 7,550 are direct transfers from rent supplement.  Analysis of recipient numbers transferring to HAP as at December 2015 to end June 2017 is provided in the table.  In addition to the ongoing transfer of long-term rent supplement recipients to HAP, the majority of new applicants seeking State support towards their rent are being supported by the local authorities under HAP rather than rent supplement.<\/p><p>The rental accommodation scheme (RAS) also has continued its operations in the transfer of rent supplement customers.  At the end of May 2017, local authorities had transferred a cumulative total of 58,740 households from rent supplement to RAS and other social housing supports. <\/p><p>I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputies.<\/p><p><b>Rent Supplement:  Recipient Numbers &amp;amp; Expenditure: 2013 to Present<\/b><table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Recipients<\/th><th>% Change<\/th><th>Cost &euro;000<\/th><th>% Change<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>79,788<\/td><td>-9.00%<\/td><td>372,909<\/td><td>-12%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>71,533<\/td><td>-10.30%<\/td><td>338,208<\/td><td>-9.30%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>61,247<\/td><td>-14.30%<\/td><td>311,059<\/td><td>-8%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>48,041<\/td><td>-21.60%<\/td><td>275,296<\/td><td>-11.50%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2017<\/td><td>41,240<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>253,000 2<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>As at end June 2017 <\/p><p>Forecast outturn for 2017<\/p><p><b>Rent Supplement:  Recipient Numbers transferred to HAP<\/b><table><tr><th>YEAR<\/th><th>Transferred from RS to HAP<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>N\/A<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>2,100<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>3,943<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>End June 2017<\/td><td>2,071<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600081#WRDDDD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Expenditure","counter":4277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600081#WRDDDD01100"},{"type":"question","counter":4278,"qnumday":1559,"qnumall":"[36365\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600081#WRDDDD01200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the full year cost for measures (details supplied).","asker":"1238","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":4279,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy is detailed in the following table:<table><tr><th>Measure<\/th><th>Cost<br \/><br \/>&euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Increase the duration of the fuel season by two weeks (from 26 to 28)<\/td><td>17.6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Increase social welfare payments to 2008 levels (costing relates to weekly payments made to people aged under 66 &ndash; pension rates are currently in excess of 2008 levels) <\/td><td>349<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Introduce a &euro;250 per week state pension for all pensioners (includes rates of payment for recipients of Widow\/er&rsquo;s\/Surviving Civil Partners Contributory pension aged 66 or over).<\/td><td>406<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Restore the full Christmas Bonus to all those eligible (based on a payment level of 110%)<\/td><td>267<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Increase all social welfare payments by &euro;10 per week. <\/td><td>694<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Increase the Family Income Supplement multiplier from 60% to 75%.<\/td><td>101<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Extend Child Benefit to 18 year olds in second level education.<\/td><td>62<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Increase the age of the youngest child to 18 for receipt of One Parent Family Payment (costing is based on allowing recipients of FIS with a youngest child aged 7 to 17 to concurrently claim one parent family payment and transferring recipients of jobseeker&rsquo;s transition with a youngest child aged 7 to 13 to one parent family payment.

The State pension (non-contributory) is a means tested pension and is funded by general taxation, whereas the State pension (contributory) is not means tested and is paid from the Social Insurance Fund, with contributions to that fund generally improving a person&rsquo;s entitlements under that pension. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to ensure that those qualifying for a State pension (contributory) have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension (contributory), all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. <\/p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This may have the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their State pension (contributory). The scheme was not introduced retrospectively.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has estimated that the annual cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost some &euro;290m in 2017, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the rate of the overall cost of State pensions.  This is a very significant cost, and the main beneficiaries would be people who already have significant means, and who do not therefore qualify for an alternative means-tested payment.<\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a State pension (non-contributory), which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  While this payment is subject to a household means-test, there are very significant disregards which mean that over 70% of such pensioners qualify at the full rate.<\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600081#WRDDDD01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Labour Activation Programmes Expenditure","counter":4284,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600081#WRDDDD01800"},{"type":"question","counter":4285,"qnumday":1562,"qnumall":"[36400\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600081#WRDDDD01900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the amount it would cost to remove the qualifying time periods and allow immediate access for all qualifying payments for back to education allowance or community employment training.","asker":"1367","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":4286,"content":"<p>The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) and Community Employment (CE) schemes are not targeted at the newly unemployed.  My Department provide a range of activation supports to newly unemployed individuals through the Intreo network to assist them in finding employment.  The current rules are designed to ensure that a person who becomes unemployed is, in the first instance, provided with the one-to one intensive activation support of a DSP case officer to try to find employment before being considered for a placement on an employment programme.    <\/p>  <p>  CE is primarily aimed at long-term unemployed persons, which is generally defined as one year or more on the Live Register.  CE is an active labour market programme aimed at persons who are not considered ready for entry to employment, with the programme emphasis on progression into employment and\/or further education\/training.  The core eligibility criterion for CE is that the person is in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a specified amount of time, generally 12 months.  <\/p>  <p>  The BTEA is a second chance education opportunity scheme designed to remove barriers to participate in second and third level education by enabling those who fulfil the eligibility criteria to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course. <\/p>  <p>  The objective of the scheme is to raise the educational and skill levels to enable jobseekers better access to the emerging needs of the labour market in line with Government activation strategy.  The BTEA is not intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.  The Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) grant, payable by the Department of Education and Skills, represents the primary support for persons pursuing education.  In general, most BTEA customers will also have certain registration and related college fees paid by SUSI.<\/p>  <p>  A person wishing to pursue a course of study under the BTEA scheme will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as age, in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment for a specific period and pursuing a full-time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education, with reference to the National Framework of Qualifications among others. <\/p>  <p>  To qualify for BTEA, a person must be in receipt of one of the following social welfare payments for a minimum period - 3 months if pursuing a second level course or 9 months   prior to the date of commencement of their course.  <\/p>  <p>  A waiting period is considered essential for the BTEA.

The 2017 Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseekers&rsquo; schemes of &euro;2.5 billion. <\/p>  <p>  Both the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes provide significant support to individuals so that they can work up to 3 days a week and still retain access to a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  The current days based system can provide significant income supports to jobseekers who are casually employed.  For instance an individual can earn a little over &euro;19,760 per year and still retain a small jobseeker's allowance payment, while the equivalent threshold for an individual with a qualified adult is almost &euro;33,975 if they are both working.  <\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that a changing labour market has resulted in a move away from more traditional work patterns, resulting in an increase in the number of persons employed for less than a full week.  However, it is important that the structure of jobseeker&rsquo;s payments does not inadvertently subsidise unsustainably low earnings or encourage employers to offer minimal hours of employment. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the two jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes my Department&rsquo;s main in-work support is the family income supplement (FIS), which targets families with children on low incomes and who work at least 19 hrs per week.  <\/p>  <p>  The back to work family dividend (BTWFD) scheme allows JA or JB recipients who have been jobseekers for 12 months or recipients of the one-parent family payment to retain their full increase for qualified children (IQC) for the first year in employment, tapering to 50% in the second year. <\/p>  <p>  Where a long term unemployed jobseeker is offered employment of more than 3 days but less than 24 hours a week, they may be eligible for the part-time job incentive scheme.  Under this scheme they can receive a weekly payment of &euro;119 per week if they are single or &euro;193.90 if they have an adult dependent.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently analysing incentives to work in the social welfare system for jobseekers with children with a view to developing the Working Family Payment.   <\/p>  <p>  Based on an analysis of current incomes, benefits, and taxes, ESRI research shows that people are better off in work than on welfare.  In particular, it demonstrates that more than eight out of ten unemployed jobseekers would see their income increase by at least 40% upon taking up employment.  Fewer than 3% would, in the short-term, be financially better off not in work.     <\/p>  <p>  The risk of facing weak financial incentives to work is higher for unemployed persons with a spouse and children, as the income support goal of the welfare system means that they tend to have higher welfare payments.  However, even among that group, less than one in fifteen would be financially better off not working and with the introduction of the BTWFD scheme, that figure drops to one in twenty.<\/p>  <p>  The combination of schemes available provides considerable income support for individuals who have part time employment by allowing them retain access to a social welfare payment.    <\/p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, long term unemployment continues to fall.

This demographic change alone is expected to increase spending on pensions by over &euro;220 million this year - not including the impact of rate increases.  <\/p>  <p>  The current rate bands applying to the State pension (contributory) were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000.  These rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contributions history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012.  <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands would result in an annual cost of over &euro;60 million in 2018, and this annual cost would increase by an estimated &euro;10 million each following year.  The main beneficiaries from such a decision would be pensioners who haven&rsquo;t made sufficient contributions into the Social Insurance Fund to qualify for a contributory pension at the maximum rate, or the 98% rate applying to those with an average of 40-47 contributions per year, and who do not qualify for means-tested pension payments because they have additional means above a certain level (e.g., in receipt of an occupational pension).<\/p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded in the calculation of the yearly average of the pensioner.  This will generally have the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, and may result in a higher rate of pension, depending on their circumstances.  <\/p>  <p>  Where people do not qualify for a maximum-rate contributory pension in their own right, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Where their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them, and is subject to a personal means-test.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), based on their household means, amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. There are very significant income disregards in this means test, which result in over 70% such pensioners being paid at the maximum rate.<\/p>  <p>  The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirmed that the Fund provides a better return to female rather than male beneficiaries.  This is due to the redistributive nature of the Fund, where an &ldquo;expensive&rdquo; weekly PRSI contribution paid in respect of a highly paid worker results in the same entitlements as that paid on behalf of a part-time worker on the minimum wage.  The system of benefits also results in cross subsidisation of those who have made fewer contributions into the system.  For example, a person with a yearly average of less than 40% of the maximum may receive a contributory pension that is 85% of the maximum rate, where they do not alternatively qualify for a non-contributory pension at up to 95% of the contributory rate.<\/p>  <p>  Over 54% of the payments made by my department to people over 66 are in respect of female beneficiaries, and so changes regarding the pensions paid by the department are likely to affect more women than men, whether they are rate increases, or savings such as these.  The main focus of my department is in ensuring that the most vulnerable women and men are protected to the greatest possible extent, while ensuring there is a sustainable system where people are encouraged to work and contribute to the Social Insurance Fund, which pays for those contributory benefits and pensions.<\/p>  <p>  The savings created by the new ratebands were an alternative to cutting the core rate of pensions, at a time when Exchequer savings were required, and other social protection payments were being reduced across the board.  Had a similar approach been taken with pensions, affecting everyone over State pension age &ndash; regardless of their means and their contribution record &ndash; the hardest hit would have been pensioners with no additional incomes, notably those paid a State pension (non-contributory), and widows and widowers living alone on one pension payment.  A significantly higher proportion of such pensioners are women, and this would have been expected to result in more women over 65 experiencing consistent poverty, relative to men.  <\/p>  <p>  The alternative approach regarding those over State pension age, taken by the Government at that time, made the State pension (contributory) for new pensioners more reflective of contribution history, while maintaining the rates of payment for non-contributory and Widows\/widowers pensions, as well as for contributory pensions paid to those who had contributed into the Social Insurance Fund throughout their working lives (i.e. with a yearly average of 40 or more).  This approach safeguarded those most vulnerable pensioners, whilst also avoiding a reduction for those who had paid into the system their entire working lives.  The most recent CSO figures (from 2015) show that the rate of Consistent Poverty among women aged over 65 is 2.6%, compared to 2.9% for men in the same age group.  Both of these figures are substantially lower than the rates of consistent poverty among the working age population.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600082#WREEEE05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Assist Scheme","counter":4378,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600082#WREEEE05600"},{"type":"question","counter":4379,"qnumday":1594,"qnumall":"[36693\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600082#WREEEE05700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the 2017 budget allocation for farm assist; the amount expended to date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":4380,"content":"<p>&euro;82.8 million was provided for the farm assist scheme in the 2017 Revised Estimates Volume.

Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the Europe 2020 poverty target is to lift a minimum of 200,000 people out of &lsquo;combined poverty&rsquo; (i.e. at-risk-of-poverty and\/or basic deprivation) by 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The latest national data from the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) for 2015 show improvements in the key poverty targets.

Responsibilities are also set by the local authorities, as landlords, for tenants of social housing which are normally set out in tenants' handbooks.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Strategy for the Rental Sector, published in December 2016, sets out a number of actions in relation to standards, with the combined aim of improving the quality and management of rental accommodation. On 1 July 2017, the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017 came into operation. The Regulations specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, fire safety, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply, with new requirements introduced focusing on tenant safety, including new measures covering heating appliances, carbon monoxide and window safety. With very limited exemptions, these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units, as well as other rented residential accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  All landlords, including local authorities,\u00a0have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations.\u00a0Enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).\u00a0The capacity and effectiveness of the local authorities' inspections and enforcement systems are critical to ensure that the new standards result in high quality and safe rental accommodation. <\/p>  <p>  Last year's report by the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC) on this area of inspection activity made a series of recommendations for improvements.\u00a0 As a result of NOAC's review and my own Department's consideration of the matter, the Strategy for the Rental Sector specifically prioritises strengthening the inspection capacity of local authorities and increasing the number and frequency of inspections of rental properties.\u00a0\u00a0A shared services model for inspection and enforcement of the rental accommodation standards regulations will be developed by the local government sector. Procedures for a more efficient, standardised and transparent inspection and enforcement approach across all local authority areas will be introduced. Under the Rental Strategy, this is\u00a0targeted for completion by Q4 2017 and my Department is working with the local authorities, through the City and County Management Association, to develop this new and more effective inspection and enforcement system.<\/p>  <p>  Specific ring-fenced funding for inspection and compliance activity will be identified from 2018 onwards and annual targets for both inspection and compliance will be agreed with local authorities. The objective set out in the Strategy is to increase inspection numbers incrementally each year so that, by 2021, 25% of all rental properties are inspected annually.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to further legislation in this area, my Department will shortly be publishing a guidance document to assist local authorities in their implementation of the\u00a0Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017.\u00a0 While I understand\u00a0that certain local authorities undertake the servicing of boilers themselves and in other cases, this is the responsibility of tenants and is specified as such in tenants' handbooks, I am satisfied that in all cases, the\u00a0minimum standards for rental accommodation\u00a0apply and it remains a matter for each of the local authorities to ensure they are in compliance with these minimum standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600084#WRGGGG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Eligibility","counter":4451,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600084#WRGGGG00800"},{"type":"question","counter":4452,"qnumday":1618,"qnumall":"[35056\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600084#WRGGGG00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will change the income assessment guidelines for housing needs assessments to disregard family income supplement on the grounds that this income support is paid to households whose own income falls below levels the Government deems acceptable and, therefore, should not be taken into account when determining a household's housing need.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4453,"content":"<p>The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, prescribe maximum net income limits for each housing authority, in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.

Screening under Environmental Legislation including the Birds and Habitats Directives (Environmental Impact Assessment and Appropriate Assessment Screening) will be formally carried out at this stage.  Only after these steps have been completed and the application fully assessed will a recommendation be made by the MLVC and a completed report provided as part of the submission for determination.\u00a0 It is also\u00a0open to me as the Minister with responsibility for making the decision on this application to seek advices from whatever body I deem necessary in the determination of the application.\u00a0 <\/p><p>-  In relation to the application in question, the report of the Marine Licence Vetting Committee (MLVC), which is a key element of the foreshore decision-making process, was completed on 6 July 2017.\u00a0 I expect\u00a0a decision to be made on this application\u00a0shortly. <\/p><p>5.

This is one of the issues I will be considering in the context of the recently announced review of Rebuilding Ireland, one year on from its publication, with an emphasis on building on the progress made, strengthening the measures already in place and identifying new initiatives that add value and raise ambition. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the review process, my Department will focus in particular on the broad issue of housing affordability, building on the measures already being advanced, for example through initiatives to use State lands to deliver mixed-tenure housing.  In this context, my Department intends to consult with local authorities and other key stakeholders in the coming weeks, as part of the broader review process.<\/p>  <p>  At a strategic level, under the new 20-year National Planning Framework, there will be an emphasis on managing and utilising State lands to deliver housing and to ensure an active and healthy market for development land.  In this regard, an important policy intervention in the delivery of new housing supply under Pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland is the development of State-owned lands for mixed-tenure housing, particularly in the major urban areas, where demand is greatest.  On 27 April 2017, details of some 2,000 hectares of land in public ownership were published, with the potential to deliver up to 50,000 homes nationally.  In practical terms, the development of sites such as these will mean accelerating social housing delivery and securing more homes for sale and rent at lower and more affordable price points.<\/p>  <p>  Rebuilding Ireland also commits to the introduction of an affordable rental scheme to enhance the provision of affordable accommodation for households currently paying a disproportionate amount of disposable income on rent.  As set out in the Strategy for the Rental Sector, this commitment is now to be progressed through kick-starting supply in rent pressure zones.  Lands held by local authorities in such zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, and in particular targeting middle-income households, in mixed-tenure developments.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to cost rental, a range of measures to improve the supply of rental accommodation that meets the needs of ordinary households are being progressed under the Strategy for the Rental Sector including:<\/p>  <p>  - build to rent models;<\/p>  <p>  - use of State-owned lands to deliver affordable rental in areas of high demand;<\/p>  <p>  - measures to increase the supply of dedicated student accommodation to free-up units in the general rental market;<\/p>  <p>  - supports to bring vacant stock into use;<\/p>  <p>  - consideration of tax and fiscal incentives to encourage additional supply.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, the Strategy for the Rental Sector noted that the Programme for a Partnership Government contains a commitment to develop a \"cost rental\" option, taking account of work already completed in this area, including by NESC and others.<\/p>  <p>  In line with this commitment, Action 12 of the Strategy for the Rental Sector provides that my Department will lead an expert group to develop a cost rental model for the Irish rental sector, addressing issues such as funding mechanisms, the need to grow the necessary institutional capacity, particularly within the AHB and not for profit sector (whether through mergers, new entrants or strategic partnerships), the households to be targeted and the appropriate regulation mechanisms.  The expert group will assess the benefits that a larger and more developed not-for-profit segment would bring to the rental sector and the housing system, and examine the feasibility and effectiveness of different approaches to achieve the desired change.  A proposal to establish the Expert Group - including membership and terms of reference - is currently being prepared in my Department.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently two house purchase loan offerings available to lower income first-time buyers from local authorities.  The first is a standard annuity mortgage available from all local authorities.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.\u00a0 The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation of each property determined by the Valuation Office, to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function. \u00a0Rates income is a very important contribution to the cost of services provided by local authorities such as roads, public lighting, development control, parks and open spaces.  Locally elected members adopt the annual rate on valuation they consider necessary in order to provide the required services.<\/p>  <p>  Under Part 5 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, the Commissioner of Valuation is conducting a revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State.\u00a0 The aim of the revaluation programme is to ensure that the valuations used for rating purposes are up-to-date and reflect current market conditions.\u00a0 To date, revaluations have been completed in South Dublin County Council, Fingal County Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Dublin City Council, Waterford City and County Council and Limerick City and County Council.\u00a0 I understand that revaluations in 10 local authorities, including Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, South Dublin and Westmeath County Councils are due to be completed this year with valuations to take effect for rates purposes for 2018. \u00a0The Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 fall within\u00a0the remit of\u00a0my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p>  <p>  Section 56 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015, as amended by section 8 of the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Act 2006, provides that I, as Minister, can make an order directing a rating authority to limit the overall amount of income it could raise through rates in the year following a revaluation to the total amount of rates liable to be paid to it in the previous year, adjusted for inflation.\u00a0 Rate limitation orders have been made in each of the local authorities that have undergone a revaluation to date and I will be making further orders later this year in respect of the rating authorities currently undergoing revaluations.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My\u00a0Department has in recent years requested local authorities to exercise restraint in setting, and where possible to reduce, ARVs and they have responded positively in this regard.\u00a0 The national average ARV has not\u00a0changed significantly in recent years.\u00a0 The national average ARV decreased slightly each year from 2010 to 2015 and has increased slightly in 2016 and 2017 (less than a 1 percentage movement in each case).\u00a0 Some areas are subject to greater increases or decreases in rates due to local authority mergers and the necessity to harmonise rates across new local authority areas.<\/p>  <p>  The legislative basis for the levying of rates is spread over a number of enactments, some dating back to the 19th century.  Many of the provisions are outdated and not suitable for business trends in the modern era.  My Department has developed\u00a0legislative proposals to modernise and consolidate the legislation governing commercial rates. \u00a0Among the measures included in the General Scheme of the Bill are provisions to allow a local authority to introduce rates alleviation schemes to support specific national and local policy objectives.

It is anticipated that more than 111,000 households will have their housing need met by one of these schemes in the period to 2021. <\/p><p>The annual cost of the three schemes to the exchequer is made up of the continuing cost of supporting the tenancies and contracts in place at the end of the previous year, and the additional cost of the new tenancies and contracts supported over the course of the year to which the allocation relates.  The cost of the schemes in future years is therefore dependent on the number of housing units or tenancies falling to be funded within each of the schemes and the rental or lease payments involved. <\/p><p>The Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), previously referred to as the Social Housing Leasing Initiative, was introduced in February 2009.  Since then the programme has been expanded on a number of occasions to provide for new types of supply and to involve a greater range of agencies and bodies in providing accommodation.  SHCEP supports the delivery of social housing by providing financial support to local authorities for the long term leasing of houses and apartments from private owners, developers and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).  Properties made available under the programme are used to accommodate households from local authority waiting lists.  Leased properties are allocated to tenants in accordance with the relevant local authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.  My Department recoups the cost of the agreements that are made with private property owners, including AHBs, to the local authorities.  Expenditure includes the ongoing cost of contractual arrangements and relevant cost of new contracts made within the year.<\/p><p>Details of the funding provided and drawn-down by Local Authorities under SHCEP in 2015 and 2016 are provided in the following table.  Exchequer funding for SHCEP in 2017 is &euro;83.947m; the allocation for SHCEP in 2018 will form part of the Estimates process.<\/p><p>SHCEP is targeted to secure an additional 2,250 social housing units in 2017 using a variety of different delivery mechanisms, with each unit secured under a long-term availability\/ lease arrangement.  Details on the number of SCHEP agreements supported by my Department in 2015 and 2016 are published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: . <\/p><p>There are currently over 24,700 households being supported by the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme in 31 local authority areas.  The scheme is funded through a combination of Exchequer monies and tenant differential rents collected in respect of HAP tenancies.  The  exchequer outturn for the HAP scheme in 2015 was &euro;15.64 million, while in 2016, it was in excess of &euro;57 million.  The majority of this funding supported the on-going costs of tenancies established in 2015 that continued into 2016, and the costs of the 12,075 new households supported by the scheme in 2016.  Budget 2017 has increased the Exchequer funding for the HAP scheme to &euro;152.7 million, in order to meet the continuing costs of existing HAP households, and the costs of the additional 15,000 households, targeted under Rebuilding Ireland, to be supported by HAP in 2017.<\/p><p>Limerick City and County Council provides a highly effective HAP transactional shared service on behalf of all local authorities.  This HAP Shared Services Centre (SSC) manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord.  Accordingly, my Department does not recoup individual local authorities in respect of HAP rental payments in their administrative areas but rather recoups all landlord cost via the HAP SSC.  A breakdown of average HAP payments to landlords in each local authority area at 31 December 2016, and a breakdown of the number of households supported by HAP, including the number of Rent Supplement transfers, in each local authority area at 31 December 2016, end Quarter 1 2017 and end Quarter 2 2017, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .<\/p><p>All households accommodated under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS)  have transferred directly from rent supplement.  My Department is currently updating and reviewing the RAS data collection and management process.  In that context, tenancy data relating to 2016 is currently in the process of being gathered from local authorities and will be published on my Department&rsquo;s website when available.  Data relating to the annual RAS spend from 2011 to 2016 and the number of households availing of support under RAS from 2011 to 2015 can be found on my Department's website at the following link: .  The provisional data indicates that some 1,256 new households were transferred from Rent Supplement to RAS in 2016. <\/p><p>In total, 1,645 transfers have taken place from 01 January 2016 to 31st May 2017 leaving a remaining target of 355 households to be transferred to RAS under the Social Housing Strategy national target of  2,000 transfers for the period  2016\/2017, indicating that 82% of the total transfer target has been achieved to this point in the two year period.<\/p><p>It is not possible to project the number of tenancies that will be supported by RAS at the end of 2017 as numbers in RAS will vary as contracts end, tenants move on to other properties, landlords join or withdraw from the scheme, new tenancies are allocated or vacancies in contracted units are filled.  &euro;134.338  million has been allocated to RAS in 2017.

It is not established on a statutory basis and members undertake to participate in each instance voluntarily, as representatives of their individual organisations.\"<\/p>  <p>  This letter also highlighted the different ways in which the MLVC may operate and stated that:<\/p>  <p>  \"The committee operates in three different ways:<\/p>  <p>  1. For specific categories of application, the application and supporting documentation will be assessed by either the Chair of the MLVC or a member of the Department&rsquo;s Water and Marine Advisory Unit (WMAU). Examples include site investigations, one day events, slipways, moorings and other projects deemed to be not significant in nature.<\/p>  <p>  2. Larger projects require the convening of the full MLVC. However, the members may not meet in person. The Chair of the MLVC will correspond with the individual members for their views on the application including any submissions from prescribed bodies and the public.<\/p>  <p>  3. Finally, when it is required, due perhaps to the complexity of the application and its supporting documentation or the volume of information to be assessed, the full MLVC may convene and meet to discuss the application, for example: strategic infrastructure developments.\" <\/p>  <p>  It was also highlighted that the MLVC is normally chaired by Dr. Terry McMahon of the Marine Institute. However, since the Marine Institute was the applicant in the case referred to, Dr. McMahon was not involved in any way in the assessment process and the MLVC was chaired by Mr. Richard Cronin, Senior Advisor within the Water and Marine Advisory Unit of my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Since participation in the MLVC is voluntary, members are invited to participate rather than being appointed. Members are representatives of their respective organisations and it is up to those organisations to ensure that their staff have the requisite knowledge and expertise to perform their duties including participating in technical evaluations of foreshore applications.<\/p>  <p>The MLVC makes a recommendation within a report which is included as part of the submission for determination by the Minister with responsibility for making decisions on foreshore applications. It is the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government that has the statutory responsibility to make the final determination on any application having taken all relevant information into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600087#WRKKKK04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fire Safety Regulations","counter":4655,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600088#WRLLLL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":4656,"qnumday":1697,"qnumall":"[36489\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600088#WRLLLL00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the terms of reference for the fire safety review that he ordered after the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower;

NSAI Agr&eacute;ment (formerly the Irish Agr&eacute;ment Board (IAB), but now operating as part of NSAI) is responsible for Agr&eacute;ment assessment and certification and issues technical certification for new and innovative products and processes in building and materials technology.<\/p>  <p>  Irish Standard I.S. 440 &ndash; Timber Frame Dwellings was published by the NSAI in 2009 and was revised in 2014 to I.S.440:2009+A1:2014  &lsquo;Timber frame construction, dwellings and other buildings&rsquo; to include all TF buildings and refer to the Eurocodes, and this standard applies in respect of all timber frame construction up to four storeys. Since the introduction of this standard all manufacturers of timber frame housing are assessed by NSAI to assess and certify compliance with I.S. 440 and the Building Regulations. Timber frame construction which does not fall within the scope or specification of I.S. 440 may demonstrate compliance with the Building Regulations by means of Agr&eacute;ment certification and the Assigned Certifier may rely on this third party certification as a basis for certifying compliance with Building Regulations. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that while NSAI Agr&eacute;ment is responsible for assessment and certification, primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings. In response to the many building failures that have emerged in the past decade, my Department introduced the Building Control (Amendment) Regulation 2014, which require greater accountability in relation to compliance with Building Regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals and builders, lodgement of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction and validation and registration of certificates. <\/p>  <p>  Under the 2014 Regulations, owners are required to appoint an Assigned Certifier whose role, in conjunction with the builder and the project team, is to draw up and execute an appropriate inspection plan and to certify the building&rsquo;s compliance with Building Regulations on completion.  The Assigned Certifier undertakes to inspect, and to co-ordinate the inspection activities of others, during construction, and to certify the building or works on completion. Builders undertake to cooperate with the Assigned Certifier&rsquo;s inspection plans and to jointly certify the building or works on completion. In effect, the statutory Certificate of Compliance on Completion certifies that a building is compliant with all relevant requirements of the Building Regulations. <\/p>  <p>In 2002, my Department commissioned an independent study on the use of timber frame housing in Irish conditions which, following public consultation, was published in December 2003. The study included recommendations which have since been implemented in relation to the development of standards and on-site quality assurance and compliance certification procedures, namely I.S. 440 and the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, which I have set out in detail above.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600088#WRLLLL01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreshore Licence Applications","counter":4668,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600088#WRLLLL01600"},{"type":"question","counter":4669,"qnumday":1702,"qnumall":"[36525\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600088#WRLLLL01700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if an environmental impact assessment was required by his Department in the granting of the foreshore licence to a company (details supplied) for kelp harvesting in Bantry Bay; if not, the reason; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":4670,"qnumday":1704,"qnumall":"[36528\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600088#WRLLLL01800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if the monitoring programme attached to the foreshore licence granted to a company (details supplied) to harvest kelp in Bantry Bay will be carried out by the company; the reason he deems it appropriate for the monitoring to be carried out by a private for profit company and not by an independent body; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1295"},{"type":"question","counter":4671,"qnumday":1705,"qnumall":"[36541\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600088#WRLLLL01900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the procedure for the granting of the foreshore licence to a company (details supplied) for kelp harvesting in Bantry Bay; if all statutory bodies, stakeholders and interested parties were informed of the application; the type of public consultation that was undertaken; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4672,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1702, 1704 and 1705 together.<\/p>  <p>  The application referred to\u00a0was assessed\u00a0in line with procedures followed for\u00a0other applications\u00a0assessed at\u00a0the time. In addition,\u00a0standard\u00a0public consultation procedures were also followed for this application.\u00a0It was advertised in the Southern Star and was available for inspection at a local Garda Station for a period of 21 days. No submissions were received from members of the public. <\/p>  <p>  In line with usual procedures, the application was also circulated to various bodies for their views and input.\u00a0 Submissions were received from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Underwater Archaeology Unit of the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Marine Survey Office, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board, the Central Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute. <\/p>  <p>  The licence provides for a four year rotation of zones with a stand by zone only to be harvested if weather is adverse (99 hectares\/240 acres). On average, some 175 hectares\/432 acres will be subject to harvest annually, less than 1% of the area of the bay. <\/p>  <p>  The rotational harvesting plan ensures that only a portion of the bay is harvested each year.\u00a0 To strengthen the sustainability of the harvesting plan for the licensed area within the bay, the harvesting is also subject to a strict monitoring programme, and requires approval of a baseline study prior to commencement of operations. All costs associated with the baseline study\u00a0and costs associated with the monitoring programme were or will be fully borne by the licensee.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The monitoring programme includes comparisons between harvested and non-harvested areas in each zone for density and height of kelp together with quantitative measurements of flora and fauna prior to commencement of harvesting\u00a0and in years 3\u00a0and 5\u00a0for 15 areas within each zone.<\/p>  <p>  The EIA Directive applies to a wide range of public and private projects. It is a mandatory requirement for project types listed in Annex I of the Directive, e.g., the construction of motorways and airports or the construction of installations for the disposal of hazardous waste.\u00a0 For project types listed in Annex II, it is up to the consenting authority to determine if an EIS is required by carrying out EIA screening based on criteria set out in the Directive.\u00a0 Examples of Annex II projects include intensive fish farming, reclamation of land from the sea, extractive mining, fossil fuel storage or metal processing.\u00a0 An EIA may also be required where the thresholds set out in the Directive are not met (sub-threshold EIA) or where the project or activity is proposed to be carried out in a Natura 2000 site.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  If the consenting authority determines that the EIA Directive applies to a project it requires that an applicant must prepare and submit an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), following which the consent authority would carry out EIA. In the case referred to, the proposed project is not within a Natura 2000 site, it is not of a class set out in Annex I of the Directive nor does it fall into Annex II; therefore, an EIS is not required. I should, however, point out that the Marine Licence Vetting Committee considered all material pertaining to the application and concluded that subject to compliance with specific conditions, the proposed harvesting was not likely to have a significant negative impact on the marine environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600088#WRLLLL02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Eligibility","counter":4673,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600088#WRLLLL02100"},{"type":"question","counter":4674,"qnumday":1703,"qnumall":"[36527\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600088#WRLLLL02200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the reason his Department stipulates that gross income be used to assess if persons can become local authority applicants (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1320","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":4675,"content":"<p>The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for each housing authority, in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy, which is available on my Department's website at the following link: <\/p><p>The\u00a0income threshold\u00a0is the basic measure of whether a household is eligible for social housing support.

The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) was established as an independent statutory body under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. <\/p>  <p>  Security of tenure under the 2004 Act is based on rolling four-year tenancy cycles. Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of 6 months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy before the expiry of the period of 6 months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period.  This is referred to in the Act as a &lsquo;Part 4&rsquo; tenancy.  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, extended the term of Part 4 tenancies from 4 to 6 years, for tenancies that commence after 24 December 2016. <\/p>  <p>  For a Part 4 tenancy, section 34 of the Act provides that the landlord must state in the termination notice the reason the tenancy is being terminated. The termination will not be valid unless that reason is one of the reasons set out in section 34 of the Act, for example, that vacant possession is required for substantial refurbishment of the dwelling.<\/p>  <p>  Notice periods for the termination of a tenancy by the landlord vary, depending on the duration of the tenancy, but periods of up to 224 days are provided for under the Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 introduced strengthened protections applying to tenancy terminations in order to guard against terminations on false grounds. For instance, if a landlord is terminating the tenancy on the grounds that he intends to substantially refurbish or renovate the dwelling in a way that requires the dwelling to be vacated for that purpose, the notice of termination must contain or be accompanied by a statement;<\/p>  <p>  (a)  specifying the nature of the intended works.

The Focus Groups engaged in the study were conducted towards the latter end of last year and early this year. The comments quoted therein cover a wide range of issues relating to human resources management including, amongst others, pay and conditions (particularly pay for the lowest paid members of the Defence Forces), vacancies, recruitment and retention, promotion systems, performance management, leadership, culture, morale, stress and work-life balance.  The Deputy has asked a range of questions relating to specific comments within the report. As advised by the University of Limerick, their findings and recommendations are interconnected and caution should apply to reading any one particular finding in isolation. In this context, I have addressed the questions in the round in line with the holistic approach being taken in response to the Study. <\/p>  <p>  The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with operational requirements. As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force targeted recruitment has been and is currently taking place so as to maintain the agreed strength levels. I am advised by the Military Authorities that the Defence Forces are planning to increase the level of recruitment in 2017 and a number of competitions are currently underway in this regard. The 2017 Cadet Competition was launched on 22 March 2017. A total of 100 Cadet inductions are planned to take place in September 2017. The Defence Forces are currently advertising for Apprentice Trainee Technicians and hope to induct new Apprentices from this competition in Sept\/Oct 2017.   <\/p>  <p>General Service Recruitment Campaigns\u00a0for both the Army and Naval Service were launched on 23 February 2017. The competitions have now progressed and general service recruitment has commenced.<\/p>  <p>  Public Service pay is based on collective agreements negotiated with public service trade unions and representative associations. Since the survey was carried out, PDFORRA has signed up to the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA), resulting in increases in pay\/salary for all their members. In addition, recent adjustments to salary scales will significantly benefit general service recruits and privates who joined the Defence Forces since January 2013 (increases of between 8% and 24% depending on the scale point). Further benefits are provided for under the extended LRA. The extended LRA proposals are under consideration by the Representative Associations.<\/p>  <p>  I was briefed on the Report at the end of June and I met with the Representative Associations on the 13th July 2017. I   will discuss the issues raised in the report further with them in September.  The broad range of HR issues raised in the study are being considered by senior management.  As the Deputy will be aware there is a significant ongoing programme of HR development within the Defence Organisation. This study was intended to further inform that work. <\/p>  <p>  I believe that this ongoing programme of HR development, much of which was set out in the White Paper on Defence (2015), will deliver more effective, energetic and sustainable Defence Forces, with an associated beneficial impact on morale into the future. As part of this programme civil and military management will bring forward proposals in respect of retaining specialists, providing for re-entry and where appropriate, direct entry, for my consideration and I expect to be in receipt of those shortly.  The Public Service Pay Commission will further examine the issue of retention of specialist personnel in accordance with the provisions of the recent Pay Agreement.  I believe that the Climate Survey process has provided an opportunity for members of the Defence Forces, including the Representative Associations, to express their views.  This is to be welcomed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600089#WRMMMM05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Corps Strength","counter":4757,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600089#WRMMMM05300"},{"type":"question","counter":4758,"qnumday":1735,"qnumall":"[35502\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017072600089#WRMMMM05400","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"his views on shortages within the Airs Corps; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":4759,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to maintaining the establishment of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel, comprising of 7,520 Army, 886 Air Corps and 1,094 Naval Service as stated in the 2015 White Paper on Defence.    <\/p>  <p>  The manpower requirements of the Permanent Defence Force are monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of the three services.

The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009-2015 and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2018 (the Lansdowne Road Agreement) define current pay policy for Public Servants and members of the Permanent Defence Force.   <\/p>  <p>The Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA) included proposals to increase salaries during 2016 and 2017. These benefits come in the form of increases in gross pay in 2016 for those earning up to &euro;31,000 and in 2017 for all those earning up to &euro;65,000. PDFORRA, (the representative association for enlisted personnel), signed up to the agreement in March 2017. The finalisation of negotiations under the agreement allowed for the commencement of the process for the implementation of pay increases and arrears, which are now being applied to their members.   <\/p>  <p>  An increase of 2.5% from 1 January 2016, for annualised salaries up to &euro;24,000 and 1% for annualised salaries between &euro;24,001 to &euro;31,000 was included in the weekly payroll of 5 July 2017. An increase of &euro;1,000 from 1 April 2017, on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000 per annum was paid on 19 July 2017. <\/p>  <p>The pay of general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013 will be increased further following an agreement reached between the Department of Defence, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and PDFORRA. This revised payscale, which will be backdated to 1 July 2016, and will see the gross pay for general service recruits and privates, who joined the PDF post 1 January 2013, rise by between &euro;2,000 and &euro;6,000 per annum, depending on their point on the incremental payscale. Arrangements are being made to process these payments.   <\/p>  <p>  Going forward, there is also potential for further increases arising from the recent negotiations on the extension to the Lansdowne Road Agreement. The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 contains proposals for:<\/p>  <p>  -  a 7.25% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning less than &euro;30,000 per annum<\/p>  <p>  -  a 6.75% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning between &euro;30,001 and &euro;32,000 per annum, and<\/p>  <p>  -  a 5.75% increase over the period of the agreement for those earning over &euro;32,000 per annum. <\/p>  <p>  The proposals have been presented to the Defence Forces Representative Associations who participated in the negotiation process. They will now be subject to ballot by members of the Associations.

Such verification was provided by surviving members of the old IRA and other related organisations who knew of the membership and activities of the applicant. However, not every individual who was involved in Easter Week and\/or the War of Independence made an application for a pension or medal and in such cases there would have been no reason to seek or hold verification of membership or activities. <\/p><p>I note the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to using material from Witness Statements of the Bureau of Military History.

As the Deputies will appreciate, the Curragh being approximately 4,870 acres in area is one of the most open and accessible areas in the country. <\/p>  <p>  At the most recent meeting of the Curragh Forum several actions were agreed to assist in addressing a number of the problems. Notably it was agreed that a review of the Curragh Bye-Laws and the Curragh of Kildare Act would be timely, with a view to identifying amendments that could potentially provide more effective solutions to the issues of illegal encampments, illegal dumping, illegal parking and other key issues. This review is progressing.<\/p>  <p>  The openness and accessibility of the Curragh Plains render many of these issues very difficult to address.  Notwithstanding this, illegal dumping and camping are amongst the priorities for my  Department.  An environmental maintenance contract for the Curragh is in place and in the first six months of this year my Department has spent approximately &euro;117,000 in this regard. The work undertaken includes clean-up operations following illegal camping and dumping, the disposal of rubbish and cutting of nettles and thistles. <\/p>  <p>  The response to illegal dumping is managed by the Department land staff in cooperation with the County Kildare Litter Warden, and in line with the obligations of the Litter Pollution Act 1997. As I have alluded to previously, given the size and openness of the Curragh Plains it is difficult to prevent this activity. However, it is dealt with expeditiously once it has been identified. In relation to illegal camping, Section 19C of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, as inserted by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, provides that it is an offence for a person to enter on and occupy property without the consent of the owner. Under the provisions of the Act, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the power, without warrant, to arrest a person who fails to leave when requested and seize anything they bring onto the property in question. Penalties for persons found guilty of an offence under this section of the Act include fines not exceeding &euro;3,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding one month, or both. Accordingly, my officials report all incidents of illegal encampments on the Curragh Plains to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as soon as they are made aware of them.
