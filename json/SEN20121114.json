Yesterday, it raised \u20ac1 billion for residential mortgages at an interest rate of 3.2%.  Senator Gilroy is known as the finance guru in the House and he might understand that what this represents is effectively a mark-up and margin to the bank of more than 50% on what it charges its variable rate customers.  This is the bank which arbitrarily raised its variable rate interest rates by 0.5%, as did its subsidiary, ICS, which now has a rate of 4.5%.<\/p> <p>The bank is raising money for which I am glad but at 3.2% for three year money and still charges its variable rate customers 4.5%.  That is a 50% mark-up at a time when one in five mortgages - it is closer to one in four - are in arrears.  The financial situation is getting worse by the day but these banks, such as Bank of Ireland and AIB, are crucifying their variable rate customers in order to pay for the losses that they are incurring on tracker rate mortgages.<\/p><p>A fortnight ago the Leader gave an update on the mortgage resolution measures that were supposed to be submitted by the banks to the Central Bank by 30 September.  I understood from his answer that the measures have been submitted.  Can we get an update on when these banks, which are apparently two pillar banks, will move to relieve the distress in the mortgage market?  When will they produce innovative products and solutions for people?  I do not mean the Personal Insolvency Bill, which is the equivalent of the nuclear button where one must give up everything.  The Bill will not be a game changer because it is just part of the solution.<\/p><p>Yesterday Bank of Ireland raised \u20ac1 billion at 3.2%, which is good news, yet it charges variable rate customers a rate of 4.5% when there has been no increase in the ECB base rate.  A mark-up of 50% is unacceptable.  Perhaps Senator Gilroy will telephone Mr. Boucher because I am sure that Mr. Boucher has a great deal of regard for his financial knowledge.  I ask the Leader, on foot of the good news given by the Bank of Ireland yesterday that it has raised money, to put pressure on it and seek the reversal of the 0.5% rate increase that was arbitrarily hoisted on customers over eight weeks ago.  People are being crucified by it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400002#A01500","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352889000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>The Senator ran over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400003#B00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1352889000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I had intended to raise a different issue but I might get around to it during my address.

It is clear that the matter must be addressed.  A young woman in the prime of life and full of vitality was taken from her family.  Apparently certain facts have been established.  She was admitted to hospital suffering from severe pain.  It increased and got worse after a day and she and her family requested a termination.  At that point the baby could not have been born alive and the death of the child was inevitable, medically.  She again requested a termination.  If the newspaper reports to which Senator Heffernan referred are accurate she was told not once, but on several occasions, that the law meant that as long as the foetal heartbeat was detectable, even though the child was inevitably going to die, she could not have the procedure.  Apparently she was also told - this is very worrying - that this was a Catholic country.<\/p><p>This is certainly a country in which there is considerable respect for the Roman Catholic Church historically.  The overwhelming majority of people give adherence to that belief.  However, I would not like to think, as somebody who is not a member of the Roman Catholic Church, that this was a Catholic state.  We have made provision by removing an Article from the Constitution to ensure that all beliefs should be treated separately.  The husband apparently indicated that he was neither Irish nor Catholic but a Hindu like his wife.<\/p><p>We stand condemned because of our lack of courage in facing the issue.  It is many years since the X case and we have been rebuked by the courts for not providing legislation.  That is due to a lack of political courage, perhaps an understandable one.  Three questions need to be answered by legislation.  Minimal legislation allows a woman to travel from the country but we have been warned by the European Court of Human Rights that there is opacity in the law.  That makes it difficult for doctors or anybody else to determine what is the situation.  It seems to me that there are three questions that require an answer.  First, at what point in a health crisis can the mother legitimately seek a termination?  It is legitimate, apparently, under the law but we do not know at what point.  We need to answer the following.  At what point can she legitimately seek a termination?<\/p><p>Second, to what extent can a patient be denied access to this treatment because of the conscientious objection of a consultant?  Third, to what extent is a patient entitled to a second opinion, how quickly and also alternative appropriate treatment?  These are very important matters that need to be dealt with.  I have tried to be factual in as far as I understand the case.  I have indicated that this is a tragic situation.  Of course one sends one's sympathy to the bereaved family.  We must face up to the situation.  I believe I have isolated three clear questions in a neutral, non-controversial and non-aggressive manner that we, as legislators, need to answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400003#B00800","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Visit of Australian Delegation","time":1352889600,"counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400004#C00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1352889600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Before I call Senator Conway, I am sure that Members will join me in welcoming the Senators and MPs from the Australian-Ireland parliamentary friendship group who are accompanied by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

As we come to the Chamber, we pass the portraits of the great leaders of the past, and call to mind people like Michael Davitt, Kevin O'Higgins, who was assassinated in the service of this State.  We are aware of the huge bounty pensions that are being paid and are faced with the prospect that nothing can be done about them.  I am sure those great leaders would turn in their graves if they were to know that in a time of crisis we could do nothing about these payments.  I suggest that where there is a will there is a way.  I have no doubt that the Minister for Finance is examining all options in terms of dealing with this situation.  I encourage him in that endeavour because it is extremely important.  The people who rely on Members for leadership and to do the right thing are beginning to question whether we are doing the right thing.<\/p><p>Members on all sides of the Oireachtas are doing good work both at home and internationally.

However, I am concerned, as are many other Members who have expressed their concern, about the bankers who are still <i>in situ<\/i> who were in place in retail banking in Ireland - I am talking about pillar banks - when they brought down our banks.  It was a condition of the State guarantee of the banks that pay caps be observed and we know in specific instances that they are not.  They are seriously out of kilter in some instances and this is an issue that must be addressed, apart form the pension pots, which are outlandish, and they should be brought to heel in that regard.  The important point we want to enforce and recommend to the Minister is that while the banks are still dependent on State assistance, as both pillar banks are, they must play by the rules and they should be made play by them.  I do not have a remedy for how that should be done, but it is not outside the bounds of the capabilities of the people who are dealing with this matter to ensure that will be the case as long as those banks are depending on the State guarantee  When they are free of it, they can break away, as can the other banks.

We heard confirmation in recent days of a deficit of \u20ac400 million in the HSE, that there will be no supplementary budget in this regard and that the deficit will be carried over into next year.  That will clearly impact on front-line services.  We can see this already.

On the pensions side, there are people on salaries ten times more than the average wage with pension contributions of up to 36 times more than those.

The fact remain however that for every 50,000 Irish women who give birth every year a further 14,000 Irish women miscarry.

Abortion is very rarely necessary to save a woman's life.  It is an extremely rare event, although that does not mean it is not important to have a legislative framework for it.  Anybody's life is important but there is another context to this, as maternal deaths in such circumstances are extraordinarily rare events.  There are years in Ireland when there are no maternal deaths, with most years seeing only one or maybe two.  Most of our large maternity hospitals regard it as a tragedy if there is one such death in the course of a year.  It is an extremely rare event.  To say that abortion is rarely necessary to save a mother's life does not undermine the necessity for having legislation in place for abortion to save the mother's life at a time when saving that life can only occur in the context of an abortion.<\/p><p>As has been pointed out most recently by my friend and colleague, Senator Mooney, the circumstances of the case are not well known and we are all depending on second-hand accounts from newspapers.  I wish no disrespect to any of the accounts given or the unbelievable tragedy suffered by this family when I say we should reserve judgment until there is a formal account of exactly what happened here.  There is a suggestion there may have been a failure on the part of the doctors, and that may be the case, but we do not know if that was the cause or if there was a failure of the legislative framework in which the doctors work.  The legislative framework is surely inadequate and there has been a vacuum.  An inquest will determine the cause of death and we can only hope that will occur very quickly.

I did not realise the number of amputations or the incidence of blindness related to diabetes but I am scandalised by the fact that money was allocated two years ago and has not been used.  I believe the Minister needs to have this drawn to his attention and I hope on a future visit by him to the House we will have the opportunity to debate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400007#F00500","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1352891400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>With regard to rare diseases, I attended a briefing earlier by the medical research charities on the importance of research.

It would be great if Ireland led by being the first to publish its national plan and to have an organised programme to deal with this issue.<\/p><p>This leads me to the upcoming EU Presidency, about which I also attended a briefing.  There will be 1,600 meetings and 175 other events during the six months Ireland holds the Presidency.

It will be important to use the opportunity to get the message out about the influence we have in Europe and the important part we play.

I have been in contact with the management of the hospital who have said they cannot say anything at the moment for legal reasons, which I appreciate, but I hope we have a full and frank debate on the issues when all the information is available to us.  I join in calls for the recommendations of the expert group to be made available.  The Minister has the report and he must report to the European court on the issue by 30 November as part of its proceedings.  It would be pertinent for us to have a debate before that happens and the report should be made available to us in order that we can debate in a measured way on all the issues involved.<\/p><p>While there were many presentations this morning on pre-budget issues, I attended an excellent briefing on equality budgeting in Ireland.  I have called on a number of occasions for the Government to equality proof and poverty proof budgets.  I appreciate we had a good debate with the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform yesterday, but it is difficult to discuss all the issues in a three minute contribution.  Equality budgeting is worthy of a debate.  We were informed earlier about models of equality budgeting in the North, Scotland and other European states, which ensure the views of groups in society with an equality agenda are taken on board when a budget is being framed.  I call for a debate on equality budgeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400007#F00700","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1352891400,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I am flattered and a little humbled by Senator Darragh O'Brien's kind words about me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400007#F00800","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1352891400,"counter":89,"content":"<p>The Senator is welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400007#F00900","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1352891400,"counter":90,"content":"<p>It causes me some distress to have to be critical of him, which is uncharacteristic of me.

He said that certain questions need to be answered, including whether protocols were in place in the hospital, whether they were followed, and whether they were adequate.  Will the Leader arrange for the Minister to come to the Chamber?  I have concerns that a number of people may try to exploit the unfortunate tragic circumstances in Galway.  Members have mentioned the X case.  The man who championed abortion legislation in Britain based on mental health, Mr. David Steele, said he never envisaged a situation where up to 190,000 babies are aborted in Britain annually, many as a social convenience.

The annual report of CIE is due in the coming days and will not make for positive reading.  Attempts are being made to squeeze more from unions.  A cursory reading suggests the unions in the three companies, Bus \u00c9ireann, Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann and CIE, have been more than compliant in terms of making severe adjustments.  There has been a reduction in the workforce and it looks like there will be further redundancies.  My main concern is that it has been flagged that there may be the closure of further services.  These services are not generating passenger numbers as high as earlier expectations.  The sad reality is if the company goes down that road, it will be the death knell of rural Ireland.

The second thing that must happen is additional staff being provided to SUSI.  Some ten additional members of staff have been provided but it is not nearly sufficient.  It is a step in the right direction.  Everyone must learn from this.  We have received e-mails saying information that could have been provided earlier, if the student had known, which shows the SUSI system is not working effectively or efficiently in comparison to the local authority or VEC system.  While there were questioned over the latter, it was more effective and efficient than the current system.  With only 3,000 students in receipt of grants, it is wholly unacceptable, particularly in light of how banks are dealing with students.  No overdrafts or loans are available to students and many students are considering leaving college.  That is a sad reflection on what has happened.

It is an important milestone on the path to full independence for the banks.  It is the first time since October 2010 that Bank of Ireland has been able to access the international debt markets in a benchmark public issue.  The issuance is further evidence of the strengthening and normalisation of thje banking system.  It is a clear show of confidence by international investors in the restructuring of the sector and its viability in the future.  The commitment of \u20ac1 billion from investors in unguaranteed Irish bank paper is important in decoupling the sovereign from the banks.  It is a step towards a full return to the wholesale markets independent of State support.  The strong investor appetite is demonstrated by the fact that the issuance was close to two and a half times oversubscribed.  That is an expression of confidence in the economy.  The deal is an important part of the normalisation of the banking sector.  Access to international markets at sustainable rates is vital to the viability of the banking sector.  I take on board what Senator Darragh O'Brien mentioned in respect of mortgage interest rates.<\/p><p>The acting leader of the Labour Party, Senator James Heffernan, raised the very sad tragedy we learned of in Galway.  Our thoughts and sympathy go to the husband and family of the young woman who died in the Galway hospital.<\/p> <p>The vast majority of Members have commented on this tragic event and asked about the report of the expert group.  I understand the report of the expert group on the judgment by the European Court of Human Rights in ABC <i>v. <\/i>Ireland has been completed and was delivered to the Department of Health last night.  The Minister for Health has not yet seen the report as he is in Cork.   He has a duty and responsibility to read the report, reflect on it and bring it to the Government.  The expert group was asked to examine the judgment and present a series of options on how to implement it, taking into account the constitutional, legal, medical and ethical considerations involved in the formulation of public policy in this area.  The Government has until 30 November to send a response to the Council of Europe on the progress made in this area.  That is the position as it stands.  <\/p><p> In regard to the death of the young woman in Galway, I do not intend to make any further statement.  As I understand two investigations are taking place, it would be wise to wait for their findings.  I am sure the House will have a debate on the findings of the expert group in early course.<\/p><p> A number of Senators raised various issues, including Senator Conway who referred to bankers' pensions.  Certainly there is a will on the part of the Government to tackle the issue.  I am confident the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, will find a way to deal with it soon.<\/p><p> Senator Terry Leyden raised the issue of the transfer of a prisoner to the Czech Republic.  The matter was raised previously and I dealt comprehensively with it.  Just to refresh the Senator's mind, I will go over it once again.  The transfer was being made under the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts 1995 and 1997.  The Acts provide for a mechanism whereby non-nationals serving sentences in Ireland may apply to serve the remainder of their sentences in their own countries where those countries are parties to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  In the period 1995 to 2011, approximately 140 Irish citizens were transferred to Ireland from abroad to serve their sentences here, including 39 citizens convicted of murder in other states.  A similar number of foreign prisoners were returned to their home countries to serve their sentences there.  The Czech Republic is a convention state as defined in section 1 of the Act.  In the particular case of the Czech authorities, they have given assurances that Mr. David Brozovsky will continue to have his sentence of life in prison enforced and will serve at least 20 years of his life sentence before being considered for conditional release.  Furthermore, the serving of an exclusion order which will require him to remain outside Ireland is being considered and processed through the normal channels.  I have a good deal more information which I outlined to the House and the Senator previously but I will impart it to Senator Leyden if he wishes to have it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400008#G00800","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352892600,"counter":102,"content":"<p>The Coughlan family is not happy about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400009#H00200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1352892600,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Senator Paul Coghlan asked about people who were <i>in situ<\/i> in the banks during the disastrous time when the banks were guaranteed.

I thank Members of the Seanad for agreeing to discuss it today.<\/p><p>With regard to the topic of fiscal responsibility, the Seanad has a head start over the D\u00e1il because of the Fiscal Responsibility (Statement) Bill 2011 which was introduced by Senator Barrett.  Prior to the Second Stage debate on that Bill, Senator Barrett held a number of sessions on the Bill and the topic in general.  The Bill before the House today is explicitly drafted to meet the specifications of the treaty in making provision for its implementation in national law.  This is why it has not been possible to incorporate Senator Barrett's proposals, but I congratulate him on the work he has done in this area.<\/p><p>As Senators will be aware, on 31 May 2012 the people voted in a referendum to ratify the stability treaty or, to give it its full title, the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union.  The aim of the stability treaty is to improve the stability of the euro and provide for better co-ordination between the participating countries and agreement on shared ways of managing our economies.<\/p><p>To fully inform the electorate of the context of the referendum, I published the general scheme of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill 2012 on 26 April 2012.  That general scheme set out the draft legislation that would implement key provisions of the stability treaty, subject to the will of the people.  The key purpose of this legislation is to implement the fiscal rules in the stability treaty.  These rules are sensible and prudent and represent a responsible approach to budgeting.<\/p><p>As per our programme for Government commitment, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was established on a non-statutory basis in July 2011.  It was tasked with assessing the official macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts and the fiscal stance.  Now, as part of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill 2012, the fiscal council will be put on a statutory basis and assigned additional responsibility for monitoring and assessing compliance with the fiscal rules we have signed up to under the stability treaty.<\/p><p>The Fiscal Responsibility Bill is part of an overall move towards more secure and stable economic governance throughout Europe.  Many steps have also been taken Europe-wide to address the problems caused by the acute economic crisis, to encourage recovery and to ensure the mistakes of the past cannot be repeated.  The stability treaty is an important part of this effort and the people agreed.<\/p><p>The EU has fundamentally strengthened the economic rules that apply, particularly in the euro area.  This was achieved through reforms, including in the six pack, which consists of five regulations and one directive covering fiscal surveillance and macroeconomic surveillance.  The reforms amended and strengthened the Stability and Growth Pact, reinforcing the corrective elements of it.<\/p><p>Other major steps were taken to strengthen the euro area economy.  Rescue mechanisms were put in place to ensure member states, such as Ireland, experiencing difficulties could access loans when they could not raise money from the markets at a sustainable cost.  The EU has worked to stabilise Europe's banks and has refocused its efforts to ensure economic growth and job creation are its top priorities.  Ireland has participated and co-operated fully in this regard.<\/p><p>These aims were clear in the stability treaty.  According to its first article, its aim is to &quot;support the achievement of the European Union's objectives for sustainable growth, employment, competitiveness and social cohesion&quot;.  It contributes to these objectives through budgetary rules, intended to ensure good housekeeping in each country, and by arranging for countries using the euro to work closely together and support each other.<\/p><p>The stability treaty will enter into force on 1 January 2013, provided that 12 euro area member states have deposited their instruments of ratification, or on the first day of the month following the deposit of the 12th instrument of ratification by euro area member states, whichever is the earlier.  At present, eight euro area member states and four other European member states have ratified the stability treaty.  Ireland will deposit its instrument of ratification as soon as the Fiscal Responsibility Bill 2012 has been enacted.<\/p><p>In other measures aimed at improving expenditure control, the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2012 was published at the end of September.  The purpose of this is to provide a statutory basis for multi-annual Government expenditure ceilings and multi-annual ministerial expenditure ceilings that have been introduced on an administrative basis.  It amends section 17 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 and provides for the Government, following a proposal from the Minister for Finance, to approve an upper limit on Government expenditure, which carries the aggregate amount of voted expenditure and the expenditure of the Social Insurance Fund and the national training fund, for each of the following three financial years.<\/p> <p>It also provides that the Government shall, following a proposal from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, approve the amount of Government expenditure to be apportioned into ministerial expenditure ceilings for each of the three financial years concerned.<\/p><p> The Bill before Senators closely follows the stability treaty, as accepted by the people.  A key change from the general scheme involves providing for a correction mechanism to be triggered automatically in the event of significant observed deviations from the medium-term objective or the adjustment path towards it.  The correction mechanism, which concerns the nature, size and timeframe of the corrective action to be undertaken, could not be included in the general scheme because the common principles required under the stability treaty were not yet available.  However, the European Commission subsequently adopted them in June.  In addition to the correction mechanism, the common principles also covered the role and independence of the institutions responsible at national level for monitoring the observance of the rules and these elements have been reflected in the Bill.<\/p><p> The key elements of the Bill are the introduction of a budgetary rule, the introduction of a debt rule, the requirement to implement a correction mechanism if there is a significant deviation from the budgetary rule, and placing the Fiscal Advisory Council on a statutory basis, ensuring its independence and ability to complete the relevant competencies.<\/p><p> I will now set out full information on the Bill, section by section.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the implementation of Articles 3 and 4 of the stability treaty, including the establishment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on a statutory basis, as it will be the independent body responsible at national level for monitoring compliance with the fiscal rules.  We have been advised by the Office of the Attorney General that Articles 3 and 4 of the stability treaty require implementation by way of national legislation, while the remaining articles of the stability treaty are binding obligations at international law that do not require to be reflected in national law.<\/p><p> Section 1 is the interpretation section.  Section 2 requires the Government to endeavour to comply with the fiscal rules, which are set out in the subsequent sections.  This section also provides that the official macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts prepared by the Department of Finance include all the data needed to assess if the Government is complying with the fiscal rules.<\/p><p> Section 3 outlines the budgetary rule required by Article 3 of the stability treaty.  One of two conditions must be satisfied.  These conditions are that the budgetary position of general Government is in balance or in surplus, and this will be deemed to be the case if the medium-term budgetary objective set under the Stability and Growth Pact is achieved, or, if it is not, that it is on the adjustment path towards adhering to our medium-term budgetary objective.<\/p><p> In line with the stability treaty, section 3 allows for neither condition to be met in the event of exceptional circumstances.  The definition of exceptional circumstances as per the stability treaty means an unusual event outside the control of the State which has a major impact on the financial position of the general Government or a period of severe economic downturn, provided that the temporary deviation of the State does not endanger fiscal sustainability in the medium term.<\/p><p> Senators should be aware that the medium-term budgetary objective set under the Stability and Growth Pact is expressed in structural terms.  This means the deficit target excludes one-off and temporary measures, and is cyclically adjusted.<\/p><p> Section 4 deals with the debt rule specified in Article 4 of the stability treaty.  The requirements of the debt rule are already law under EU Regulation 1467\/97, which was amended by the EU six pack of reforms.  However, as it is specifically included in the stability treaty, we are providing for its implementation in domestic law through this Bill.  The text accomplishes this by direct reference to the relevant EU regulation.  This eliminates the possibility of drafting a provision that could be inconsistent, and ensures better adherence to the regulation.  The EU regulation states that debt in excess of the 60% debt to GDP ratio must be reduced by at least one twentieth per year based on changes over the past three years.  I remind Senators that the debt rule specifies that when the level of general Government debt exceeds 60% of GDP, the Government must reduce the debt by one twentieth of the difference between that level and 60%, not one twentieth of the whole debt.<\/p><p> The EU regulation goes on to provide for a transition period for member states, including Ireland, that were subject to an excessive deficit procedure on 8 November 2011.  This transition period means that the general rule will only apply three years after the correction of the existing excessive deficit.  Our existing excessive deficit will be corrected in 2015 when our general Government deficit is targeted to be just under 3% of GDP.  This means that the one twentieth rule will fully apply in 2019.  In the meantime, it is required that there is satisfactory progress in reducing the debt to GDP ratio, and this will be assessed by the Commission and ECOFIN.<\/p><p> Section 5 provides for the requirements in Articles 3.1.b and 3.1.d of the stability treaty in relation to the setting of the medium-term budgetary objective or MTO under the Stability and Growth Pact.  The MTO results from the requirements of EU Regulation 1466\/97.  It is a calculated figure and what the stability treaty and this section say is that, notwithstanding the result of the calculation, the lower limit of the MTO is an annual structural deficit of the general Government of minus 0.5 % of GDP.  In line with the stability treaty, the section provides that when the debt to GDP ratio is significantly below 60% of GDP, the lower limit is changed to minus 1% of GDP.  In most countries, this situation will not arise for the foreseeable future.  Ireland's current MTO is minus 0.5% of GDP.<\/p><p> Section 6 has been changed substantially from the general scheme, as it provides for the correction mechanism that member states are required to put in place under the stability treaty.  The correction mechanism has been drafted in light of the now available common principles from the European Commission.  This section provides that the Government shall present a plan that specifies the corrective measures it will take if there is a significant deviation from the medium-term objective or from the agreed convergence path towards that objective.<\/p><p> Reference is made in the section to Article 6.3 of EU Regulation 1466\/97 which defines a significant deviation as 0.5% of GDP in a single year or 0.25% of GDP in two consecutive years.  The correction plan, which must specify the period covered and the revenue and expenditure measures to be taken, has to be consistent with recommendations made to the state under the Stability and Growth Pact in relation to the period over which the correction will take place and the size of the measures to be taken.<\/p><p> Provision has also been made in this section for the Government to lay a statement before the D\u00e1il outlining the steps it intends to take if a significant deviation is likely to occur in the future.  This was added into the Bill as the common principles allow for an option for either <i>ex ante<\/i>or <i>ex post<\/i>activation of the correction mechanism.  Credible fiscal management suggests that it would be prudent to address both circumstances.  This is a sensible and prudent measure, as it would be very difficult for the Government to refuse to take action on an <i>ex ante<\/i>basis if, for example, its own forecasts projected a significant deviation.<\/p><p> Section 7 provides for the establishment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, or fiscal council, on a statutory basis, which will operate in accordance with the Schedule.  Section 8 provides that the fiscal council shall be independent in the performance of its functions and assigns it the function, as required under the stability treaty, of monitoring compliance by the Government with the duty imposed on it by section 2.<\/p><p> In light of the finalisation of the common principles, some further clarification was required in the Bill on the duties of the fiscal council in relation to the stability treaty.  The common principles require that the fiscal council's monitoring and assessments should cover whether there has been a significant deviation from the agreed fiscal targets, exceptional circumstances have begun or ceased, and if a correction is proceeding in according with the corrective plan.  The common principles also require governments to comply with the above assessments or explain publicly why they are not complying.  Provision has been made to fulfil this requirement.<\/p><p> Provision also must be made for the other functions assigned to the fiscal council by the Government.<\/p> <p>These functions, which were included in the general scheme, are to assess the official macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts of the Department of Finance and assess the appropriateness of the fiscal stance of each budget and stability programme.  The fiscal council is required to publish its assessments within ten days of giving a copy to the Minister for Finance.<\/p><p>Section 9 provides for the regulation-making powers required by the Bill.  A residual power to make regulations if the common principles change has been retained but it can only be used if the resulting changes are not substantive.  Section 10 is the standard section for expenses incurred in the administration of the Act.  Section 11 provides for the Short Title and the commencement provisions.  The Schedule sets out the provisions with regard to the establishment and operation of the fiscal council, including membership, terms of office and staffing.  These measures are to ensure the fiscal council's independence is protected and guaranteed, which is vital to its performance of its role.<\/p><p>In addition to measures which I will detail further, the fiscal council's mandate is also protected, and cannot be altered without legislative action.  The fiscal council will have five members appointed for staggered terms of four years.  This does not include the current members, some of whom will serve shorter terms to rotate their end dates.  The Schedule also lays out the details of the appointment of members to the fiscal council.  These members will be chosen with regard to the desirability of their having competence and experience in domestic or international macroeconomic or fiscal matters and, to the extent practicable, ensuring an appropriate balance between men and women in the membership of the fiscal council.<\/p><p>There are a number of key differences in the provisions for this body compared to most other non-commercial State agencies.  These differences result from the need to ensure the fiscal council meets the independence requirements of the common principles.  The principal issues are that the termination of the appointment of a fiscal council member by the Minister on the grounds set out in section 4(2) of the Schedule will require a motion of approval from D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann; and the fiscal council will be funded from the Central Fund for expenditure incurred in the performance of its functions up to a ceiling of \u20ac800,000 per annum, which will be indexed to the harmonised index of consumer prices.  This will ensure the fiscal council's annual budget is guaranteed, unless a future Oireachtas decides to amend this provision.<\/p><p>One amendment was made to the Bill during its passage through the D\u00e1il, with regard to paragraph 10(2) of the Schedule.  The reference to &quot;accounting officer&quot; was changed to &quot;the officer accountable&quot; and the reference to &quot;appropriation accounts&quot; was removed.  Both are legal terms in the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts and do not apply to bodies such as the fiscal council.  This amendment does not change the original intent and purpose of paragraph 10(2).<\/p><p>I look forward to a constructive debate on the Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to give full effect to the decision made in the referendum on the stability treaty.  The Bill will facilitate stable economic governance in Ireland and ensure more controlled fiscal structures.  This will also allow us to ratify the stability treaty in line with our fellow euro area member states.  It is in the interests of the country and the euro area.  Therefore, I urge Senators to support the Fiscal Responsibility Bill 2012 which I commend to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400010#J00400","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352894400,"counter":118,"content":"<p>On behalf of Members, I thank the Minister for coming to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400012#L00200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1352894400,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his contribution.  My party supports the Bill as necessary legislation following the passing of the EU stability treaty.  I am sure all of us including the Minister would rather this discussion were taking place when certain agreements had been made on the residual banking debt and the break between banking and sovereign debt and that things were clearer.  During the referendum campaign a major discussion focused on our banking debt and the fact the sovereign is responsible for it.<\/p><p>On 18 July in this House the Taoiseach was very clear on several issues following the summit on 29 June.  Will the Minister give the House an update on a prospective timeframe for the establishment of a single supervisory mechanism for banking regulation in Europe?  The ESM seems to hinge on this.  Following this, another discussion will have to take place on retrospective recapitalisation of our banks.  On 18 July in this House the Taoiseach formally acknowledged this for the first time.  He stated: &quot;I simply could not accept a position whereby Ireland would be at a disadvantage for having taken the steps necessary to secure our banking system, both in the interests of our economy but also in the wider European interest, before new arrangements applied.&quot;  All of us now agree that at the time decisions were taken in a vacuum when there was no EU mechanism.  Importantly, the Bill will deal with many of the deficiencies which were inherent in the Stability and Growth Pact and which became effectively unenforceable once France and Germany stated they would not apply to them.  What is good about the passing of the treaty is that the rules apply to all states equally.<\/p><p>We all want a better and more transparent budgetary process.  In this light, in his statement the Minister alluded to the fact that the establishment of the fiscal council should effectively lead to a more transparent and open budgetary process, something which was promised in the programme for Government.  I hope this comes about.  Our experience to date with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council which is in place, albeit on a non-statutory basis, is that anything it has stated has been disregarded not only by the Government, but also by members of some Opposition parties.  If we have an independent statutory fiscal council, it is important the Oireachtas and all parties take its advice seriously.<\/p><p>An example is how a transparent budgetary process, which the Minister stated is a commitment in the programme for Government, was applied in the debate on property tax.  We have not had a proper debate on the proposed property tax being introduced in the budget.  All that was stated by the Minister the month before last was that the details would be announced in early December.  This is not a criticism of the Minister.  For years our budgetary process has been wrong.  We do not have open debate or discourse about the options available.  This is a failing not only of the Government, but also of all previous Governments I can remember.  We have one big bang approach in early December, which is what leads to the grave uncertainty we find in our domestic market, particularly the Irish indigenous market.  Consumer confidence has plummeted again since late September or early October, and this is in anticipation of the budget.  I hope the establishment on a statutory basis of a fiscal council will mean the Government and all future governments will engage properly with the public and the Oireachtas, and not only on the basis of a December budget announcement with everything else following quickly to establish changes in early January.<\/p><p>The Taoiseach stated the Ministers for Finance in the Eurogroup have agreed technical discussions on direct recapitalisation of banks through the European Stability Mechanism, which was to start in September.  This could put the ESM in a position to decide to recapitalise banks directly once an effective single supervisory mechanism is established.  I have already asked the Minister when he believes this single supervisory mechanism will be established.  Are we looking for an effective write-down of our debt?  Are we looking for retrospective recapitalisation of the money put in by taxpayers to Anglo Irish Bank, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland?  I do not know what our negotiating position is and what we are looking for.<\/p> <p>The Taoiseach has said in the other House that we will pay all our debts in full, but he comes into this House and states, rightly, that we should not be disadvantaged on the basis that we took decisions at the time in the interests of the economy and the wider European economy.  It is important that people get a view.  We were all hopeful that something would happen before the end of the year, and that was mentioned by many Ministers, including the Minister present, as far back as the summer.  Where does it stand in terms of the establishment of the banking regulator and the European Stability Mechanism?  Does the Government see this process going through 2013, 2014 and beyond?  Can we expect a clearer decision from the European Union?<\/p><p>The passing of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill is important because it beefs up the strengths in the eurozone in terms of proper budgetary policy and ensuring deficits do not overrun every year.  That is all well and good but legislation such as this is only relevant if it is acted upon properly.  The fundamental question the people will ask is whether we are seeing light at the end of the tunnel.  There have been many false dawns.  I respect the fact the Minister was in a new position and a new Government took over the reins during the negotiations.  Nonetheless, there is general frustration about the lack of perceived progress and that the European Union seems to be dragging its feet.<\/p><p>We are talking about the stability of banks in Europe and Ireland and I have made the point that it is clear to me that we have totally and utterly failed to get the banks, especially the two pillar banks, to support citizens.  While I welcome that Bank of Ireland yesterday raised \u20ac1 billion on the markets at a rate of 3.2%, I condemn the fact it raised its variable mortgage rate arbitrarily by 0.5% to 4.5% along with the ICS, while AIB raised also its rate.  The problem is that while we can talk about banks, banking regulation, the ESM and the retrospective recapitalisation of banks, nearly one in four people with mortgages is in arrears, people's houses are being repossessed and people who cannot pay their mortgages are faced with paying a property tax in January that we cannot discuss and debate in advance of the budget.  I respectfully ask that the banks be hauled in once again and told that they should be grateful for their existence because it is based on the fact the taxpayer ensured they remained in business.  I shall not mention salaries and pensions because I am sure that the Minister is sick to his back teeth hearing about them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400012#L00300","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352895000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>The Senator does not have time to talk about that issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400013#M00200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1352895000,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill but I will never miss an opportunity to mention to the Minister and I am sure he is well aware of how disappointed and let down the people feel by their two main pillar banks, the ones that we as Oireachtas Members, the Government and the previous Government supported in the interest of the economy.

I am glad that he welcomed the Bill.  We could rename it as the checks and balances Bill.  It is a pity that these types of checks and balances were not in place back in September 2008 when, as Senator Barrett spoke about, people walked up the back steps into the Department of Finance and laboured a bill of &#8364;64 billion upon the sovereign.<\/p><p>  I shall quote a wonderful analogy given by Professor Patrick Honohan yesterday during his speech at the Scottish Institute for Research and Economics at the David Hume Institute.  He said:  <blockquote>In the 1990s, Ireland had stuck to the arduous but dry uplands of growth through competitiveness and fiscal discipline that alone lead safely to sustainable higher income, full employment and steady prosperity.  But sometime around the turn of the century, lured by a Will O&#8217; the wisp, in the form of a property and construction bubble financed by easy access to foreign borrowing, Ireland stumbled into a morass of over-indebtedness from which it is now extricating itself.<\/blockquote>That comment sums up the crisis perfectly.  Not alone did it lead the citizens of the country into the morass of over-indebtedness but it led the Government into the easy money of transactional taxes.  Those taxes looked like we were able to spend in the way we did.  Now, to our dismay, we must make difficult and painful corrections.<\/p><p>  I welcome the fact Mr. Alan Dukes, a former Minister and now the chair of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, formerly Anglo Irish Bank, has said that the entity will cost the State closer to &#8364;25 billion and not &#8364;29 billion to &#8364;34 billion.  It is still an enormous sum of money but I shall put it in context.  The difference is the magnitude of last year's deficit.  While citizens are angry and annoyed over what Anglo Irish Bank will cost the State, and they have every right to be angry, it seems okay to run a deficit of &#8364;25 billion.  The reason it is okay is because I saw a statistic in recent weeks that 50% of the people are in receipt of moneys from the State.  That will not be able to continue.  Last year's deficit was &#8364;25 billion, but it is not just in this country.  Deficits have occurred internationally.  California is running a deficit of $17 billion on top of its state debt of $618 billion.  That is the extent to which countries and states are trading, but the system is flawed.  We must put in place checks and balances, about which I spoke initially and which is the aim of the legislation.  If they had been in place at the start of this century or at the mid-point of the first decade, we might not have reached the point where we must rectify the deficit in the manner we are doing.  Here we are, however, and we must get on with it.<\/p><p>  I had a couple of debates during the referendum on children's rights with people on the other side of the argument.  They held the view that the aim of this legislation will never happen and that we will impoverish the people even further, but that is not the case.  I am glad there is now complete clarity on what has become known as the debt brake.  It has been made clear that we have 20 years from 2019 to make our general Government deficit 60% of GDP, to be followed by a further decrease of one twentieth from then on.  That will put in place the correct grounding to allow us to advance in that at the end of the period there will not be a top-heavy position where taxpayers must pay down the debt of previous generations.  The six pack of five regulations and one directive is part of European law and we are codifying it here to provide for it in national law.<\/p><p>  I would like further details on a couple of matters from the Minister and I do not mind if he gives me the information now or later.  I would like some clarity on the exceptional circumstances.  When there is a grey area of that nature, there is potential for somebody, either here, in the European Union or in the Commission, to interpret the legislation in a particular way.  I would like to hear more details on it.<\/p><p>  I support the multi-annual expenditure ceilings.  We must take a more medium-term view rather than the annual view we take.<\/p> <p>I have been at meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform with the fiscal council.  They are fine people who are in an advisory role.  Mr. Donal Donovan was previously at the IMF, Dr. John McHale is from NUI Galway and Dr. Alan Ahearne was with the ESRI and is currently with Trinity College Dublin.  These people are giving good advice but they are not the Government, the Cabinet or the Minister.  It is good to put in place such structures and have them codified.<\/p><p>I refer to the stabilisation of the banks.  The Irish banks may be deleveraging too quickly.  They are attempting to pay back the exceptional liquidity assistance, ELA, from the Central Bank of Ireland and the ECB, which has been reduced from \u20ac186 billion to \u20ac128 billion.  They are doing so at a time when repossessions are disallowed.  This point is contrary to the popular view.  There are practically no repossessions in Ireland.  In Northern Ireland, per thousand homes, it is ten times the rate here.  During the week, we learned that 400,000 homes in Spain have been repossessed.  The rate of deleveraging is too fast.  It is difficult for the banks to pay down the ELA and keep people in their homes while trying to get into a position where we can move them back into the private market to be taken over in the same way as Bank of Ireland, in which the State now owns 15%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400013#M00700","speaker":"1160","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352895600,"counter":128,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his kind remarks about the previous Fiscal Responsibility (Statement) Bill.  The remarks are appreciated.  I thank the Minister for gracing an international economics conference with this presence during the summer.  One of the questions that arose was what was happening to the Munster rugby team.  The Minister's reply was that they are rebuilding and it is the same with the economy.  The Bill is excellent and I will support it.  The Bill proposed on 7 December 2011 had the support of every Member and the Minister will also enjoy the same support for this Bill.  That was an occasion when the Seanad proved itself to be invaluable in the governance of the country.<\/p><p>  Why do we need the Bill?  One must protect the country against what happened on 29 and 30 September 2008.  The Attorney General was there and future Attorneys General, after the Bill is passed, will advise that it cannot be done because of the debt brake and borrowing brake.  These are useful instruments in rebuilding the country and I commend the Minister for having introduced them in law.  They are needed.  Parliament must respond to what happened on that dreadful night.  There is now parliamentary and legal protection, which will stand up in court if anyone tries to perform that kind of act again.  It is important because we need those rules and we are not alone.<\/p><p>  The international aspect of the Minister's speech referred to the fact that many countries have allowed debt to GDP ratios to get out of control.  We need protection against lobbyists, those who hijack the public purse, those who waste public money,empire building bureaucrats, quangos, subsidy seekers and pressure groups.  Regarding the latter, I was astounded to see, in the <i>Evening Herald<\/i> on Monday, the former Governor of the Central Bank say that bailing out the banks was heroic.  If that is heroism, we do not need it.  It was a daft statement by the former Governor.  It was a dreadful night for the economy but we now have legislative measures to prevent it happening again.<\/p><p>  With regard to the people we bailed out, page 13 of the IMF assessment of Ireland dated 28 August 2012 says that SME credit is flat and new lending has slowed further.  I agree with the IMF criticism of the banks.  In 1947, in older times, when Trinity College Dublin was in receipt of a subsidy for the first time, the Government of the day said it was not to be used to pay more to those higher up.  It is open to the Minister to examine the 1947 file and see if there is a way to bring some discipline to the way the banks have been conducting themselves.  There is a view in the House that we need a rule preventing anyone in a grant-aided body from earning more than the Taoiseach.  There have been criticisms about the high earnings of charities aided by public funds.  We are trying to make this a fiscally responsible country after eight or ten years in which we were not so.  That requires a great deal of change.  The <i>laissez-faire<\/i> approach does not seem to operate anymore.  Does too big to fail mean it is too expensive to save?  I think it does.  We must take many organisations off the public payroll so that we can balance the books again.<\/p><p>  A handful of lobbyists can get an item of expenditure going and we never do broad cost benefit analysis from the point of view of society as a whole.  That problem has existed.  The problem of tax lawyers and accountants, the complexity of the tax code and the way their loopholes and tax expenditures are sheltered from the budget discussion we will be having in a few weeks time should be opened up for scrutiny.  I commend the Minister for establishing the fiscal council on an independent basis and I commend the personnel in place.  There was a cosy consensus between the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the ESRI that got us into the euro without fully discussing the options and gave us a weak scheme of bank regulation.  We need contrarian voices and I commend the Minister for the way he set up the fiscal council so that contrarian voices will be there.  The wrong kind of consensus got us into this situation.<\/p><p>  Can the Minister be accused, as happens frequently, of being hard hearted?  We have done the borrowing experiment and it makes the rich richer, lobbyists proliferate, bureaucracy grows, bankers prosper, unemployment grows, inequality grows and the next generation inherits a debt mountain.  There is a strong social case to support what the Minister is doing.  We tried the experiment of borrowing 120% of GDP and ended up with 14.8% unemployment, as well as emigration.<\/p><p>  The Bill is a good start to the necessary task of setting the public finances in order.  It is a major part of the recovery agenda and I commend the Minister.  I may table technical amendments at a later stage.  The Minister's initiative deserves the support of the House, as the Bill in December received support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400014#N00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1352895600,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and I am glad the senior Minister has come to the House.

During the referendum debate, there was great deal of misinformation and some of the arguments were not as we would hope or what we strive towards.  We do not want to revisit or relive the arguments in favour of and against the treaty.  It is prudent to implement fiscal rules, as Senator Sean Barrett proposed in December last year, that make provision for balanced budgets, which is prudent, and for contingencies arising when budgets become unbalanced in rare and exceptional circumstances and for mechanisms to deal with that.  Despite some of the comments at the time of the treaty, its passing has led to improved levels of confidence in Ireland and Europe.  We can see evidence of that in falling interest rates charged on Irish debt and on the return of the NTMA to the markets, albeit in treasury bills and short-term debt.  Nevertheless, it is encouraging and significant and stems from the confidence in our economy gained across Europe by the people of Ireland accepting the provisions of the Bill.  The enshrinement of the rules into legislation will go towards consolidating confidence.<\/p> <p>Those who were opponents of the treaty at the time are noticeably silent on what may have happened if we had rejected the provisions of the treaty.  If we had followed the course of action proposed by the opponents of the treaty at the time we would not be in the position we are in now, albeit in a fragile position.  The idea was proposed at the time that in passing the treaty we were somehow conceding some level of sovereignty to unnamed and unimaginable forces in Europe but the fact that we are bringing the legislation into the House demonstrates that our autonomy in that regard at least remains in our hands.<\/p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien was correct in his comments earlier in regard to monetary union when it was set up and that France, Germany and the larger economies of Europe had seemingly found it expedient not to live within the Stability and Growth Pact rules.  When the larger economies could do so with impunity there was very little incentive for smaller economies to attempt to live within the measures.<\/p><p>I have much more to say about this and some of it might be more appropriate to raise on Committee Stage.  I refer to section 7 and the establishment of the fiscal council.  I note from the Minister's contribution and the notes we have on this that the fiscal council will monitor and assess the provisions of the Bill but where is the report published by the fiscal committee?  Where does responsibility for action on the recommendations in the report lie?  Does it lie with the Department of Finance or ECOFIN?  It is certainly welcome that a report would be published in advance of the budget but I am not sure what is actionable and who is responsible for that action.  That is one question I want to put to the Minister.<\/p><p>The Minister will recall there was a great deal of comment in political and academic circles, and in the committee set up to discuss the fiscal treaty at the time which was chaired very well by Deputy Hannigan, on the difficulty of arriving at an agreed formula to establish what exactly would constitute a structural deficit.  I understand more may need to be done on that but from what I have read on that I am not sure how we will agree on what constitutes the structural deficit and who will be responsible.  Will we do it ourselves?  How does it fit in with the European structures, and what happens if there is lack of agreement on what constitutes the structural deficit?  <\/p><p>If the Minister could answer those two questions I will ask more on Committee Stage and they are probably more appropriate to it.  I acknowledge Senator Barrett's contribution, as did the Minister who generously accepted most of the provisions of what Senator Barrett suggested last December.  I will leave it at that and return to this on Committee Stage when I look forward to opportunity to tease this out further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400014#N00300","speaker":"1117","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352896200,"counter":131,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire ar ais go dt\u00ed an Teach ar\u00eds inniu.  We want to support this Bill.  We believe it is important and that anyone who opposes it is opposing the will of the people in the referendum that was held some time ago.  The Bill, effectively, was tied up in the fiscal treaty and there are some extra provisions in it but anyone who opposes it is going against the will of the people and that should be borne in mind.<\/p><p>The fiscal treaty rules give enhancement to what was always there in terms of the Stability and Growth Pact.  We have a job as a nation to explain to our colleagues in Europe how the Stability and Growth Pact worked.  France and Germany were the first to breach it and even at a party conference at the weekend with some of our European colleagues it came as a considerable shock to some of them that Ireland was fully in compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact throughout the years of the Fianna F\u00e1il Governments until 2008.  That is not say that everything we were doing was right, rather quite the opposite, it says that the rules were wrong, they did not go far enough and were not enforced in many countries.  That is a point that needs to be hammered home repeatedly particularly with Germany and to a lesser extent with France which is more supportive of us.<\/p><p>The new set of rules we are enacting, and that the people effectively enacted, address the deficiency with the original Stability and Growth Pact by setting out an automatic corrective mechanism which will be very difficult on governments.  If the rules had been in place before 2008, I hope we would not have reached levels of public expenditure that would have required such a huge correction, but if it had come into force in 2008 it would have resulted in a massive correction in public expenditure.  We have got to get to a position where we do not allow that to happen again.  Bringing in these rules at this point in the economic cycle should help in that respect. <\/p><p>The currency of the Union is still vulnerable to destabilising financial flows and credit bubbles in regional areas, and that may well  be currently happening in some European countries.  It is not happening here, in France, Spain, Portugal or Greece - it has happened already.  There has been talk about a property bubble arising in some of the northern European countries.  It is worth bearing in mind that these things can still happen.  They have happened in the past and history can repeat itself.<\/p><p>The Bill establishes the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on a statutory footing and everyone will praise that and say it is a great move but the fact of the matter is that it has been on a non-statutory footing for the past while.  I believe it has issued two major reports.  Those on the council have not been listened to; they have been completely dismissed by the Taoiseach and kind of dismissed by the Minister as well.  I wonder what these people who are highly regarded economists - not all of them are from Ireland, some of them have to fly over here to meetings - think when they produce this important information for the public to try to prevent the crisis we are in from happening again and to keep this country on the straight and narrow and they are not listened to by the Government.  One wonders what is the point of this.  Some of the reaction from Government to previous reports of the fiscal council has been insulting, to put it mildly.  <\/p><p>The fiscal council must become known and trusted by the public and the people must listen to what it says because those on it will not always say things that are palatable to the citizens.  They will be providing information in many cases that will not be at all palatable and that will result in further cuts than what the Government proposes.<\/p><p>We will support the Bill.  We support the fiscal treaty.  My party leader played a huge role in that referendum and I pay tribute to him for doing that.  It is partially his role in that respect that has allowed us to move forward and set out this Bill to comply with our European obligations to get it passed, as was the will of the people, and to move on to the other urgent matters that are on the Minister's agenda.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400015#O00200","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1352896200,"counter":132,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome to the House.  I was impressed by the words he used.  He talked about the need for sensible, prudent responsibility.  These were exactly the words we used last year when Senator Barrett proposed exactly this theme and I was very happy to support it last year.  The objective of this Bill must be accepted by everybody, I cannot believe anybody would disagree with it.  The concept of a balanced budget is very solid and sound but I am sceptical about whether these targets can they met and if it will be some time before they can be met.  This is seen by some as optics but it could be argued that it will limit our growth.  Even the IMF, in its report issued last month, suggested that it had miscalculated the effect of the austerity on the economy.  Clearly, it is not a science that is easy to define.  This means that consumer spending is being hit harder than originally assumed while unemployment is even more severe.  That means that the social, political and the economic effects of austerity are larger than expected.  Nobody disagrees with fiscal responsibility but there will be times where we will have make sure that we do not run into the same difficulties we have had in the past.<\/p><p>  We also have to bear in mind that this measure puts stricter rules in place which makes it harder for member states to spend their way out of trouble, which is very wise.  David McWilliams has written:<blockquote>Europe has 25 million unemployed and short-term interest rates in the core are negative.  If that doesn't scream at you the need for a fiscal expansion in the eurozone, I don't know what does!&quot;<\/blockquote><\/p> <p>Perhaps we are seeing an overall shift in policy making.  People must have money in their pockets to spend.  They need to get their confidence back and need to be encouraged to consume.  Should there be rules, therefore, in order that when the economy improves or goes beyond forecast, we will know what to do?  Instead of slashing taxes should we have rules to maintain certain taxes which might give more stability to the system and enable us to be better prepared for downturns?  When Charlie McCreevy was the Minister for Finance he introduced the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Should we also be looking at another rainy-day fund, which would also mean the Government would have more flexibility for dealing with sudden shocks, as in the current crisis?  <\/p><p>I am concerned that there is not enough diversity on the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, as it is the Minister for Finance of the day who makes the appointments.  How can we assume that the appointments are not politically biased or, indeed, divided up among the Government partners?  How do we restore faith in economic forecasting?  Economists are very fickle characters and it is not an exact science, so which ones do we trust?  Transparency is what we need at the very least.  The UK's Office for Budget Responsibility, which is the equivalent of our Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, answers parliamentary questions on forecasts and gives evidence to parliamentary committees.  We need that kind of openness here.  Why does our council not report to the Oireachtas?  On a side note, the OBR recently admitted poor forecasting, but I wonder how accurate and independent our body will prove to be.<\/p><p>The Germans have their own council of economic experts.  There were reports recently that they were asked by the French Government to draw up economic reform proposals for France.  While these reports might not be true, it would be more open to some sort of outside body to look over finances here and make proposals.  The fact is that so many decisions in terms of taxation or Government spending are politically motivated or have been in the past.  Politicians need to get re-elected and while members of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council are politically appointed, we need to get the brightest and best from outside to advise the Government.<\/p><p>At the time of the crisis in 2008, it was well documented how few economists there were in the Department of Finance.  We should be open to outside advice and I would like to think that the appointments would reflect that.  I am not really talking about the Minister's say in this, but this will last for some time.  As there will be other Ministers for Finance and other Governments, I would like to ensure that we stitch in some control on their appointments to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400015#O00300","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352896800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for Finance to the House.

I have received some notes from my officials and I will go down through them.  It was obviously a very constructive debate, which underlines the importance of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill.  The Bill will implement the key provisions of the stability treaty, as voted for by the people.  As Senator Reilly said, there might not have been any mass movement on the streets for this type of legislation but when it was put to the people there was a very strong majority in favour of it.  It is therefore not true to say that there is not public support for this measure.  We believe that the proposed rules are sensible, prudent and represent a sensible approach to budgeting.<\/p><p>A number of issues have been raised, while various proposals and queries have been put to me.  I would like to respond to them in due course.  Some of the responses will be more appropriate on Committee Stage but I will give an initial response now. <\/p><p>I welcome the support of Senator Darragh O'Brien and his party for the Bill.  I also welcome the support of Senator Barrett and his comments on the Bill.  Senator Darragh O'Brien raised the issue of the recapitalisation of the banks.  With regard to the comments about a solution to our banking debt, discussions are ongoing between Ireland, the ECB and other members of the troika.<\/p> <p>We will see how that works out.  I cannot be expected to negotiate over the airwaves or in public, but talks are ongoing.<\/p><p> Ireland is subject to an excessive deficit procedure decision requiring us to reduce our headline deficit to below 3% by 2015.  We are in line to do so and will continue with budgetary policies to get us to that position.  When we emerge from the programme we will be required to comply with the adjustment path towards our medium-term objective and, as such, we will be subject to the budgetary rule.  The fiscal council examined this recently, suggesting that based on current information and a number of technical economic assumptions, including tight expenditure control, Ireland may reach its medium-term objective as early as 2019.  However, caution must be taken with this forecast and as highlighted by the fiscal council in its report, there is great uncertainty about the structural position so far into the future.<\/p><p> I thank Senator Michael D'Arcy for his support and excellent speech, in which he spoke about the &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; reference in the Bill.  As outlined in the interpretations section of the Bill, &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; refer to a period where an unusual event occurs that is outside the control of the State and which has a major impact on the financial position of the general government.  This phrase can also refer to any unusual economic circumstances, such as those in which we currently find ourselves.  It is further specified that exceptional circumstances must be defined within the meaning of the Stability and Growth Pact to ensure we are complying with the essence of the pact.<\/p><p> In the event of a case of exceptional circumstances, we will set out the position to the European Commission in our stability programme update and our case will take full account of the assessments of the fiscal council under section 8(3)(<i>a<\/i>) as to whether exceptional circumstances exist.  The process that follows is that the Commission, in its assessment of our stability programme update, decides whether exceptional circumstances exist and ultimately includes a recommendation to ECOFIN, the final arbiters of whether the case comes within the definition of &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;.  In essence, we work towards a definition and send a report if we believe there are exceptional circumstances.  The Commission evaluates this and makes a recommendation to ECOFIN, which has the final decision.  If it finds in our favour and decides that exceptional circumstances exist, we get a reprieve from the terms of the Bill for the period in which exceptional circumstances prevail.<\/p><p> Beyond that explanation it is extremely difficult to provide a clear and unambiguous definition of the phrase.  We know exceptional circumstances when they arrive but we are not always in a position to describe them in advance.  There is enough in the Bill and process to ensure that a result in favour of the country would be achieved if we get into that kind of difficulty.  Rather than creating a definition that would be inconsistent with the treaty definition, the best course of action is to follow closely the definition provided in the treaty.<\/p><p> Senator Gilroy asked about the fiscal council reports and where the responsibility for action on the reports lies.  The reports and recommendations of the council are a matter for the Government to consider and I have undertaken to provide comprehensive responses to the reports.  I should also point out that the Government is required to comply with or explain if it disagrees with the council's assessments on exceptional circumstances and the need to deploy the correction mechanism and adherence to a correction plan.<\/p><p> Other Senators also raised this issue.  Representatives of the fiscal council have gone before the Oireachtas finance committees and participated in full discussions.  The council is not accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas because it is independent in the exercise of its functions but there is no reluctance to come before committees of the House, particularly the finance committee, for an exchange of views and to be subject to scrutiny.<\/p><p> The council does not have an executive function.  If the fiscal council produces a report which in its independent state indicates that the Government's forecasts are totally off the rails and the budgetary strategy is incorrect, it would not take very long for the Opposition to hold the Government to account.  It has independent input to public and Oireachtas debate, and that gives the council its authority.  It does not have any executive function in implementing the recommendations, as they are considered by the Government.<\/p><p> There has been much debate about the structural deficit calculation.  This must be done on the basis of a harmonised methodology agreed by member states.  This is not ideal for small open economies like Ireland but we can and do contribute to the revision of the methodology.  As the process develops, the Irish input is being taken into account and we may get to a point where there is a more refined definition of structural deficit.  It is an issue that is hard to measure but very often the fact that there is a structural deficit is the base position for dealing with it.  I accept that definition is difficult in that area.<\/p><p> Senator Reilly's views mirror the arguments put forward by her party during the fiscal stability treaty referendum campaign.  It was the party's entitlement to oppose the referendum on the fiscal stability treaty but circumstances have now changed; the people considered all the arguments and supported the treaty.  As I have indicated, the purpose of the Bill is to implement the stability treaty.  I suggest to the Senator that her party is now positioning itself to hold out against the express will of the people and, in effect, to talk down to a very significant majority of the people on the insistence that Sinn F\u00e9in knows better.<\/p><p> The Senator also mentioned a point made by her colleague in the other House that the remit of the fiscal council is quite narrow and that it should have a wider mandate to take in social and economic issues.  The council has been set up for a specific job and has been given the resources to focus on it.  It is not the only organisation to proffer advice to the Government and the public.  For example, the Economic and Social Research Institute and the National Economic and Social Council report at considerable length with considerable frequency on all aspects of policy development, assessing social and economic impacts of policies put in place by the Government.  We do not need to duplicate processes by widening the remit of the fiscal council.<\/p><p> Some comments seem to indicate confusion about the debt rule.  I remind Senators that the debt rule specifies that when the level of general government debt exceeds 60% of GDP, the Government must reduce debt by one twentieth of the difference between the level and 60%.  It is not one twentieth of the whole debt, as I indicated in my original speech.  If the debt is 100% of GDP, the calculation is done on 40%, taking 2% off each year.  It is a straightforward concept.<\/p><p> I acknowledge Senator Barrett's comments on fiscal responsibility in general, particularly the Fiscal Responsibility (Statement) Bill 2011.  On the single supervisory mechanism, a clear timetable was set out at the October European Council by the Heads of State and Government.  It was decided that the legislative proposal to establish this would be dealt with as a priority no later than 1 January 2013.  The single supervisory mechanism will come into operation during the course of 2013.  The European Central Bank has suggested that the implementation of the supervisory rule could take between six and 12 months.  Some progress has been made and the Commission published a paper in that respect.  In simple rather than legalistic terms, the legal mandate to regulate would be vested in the European Central Bank.<\/p> <p>The bank will have the legal competence and then it will directly regulate some of the large international banks.  However, it will decentralise the function to the local supervisory authorities in respect of many other banks with the division to be decided as the process develops.<\/p><p>It is not possible to say all the banks in Ireland should be regulated from Dame Street and all the small banks in Spain should be regulated from Madrid and, therefore, a rule book has to be put in place that will apply common rules across the banking industry with a legal mandate from Frankfurt.  There are approximately 6,000 banks altogether and that rule book will have to be supported by instruction manuals for the local regulators and by protocols.  All that work is being done in advance of the single supervisory authority being put in place.<\/p><p>The other decision which is likely to be made - because in the political debate it is clear what politicians are thinking - is that there must be no spillover between the two functions of the ECB.  In other words, the bank's function as the monetary authority must be kept entirely separate from its function as the supervisory authority.

It provides for the repeal of the Civil Defence Act 2002, the dissolution of the Civil Defence Board and the transfer of its functions and other responsibilities back to the Department of Defence.  The purpose of the Bill is to bring the management, development and administration of Civil Defence at national level back into the Department of Defence where it lay from when the organisation was founded in 1950.  The organisation was designed to undertake non-combatant activities and to take measures to defend persons and property against an attack on the State from hazards such as radioactive fall-out or biological or chemical warfare.  In the context of current policy on bringing the functions of many State agencies back into their parent Departments, the Government has decided that the functions of the board should once again become a function of a branch within the Department of Defence.<\/p><p>  As Senators will be aware, the board was established following the passage of the Civil Defence Act in 2002.  The stated purposes of that Act were to update Civil Defence legislation generally and to establish a board to oversee and manage the future development of Civil Defence at national level.  Apart from establishing a management board to take over the administrative and developmental roles of Civil Defence from the Department and prescribing all of the various duties and obligations associated with a non-commercial State authority, the Act of 2002 did not make any fundamental changes to the governing structures.  Policy formulation remained with the Minister.  The key relationship for effective Civil Defence operations, that being between local authorities and the organisation at national level, was not altered by the Act of 2002.<\/p><p>  I am pleased to say the Bill I am commending will not alter those fundamental structures that have served Civil Defence well over many years and supported the voluntary ethos that has been the hallmark of the organisation since its foundation.  The transfer of functions back into the Department of Defence will assist in removing a tier of administration which arose as the board was established as a non-commercial State authority with corporate governance requirements.<\/p><p>  I express my sincere gratitude to each and every person who gave up their time to serve with distinction on the Civil Defence Board and equally to the members of each of the statutory committees of the board.  Unlike other State authorities, service on the Civil Defence Board was voluntary and attracted no remuneration for members, including the chairman, other than the normal Civil Service expenses for attending meetings.  I commend the board and its committees on their contributions to the development of Civil Defence in the past nine years in bringing forward plans and proposals which have driven the evolution of the organisation.<\/p><p>  While we live in very different times from those of 1950s, what has not changed is the voluntary ethos which is the hallmark of Civil Defence.  People from all walks of life willingly give up their time to be trained over many months to professional standards.  This training enables them to effectively support the front-line services.  These volunteers can be called away from their families at any hour to respond to emergencies in their communities.  We only have to recall the sustained response from Civil Defence volunteers in virtually every county in Ireland to alleviate the effects of the severe weather in recent winters, not to mention the floods in Dublin, Wicklow and Monaghan in October last year.  More recently, we have to admire the comprehensive response of Civil Defence to the flooding in the Cork area in June this year.<\/p><p>  I wish to highlight the rescue operation following the tragic sinking of the trawler, <i>Tit Bonhomme<\/i>, in Glandore Harbour, County Cork, in January last with the loss of five lives.  In an operation lasting more than 27 days, an average of 36 Civil Defence volunteers per day, drawn from nine local authority areas, assisted with the search for the missing trawler men.  An extensive shore-based search operation was co-ordinated by a joint Civil Defence and Coast Guard operations centre.  Boat crews from Civil Defence, the Coast Guard, Naval Service divers and Garda divers also conducted searches in the inner harbour area under the direction of the Naval Service.  The regional inter-agency emergency response vehicle was deployed and manned by Civil Defence personnel monitoring the search efforts.  Their training and professionalism allowed the volunteers to work seamlessly in support of the three front-line services both on land and offshore in a wide range of duties.  Almost 8,000 volunteer hours were given by Civil Defence to that operation alone, and I commend all the volunteers who were involved in that operation.<\/p><p>  It was very apparent that the training, experience and motivation of all Civil Defence units involved contributed greatly to the successful recovery of the missing fishermen.  Their efforts were rightly recognised in the course of a visit by President Michael D. Higgins to Union Hall last April where he expressed his sympathy to the families affected by the tragedy and his gratitude to all the personnel and agencies involved in the search and recovery operation.  I note also that the Taoiseach visited the harbour during that tragic time.<\/p><p>  In addition to assisting the front-line services in emergency situations, Civil Defence volunteers are very much in evidence throughout the year providing assistance at community events nationwide from local field events, to welcoming home our Olympic athletes, to major events such as the Volvo Ocean Race and the Tall Ships.<\/p> <p>Volunteers provide assistance in a multiplicity of roles, including casualty, first aid and rescue, both on land and in rivers and lakes.  They provide communications, mapping and search skills, and provide welfare for both emergency personnel and displaced persons.  They also work with the Garda, establishing evacuation and reception centres on behalf of local authorities.<\/p><p>All volunteers ask is that they are recognised and supported in their continued efforts to support local communities and that is precisely what is intended with this Bill.  As part of the Department of Defence, Civil Defence at national level will now be fully integrated with the planning and implementation of our response capability for major emergencies.  This will be achieved by working through the Office of Emergency Planning and the Defence Forces.  It will no longer have to devote valuable resources to complying with its own governance requirements, but will be able to devote all its energies to the core business of Civil Defence, which is training volunteers to the highest professional health and safety standards.<\/p><p>I am delighted that we have succeeded in maintaining the current level of funding for Civil Defence at \u20ac5.585 million per annum in the face of reduced funding to almost all other State bodies in the current economic climate.  We see this investment, in supporting Civil Defence activities, as tremendous value for money and it is our intention to maintain that level of funding in so far as possible.<\/p><p>In seeking to capture the wider strategic perspective I mentioned earlier for the future development of Civil Defence, the Department of Defence will establish and chair a forum, comprising the main players in Civil Defence and from the wider emergency response community.  The purpose of the forum will be to assist the Civil Defence branch of the Department to consider the major issues affecting, or likely to affect, its development.  Central to these deliberations, of course, will be the involvement of representatives of the Civil Defence officers and the volunteers who are based in each local authority area.<\/p><p>I now turn to the main provisions of the Bill.  Sections 2 and 3 deal with the dissolution of the Civil Defence Board, the date for which will be set by order.  Sections 4 to 6, inclusivje, will ensure that the transfer of land, property, rights and liabilities, leases and licenses from the board back to Minister will take place.  Section 7 ensures that any claim in respect of any loss or injury arising before dissolution day will lie against the Minister and not the board.  Furthermore, any legal proceedings pending to which the board is a party will continue with the substitution of the Minister in the proceedings.  Section 8 makes provisions for functions commenced but not completed by the board before its dissolution.  All functions partially completed will be carried on by the Minister.  All moneys, stocks, shares and securities registered to the board prior to the dissolution day will be transferred to the Minister.  The income of the board was derived from the grant-in-aid from the defence Vote.  No shares or securities were registered to the board.<\/p><p>Section 9 provides that the former director general of the board will submit, within six months of dissolution, the final accounts of the board to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  Furthermore, he or she must also submit to the Minister the final annual report of the board within nine months and the Minister is required to, as soon as practicable thereafter, lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>The transfer of staff and the director general back from the board to the Department of Defence is dealt with in section 10 while section 11 ensures that any contract or agreement in force before dissolution day between the board and any other person or body shall continue in force in the name of the Minister.  Section 12 deals with Civil Defence plans and sets out the requirement for local authorities to submit a plan within 12 months of dissolution to the Minister.  The components of the plan are clearly set out for the authorities, as well as a requirement for them to review the plan within three years.<\/p><p>Section 13 amends section 221 of the Local Government Act of 2001 to ensure that annual reports prepared by local authorities will make suitable reference to the performance of its functions relating to Civil Defence, including the expenditure incurred by the authorities in carrying out those functions, while section 14 continues the Department of Defence's grant of funds provided by the Oireachtas for the local authorities for the purpose of defraying expenditure incurred by the authorities in carrying out Civil Defence functions.<\/p><p>The recruitment of Civil Defence members by the local authorities is dealt with in section 15, while the requirement for and the details to be contained within the Civil Defence members register are outlined in section 16.  Section 17 repeals the 2002 Civil Defence Act and section 18 deals with Short Title, collective citation and commencement.<\/p><p>The Bill will provide Civil Defence with the ideal platform to strengthen its capacity to continue to develop as a first-class second-line emergency response service while retaining its voluntary ethos and continuing with its community support activities.  I am very pleased to submit this legislation for the consideration of the House.  I look forward to hearing the views and contributions of the Members in their deliberations and reflections on the Bill which I commend to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400019#T00800","speaker":"1098","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352898900,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire St\u00e1it chun an Bhille seo a phl\u00e9.  The Civil Defence organisation is one of the most important organisations in the country.  It was established in 1950 to provide a structure for giving a civil response on the potential hazards that might arise during a time of war.  That obviously came just after the completion of the Second World War.  Civil Defence is made up of 4,500 trained active members and up to 6,500 members when volunteers are included.  Volunteers under the Civil Defence organisation carried out exceptional work in 2009 and that work should not go unrecognised.  Civil Defence deserves the full respect and support of the State, given the important work it undertakes in conjunction with local authorities, the Army and Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.<\/p><p>Fianna F\u00e1il will not oppose the Bill, even though we have some concerns that the valuable external input, which has been represented on the board in the past ten years, could be lost given the proposed restructuring under the legislation.  The late S\u00e9amus Brennan as Government Whip and Minister of State at the Department of Defence introduced the Civil Defence Act 2002.  That Act provided for the establishment of the dedicated State-funded Civil Defence Board which was representative of the principal stakeholders, such as the relevant Departments, State agencies, county managers, Civil Defence officers and volunteers together with expertise from outside.  That Act followed the previous legislation, the Air-Raid Precautions Act 1939 and a number of powers orders in 1946.  The legislation was updated to give a more accurate reflection of the Civil Defence organisation in 2002.<\/p> <p>The Civil Defence Bill, which will not be opposed by Fianna F\u00e1il, will realign Civil Defence under the auspices of the Department of Defence.  As the Minister of State outlined, this will see a transfer of functions, property, assets, liabilities and other responsibilities to the Department of Defence.  The savings to be accrued by the move appear to be approximately \u20ac60,000, which is approximately 1.1% of the almost \u20ac5.6 million budget of Civil Defence.<\/p><p>I will not speak at length on the role of Civil Defence because it should be taken as read.  Every Senator will agree the work carried out by the Civil Defence organisation deserves our full respect and gratitude.  In my county many of the volunteers and those employed by Civil Defence carry out work at short notice for charitable or festival events such as the Donegal rally, or when there is an emergency.  They are at our beck and call.  They work closely with coastal and mountain rescue units.  Their future role must be secured, as must the budget for Civil Defence.  No cuts should be made in any budget for Civil Defence given the absolute necessity of having such a resource available to the State.<\/p><p>Under the 2002 Act the Civil Defence Board was empowered to initiate and foster contacts with other Departments and State authorities, external national and international educational and research institutions as well as utilising its own resources to enable it to develop optimum standards for the training of volunteers.  Is this capacity likely to be curtailed by the board's return to the Department of Defence?  I ask the Minister of State to contemplate this.  Savings of \u20ac60,000 are outlined in the Bill, but the Bill does not outline the cost associated with the reconfiguration of Civil Defence.  Is there a cost and, if so, will it be front-loaded?<\/p><p>The fact that Civil Defence works closely with local authorities throughout the country means its response can be immediate and locally focused.  What guarantee, if any, can be provided that this will continue?  The point of government most local to the citizen works closely with Civil Defence which means it responds quickly.  Will this be jeopardised in any way?<\/p><p>The 2002 Act also sought to strengthen and maintain the volunteer ethos of Civil Defence and provided for the voice of the volunteer to be clearly available on the management board.  How will the voice of the volunteer continue to be heard under the new Bill?  I would be grateful if the Minister of State outlines responses to these questions when he sums up at the end of Second Stage.  Fianna F\u00e1il will not oppose the Bill.  We do not see any reason to do so.  However, we would welcome clarification on the points I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400020#U00200","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352899500,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his comprehensive overview of the situation and what is envisaged and proposed in the Bill.  I also welcome Fianna F\u00e1il's support.  Senator O'Domhnaill's questions are understandable and I am sure we will all have a few questions.  I like the Bill because it fits with everything proposed by the Government.  It removes duplication in so far as any exists, and perhaps it does, because it is a separate agency.  The board has been answerable to the Department and the Minister.<\/p><p>It is good and logical that where necessary, as in this case, agencies are taken back within the Department where they should be.  As the Minister of State outlined, Civil Defence has had a separate board since 1950 and this will remove the bureaucracy associated with an independent board and the corporate governance legal requirements.  For these reasons I greatly welcome the Bill.<\/p><p>We salute the great work and voluntary effort of all involved through the years.  The Minister of State outlined the great work undertaken by Civil Defence in recent tragedies.  When it is within the Department, activity will be more focused and co-ordination will be better because of the involvement of the Defence Forces.  I look forward to the Minister of State summing up on Second Stage and answering the questions posed by Senator \u00d3 Domhnaill.<\/p><p>As in a sense Civil Defence was a branch of the Department, there will be no change.  Political accountability to the Oireachtas for the discharge of the board's functions was with the Minister, and the Secretary General of the Department will remain the Accounting Officer for all expenditure on the board's part.  The Minister of State outlined how within six to nine months its operation will be wrapped up with a proper audit.  Shortly after taking office the Minister decided the functions of the board should be transferred to the Department, which fits with the Government's programme and I greatly welcome it.  The Minister of State indicated this solution will save approximately \u20ac60,000 per annum from the Civil Defence budget of \u20ac5.6 million.  This is a small amount but the saving is welcome.  Every saving made in the present climate must be welcomed.  I could make a number of other points but I look forward to hearing the Minister of State and we can further tease out issues if necessary on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400021#V00200","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1352899500,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire.

As he stated, the Bill deals with the functions of the Civil Defence Board and provides for its functions to be transferred from the board to the Department.  On balance this seems to be a very sensible proposal and the Bill seems to be sensible legislation.  I have some concerns with regard to the application of this at local level, a point to which I will return presently.<\/p><p>Civil Defence offers backup, and we have heard numerous examples given, to the full-time emergency services and provides casualty, rescue, auxiliary fire and welfare services when needed, usually at times of major emergencies.  The work of Civil Defence is largely voluntary and those who give up their time to serve their fellow citizens in times of emergency, danger and tragedy deserve our commendation.  I pay tribute to the work done by Civil Defence.  We could turn on &quot;Reeling in the Years&quot; on television for any year and there is every likelihood we will see the men and women of Civil Defence, with their distinctive blue triangular logo, assisting in rescue efforts following large tragic accidents or assisting in flood relief efforts and various other emergencies.  They are versatile, reliable and courageous and deserve all of our praise and support.  I hope in the new framework whereby Civil Defence is under the auspices of the Department rather than the Civil Defence Board that Civil Defence will still be able to provide as good a service as it has since its establishment in 1950.<\/p> <p>How will the change impact on the way Civil Defence functions and co-operates with local authorities?  The good relationship which existed meant that the response was always very quick and their local knowledge was invaluable in ensuring that the resources of Civil Defence were used effectively.  I hope this can be maintained.  Has the Minister given any thought to how that might remain the case?  How will he ensure that local voices are heard at a national level and there is a good level of feedback?  I appreciate the Minister reassured the D\u00e1il previously that the connection between Civil Defence and the local authorities will continue and will not be affected in any shape or form, which is positive.  However, some elaboration on the point would be welcome and I ask him to highlight how it will be maintained.<\/p><p>Responding to local emergencies is where town councils came into their own.  A good example is Clonakilty, west Cork, where town councillors were to the fore in directing and supporting responses and assisting local residents and businesses.  I regret that the council will shortly no longer be part of our system of local government and this is one respect in which they will be missed.  I accept that previous positive measures in terms of the relationship between the Civil Defence Board and the local authorities will be retained, with the Department taking the place of the board. <\/p><p>Section 12 provides that each local authority, within a year of the board being dissolved, must submit a new Civil Defence plan to the Minister.  Section 14 enables the Minister to pay each local authority a grant out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas for expenditure related to the performance of Civil Defence functions.  It is positive that savings can be achieved in this area without a significant effect on the provision of services.  I understand savings of \u20ac60,000 per annum will be achieved, which I welcome.  My party holds the view that savings which can be achieved in areas such as these, which are related to community services, should be directed back into the community rather than making its way towards bondholders or general coffers as so much of the public finances seems to do.  Will the Minister of State state whether these savings will be directed towards the community?  Sinn F\u00e9in previously attempted to ensure that money was ring-fenced for community use.  We brought forward proposals to ensure the proceeds of crime, confiscated by CAB, were ring-fenced for use in the community concerned.  This is a sensible proposal and I ask the Minister of State to explain why he believes such ring-fencing of funds cannot be brought about. <\/p><p>It is also positive that the legislation may affect the operation of the Civil Defence Board in terms of the operation of emergency responses.  Following the publication of the Bill, the Chairman of the Civil Defence Board, Mr. Brian Spain, appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  He stated that the decision to bring Civil Defence at national level back into the Department of Defence is a positive development for the organisation and moves Civil Defence more towards the centre of emergency planning arrangements at the highest level.  He continued that the director general now regularly attends meetings of the Government task force on emergency planning along with colleagues from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.  It is reassuring to know that Civil Defence is happy with the change.<\/p><p>It is vital that the Government ensures that Civil Defence is adequately resourced in terms of training.  Mr. Bill Smith, at the Oireachtas joint committee, noted that there was a capacity problem locally in terms of accommodation and training facilities.  My party feels this needs to be examined and rectified.  <\/p><p>Go ginear\u00e1lta, cuirimid f\u00e1ilte roimh an reachta\u00edocht.

On my first cursory examination of the legislation I feared that it meant the abolition of Civil Defence.  On closer scrutiny I realised that it is practical legislation which aims to transfer the functions of Civil Defence back to the Department.<\/p><p>Historically, one must examine why and when Civil Defence was set up.  It was established in the years following the Second World War.  It is well documented that many people who joined Civil Defence were former members of what was then known as the local defence force, LDF, of which many of my family were members.  The LDF was involved in activities to protect the country at a time known as the Emergency.  The organisation became Civil Defence and my late uncle, Michael Kavanagh, was one of the founding members of a unit in Carrick-on-Suir.  At that time Civil Defence carried out training exercises practically every Sunday morning in each area, including the monitoring of aircraft activity.  The activities were all documented and sent to its headquarters in Dublin.<\/p><p>Civil Defence has a long history and it operated without a board for 52 years.  I have done some research and tried to establish why the board was set up.  I have read about some of the reasons for it but I fear that most of them were political.  We have moved on and the Government has decided to dissolve the board and bring Civil Defence back within the remit of the Department.  I welcome the measure which is not about saving money, but creating efficiencies.  I also welcome the fact, as the Minister of State clearly outlined today, that every effort will be made to safeguard the budget of almost \u20ac6 million per annum for Civil Defence.  Some speakers raised the issue of the voice of the board.  The Minister of State has clearly outlined that a forum will be set up where all interested parties in Civil Defence can have a voice.  They can express their views and have their policy views implemented by the new system controlled by the Department.<\/p><p>The activities of Civil Defence have been well outlined, particularly by Senator Brian \u00d3 Domhnaill.  In my area of Carrick-on-Suir, Civil Defence, right through the 1990s, helped and supported hundreds of families who were affected by flooding on an almost annual basis until the problem was alleviated.  The organisation is also engaged in other activities and is strongly associated with a local cycling club.  Many people will know that Carrick-on-Suir is the home of cycling in Ireland and the famous cyclist, Sean Kelly, hails from my town along with many others.  Civil Defence and cycling are synonymous with the town, because the town hosts a cycling event on St. Patrick's Day.  Civil Defence is also involved in other activities in the area, such as motorbike racing, and recently I attended a point-to-point race where Civil Defence was present to monitor the crowd and provide assistance.  <\/p><p>I welcome the legislation and I am glad it has been welcomed across the House.  The Bill makes sense because we are in an era where we must examine every penny that is spent.  I know the legislation is not predominantly about saving money but there is an element of it.  There is a relatively new state-of-the-art building in Roscrea that is in the ownership of Civil Defence.  People who follow political history may understand why it was located there.  What will become of the building?  Is there a future for it?  Taxpayers' money was invested in the property and there should be a future for it.<\/p><p>The Minister of State referred to various sections of the Bill.  It is practical, to the point and deals with the issue.  I commend the Minister of State for introducing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400022#W00300","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1352900700,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for their constructive contributions and comments during the debate.  As I stated in my opening remarks the purpose of the Bill is to return the management, development and administration of Civil Defence to the Department of Defence.  On that note, Senator Landy discussed the setting up of the Civil Defence Board in 2002 which he questioned, as I did in 2002, notwithstanding the great work the board has carried out since 2001, on which I commend it.  I am very aware of the great work that Civil Defence does in my own county and individual Senators outlined the work that Civil Defence does in their counties.  On that note, Senator \u00d3 Domhnaill spoke about the relationship between Civil Defence, the local authorities and other agencies.  I can assure him that the Bill will strengthen these relationships.  The Bill will ensure that Civil Defence can turn over a new leaf.  It will make a great impact on the organisation.  Relationships can be improved.  There are great relationships between Civil Defence and the local authorities in every county.<br \/><b><\/b> Senator Landy referred to the flooding in Carrick-on-Suir and Senator \u00d3 Domhnaill referred to festivals in his constituency and how Civil Defence played its part.  I have the same experience in my constituency.<\/p><p>  Members asked about the response times and operational capacity of Civil Defence.  I can reassure Members that nothing of that nature will change because of the Bill.  I believe the measure contained in the Bill will be welcomed by all the members of Civil Defence.  I attended a recent Civil Defence training event in Enniscorthy and spoke to the members there.  They have a genuine interest in doing voluntary Civil Defence work for their community.  They are very excited about the opportunity to strengthen the role of Civil Defence in the community and its work as a first class, second line emergency response, while retaining its voluntary ethos and continuing its community support services.  There will be no additional financial costs.  We will make a net saving by enacting this legislation.<\/p><p>  A Member referred to the current training standards of Civil Defence volunteers.  That will remain.  It is important that every member of Civil Defence is trained to a very high standard.  Nobody knows what they will face at any time.  I outlined the reasons that Civil Defence was set up originally, and for that reason the volunteers must be trained to a very high standard.  Senator Trevor \u00d3 Clochartaigh referred to its operational work and whether volunteers will have the same say in the organisation and have their voices heard.  Voluntary organisations must listen to the members on the ground because if they do not do so, the organisation has failed.  The voice of the voluntary members of Civil Defence has been and will continue to be listened to when Civil Defence transfers to the Department of Defence.  It is important the Minister, the Minister of State and the officials in the Department listen to the volunteers.  We have listened to their views.<\/p><p>  We are trying to retain the current budget of Civil Defence.  Volunteers give freely of their time, which we respect.  It will be difficult to retain the current budget in these challenging economic times, but the volunteers give not just an hour or two a week but often their weekends.  That must be recognised.  The Minister, his officials and I as Minister of State very much appreciate that. <\/p><p>  I look forward to the Committee Stage debate in both Houses.  Members will have the opportunity table amendments, which I assure them will be discussed in detail.  We will listen to their arguments.<\/p><p>  The Bill will be very positive for Civil Defence and will bring new enthusiasm into the work of the organisation.  I thank Members for their contributions which have been most instructive and helpful.  I look forward to a constructive Committee Stage debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400023#X00100","speaker":"1098"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1352900700,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1352900700,"counter":175,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400023#X00300","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1352900700,"counter":176,"content":"<p>On Tuesday, 20 November 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400023#X00400","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1352900700,"counter":177,"content":"<p>  Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 20 November 2012.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400023#X00600","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1352900700,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.20 p.m. and resumed at 4.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Measures to Address Bullying: Motion","time":1352901000,"counter":179,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400024#Y00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1352901000,"counter":180,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400024#Y00200","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1352901000,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote><br \/>That Seanad \u00c9ireann- expresses deepest sympathies to the families and friends of all those who have lost their lives so tragically to suicide recently;<br \/>- recognises that tackling bullying in all its forms is a key objective of this Government;<br \/>- notes the existence of resources such as <i>internetsafety.ie<\/i> and <i>webwise.ie<\/i>, which have been produced to provide parents, teachers and students with Internet safety advice;<br \/>- acknowledges that the anti-bullying forum hosted by the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in May 2011 was the first of its kind in Ireland;<br \/>- further acknowledges the establishment of a working group which will produce an action plan on bullying for the Minister for Education and Skills in the coming weeks;<br \/>- welcomes the improvements which technology has brought to our lives, and the improved learning which takes place in our schools as a result;<br \/>- understands that parents, siblings, teachers, service providers of social media and the wider community all have a vital role to play in combating cyberbullying; and<br \/>- notes the intention of the Minister for Education and Skills to publish the action plan on bullying before Christmas.&quot;.<\/blockquote>I again offer my deepest sympathy to all the families which have lost loved ones to suicide recently, particularly those who have been traumatised by cyberbullying, which may have influenced decisions at a crucial time.  It is to be recognised and welcomed that in the programme for Government the issue of bullying in all its forms is listed as a high priority.  At the same time the fact that it is included as a discrete area in the programme is significant in that it recognises bullying as an acute if not a chronic problem in our schools and our society.<\/p><p>  While researching this topic I have been struck by the number of valuable resources available on the Internet.  Nevertheless, the issue of bullying is a bit like the short story by Italo Calvino, &quot;The Argentine Ant&quot;.  Everybody had their own sovereign method of eradicating the problem of the infestation and each was tried in turn with great hopes of success but none worked.  The fact that this story is an allegory for the Nazi occupation of Italy is also appropriate because bullying is also about power and the abuse of such power, insidious dehumanisation and destruction of personality.  It is also very difficult to deal with it.<\/p><p>  Professor Mona O'Moore of Trinity College Dublin, one of our foremost experts on bullying, has argued that we should take the shame from bullying, which is a complex statement.  In other words, we should recognise bullying as a part of human nature.  Most people have either bullied or been bullied at some stage, and some have experienced both.  We should take that as a first principle and deal with the problem from that perspective.  In that way parents, bullied persons and the bullies will be &quot;freed from the burden of shame&quot;.  This is theory, and it is difficult to see how parents or victims could muster that level of detachment in a crisis.<\/p><p>  It is, therefore, necessary to have in place in schools well thought-out plans and policies.  There is a statutory requirement for schools to have a code of discipline and a discrete policy on bullying.  In this new scenario, there is a need for schools to update fully their plans and polices in this regard.<\/p> <p>The Minister shares this view and that is why, on taking office, he hosted an anti-bullying forum in May 2012 , which was the first of its kind in Ireland, and subsequently established the working group to produce an action plan on bullying which I hope will report shortly.<\/p><p>Technology had brought great change into our lives in every sphere and most of that change has been for the good.  It has greatly aided teaching and learning in schools.  However, the newest form of bullying is known as cyberbullying, which refers to the bullying and harassment of others by means of new electronic technologies, primarily mobile phones and the Internet.  It is emerging as a significant problem that can threaten the health, well-being and attainment of victims and adversely affect the climate of the peer group and ethos of the school.  There is also the problem of &quot;the digital divide&quot; between young people and adults.  Many parents feel helpless in dealing with this issue and limited in how they can support their child.  Sometimes, the greatest fear of children is that their mobile phone may be taken away from them if they tell their parents, leading to further isolation and, therefore, they say nothing.<\/p><p>Another problem is that parents sometimes cannot accept that their child is a bully and rather than contact between parents being part of the solution, it becomes part of the problem.  We have to explore how that can be changed.  It is worth noting that two thirds of bullying is still attributable to traditional means.  While we should focus on cyberbullying, we cannot engage in &quot;the politics of the last atrocity&quot; to quote John Hume.  We must be proactive rather than reactive.  It is essential, therefore, that a whole school approach to bullying be firmly adopted at the policy stage, which should include whole school fora.  The Minister should suggest that to schools because sometimes the consultations on school policy, given the demands on schools, may not be as strong as they should be.  In this instance, it is essential because bullying can comprise pupil on pupil, pupil on teacher, teacher on pupil and teacher on teacher.  A range of issues need to be considered.<\/p><p>Bullying is one of the most difficult problems to deal with in schools.  I found it one of the most difficult problems to get my head around as a school principal for 30 years.  I do not in any way want to minimise how difficult the issue is to address but that does not mean we should fail to make every effort to have a new beginning to deal with bullying in schools.  Most bullying happens outside school.   It is both an innate and learned behaviour.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House to debate this issue.  I have great admiration for what he is doing in this regard.  The more preventative measures that are implemented, the less bullying there will be.  It is about policy, ethos and practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400024#Y00300","speaker":"1166","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352901300,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I second the motion, which I welcome.  I also welcome the Minister to the House.  I have been in the House for approximately 18 months and every day I attend, I hear stories about child abuse, the banks in trouble, the debt people are enduring, the economy, suicide, unemployment and drug and alcohol abuse.  It seems day after day, session after session, our society is dealing with an endless number of social problems.  It appears there is a bleak future but, at the same time, when I put on the blinkers, I can identify a great deal of good happening in our society through sports, art and entertainment.  The recent deaths of the two young girls in counties Leitrim and Donegal and that of the Irish girl in Connecticut only last year have highlighted cyberbullying and the devastation it is causing for the families and communities who have to deal with it.  Cyberbullying is the silent destroyer, as it destroys individuals and families.<\/p><p>Bullying is nothing new; it is even mentioned in the Bible.  It goes back to the early days of our Lord.  We have physical and psychological bullying and now we have cyberbullying.  There is no single clear profile of a bully.  Bullies are young, old, men, women, children and leaders in our society.  It crosses all genders, age, race and creeds.  Do people bully because of jealousy or insecurity?  Does it give them power or make them feel better?  Do they do it out of fear or are they looking for attention to address an underlying problem they might have?  Do they realise the devastation they cause for other people at the click of a finger? <\/p><p>I know what it is like to be bullied.  I was bullied growing up on the streets of Drimnagh where I was afraid of my life to go outside the hall door day after day, night after day for fear I would be attacked.  The top of a petrol can came crashing through the window and split my mother's head having been thrown by young bullies trying to get at me because they were jealous.  I was bullied in school.  I was beaten relentlessly and I missed school for months on end because I was bullied not by a student but by a teacher.  I was bullied in the business community.  I am aware of the despair I suffered following those experiences over the years but the one thing I had going for me was I was able to speak to somebody about it.  I spoke to my parents and I spoke to my coaches at the time.<\/p><p>The young people enduring cyberbullying have nowhere to go.  It is the silent destroyer.  Bullying is repeated verbal, physical and psychological aggression perpetrated by individuals and groups against individuals and groups.  We have all grown up being slagged but there is a big difference between being slagged and being bullied.  One can overcome being slagged because it will make one resilient, tough and aggressive but cyberbullying, the silent destroyer, is evil and faceless.  We welcomed information technology, IT, into the 21st century, particularly in the context of commerce and communications.  For example, we can talk to our sons, daughters and other family members around the world.  The problem with IT nowadays is accessibility to the Internet through mobile phones, smartphones text messaging, FaceTime, Bebo and Ask.fm.<\/p> <p>Children are now engaging in society in ways previously unimagined.  We need a serious look at how to regulate the industry, including legalising it.  We are looking for parental and legal responsibility and for responsibility in the industry.  From recent research, I realise that 25% of children in primary school are on Facebook.  Some of them are as young as eight years old, yet Facebook policy is that one must be 13 years of age to sign up.  Where is the regulation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400025#Z00200","speaker":"1165","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352901900,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Where are the parents?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400026#AA00200","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1352901900,"counter":186,"content":"<p>Precisely.  Do people who engage in bullying know the damage they are causing, the lives they are destroying, the humiliation and isolation and low self-esteem they are causing?  They use intimidation and aggression to feel that power but it hides other issues.  We need to rethink tactics on dealing with bullying.  We welcome the anti-bullying forum established by the Minister and we note that it is not just about cyberbullying but also homophobic bullying and racism.  We welcome the fact that the Minister is engaging students, educators, parents and academics and is identifying policies and practices.  We need practical steps to tackle bullying.<\/p><p>We also welcome the research centre of Professor Mona O'Moore in Trinity College Dublin and the five areas she is working on, including national strategy, teacher training, a media campaign, national advisory boards and legislation.  Dr. O'Moore referred to the ABCs, namely, avoiding aggression, being tolerant and care for others.  In my points for life campaign, through the medium of physical education in schools, I spoke about ABCs, meaning agility, balance and co-ordination, and cardiovascular.  Through the work I am doing with the Department in this area, which is going quite well, we can incorporate the bullying tactic and how to deal with it through the medium of physical activity education in sports in school.  I thank the Minister for his attention and the work he is doing to attack this issue progressively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400026#AA00300","speaker":"1165"},{"type":"speech","time":1352901900,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the motion and the initiative taken by my Fine Gael colleagues in tabling it.  Fianna F\u00e1il fully supports it and has not tabled an amendment.  It is important for my party to support it and not to put the matter to a vote.<\/p><p>I express my sympathy and that of my colleagues to the families of those who have lost loved ones to suicide in recent times, including Ciara Pugsley and Erin Gallagher.  Some Members were present in the audiovisual room when Ciara's dad, Jonathan, gave a touching account of his family's experience on the issue.  In the gentlest, most dignified way, he put it up to all of us to work together and co-operate on all sides of the House to ensure effective strategies are in place to tackle bullying.  We owe it to the families affected by this to ensure we do everything we can to ensure that is done.<\/p><p>Bullying is a major problem.  As Senator Eamonn Coghlan pointed out, it is not a new problem but it has new forms.  Physical bullying, which makes up the majority of bullying incidents, means that even though kids may dread going to school, they know they will get out the gate and can go home.  If they are being bullied in other physical environments, they can find some space where the bullies cannot get to.  However, that is not the case with Facebook or text messages and the advent of cyberbullying means our young people can be persecuted 24 hours a day and cannot get away from it.  Statistics show that cyberbullying is a much smaller aspect of the problem but in many respects it is more severe because it is impossible for young people to get away from it.  The recent worldwide survey of Headstrong showed the extent of bullying.  Adolescents were asked questions about their personal experience and over 40% said they had been bullied at some point.  It is quite shocking and amounts to almost half of all young people on a monthly, weekly or daily basis, which means it is constant bullying and intimidation.<\/p><p>Members have pointed out that bullying takes many forms, including physical bullying, verbal intimidation and social exclusion.  Girls are the most vicious at isolating other girls in their class and excluding them.  The pain and the sense of being cut off from one's peers is really tough.  It is my experience that it goes on in girls schools.  We need to do so much more to tackle bullying.<\/p><p>I do not seek to amend the motion.  It is great more work is being done on bullying.  I welcome the initiative of the Minister to set up the working group, which I gather is working well.  I hope the timescale will be met, although it has been pushed back a little towards Christmas.  While it is important that the job is done right, I hope the Christmas deadline can be met.<\/p><p>Over the summer, I did a lot of work on youth mental health, which is an issue I have spoken about on several occasions.  I am personally interested in the topic.  Fianna F\u00e1il had its national conference in Galway in June and I met groups such as Headstrong, See Change, Suicide or Survive.  There were representatives of teacher unions, management bodies and the Irish Primary Principals Network and others at the national conference.  We wanted to start a conversation on what we need to do on youth mental health.  Bullying was a major part of it and came up in all discussions.  Equally, the point was made that the issue was broader than bullying.  We must examine the consequences for young people and the emotional impact on them.  We must give them the skills to get through.  If young people feel they are in desperate emotional pain or in a hopeless situation because of depression, problems with their body image or sexual orientation, problems in the home such as marital breakup and financial pressure or bullying, these are different causes but the impact is the same.  This was the message that came through to me from different groups.  It is good that there is a spotlight on bullying and we must ensure we have more effective strategies in place in our education system.<\/p><p>The Minister referred to parents, which is a crucial aspect.  We must ensure proper co-operation so that parents have a role to play.  If children are on Facebook when they are too young to sign up to it, maybe it is because parents are not aware that they must engage further and need to know what their kids are looking at.  They also need to know the risks to look out for.  Schools cannot do everything but they have a strong part to play and we need to empower schools in that respect.<\/p><p>I sent a copy of our mental health paper to one of the Minister's officials after we published it.  I ask the Minister to read it because it is genuinely based on a lot of consultation.  There are many sensible suggestions, many of which are straightforward.  An example is ensuring every school has its own mental health promotion plan in order that students and teachers and parents and the community are involved in it.  School should also have access to services outside, such as jigsaw centres and specialised services for dealing with young people.  We should promote peer support, both in the bullying context and elsewhere, and encourage young people to stand up for each other.  The Minister is very aware of the BeLonGTo campaign and its powerful message that equipping young people to stand up and not tolerate any kind of intimidation is one of the most powerful things we can do.<\/p><p>I did not want this to be my main point because I did not want to approach this from a political perspective but it would be remiss of me not to ask the Minister to reconsider the decision on guidance counsellors.  It is having an impact, which has been stressed to me in recent months.  Without having a person in the school who can support young people and have the time and space to provide counselling support, there is a gap.  It is one of the many suggestions in our report and I hope the Minister considers them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400026#AA00400","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1352901900,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and express my sincere sympathy and that of my colleagues to the families of those who have tragically died by suicide in recent times.  I also pay tribute to Mr. Jonathan Pugsley, who was at the briefing this afternoon.  It is a tribute and testament to the man and it is invaluable help to listen to the story.  It gives us a further insight and helps to avoid future such situations.<\/p> <p>It is a very unselfish act by the parents who come forward.<\/p><p>I pay tribute to my Fine Gael colleagues for bringing the motion to the House.  Recently, the House debated homophobic bullying.  The coverage in the media of the tragic deaths of two teenagers and the outcry following that, the report just published by the Ombudsman for Children on bullying in schools, the statement by the Minister for Justice and Equality on cyberbullying last week, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs's meeting with Facebook management to discuss online safeguards for children, and the series on RTE television programme, &quot;Bullyproof&quot;, which concluded last night have all focused our minds on the far-reaching and serious repercussions of all forms of bullying.<\/p><p>I commend the Minister for the work done to date in tackling the issue of bullying in schools with the establishment of the anti-bullying forum.  I await with great interest the action plan which I hope will be published before Christmas.<\/p><p>As a former teacher I know that schools have been engaged for a number of years in establishing school policies to deal with bullying, and all schools are obliged to include it in their school planning.  The Department of Education and Skills inspectorate evaluates, advises and gives support on anti-bullying measures in inspections of SPHE, CSPE and RSE programmes in schools.  Primary schools have to implement the Stay Safe programme, a personal safety skills programme for primary children that aims to reduce vulnerability to child abuse and bullying through the provision of personal safety education.  We certainly need schools to evaluate the efficacy of their current anti-bullying programmes and to develop a whole-school approach to the issue.<\/p><p>The Ombudsman for Children's report states that 10,000 children every day struggle to go to school because of bullying.  That is a pretty staggering figure and it does not even take into account the unreported cases or those children who are suffering in silence.  In my teaching career I found it particularly difficult to deal with these children.  I remember one particular student who became increasingly withdrawn over the course of a year.  I could see weight coming off and would try to ask her if she was okay.  One can sometimes sense that a child in such a situation does not want to be singled out and approached.  One has to be very careful in how one deals with such a situation.  One day I had the group for last class and when the girl was heading out at a quarter to four, I asked her if she was okay.  A teacher has to give a child the time when he or she wants to come forward.  The following day I found she had left a long and heartbreaking letter on my desk.  Cyberbullying was not spoken of at that time.  As Senator Power said, girls can be particularly cruel.  This girl had not been physically hurt or even verbally abused.  She had suffered isolation and a feeling of not belonging.<\/p><p>Some will say most bullying takes place outside school, but a great deal goes on inside schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400026#AA00500","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352902500,"counter":190,"content":"<p>It originates in school.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400027#BB00200","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1352902500,"counter":191,"content":"<p>It does.

All forms of bullying can only be tackled effectively if the whole school community is involved.  It is important we have students, parents, teachers, principals and boards of management working together.  Adequate in-service training must be provided and offered.  The easy bit is sending a group of teachers on a course and establishing an anti-bullying policy.  The difficult part is engaging the whole school community in order that everyone feels they have ownership of the decisions made and have been included right from the start.  Parents in particular need to have the tools to recognise the early signs that their child is being bullied or is the bully and to deal with it.<\/p><p>There is no doubt that parents and schools are struggling with the whole area of cyberbullying.  I welcome the measures that are in place.  When the Department  of Education and Skills started to fund the Webwise integrated education initiative in 2006, the world was a very different place.  Schools could put Internet safety controls in place on school equipment and block harmful content.  At home, parents could do the same and keep a careful eye on the family computer.  There was usually only one computer in the home and it sat in the middle of the living room or in a common area where everyone used it.  Now, the Internet is on our phone 24-7 and there seems to be no way to get away from it.  I cannot remember the last time I actually switched off my phone.  Last night, I remarked to my own children that when we try to watch a programme on television, there is a constant click of texts being received.  It is never ending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400027#BB00500","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1352902500,"counter":194,"content":"<p>The Senator's time is up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400027#BB00600","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1352902500,"counter":195,"content":"<p>I have so much more that I want to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400027#BB00700","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1352902500,"counter":196,"content":"<p>The Sentor must save it for another occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400027#BB00800","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1352902500,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I hope we will return to this topic.

I commend the Fine Gael Senators for bringing this motion before us and initiating this timely debate.  We have been debating the seriousness of bullying in all its forms for some time now, including here in the Seanad as recently as September when we had statements on homophobic bullying and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, was present.<\/p><p>I note with great sadness the tragic deaths by suicide, linked to cyberbullying, of teenagers, Ciara Pugsley and Erin Gallagher, as the backdrop to this motion.  Their tragic deaths by suicide must be the catalyst for real action to tackle the pernicious, pervasive and extremely dangerous phenomenon that is bullying.  The motion, rightly, welcomes the improvements technology has brought to our lives, but we must also be cognisant of the new dangers such improvements inadvertently bring.  Today, we are talking about cyberbullying but another issue of concern to me is the dissemination of child abuse material on the Internet.<\/p><p>It was demonstrated by the successful passage of the children's rights referendum on Saturday that the protection and welfare of children is a key concern in Ireland and must remain a top priority for all Members of the Oireachtas.  In this regard, I welcome the commitment in the programme for Government as well as the anti-bullying forum and the working group to produce an action plan on bullying established by the Minister for Education and Skills.  I look forward to seeing the roadmap the working group will produce.  I hope the working group speaks of the need for effective structural changes in curriculum, policy, support services and teaching practice, and is for all children.  Otherwise it will be a lost opportunity.  I look forward to the Seanad debating the action plan when it is produced.<\/p><p>It is important to note that it is not possible to combat cyberbullying through legislation.  Legislative provision capable of catching the kind of circumstances which prevail in cyberbullying cases, in the offence of harassment, is to be found under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  This point is well made in a recent legal comment by Fergal Crehan, BL, who noted that &quot;laws can only make things illegal, they cannot stop them from happening&quot;.<\/p> <p>The law can only help in prosecuting disclosed cases of bullying but does not help in preventing the behaviour.  We need to concentrate on tackling the behaviour.  We must examine the prosecution aspect and ensure that when people present evidence those concerned will be prosecuted for breaking the law.  We need a fundamental cultural shift in attitudes and values around bullying through a national strategy with a whole school community approach.  We must redouble our awareness efforts in order that parents, teachers and communities know the signs as most of us would find it difficult to recognise them, especially in teenagers who are going through a troubled period in their life at the best of times.  To recognise the signs is very difficult for any parent on his or her own.  That is why there is a need for a whole community-school approach.  <\/p><p>Cyberbullying can take many forms.  The recent publication, A Guide to Cyber Bullying, prepared by the Office for Internet Safety, O2, Barnardos and the National Centre for Technology in Education, identified five types of cyber bullying: personal intimidation, impersonation, exclusion, personal humiliation and false reporting.  The guide stated that such behaviour should be tackled with education and the role of the school is particularly important.  It was pointed out in the excellent briefing earlier that all too often, schools tend not to promote their bullying policies but will promote many other policies.  By promoting the fact that they have a policy on bullying is almost a way of emitting some deficiency in the school.  We need to reduce that stigma and grow up.  Schools need to say what they are doing.  <\/p><p>Senator Moran's experience was telling.  Many children will not tell about a bullying experience because of the shame and often they present in medical conditions.  I had one girl involved in youth work who ended up hospitalised and on a drip.  When we got down to the issues it was clear she was being bullied.  Very often children will present with medical conditions because they believe it is their only way to get out of their situation.  <\/p><p>The role of adults has been mentioned.  There is saying to the effect that children do not pick it off the streets.  I have just been through a referendum campaign where those on both sides of the debate shouted at one another and used strong language.  On some programmes such as &quot;Frontline&quot; I sometimes feel there is a pack mentality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400027#BB01000","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352903100,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400028#CC00200","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1352903100,"counter":201,"content":"<p>We need to be careful.

We need to challenge ourselves as adults about our behaviour.<\/p><p>It is important that the curriculum is not used in its standard form.  Earlier the National Youth Council of Ireland gave a presentation on youth arts and Roscommon Youth Theatre performed an eight to ten minute play on bullying.  It was powerful and the young people showed empathy.  By preparing and writing the play they were able to get an understanding of the different sides of what happens in a bullying situation.  Whether it is sport, as Senator Eamonn Coghlan said, or arts we must use different ways to address the issue.<\/p><p>There is also the issue of child abuse material on the Internet which I will raise again with the Minister for Justice and Equality, having done so last year.  The debate is welcome and I hope we can now proceed to take action to address this aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400028#CC00300","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1352903100,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I join in the welcome to the Minister to discuss this important, issue which is exercising the minds of many people.  I welcome the fact that there is such cross-party support for the motion as it is a major issue in all our communities.  I was present in the AV room for the presentation which was one of the most striking I have seen for a long time and also one of the best attended.  The anti-bullying coalition gave us a good insight into its concerns and was complimentary of what the Minister has done so far and also about what, I hope, will come from the working group and may be rolled out in the future.<\/p><p>The presentation by Mr. Jonathan Pugsley was particularly heart-rending.  For a man who laid his dear daughter to rest less than eight weeks ago it took some courage to come in and speak to Members about his concerns.  He made one telling comment.  He said that he and his family were not equipped to see the problem nor was the school or community particularly equipped to see it.  That is an issue that will have to be addressed.<\/p><p>Like other Senators, I extend my sympathy to all the families throughout the country who have been devastated by suicide.  We all know families, friends, neighbours and constituents who have suffered in this way.  There are many causes of suicide.  Some have had mental health issues.  Some were probably caused by financial pressures or broken relationships, and inevitably bullying, as we have seen in a number of high profile cases recently, particularly that of Ciara Pugsley and Erin Gallagher.  It is a huge challenge for society.  Bullying, as Senator Eamonn Coghlan and others have alluded to, is not a new phenomenon in schools.  <\/p><p>We all remember from our school days instances of weaker or gay students being singled out for physical and psychological abuse.  One in four girls and one in six boys are guilty of traditional bullying.  The majority of those involved in cyberbullying are also involved in traditional bullying.  While we welcome the technological advances, we are aware that uncontrolled bullying has the potential to seriously damage the lives of young people.  One incident of cyberbullying has the potential to go global and it leaves a permanent footprint.  That is the frightening aspect about the Internet, Facebook and all the other social media outlets.  Parents have a responsibility to be aware of who their children are interacting with on social media, websites and mobile phones but in many cases they are ill-equipped to deal with it as technology has gone ahead of them.  There is much work to be done to educate parents on the power and dangers of the Internet.  The service providers also have a role to play.  I do not know how the issue can be controlled but the Government must look at the service providers to ascertain whether they are acting responsibly. <\/p><p>The problem can only be solved by various Departments working together.  In this regard education and the health services have a major role to play.  Often for a child who has been bullied his or her first interaction will be with somebody within the health service.  A doctor, a psychologist or a nurse may become aware of problems being experienced by a child as a result of bullying.  There is a need for joined-up thinking between the services.  There is a need to heighten awareness.<\/p><p>We have powerful media outlets.  In the AV room, somebody alluded to the effectiveness of the Saorview campaign in alerting people to the fact that unless they took certain action their television would not work after 25 October.  A similarly high profile campaign is needed to alert people to the dangers and tell-tale signs of bullying.  We need to promote a culture among young people of looking out for each other, which is something that can happen within the schools.<\/p> <p>Much of the bullying is symptomatic of the social problems in the country.  We cannot underestimate the pressures under which vulnerable young people are being put by ruthless people involved in drug dealing.  I know of many young people who took their lives because they might have incurred some debts they were unable to meet and pressure was being put on them.  We cannot underestimate that and it is something we need to address.  While we could debate the problem of suicide forever, there are issues we need to address and that is one of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400028#CC00400","speaker":"1118","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352903700,"counter":204,"content":"<p>The Acting Chairman, Senator Quinn, could be taken as a prime example of somebody who does not bully and is very gracious with other people.  He was scheduled to be next to speak and could very easily have made an arrangement with the previous Acting Chairman to stay in the Chair, but he very graciously yielded to me and that is an example of the kind of courtesy that negates bullying.  There seems to be a great decline in the levels of courtesy and respect one human being shows to another.  It is throughout society and there is considerable hypocrisy around it.<\/p><p>It is important that we have this debate.  I am not sure we will get anything new from it.  I hope we will.  It seems to combine two elements, the first of which is bullying and we are all against bullying.  It is easy enough for everybody to be against bullying.  The second is something that is sometimes the result of bullying, which is suicide.  I tried to amend this motion, not, I hope, in an aggressive or unpleasant manner, but because I would have liked to query why the Government has not yet appointed a director of the National Office of Suicide Prevention, an issue I would like the Minister to take back to the Cabinet.  If we are serious about this and not just grandstanding, these are the kinds of things we need to do.  That office has been left vacant for the past year and I know other colleagues have brought this to the attention of the House, as I have.  As I said, I wanted to amend the motion but the amendment was ruled out of order.<\/p><p>We need to look at the whole basis of society.  Things have changed, to a certain extent for the better.  In the old days children were not listened to.  If they went home and told a parent or guardian that they had been slapped in school by a teacher or that they had been clouted in the playground, they might well have received another clout from the parent who might have said: &quot;You probably deserved it, you little brat.&quot;  Things have changed completely.  When I was in boarding school the poor little creature next to me, who came from a broken family, wet the bed.  His nose was rubbed in it before all the rest of the boys in the dormitory and he was shamed.  He ran away and was killed by a car crossing the road.  I have been a witness to bullying, which was endemic in the boarding school I attended.  There is, of course, physical violence.  Coincidentally, tomorrow I will launch a novel by a talented young writer, Oran Ryan.  I have just finished reading it and although I thought it was going to be a pretty ghastly book, it turned out to be a very subtle book, revolving entirely around the devastating impact of bullying on a child in a school for gifted children.<\/p><p>I am very glad Senator Eamonn Coghlan raised the question of homophobic bullying.  It is terribly important that somebody who is an icon in the sporting world and a kind of epitome of masculinity should raise this subject, even in a brief manner.  I am glad that Senator Power referred to BeLonG To, a wonderful group that has stood against homophobic bullying.  However, it still continues, particularly in schools.  It is the most consistent element in bullying.<\/p><p>I said I felt that bullying was ingrained in our culture.  I also attended the meeting at which Mr. Pugsley spoke.  While he was speaking, a succession of photographs were displayed.  They showed an attractive girl with what seemed to be a lovely boyfriend, a sporting trophy and all sorts of things that bespoke the positive life.  I wondered who she was.  It was Ciara Pugsley.  The photographs gave no indication that she was in such distress.  It is important to find out.  How does one know?  How does one open oneself to somebody who is being bullied?<\/p><p>Last year I met a large number of groups and individuals who were involved in the area of suicide prevention.  I am sure the Minister will know them.  They largely sprang up organically from the experience of suicide, often of a person who was bullied.  If it has not been done, it would be very useful to include those groups that sprang up organically because they have the direct experience.  They did not come to it from a theoretical point of view.  They came to it because they had the agonising experience of suffering this situation.<\/p><p>Obviously we need to look at the area of mental health and suicide.  This was challenged by one of our colleagues from the Lower House who did not believe it had anything to do with mental health, but of course it has.  The whole point of bullying is to create &quot;dis-ease&quot;, disease, in the object of the bullying, and to upset, humiliate and degrade him or her and make him or her feel inferior.  There is a fair amount of hypocrisy because there is also bullying in political life.  It lives on bullying.  Some people in this House spend their time twiddling around on those telephones or whatever they are, tweeting, or whatever they call it, negative comments about their colleagues.  Why do they not blather about bullying?  Let us be consistent and not just grandstand all the time.<\/p><p>Bullying is endemic in society.  There is a whole cultural endorsement and engagement in bullying, and people love it.  There is a huge audience appeal in bullying and that is why we have &quot;I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here!&quot;  I have only occasionally seen it, but they make them eat insects and worms.  That is why they have the awful &quot;X-Factor&quot; where they humiliate people who have absolutely no talent.  That is why people watch it.  It is disgusting.<\/p><p>The Minister will know this, but he deals very effectively and well with it.  The media are one of the biggest bullies.  People of no distinction and complete banality take on Cabinet Ministers from all parties who have the responsibility on their shoulders of making decisions, and they attempt to grind them into submission.  Let us look at the whole culture.<\/p><p>I used to watch a wrestling programme moderated by Kent Walton of Granada Television in Manchester.  It was great fun and everybody enjoyed it.  Now we have World Wrestling Federation where they cheat and injure each other.  It is a real endorsement of bullying.  On a political level, what about the drones?  What are our friends, the Americans, doing with their mechanical instruments of death up in the sky that kill people who are not even associated with al-Qaeda in addition to occasionally getting a target they would regard as appropriate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400029#DD00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1352903700,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to discuss the issue.  I also thank the Fine Gael Members for tabling this motion.  I join other Members in paying my respects publicly to the family of Erin Gallagher who died tragically.  Part of the collateral damage in that case was that her young brother was present when the suicide occurred.  I would hope there could be some help in that area.  There are so many aspects to cyberbullying and emotional bullying.  Humans are not like other animals in that we engage in damaging other people physically, mentally and emotionally.  It starts in the schoolyard and continues on through marriage and employment.  Cases have been cited of bullying people who are disabled because it is easy.  As Senator Moran said, every parent thinks that his or her child is not a bully when much of the time the bully lives within the house.  The most difficult part is to identify a bully.  We have all seen them in action at school, at work, in politics, as Senator Norris said, and in life in general.<\/p> <p>I heard an interesting conversation on the radio about a suicide in Spain.  It was stated it is unusual for people in southern Europe to commit suicide and that it is a northern European phenomenon.  I do not know how this translates throughout the world and whether Africa and Asia are more like northern or southern Europe.  Perhaps we can examine whether bullying is an issue specific to certain countries or cultures.  In the UK and Ireland bullying is highlighted regularly and it is a crime against the person.  It has been said that pressure is other people, and these other people can be eight, ten or 50 years old.  There is a role for parents, teachers, employers and everyone who interacts with people on a daily basis to ensure bullying is not part of any such interaction.  We all meet very respectful and outgoing people who we assume are mentally adjusted and who work in very prominent jobs.  However, when one sits down with them perhaps they tell one of something that happened in their past which was related to bullying.<\/p><p>As previous speakers stated, certain boys and girls use strong arm tactics to pick on the weak people in the group.  We must confront this and admit it happens more than occasionally.  I believe it is learned behaviour and it can be unlearned.  We have seen recent tragedies and I am sure more tragedies related to bullying will occur.  People are fearful every day of the week.  Children as young as four or five are pressured by other children or adults within and outside the family and this terror does not go away.  It is constant.<\/p><p>There has been a history in this country of abuse and now cyberabuse is on a different level.  For generations, in industrial homes in this country children were abused and bullied by the State and individuals.  The saddest part for many of these children is that they did not have a birthday or Christmas.  All they had was an existence and they were bullied into believing they were not useful.  This is not a modern phenomenon.  It has happened for generations.  In a perverse way the Internet may give us an opportunity to halt this or highlight it so much that people will realise that bullying is a crime against the person.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  He is a reforming Minister and I am sure he will take on board the comments made by Senators.  Perhaps he will return in a year to report that progress has been made and that something positive has been done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400029#DD00300","speaker":"1144","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352904300,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

The Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas are the ultimate bullies.  When one considers what will be shown on &quot;Oireachtas Report&quot; this evening it is highly unlikely to be anybody praising a Minister or a Member of the Opposition praising a Member of the Government or <i>vice versa<\/i>.  It tends to be highly adversarial and highly charged.  We should be careful.<\/p><p>  Senator Norris also made a point about the B-rated television programmes which we all support.  These magazines and shows which advocate bullying and put forward bullying, downgrading and denigrating people as a sport are supported and recorded in all of our households.  We might often joke about politics being a spectator sport for all the wrong reasons but there is a message in this.<\/p><p>  With regard to cyberbullying, I got into awful trouble politically about a year and a half ago for something I said in the House, and because of its nature it went viral very quickly.  It had to do with <i>politics.ie<\/i> and <i>thejournal.ie<\/i>.  I questioned one's right to anonymity while on the Internet.  I do not know how one would deal with this from a legislative perspective nationally or internationally, but the Government of the day should use whatever international fora are open to it with regard to the Internet or co-operation in this regard because anonymity is the single biggest issue to be dealt with.  The anonymity allowing one to be Mickey Mouse in one chatroom and Ed Dantes in another while I can be Eamonn Coghlan in the next chatroom and he can be Marc MacSharry in the one after that, is a major problem.  We are all thick skinned and on political websites we are all subject to very substantial abuse with all types of language being used, but it is the business we have chosen.<\/p><p>  Facebook is reasonably well managed in that abusive language can be removed quite quickly.  However, other sites are not policed or regulated and it is not possible to regulate them.  People have as heroes those who probably between downloading pornography dip into these sites to hurl abuse under the relative anonymity of a pseudonym.  I do not know how the Minister will deal with this, but if I were to pick one area I would like to see addressed it is anonymity on the Internet because this would help us.  Senator Eamonn Coghlan is absolutely correct to state there has always been bullying and if we had no Facebook or Ask.fm we would still have bullying and, sadly, we would still have suicides we could relate to bullying.<\/p><p>  This is not a political bashing exercise, but as soon as resources can be diverted from elsewhere, the Minister must reverse the move on guidance counsellors.  In addition he must consider putting career guidance counsellors in primary schools.  People might laugh at this, but adolescence naturally brings pressures in its own right as people get older and worry about sexual orientation and body image, and pupils pick subjects at the age of 12 which will dictate what they do when they are 21 and they are not equipped for this.  They need help with this and I do not think the teacher training provided adequately equips secondary or primary school teachers to tell students they are ideal for physics, Spanish or technical drawing.  We need people with specialist expertise to assist in this regard.<\/p><p>  We are all united in the wish for a solution to suicide, but we are divided on how we think we should go about it.  I am working on the Fianna F\u00e1il policy in this area at present.  Senator Power made proposals on youth mental health and my proposals will dovetail with these with regard to suicide prevention.  For the want of a better phrase, at times it suits to be able to state suicide A was linked to cyberbullying, suicide B was linked to mental health and suicide C was linked to financial issues.  Society has failed on this issue and despite the report published in 2006, countless Administrations involving Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party have got this issue wrong for a generation or two and the figures speak for themselves.<\/p> <p>We need to change the structural report.<\/p><p>Some of the basis of the proposals that I will bring forward, probably after Christmas, will be a structural approach which would, as others have mentioned, mirror the likes of the Road Safety Authority.  It is a completely different issue but structurally it was correct in how it was approached.  Suicide prevention measures are like headless chicken going in all directions.  They have good intentions but are failing.  If resources for the National Office for Suicide Prevention were linked to the number of deaths, as those of the Road Safety Authority are, it would be receiving \u20ac64 million per year as opposed to just \u20ac7 million.  In recent days a director was appointed to the office, as mentioned by Senator Norris.  He is a former manager of the HSE in the midlands area.  I am sure he is excellent and will do an excellent job, but I did not see the post advertised anywhere.  The role requires a broader trawl when seeking someone to head up the office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400030#EE00400","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352904900,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire go dt\u00ed an Teach ar\u00eds.  Bullying is a difficult subject but I will commence on a positive note.  I know the Minister is committed to dealing with the problem and is trying to figure out the best way to do so.  I want to afford him the space to get it right because I would hate it to be done too quickly and for us not to get it right.  I am confident the Minister will do his best and time will tell if the problem is resolved.<\/p><p>Bullying is an horrendous experience for anybody, let alone a child, a young adult, a pre-teen or a teenager.  The consequences can be lifelong for those who survive and that indicates its seriousness.  Unfortunately, there have been too many examples of young people who did not survive.  A young boy from one of the schools in my town in County Clare committed suicide three days before his junior certificate examination.  It had an horrendous effect on the children in his class.  As the HSE quickly provided counselling, the apparatus of the State, to a certain extent, dealt with the emergency before the junior certificate examination took place.  His family have adopted a positive approach by setting up the William Winder Rainbow Foundation and they fund-raise to make counsellors available to schools to help children in need.  His family use social media in a positive way.  I have attended a couple of their functions and admire their work.  There are plenty of other organisations like them around the country doing admirable work.  <\/p><p>I would like to see a small number of national organisations properly resourced and funded.  Many organisations have been set up in communities following tragedies.  They do great work but I would like to see a more co-ordinated approach.  Perhaps the Government could examine how we can utilise the fantastic work that is being done and bring the organisations together into one single thread in order that we can benefit from the goodwill, hard work, commitment and the time given by people who care.  I have spoken to many of them and know of their care and commitment.  <\/p><p>I would like to talk about the effect bullying can have on people with disabilities.  Young people with disabilities who want to go through mainstream education face challenges already without having to deal with bullying.  Unfortunately, disability has a tendency to create difference which can be rounded on by children in a negative fashion.  A national strategy must take cognisance of young children with disabilities who want to access mainstream education.  We promote mainstream education and it is the right thing for people with disabilities.  It is the only way to ensure that people with disabilities are integrated, but with that comes a responsibility to keep an eye on young people with disabilities, particularly minor disabilities.  Sometimes a person with a minor disability can suffer much more than a person with severe disabilities.  <\/p><p>The Internet is a new phenomenon but that is all.  During my research for this evening's Private Member's motion, I looked at the Ask.fm website because it was referred to in the media.  It claimed that a person's identity will never be revealed, which is one of its selling points.  A person can say what he or she likes with the absolute confidence of anonymity.  There is something fundamentally wrong with that.<\/p><p>We must also examine mobile phones and text messages with regard to bullying.  Any young person, from whatever age upwards, can walk into a mobile telephone shop and buy one for \u20ac10, a SIM card for \u20ac5 or multiple SIM cards, if they have the money.  There is no registration or traceability.  I know from travelling in Spain that one can only buy a SIM card on the production of a passport, which is photocopied by the shop staff.  That means there is traceability.  It would not take a lot of legislation to introduce such a simple measure and perhaps it could be done through regulation.  It would lead to the creation of a national database for mobile phone numbers and eliminate the unnecessary anonymity.  <\/p><p>I know, as do all Senators, that the Minister is committed to resolving the problem of bullying and we wish him well.  If there is anything we can do that is constructive, aside from having debates, he should tell us because we are ready to do it.  Bullying is a national problem that needs to be dealt with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400031#FF00300","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1352904900,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and this debate, which I have found very educational.  I am pleased the Minister is in the chair and believe he can make something happen.<\/p><p>  Could we introduce some new ideas in schools?  Could we ask a group of students to act as safety teams in order to teach other students about bullying and its dangers.  They rather than the teachers could set parameters and decide how to spread an anti-bullying message.  Schools have the soc<font color=\"#222222\">ial, personal and health education <\/font>programme, but I am not sure we are doing enough to give people the tools to fight bullying.  Could we bolster the subject of bullying?  We should examine ways to strengthen young people's self-esteem and resilience and help them deal with challenging situations in schools.  Bullying is so prevalent in schools but we have to make it completely taboo.  How can we do that?  Should we circulate  questionnaires on bullying?  Should students be screened for their risk of suicide?  My questions are unpleasant but they must be asked.  It could save lives.  The US Surgeon General has suggested that screening to detect those at risk of suicide may be one of the most effective means of preventing suicide in children and adolescents through mediums such as questionnaires.  It is interesting that studies undertaken in this area, asking schools or asking about screening for suicide, does not appear to increase the number of suicides.<\/p><p>  We must also remember that teachers may be subjected to insulting or bullying behaviour online by students.  Is there a place for teachers to report such behaviour?  Are some teachers scared to report it in case he or she is perceived as weak?  Do all school principals listen to such complaints?  We need to establish a procedure where parents can be contacted if such messages are made public.<\/p> <p>Employers must take this issue very seriously.<\/p><p> It is also positive to see that rules on inappropriate Facebook contact or texting students are to be added to the professional code of conduct for teachers.  The state of Missouri in the United States has gone further and has completely prohibited social networking between teachers and students.  Perhaps this has a simple limiting effect on the issue of inappropriate behaviour between students and teachers, including bullying.<\/p><p> Businesses focus on results.  I would like to see schools do the same.  They should be assessed on how they are making progress in this area.  It is no good implementing activities <i>ad hoc.  <\/i>The Government needs to standardise the measurements.  In a more general sense, new research has shown that cyberbullying is as common in the workplace as conventional bullying.  It is not limited to children.  In the United Kingdom scientists found that eight out of ten people had experienced some form of cyberbullying at least once in the previous six months.  Furthermore, almost one in five stated they had experienced it on a weekly basis or more often, which is considered a similar rate to conventional bullying.  The study found that:<blockquote>Overall, those who had experienced cyberbullying tended to have higher mental strain and lower job satisfaction.  In one of our surveys, this effect was shown to be worse for cyberbullying than for conventional bullying.<\/blockquote>Employers have an obligation to address this issue.  Perhaps referring to someone online, without their permission, could be an issue to be included in codes of conduct.<\/p><p> There is a problem with anonymity on certain websites that allows the bully to hide.  A recent suicide case highlighted that problem.  I think that regulation on this in terms of those under 18 years has a big part to play in ensuring bullies cannot get away with it.<\/p><p> How does a parent identify if his or her child is a bully?  Parents must be given the tools to enable them to ask their child if he or she has ever done anything online to hurt or to upset anyone.  They have to understand the importance of emphasising that being cruel to other children and taking part in an activity that could hurt them is wrong.  How do we encourage parents to address this challenge?<\/p><p> I am glad the Minister is examining legislation in this area.  I welcome the Government's progress.  I am glad to be able to contribute to the debate.  I am very pleased the debate has taken place and congratulate those who tabled the motion and the others who got involved in the debate.  By drawing attention to this issue, we may be able to help the Minister achieve success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400031#FF00500","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352905500,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak to the motion.  I welcome the Minister.  He has been sitting in every room I have entered today.<\/p><p>I join my colleagues in extending deepest sympathy to every family that has  been affected by suicide, particularly suicide related to bullying.  Bullying in schools is an issue at the forefront of media and public attention.  Is it not sad that it takes a tragic youth suicide to bring this to public attention?  Communities need to recognise that the problem is not just confined to schools but goes on everywhere.  For children to grow up in an environment in which they can reach their potential, everyone must be involved in tackling all forms of bullying.  The victims of bullying feel isolated, alone and afraid.  These feelings only get worse when there is no one to turn to.  Parents can only do so much with teenagers.  Things get increasingly worse in the mind of the child experiencing bullying.  I am saddened that the economic climate has necessitated cuts to the number of careers guidance counsellors in schools.  Some guidance counsellors were excellent and connected with their pupils, and pupils felt they could go to the guidance counsellor with their problems.  I hope that as the situation improves, it will be a priority for the posts of guidance counsellor to be filled.  It may not happen in the lifetime of the Government but I hope that some government will prioritise guidance services for students.<\/p><p>The print media have covered the tragic circumstances of youth suicide, but in all the articles I have never once seen a reference to the telephone number of the helpline for those affected by suicide.  The media has a role to play and could suggest that people who are feeling lonely, sad, depressed, suicidal or bullied should ring this helpline.  As paper never refused ink, that number could be printed.<\/p><p>I am delighted the Government announced an anti-bullying forum early in the life of the new D\u00e1il.  I hope the action plan will be produced as soon as possible.  We need to change our approach to bullying.  We need to begin to stop bullying rather than dealing with the consequences.  We need to give teachers the tools to prevent bullying in schools.  This means workshops on the causes of bullying, prevention measures and so on.<\/p><p>Teachers care for the welfare of their pupils and that may be overlooked.  We need to create an environment in which teachers can teach.  We must educate students to prevent bullying happening in the first place.  The social, personal and health education and the civic, social and political education curricula need to be enhanced in order that students are taught to accept, respect and tolerate others.  This should not end in the classroom.  Schools and local communities should connect to ensure teenagers are interacting with each other.<\/p><p>With regard to the issue of cyberbullying which appears to be rampant, greater vigilance is needed.  Websites have administrators who do the best they can.  They must be alert to this and try to stamp out cyberbullying.<\/p><p>Bullying is nothing new.  In the old days before new technology, pupils had the safe haven of home and could get away from the bullying, but that is not the case anymore because the Internet, Facebook, Twitter and texting are in the home and the bullying follows them home.  They can no longer shut it out.<\/p><p>We need to educate parents on how to use the Internet and social media.  Some parents would not have a clue.  Recently a woman asked me to teach her how to text.  Parents should be taught how to monitor what is happening on the Internet.<\/p><p>Some teenagers are really good and we had evidence of that when Comhairle na n\u00d3g made a presentation to the education committee.  They spoke about mental health and cyberbullying.  We can learn from them as they made suggestions on how some of the issues can be dealt with.  We should listen to what they are saying.<\/p><p>I do not envy the Minister's task because I do not know how to legislate for cyberbullying, but I hope he will find a way.  I commend the Fine Gael Senators who tabled this motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400032#GG00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1352905500,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<blockquote><br \/>After &quot;teachers and students with internet safety advice;&quot; to insert the following:<br \/>&quot;acknowledges the value of quality-assured resources like Inspire Ireland&#8217;s <i>ReachOut.com<\/i> and others given that the Internet is now the preferred source of mental health information and support for our young people;<br \/>is aware of Inspire Ireland&#8217;s work on behalf of the Health Service Executive in the development of good practice guidelines for the safe delivery of online mental health support, due to be launched in the coming months;&quot;.<\/blockquote>I welcome the Minister.  I very much welcome this Fine Gael motion on bullying and the Internet, which is topical and well thought out.  I commend the party members for it.  They may be shocked to hear me commending them for something.<\/p><p>  We are all aware of very recent cases where cyberbullying has led to suicide among young people.<\/p> <p>Suicide is always a grave tragedy and where the Internet plays a role we must examine what can be done to prevent it.  When I was in school technology, in terms of widespread use of the Internet, was not prevalent.  At that stage we had only the advent of mobile phones, which were the size of bricks.  I am not old but the technology was only coming in then and bullying occurred only in the school or in other social outlets where there was one to one contact or group interaction as opposed to the silent interactions on social media and other networks.  Bullying is occurring in the school environment in an unseen way.  Even though mobile phones are not allowed in the classroom and can be taken from students, students have their mobile phones with them and bullying occurs through Facebook, other social media and texting.  While teachers and parents may not see the bullying occur on school campus, it happens through such networks on phones in students' pockets and when they open up their phones at lunch time they will see it.  There is no point in saying students do not have their phones with them in school because they do.  I know that from my Facebook news feed indicating that my cousins have posted pictures of themselves at lunchtime in school.  Students have their phones with them in school and bullying will occur through their phones in their pockets.  <\/p><p>Senators Power and Moloney mentioned that bullying affects young people in their homes, in their bedrooms, places where they are supposed to be safe and which should be a refuge for them.  The story books tell us of trolls under the bridge but now there are Internet trolls like those on Twitter and Facebook who seem to live to give abuse.  They probably have their own issues that need to be dealt with but there are people, those trolls, who give lots of people abuse.  We see it on Twitter where high profile people such as celebrities and footballers get abuse.  It is the normalising of that which is the problem and we need to deal with that.<\/p><p>I will not push our amendment to a vote but I wish to deal with the background to the motion.  Many young people are very capable of pointing out the dangers of the social network interactions of which they are a part.  They know about issues of anonymity and ignorance in terms of the consequence of one's actions in theory and many of them are capable of pointing to solutions such as education for victims, the need for the State through the Garda or other bodies to work with Facebook and other social media outlets.  There are many programmes such as Stay Safe in schools.  There is education in this area and there are many resources online for young people such as SpunOut which guides young people on how to be safe online and, more importantly, how to deal with cyberbullying or text bullying.  As public representatives, we have a duty to bring these guidelines to the attention of young people and their parents and teachers.  I acknowledge the good work being done by the Government and it is recognised in the motion.  I hope the upcoming action plan will be given the importance required to tackle this problem.<\/p><p>The reason we tabled an amendment to the motion is to show the positive impact the Internet can have on young people who may be victims of bullying and who are dealing with mental health issues in general.  We are the Goggle generation and we cannot run from that.  People my age or younger who want to find out something search for it on Google.  We need to examine how we can harness this for the good.  That is the reason our amendment commends the work of ReachOut and other services which offer young people a friendly, accessible online service.  One of the places young people are likely to go to get a solution is online.  Inspire Ireland's work with the HSE in providing safety guidelines to young people will be launched in the next few months and it should be recognised by us.  Our amendment to the motion is designed to show that there is a positive side to the Internet in terms of young people, bullying and mental health.  For every case involving tragedy caused by bullying we need to take account of the hundreds of young people who find useful and important information online designed for young people through organisations such as ReachOut, Headstrong and SpunOut.  <\/p><p>I hope the House will accept the amendment to the motion as it will give it a balanced approach.  It would not take from the importance of the motion but it would give the positive side.  The Internet, while it is a danger, it is also an avenue young people use to tackle these very issues.  That is my input and I thank the Fine Gael Senators for bringing forward the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400032#GG00300","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352906100,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Is the Sinn F\u00e9in amendment being seconded?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400033#HH00300","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1352906100,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I do not have anyone here to second it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400033#HH00400","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1352906100,"counter":219,"content":"<p>Then the amendment falls.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400033#HH00500","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1352906100,"counter":220,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1 lapsed.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1352906100,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I call on the Minister to respond and when he concludes, I hope we will be able to accommodate all the Senators who have indicated they wish to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400033#HH00700","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1352906100,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I thank all the Senators for allowing me to speak on this debate in the Seanad.

I will give the working group a link to the debate in order that it can take on board all the comments that have been made and will be made after I have finished speaking.<\/p><p>  On a personal note on behalf of the Government, I take the opportunity to express our sympathy to the families and friends of all of those who lost their lives so tragically to suicide recently, to which reference has been already made.<\/p><p>  There is a specific commitment in the programme for Government to help schools tackle bullying and in particular homophobic bullying which underlines the Government's commitment to tackling this issue.  It was with this in mind that I, along with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Fitizgerald, convened a forum on anti-bullying on 17 May this year.  Remarkably and coincidentally, this was the first time the Department of Education and Skills together with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs had hosted a dedicated forum on this sensitive issue.  The event which coincided with the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia<font color=\"#222222\"> provided <\/font>an opportunity to bring together a range of stakeholders to consider what changes to existing policies and practices in schools might be needed to effectively tackle bullying.  I also want to identify practical steps, some of which have been referenced already, and recommendations that could be taken to improve how schools approach and tackle bullying.  A wide range of expertise and experiences were shared on the day.  More than 100 stakeholders attended. These included experts in the field of bullying, support groups for victims of bullying, representatives from the schools sector, and NGOs such as the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, known as GLEN, and BeLonG To Youth Services.<\/p><p>  I have also established a working group to consider how best to tackle all forms and types of bullying in schools.  On the day of the forum, I issued a call for submissions from all interested parties and stakeholders.  I invited students, teachers, parents and all other interested parties to submit their views on this very important topic by 29 June of this year in order that the working group could take full account of all the issues and viewpoints involved.  It is a measure of the concern about bullying that more than 65 submissions have been received from the education partners, representative groups, experts and individuals.  The working group has been considering these submissions along with the outcomes and recommendations of the forum.  During the past few months, the group has also consulted a range of stakeholders and colleagues in Scotland and elsewhere in the UK.  The group is working on an action plan recommending further measures that can be taken to effectively tackle bullying in schools.  I have asked the group to submit its action plan in draft form to me by the end of November in order that it can be circulated to the wider community with a view to having it published hopefully by the end of this year or as soon as it is complete.<\/p><p>  I am conscious other Senators wish to contribute and obviously the mover of the motion has to respond.  I will conclude by saying that I welcome the fact that this House has concentrated so much time on this issue.  We will take into account very carefully the constructive suggestions and proposals that have been made and hopefully early in the new year we will be in a position to bring forward a policy to which we can all subscribe.  I recognise that many Senators referred to the role of guidance counsellors and the need for pastoral care in our school system.  Sadly and because of pressures that were self-evident, I had to take decisions that were taken with a heavy heart.  Senator Moloney spoke about the need to restore the allocation as soon as we are in a position to do so.  The role probably should be broadened to include wider pastoral care and to avail of other supports on the career guidance side and to recognise the specialist role that pastoral care and guidance counsellors traditionally have provided in our schools.  I will complete my comments to facilitate the debate on this issue.<b><\/b><\/p> <p>I assure the House that I have listened very carefully to the contributions that have been made and will take them into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400033#HH00800","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352906700,"counter":224,"content":"<p>In his deliberations, the Minister mentioned a few of the points that I was going to raise.  Bullying can have a terrible and corrosive impact on children and young people, on their confidence, self-esteem and mental health.  The effects of bullying can last for years, as previous speakers have said.  The programme for Government commits to supporting schools in developing strategies to combat homophobic bullying and to support students so affected.<\/p><p>  A research study from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, entitled Growing Up in Ireland, highlights how over 24% of nine to 17 year olds have reported being bullied.  That is almost one in four in this age group.<\/p><p>  Research by the anti-bullying centre at Trinity College Dublin highlights how one in four girls and one in six boys in Ireland have been involved in cyberbullying either as a victim, bully or both.  Bullying in school can ruin a young person's enjoyment of some of the most important years of their young lives.  In extreme situations - tragically, as we have learned recently - it can lead to young<i><\/i>people taking their own lives.  This is to be regretted.<\/p><p>  The programme for Government includes a specific commitment to encourage schools to develop anti-bullying policies and, in particular, strategies to combat homophobic bullying and support students.<\/p><p>  The Minister has mentioned the anti-bullying forum.  In May this year, the first dedicated anti-bullying forum was convened by the Minister himself along with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.  This was the first time that the Department of Education and Skills, together with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, hosted a dedicated forum with students' and parents' representatives, education stakeholders, academics and other experts to address this issue.  I commend the Minister, as others have done, for his efforts to date.<\/p><p>  Alongside the forum, the Minister established a working group on tackling bullying, including homophobic, cyber and racist bullying.  The Minister has invited stakeholders and all interested parties to submit their views for consideration by the working group.  Fair play to the Minister for this important initiative.<\/p><p>  In recent months the group has been consulting a range of stakeholders and colleagues overseas, including the United Kingdom.  The group is working on an action plan recommending further measures that can be taken effectively to tackle bullying in schools.  I look forward to seeing this action plan, which I understand will be completed by the end of this year.<\/p><p>  A key element in dealing with bullying is having a school culture of awareness of the seriousness of the issue, and having in place a whole-school approach to dealing with it.  Anti-bullying policies work best where the entire school community, including school management authorities, staff, students and parents, supports it and adheres to it.<\/p><p>  Cyberbullying is a manifestation of bullying and refers to instances where it is carried on using - or, more correctly, abusing - modern technology.  It seems more prevalent among younger people but I know it is not confined to that group.  I can assure the Minister that fad\u00f3, fad\u00f3 there was no technology in any shape or form when I was going to school.  I hope my colleagues did not witness what I did in those days.  Each and every boy and girl was bullied when I was at school.  It was not one in four or one in six.  Each and every one of them was bullied by our teachers.  In fact, their own children were bullied in my presence in that same school.  Imagine going home to a father who had bullied you at school that day and when I say bullying, I mean bullying.  Not one of us escaped it at school.  The cane was taken to the football field and outside the church on Sunday morning.<\/p><p>  Senator Norris referred to going home from school and mentioning it to one's parents, but it did not happen.  None of my colleagues did it for the simple reason that they would be beaten again at home and told they deserved it.<\/p><p>  Parents and teachers must develop an awareness of bullying and must be especially aware of how mobile phones and other means of communication can be used to intimidate and harass young people.  I cannot emphasise enough the importance of constant vigilance by family and teachers, and the constant need to remind young people themselves of the damage that bullying in any form can cause.<\/p><p>  For the past three years, more than 500 people per annum have been taking their own lives, which is a catastrophe.  Can the Minister imagine if we had an air crash that killed 500 people and what the outcry would be?  I do not wish to compare what is happening to an air crash, but I wish to indicate what is happening year in, year out.  We all have a part to play in combating that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400034#JJ00300","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speech","time":1352906700,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his characteristic courtesy in facilitating other contributions by cutting short his speech.  We will obviously read it with great interest but I appreciate that gesture very much.<\/p><p>A lot of good work is being done and I compliment those who have tabled the motion before us.  Resources such as websites and booklets are often insufficient to help parents and teachers to cope with cyberbullying.  In some ways they require an active initiative on the part of parents who often do not bother to check a website or read an advice sheet until their own child gets into trouble.  One of the big challenges facing us is the need to engage in preventative education for parents, children and teachers.<\/p><p>I acknowledge a person I knew in a previous life, Mr. Gerard Malone, who is present in the Visitors Gallery.  He reminds me of the very important work being done by career guidance counsellors who, more than ever, have to shoulder this pastoral role.  Among the issues they are coming across are children who are victims of cyberbullying.  It is not just from this country either because, with the wide-ranging nature of Internet communication, the attacking comments and cruel treatment can often emanate from abroad.<\/p><p>There is a challenge to teach children to behave responsibly online just as they are taught to behave responsibly and ethically at offline social gatherings, such as birthday parties and schoolyard recreation.  Schools have a vital role because it is there, among other places, that children learn to behave ethically and with respect, etiquette, good manners and generosity.  The same values need to be inculcated in children when they use the Internet.<\/p> <p>Children should be helped to avoid developing a twofold persona, one for when they socialise offline and another for engaging with others on the Internet.  The primary schools curriculum could incorporate modules for teaching those principles.  Teachers themselves can often be at a loss as to how to help children to develop habits that the teachers never had to learn when they were young.<\/p><p>I have a particular memory from starting in secondary school.  The school principal, a nun as it happened, made it clear from the outset that the school would be a cold house for bullying.  She had picked up on something about a child who had a particular physiognomy and she left us in no doubt that there would be serious consequences if there was any evidence of bullying as a result.  That is the sort of clear understanding that must be established in any situation where two or more are gathered and where children's ideas and values are being formed.  It begins in the home and we cannot ignore what happens there but it is vital the good work be done in schools as well.  It is not enough to just emphasise the idea that a person has a right not to be bullied, which he or she does.  Bullying is so insidious that a positive culture of respect must be spread out to promote behaviour that begins with respect.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned homophobic bullying, which is very important.  There is evidence it is frequently not given the same attention as other forms of bullying.  There is no first class and no second class of bullying.  All bullying is equally odious and all forms should be treated with zero tolerance.  I am also concerned there are children who do not report bullying because they think their situation is unique to themselves if the bullying is related to physical appearance.  It may be less likely that a child in that situation is able to report at the time or afterwards that he is being bullied.<\/p><p>We must remember bullying is not just confined to children, although that is our focus this evening.  We must only look at the drinking culture in this country, and the way in which the non-drinker was frequently made to feel, although I hope that is not still the case so much.  That should be addressed in a substantive way.<\/p><p>I note the good work being done by the National Parents Council offering talks in schools for parents because often these are not publicised.  In particular, I emphasise the importance of what peers or slightly older adults can do in a school scenario.  Volunteers might come in from college and they can often express ideas and values that will not be as well heard when they come from teachers.  There is a great deal that can be done if we co-opt the input of those people who are few years further down the line but who are credible witnesses in the school situation.  I noticed that on the occasions when I was brought into schools to talk about careers.  There was a certain credibility because I was not so far ahead of the pupils in terms of age, although as I get older that window is closing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400034#JJ00400","speaker":"1146","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352907300,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being generous and giving of his time.  I recently opened a seminar with the Sligo Education Centre on the Minister's behalf on bullying and cyberbullying.  It took place after the untimely death of Ciara Pugsley and I would like to acknowledge her father's brave and dignified response and willingness to be part of what must be an extremely difficult debate for him.<\/p><p>At that seminar, the director of the Sligo Education Centre, Mary Hough, talked about how she had encouraged children in a local school to bring in photographs of themselves.  She gathered the photographs and put them up on the school gate.  The children were most surprised and confused and asked what she was doing.  She told them that she was showing the photographs to people; parents and teachers would see them as they drove up to the school.  The children were still puzzled and she told them that was what they were doing when posting material online, that they were showing the world what they are doing.  She was trying to identify the disconnect children feel.  Adults have it too; we all know we should not send an e-mail in haste because it is easy to be disconnected from reality when at a computer.  Mary Hough put her finger on something and was then able to relate to the children in an easy way.  Immediately they asked to have their photos removed, saying they did not want people to see them.  All of a sudden the awkwardness and gaucheness of those teenage years was apparent.<\/p><p>Of course there is a lot of work to be done and this was just a small thing but the education centres may have a role to play.  I am speaking for Sligo Education Centre, which has been very keen and positive about engaging with the whole school community.  That will emerge in the work of the working group; this is about parents, teachers and pupils.  Parents, increasingly as children get older, get left at the school gate.  It was all right when they were six or nine or ten years of age to go in and say hello or wave goodbye to the teacher but when they are 13 or 14 it is absolutely not all right, in fact they do not want parents anywhere near the place.  Parents begin then to feel less and less connected to their children, who in turn are disconnected from their own lives because of the way they can press buttons.  That level of disconnect is something communities must respond to.<\/p><p>I pay particular tribute to the work of Comhairle na n\u00d3g.  In Donegal the local branch issued a top ten tips to unwind the mind.  In Leitrim it issued a booklet about all the resources available to children and teenagers in the area.  County Limerick Comhairle na n\u00d3g ran an anti-bullying week with an anti-bullying awareness night while the Louth branch made a short film called &quot;Behind My Smile&quot; all about stressful situations and how to deal with them.  In Waterford, Comhairle na n\u00d3g did work on body image and drug use and invited very well known people, including their local Deputy, Ciara Conway, to talk about mental health.  The Westmeath branch issued a DVD highlighting how peer pressure affects young people and the Wicklow branch ran a conference on homophobic bullying.  There is a whole body of work children throughout the country, our children, have done.  They have gone about it with no money apart from the little bit Comhairle na n\u00d3g has to offer but they have knowledge and passion about the reality of life for them.  That must inform the Minister's working group.<\/p><p>The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs came to the showcase of the work they did last Friday in Croke Park.  It was wonderful to be there and share their energy and enthusiasm about something that is so close to them.  Their friends are dying and they are our children.  Somehow we must not lose the body of work that exists there, we must find a way to co-ordinate it.  It might not be about money but their inventiveness and creativity is what we need.<\/p><p>Many Senators have spoken in an open and sharing way about their experiences as children, which is not an easy thing to do.  We must see in a new age of creativity on this issue.  We in the Labour Party had a campaign during the children's rights referendum for children to be seen and heard.  They are there and want to talk to us.  The very essence of Comhairle na n\u00d3g is to have an impact in life.  These children come together to do that and we must not waste what they have done.  With the Minister's working group and their enormous efforts, we can make a difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400035#KK00200","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1352907300,"counter":228,"content":"<p>As the proposer of the motion, I thank the Minister for coming into the House and listening to us.

This issue concerns podiatry services and I am sure the Minister of State is aware there was much concern about the availability of podiatry services and posts in various hospitals across the State, especially promised positions and posts that have not been filled.  I raised in particular the case of Cavan general hospital and the HSE issued a response at 5 p.m. yesterday in this regard.  It confirmed that a podiatrist had been recruited and commenced employment in the Cavan hospital but the post holder subsequently resigned.  The HSE is commencing a process of recruitment to fill the post.<\/p><p>The Cavan-Monaghan hospital group has advised that there is an interim contingency plan to ensure that a podiatrist is providing care to patients who have been prioritised and require urgent attention.  As the focus of this matter has shifted, I will highlight the background to the request for the matter, particularly the contingency plan that will be in place until the post is filled in Cavan hospital.  There seems to be much uncertainty, particularly with regard to patients with diabetes, who have a concern about the filling of those positions not only in Cavan but across the State.<\/p><p>The HSE promised it would provide 16 whole-time equivalent podiatrists in 2010 across Ireland to screen for foot disease and deal with at-risk feet.  The national diabetes programme set a target of 30 April 2012 for the recruitment and appointment of podiatrists.  Figures from November indicate that six of the 16 posts are officially deemed to be filled by the HSE, and there is concern that the recruitment embargo was affecting the filling of these positions.  Will the Minister of State clarify why the posts have not been filled?  There is concern, particularly among patients with diabetes who are trying to avail of this care.  There is a high incidence of amputations in the past couple of years, with 2,539 people with diabetes having lower limb amputations between 2005 and 2011.  Therefore, the availability of podiatrists is important.<\/p><p>We received the two-line response from the HSE yesterday evening.  Will the Minister of State confirm that the position promised is subject to an ongoing recruitment process?  A podiatrist had been appointed but resigned.

Diabetic foot disease is one of the most common, serious, feared and costly complications of diabetes.  Patients with diabetes are between 15 to 40 times more at risk of a lower limb amputation than their non-diabetic counterparts.  Some 80% of lower limb amputation in diabetes is preceded by the development of a foot ulcer and it is estimated that the annual incidence of lower limb ulceration in patients with diabetes varies from 2.2% to 7%.<\/p><p>Diabetic foot disease is costly, with patients frequently requiring admission to hospital, investigations, surgery and a prolonged hospital stay.  International studies show that targeted foot care and proper screening of at-risk cases can result in a reduction in the incidence of foot ulcers in patients with diabetes.  With the targets of reducing foot ulcers, lower limb amputations and hospital costs in patients with diabetes, the national diabetes programme submitted a business case for the 2011 HSE service plan and was successful in recruiting 16 extra podiatrists across the country to manage diabetic foot care.  As a consequence, the national diabetes programme developed a national model of diabetic foot care using current podiatrists and newly-appointed diabetes podiatrists.  It is hoped that over time, the number of diabetes podiatrists will increase and the model will change and adapt to accommodate the increase in podiatry numbers.<\/p><p>The Government has decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet the fiscal and budgetary targets.  The end 2012 health service employment ceiling has been set at 101,960.  Within the overall ceiling, the HSE can make exceptional appointments but the number of posts must be kept to a minimum given the need for the health sector to make financial savings this year in additional to the employment targets.<\/p> <p>Given the HSE's current financial situation, it introduced a recruitment pause in July this year.  Apart from critical exceptions, this pause applies to all posts except for service plan development posts in primary care, mental health and child protection.  The HSE has confirmed that a 0.5 whole-time equivalent podiatrist was recruited and commenced employment on 5 June 2012 in Cavan General Hospital.  Unfortunately, the individual resigned from the post on 31 October.  However, the HSE has commenced the process of recruitment in an effort to fill this post as soon as possible.  Meanwhile, an interim contingency plan is in place to ensure a podiatrist is providing care to patients who have been prioritised as requiring urgent attention.  The cumulative impact of staff reductions from this year and previous years presents a significant challenge for the health system in delivering services.  However, the HSE is seeking to mitigate the impact of these reductions by using the provisions of the public service agreement to bring about greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters, redeployment and other changes to achieve more efficient delivery of services; delivering greater productivity through the national clinical programmes to reduce the average length of stay, improve day of admission surgery rates, increase the number of patients treated as day cases, etc.; and limited and targeted recruitment in priority areas.<\/p><p>The Senator has rightly outlined the issue relating to diabetes and it is one of the clinical programmes we intend to deliver through primary care.

I do not expect him to go out to defuse riots like Churchill did when he was Home Secretary.  It would be an interesting proposition but it is not necessary.  There is no question rural crime has reached epidemic levels.  Driving around the rural parts of my constituency, one would be under the impression they are wealthy because all the properties have electric gates.  This phenomenon is particularly concentrated in parishes into which known criminals have moved.  When politicians are canvassing or farm salesmen or others going about their normal business, they encounter electric gates which have been put in place out of fear.  The fear of crime in rural areas has not been drummed up falsely; it is based on statistics.  According to the annualised totals in the Central Statistics Office, CSO, report, burglaries increased by 10% in the year to the end of the second quarter.  In the Garda eastern region, they have increased by 24%, which is a frightening statistic, and I am not convinced every burglary is being reported to the Garda because, in some cases, people feel nothing will happen.  I encourage people to make sure they report these crimes not only for insurance purposes, but to make sure the statistics are right.<\/p><p>I know of many cases.  An elderly woman living alone was rescued by my uncle who heard her screams 300 metres down a rural road.  Four months later, a family is still traumatised after people dressed up as garda\u00ed entered their house, burgled it and threatened them.  Theft of cars and money is widespread and it is being facilitated by our good road network.  People are travelling from Dublin to County Meath in the Garda eastern region to commit burglaries before returning home.  The figures bear that out with a 24% increase in the number of burglaries in the past year.<\/p><p>Fear has increased following the decision of the Minister for Justice and Equality to close more Garda stations in rural areas.  He closed some last year and there is speculation about others that will be closed.  The speculation in newspapers is leading to more fear among the good citizens of this country that not only might they be burgled, but there will not be a Garda presence to protect them.  People see Garda stations in their areas as a sign of help and it is no coincidence in my area that some of the worst burglaries have been committed in parishes that are not adjacent to stations.  Stamullen is near the motorway but there is no Garda station for miles and the area is looked on as easy pickings.  The Garda in conjunction with the Minister for Justice and Equality must come up with a radical strategy to address this.<\/p><p>I pay tribute to the communities throughout Ireland that are taking steps themselves to deal with this problem.  In my area, Mr. Ronan Murtagh and the Drumconrath community alert group pioneered text alert schemes which are becoming more widespread in the State.  That is an example of a community taking the initiative. When the Stamullen community alert scheme was set up, it had a noticeable impact on the crime figures.  Communities need more help from the State and the Garda because when burglaries increase by 24% in the Dublin commuter belt, which comprises the bulk of the Garda eastern region, people have reason to be frightened and have reason to expect a comprehensive response from the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400037#MM00500","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1352908500,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who unfortunately cannot be present due to other business.  While the incidence of crime is generally lower in rural than in urban areas, I assure the House that the Minister is conscious of the deep distress burglary and similar crimes can cause to householders in rural areas and the broader impact it can have in terms of fear of crime in our communities.  The Minster also shares the widespread outrage at incidents of aggravated burglary in rural areas and is confident that garda\u00ed are doing everything in their power to bring the perpetrators of these heinous crimes to justice.  The latest official crime statistics from the CSO show that most types of crime are falling and this reflects well on the work of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  In particular, crimes against the person, including murder, are down by 8%, as are assault and related offences, which are down by 9.7%.  Public order and damage to property offences are also down by 13.1% and 10.8%, respectively.<\/p><p>Both the Minister and the Garda Commissioner remain concerned about the incidence of burglary and, therefore, welcome the progress being made as part of Operation Fiacla, which is running for 12 months initially, with effect from February 2012.  The operation is the subject of regular monitoring and review by senior Garda management and is focused on identifying and targeting gangs involved in burglaries around the country to disrupt their activities and bring them before the courts.  Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven and specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda region to target suspect offenders.  As of 19 October, 2,493 persons had been arrested and 1,404 persons had been charged as part of the operation, reflecting the substantial efforts being made to tackle this problem by the Garda.  These results show that the Garda Commissioner is effectively deploying the substantial resources available to him in a targeted approach to confront those engaged in this form of criminality.<\/p><p>In addition to the concerted law enforcement efforts being pursued by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, crime prevention is a key strategy in tackling crime in rural as well as all other areas.  The Garda national crime prevention unit and crime prevention officers at divisional level provide advice, information and support to organisations, businesses and individuals aimed at reducing burglary and property crime.  Furthermore, the Garda national model of community policing plays a key part in responding to crime by taking into account and responding to local conditions and needs.<\/p> <p>Under this model there will be a community policing team in each district, headed up by a sergeant.  Clear objectives will be set, such as high visibility in the community, ease of contact by members of the public, and enhanced support for crime prevention strategies.  In this regard the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na continues to work closely with communities to enhance community safety in a wide range of local fora, including through partnership programmes such as community alert and neighbourhood watch, as well as more formal structures such as joint policing committees.<\/p><p>While the Minister fully understands the concern that communities may have about Garda station closures, he is convinced that in providing a modern, effective police force, the emphasis should not be on bricks and mortar.  Until the station closures earlier this year, the State had a Garda station network that was mostly unchanged since 1922 and that took no account of modern transport, communication and policing methods.  It is the Government's intention to ensure front-line services are maintained at the highest level possible through the most efficient use of resources.  The Commissioner has the Minister's full support in this regard and has every confidence that he and everyone in the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na will continue to deliver an effective police service in rural as in all other areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012111400037#MM00600","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1352909100,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

More needs to be done in the teeth of Operation Fiacla.  Statistics show that burglary, in particular, is increasing.  I acknowledge that other crimes, such as murders - down by 8% - and assault, have decreased but burglaries affect most families who are victims of crime.  Burglaries account for the largest number in the statistics.  In the eastern region, in the 12 months to the end of the second quarter this year, there were 5,867 burglaries and only four homicides.  When we talk about the reduction in homicide, it is not really relevant to the average person.  Every murder is terrible and has a terrible impact on communities and families but burglaries are more likely to affect people in their day-to-day lives.  I want to put the pressure on to continue the good work of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.

The Waterford City Community Forum is one of a number of fora across the State providing a valuable service in bringing together a range of community and voluntary organisations.  It is an umbrella organisation with links to Waterford City Council that ensures proper networking and sharing of information between various community and voluntary bodies, State bodies, public representatives and members of the community.  At a time when communities are suffering because of cutbacks, the community and voluntary sector is being asked to step into the breach and provide services previously provided by local authorities or State agencies.  It is important these organisations and community fora are supported.  I can vouch for the Waterford City Community Forum.  One of the strengths of the community forum is that the people elected from constituent organisations, of which there are 220 in Waterford, use their representatives to sit on a range of State positions.  This includes strategic policy committees, joint policing committees and others.  These fora members provide a vocal and necessary community voice for those representing the community and voluntary sector.<\/p><p>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government supplied figures in respect of Waterford.

In 2011, it was halved to \u20ac11,696 and in 2012 it will amount to \u20ac11,213.  Following that pattering for the next five years, the forum will end up giving the State money.  It is important funding is returned to a realistic level to enable the forum to have a worker doing the necessary work of providing information sharing, dissemination of information, organising meetings and overseeing an important structure.  I hope the Minister of State agrees.  I impress upon the Minister of State the importance of funding these fora.  I can only vouch for the Waterford City Community Forum, which I am familiar with and which has done fantastic work.  In view of the proposed amalgamation of Waterford city and county councils, there is concern about how the forum will continue to be funded.  During discussions about the merger, the concerns of the Waterford City Community Forum should not be lost.

I agree with the comments of the Senator on community development and community fora and the work they do in the co-ordination of various groups in areas desperately in need of such input.  I share the concern that sometimes, when there is a louder argument, the smaller argument gets lost.  It is important we do not lose sight of the smaller part of the puzzle.<\/p><p>I will briefly provide the Seanad with some background information on the community and voluntary fora and then discuss the funding provided for the fora by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Community and voluntary fora were established in each city and county, in association with the establishment of the county and city development boards in 2000.  The fora have facilitated the community in making an input into the work of the boards and local government generally, as well as having representation on the local authority strategic policy committees, joint policing committees and many local development companies.<\/p><p>The White Paper on supporting voluntary activity in 2000 provided that funding would be made available through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to support the fora.  The funding is used to support the fora in organising meetings, communicating information and providing capacity building and training for forum members, particularly those representing the socially excluded.  In deciding the distribution of funding to the fora, criteria were developed by the Department to ensure counties with smaller populations receive a reasonable amount while also catering for the bigger and more populated counties and cities.  As set out in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, current economic circumstances mean public expenditure has had to be substantially reduced across Departments, agencies and programmes.  As a result, there were competing demands for very scarce resources from a range of genuine interests and difficult decisions had to be made.  The priority in these circumstances is to limit, to the greatest extent possible, the impact of expenditure reductions on essential services on those most in need.  In this context, a review of the funding made available to the fora from the Department's vote was necessary and unavoidable.<\/p><p>Following the review, a commitment was made that the community and voluntary fora would continue to be supported and a provision of \u20ac600,000 was provided in the Department's Vote for 2012 to support the fora in each county and city council area.  The funding is in addition to the financial support provided by local authorities for the participation by fora representatives on county or city development boards, strategic policy committees and joint policing committees.<\/p> <p>Waterford City Community Forum was allocated funding of \u20ac11,213 by applying the criteria developed by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government which are based on population census results.

This, however, strengthens the case for an over-arching umbrella group that is properly funded and can ensure maximum sharing of information in order that each organisation does a smaller proportion of the total work.
