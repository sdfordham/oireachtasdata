To be fair to the Department, there were 51,000 appeals last year, twice the 2007 figure.  Clearly, the Department is dealing with more people than used to be the case and seems to be doing so at a greater speed, given the numbers.<\/p><p>However, every Department must be open and transparent, particularly concerning a core issue like social protection payments.  I am reminded of recent court decisions involving Dublin City Council, one that also relates to other local authorities.  The issue is one of being judge and jury in one's own case.  The Department of Social Protection is no different.  FLAC has called for the establishment of a statutorily independent appeals process.  We should give this request serious consideration.

Yesterday, we met a group from the UK Parliament.  One of its leaders was Sir Gerald Kaufman, a distinguished Jewish Member of Parliament.  That group expressed great concern that Palestine had slipped off the international agenda.  This would be dangerous, given the pressure being applied to people in Gaza, for example.  We could be facing into another <i>intifada<\/i> if we are not careful and do not give people some degree of hope.  This is particularly so given the volatile situation in neighbouring countries, especially Syria.<\/p><p>  I am concerned by the rebalancing of priorities within what is now the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  A previous manifestation of elements of this Government ensured that human rights were given a high priority, but that seems to have slipped.<\/p><p>  Will the Leader bring this matter to the Government's attention?  The T\u00e1naiste is on board, but people do not realise.  The European Parliament rewards Israel every time it misbehaves.  This is astonishing.  Operation Cast Lead was immediately followed by an improvement in trade relations.  Human rights protocols have never operated.  In the European Parliament today, there will be a vote on a pharmaceutical agreement.  Israel is one of the largest producers of generic drugs, yet many of them are produced in settlement areas, which makes them illegal, yet favourable treatment is being given.  We need generic drugs, but we cannot sacrifice human rights in this way.  I am concerned and hope that people will keep this situation to the fore of their minds, even in these difficult times.<\/p><p>  I am also concerned about the financial situation.  The House could have continued monitoring the situation on a day like yesterday when we had little to debate.  Perhaps the Leader could set an hour aside to review the financial situation.  I was horrified at yesterday's news of 1.3 million Irish citizens having &#8364;50 or less disposable income at the end of each month.  We are facing into a budget that will crucify them again.  How can such people face tax increases and income cuts?  I do not know.  One cannot get blood out of a stone.  Not even Chancellor Merkel can perform that particular miracle.<\/p><p>  I will be distressed if there is no movement on the Mater Hospital.  We must move.  The children of Ireland are waiting and politicians are dithering.  After reviewing the situation, I believed that the Mater Hospital was a good site that provided many co-location possibilities.  When that option was thrown out, 30 proposers of various types came to the top of the pond like piranhas at the scent of meat.  There are only two or three options.  Let us make a decision.<\/p> <p>I do not see any difficulty in the T\u00e1naiste - who is coincidentally Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the leader of the junior coalition party - reviewing the issue.  We would be holding him in contempt if he did not inform himself.  There is nothing unconstitutional or illegal about it and it is a nonsense to suggest there is.  This view was supported on the radio within the past hour by a spokesperson for the principal coalition party.  Let us not make mischief about the children's hospital; we should make a decision and go ahead to build it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400003#B01100","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351071600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I ask that a debate be arranged on the sentencing of prisoners.

People in this country, particularly those in rural areas, live in fear, as people who are out on bail can continue to commit offences.  Moreover, people can be tried on five, six or seven offences and still receive a sentence that runs concurrently.

As a soccer fan I know the Leader will be aware that at the weekend Sligo Rovers will receive the league trophy for the first time in 35 years.  I will not dwell too much on the local aspect and there is a very serious point to be made in that the prize fund made available to Sligo Rovers as league champions is \u20ac100,000.

The CEO of the FAI is a fine man doing a good job but surely he could survive on \u20ac160,000 and increase the prize fund available to the league champions to \u20ac300,000.

Occupational scheme charges are more reasonable but anything up to 15%, or \u20ac60,000 from \u20ac400,000, goes in charges.<\/p><p>We are in a time when people are living longer and it is very important that people plan for and have decent pensions.

Yesterday was the 37th anniversary of the murder of Gordon Hamilton Fairley, the only medical doctor to die in the Northern Ireland Troubles.  He was a medical oncologist and leader of the cancer medicine movement in the UK.  He was walking down a street in London when a bomb intended for an elected representative who was his next door neighbour went off prematurely.  The bomb was planted by the so-called Balcombe Street Gang and killed Dr. Hamilton Fairley at the age of 45.  It causes quite a bit of appropriate soul searching for Irish cancer specialists every year when we go to the major European cancer meeting as there is a memorial lecture in which European oncology honours the greatest achievement of one of its leaders from the previous year.  It is known as the Gordon Hamilton Fairley lecture.<\/p><p>I wish to ask two questions of the T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Will he express his concern to our Italian European colleagues about the conviction yesterday of a group of scientists and seismologists who committed the offence of not being able to predict an earthquake?<\/p> <p>This is perhaps one of the most bizarre bits of modern jurisprudence I have heard in any western country and it speaks far more eloquently than anything else I could say to the need for having widespread science education incorporated into every day of everyone's education so that we have an informed citizenry who can make informed and logical decisions.  <\/p><p>One cannot predict earthquakes and six scientists now face prison and financial penalties because they are being held responsible for an earthquake which caused the deaths of several hundred Italian citizens.  While it is perhaps out of order for us to criticise our European colleagues on issues which relate to their own judiciary, I believe our concern should be expressed.  My own sense is that international scientific authorities would want to think long and hard about siting meetings in Italy and supporting a regime, or a government, which can be so illogical in the way it handles scientific fact.<\/p><p>I would like to ask the T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to clarify what follow-up has been done on the issue of the Bahraini doctors.  On 2 October it was reported that the sentences of several of these doctors were less than they had been threatened with at the time of their involvement in the Bahraini riots - their involvement being medical, or looking after rioters.  They were arrested and accused of taking part in the events, even though they had just followed their professional and ethical responsibilities.  One of them is Dr. Ali al-Ekry, a senior orthopaedic surgeon, who trained in Ireland and who was sentenced to five years in prison.  This is absurd and we cannot let this go off the boil.  A motion was tabled in the Seanad in 2011 on this issue.  I would like the T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to maintain the pressure on the Bahraini authorities - I am not even sure whether a diplomatic representative is accredited to Ireland - to discuss this and to express our ongoing concern.<\/p><p>I would like the Leader to consider asking the Minister for Health to come to the House for a fundamental and far-reaching debate on how, during his term as the head of the EU's health operation during our Presidency of the EU, we can try to institute a widespread and fundamental change in the EU's attitude to the tobacco industry and, in particular, to look at the notion that we should pick a date in 2025 or 2030 and put the tobacco companies, the tobacco farmers, the investment funds and the nicotine addicts on notice that it will no longer be legal to profit in death and addiction from tobacco.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400004#C00600","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351072200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Like Senator MacSharry, I congratulate Sligo Rovers on their magnificent achievement in winning the premier league after 35 years and I agree with his call for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the House to talk specifically about soccer in this country.

I hope that when the draw takes place, Sligo Rovers gets a good club.<\/p><p>The Minister should come to the House and maybe give us an idea as to whether he has a plan with the FAI on the future of grassroots and League of Ireland football.  The League of Ireland has struggled on for many years.  I was involved with Finn Harps for many years and people do not realise how difficult it is to keep a League of Ireland club going.<\/p><p>I again congratulate Sligo Rovers which has shown the rest of the country how to do it properly.  It has a good set up and a good stadium.  With teams like Finn Harps, Sligo Rovers and Derry City in the north west, there has always been a very strong soccer tradition there but we must grasp that.  In this context the Minister does not realise the potential we have in going abroad.  The national team has done much with the fans to promote the country and F\u00e1ilte Ireland should go with the fans and the FAI to the next venue.  We are going to Sweden and Austria next year and we will be in London in May of next year.  There are countries in which we can market Ireland through soccer.  I agree with Senator MacSharry that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport should come to the House to give us his thoughts and ideas on the future from grassroots level upwards.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400005#D00200","speaker":"1144"},{"type":"speech","time":1351072200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I take this opportunity to welcome a decision by the European Parliament to grant additional funding to former TalkTalk workers in Waterford as part of the EU globalisation fund and to praise the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, officials in his Department, all the public representatives in Waterford, European Parliament Members, the employee representative groups and the body set up to represent the former workers for the part they played in making this happen.

I acknowledge Senator Conway raised the issue yesterday but this change is inconvenient and confusing and I wonder what it is worth.  This time last year, a Bill passed Second Stage in the House of Commons which asked the British Government to examine this issue.  We should also engage in such a process.  The reason for these changes goes back to end of the First World War when adequate daylight for rebuilding across Europe was needed.  However, nowadays, we have street lighting and every house has electricity and, therefore, we do not need an additional hour in the morning.  It is also important to examine this issue from a leisure point of view and from the point of view of those doing business across Europe as it would avoid confusion and make life easier for them.  An additional hour's daylight at the weekend would be good for sports participation, walking, gardening and other outdoor pursuits while more light in the evenings would make more sense for children and, in particular, elderly people who are confined to their homes.  I am not sure whether the Minister for Justice and Equality or the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has responsibility in this regard but will the Leader schedule a debate on this?  We should consider this in order that we do not return to this again this time next year with a Member raising it on the Order of Business.

It is important to look to the future, not just at 2012 and 2013.  When the decision is made, the Minister should come to the House and give a full explanation on how he proposes expediting delivery of the project.

In 2009, when Dell let go 2,000 people, the globalisation fund structure in Europe meant that Limerick did not qualify for funding.  There had to be a loss of 1,000 jobs in an area and the jobs had to go to a destination outside Europe.  A number of us approached the Commission and, within six weeks of Dell being closed, the Commission adjusted the rules to accommodate funding for Limerick.  At the time of the loss of jobs at Waterford Wedgwood, 1,000 jobs had to be lost.  In that case, the Commission adjusted the rules so that it applied to where more than 500 jobs were lost in an area.  This is an example of working together, to which Senator Cullinane referred.  All political groups from the political parties in Waterford, along with Departments and people at European level, worked together to help those who had lost their jobs to get back to work.  We should all be trying to make sure that, where jobs are lost, we provide the necessary training to ensure people can return to employment in the shortest period.  I congratulate those in Waterford and those who worked together at European and departmental level for their work to ensure funding could be made available at the earliest possible date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400007#F00200","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1351073400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Senator Leyden lost it with his outburst against the Minister and he did his argument no favours.

The date is three years from when the Minister first appeared in the House to address this legislation.  We share his objective of not having a HSE in three years.  A sunset clause is needed because quangos tend to assume another life.  There is so-called mission creep as quangos invent other tasks for themselves to do.  Some of the quangos that have been listed for culling seem to get stronger.  In this regard, one should consider the Higher Education Authority and Health Insurance Authority.<\/p><p>  We share the Minister's wish to see the HSE abolished within three years.

I agree completely with the sentiments expressed by Senator Barrett.  The HSE is a failed experiment.  The notion of having a single, nationally commanded and controlled managerialist bureaucracy micro-managing every aspect of our hospitals and other parts of health system has failed.  We need to hasten the model's extinction.  Many people, on hearing this argument, will think that the only alternative is to have a rigid, Darwinian, <i>laissez-faire<\/i>, winner-takes-all health system based on the survival of the fittest and not on social solidarity.  This is not the case, as the Minister knows.<\/p><p>  We all believe health care should be delivered according to the principle of social solidarity, with the better off subsidising the health care of the less well off.  It should also be based on the principle of access based on need and not on the ability to pay.  What often gets lost in the fog of debate is the fact that there are other ways to this nirvana.  Not all of them involve going through a Byzantine, unitary national bureaucracy.  If one considers the ranking of OECD countries' access to health care, one will note that those countries ranked in the top ten follow the alternative model, one which is based on insurance.  When people use the word insurance, they become terrified because they believe it is a question of only-for-profit insurance companies.  We believe the principle should involve a mixture with some for-profit insurance companies and some not-for-profit social insurance companies of the type that exists in many countries, such as Canada, Germany and Israel.  In truth, this is the type that exists in this country in the form of the VHI.<\/p><p>  In seeking to impose the deadline, we are aware that the Minister will be an axe-wielding huntsman looking for appropriate bureaucratic targets to decapitate on the way to achieving our ultimate insurance-based feast.  However, he is surrounded by turkeys who will try to delay Christmas.  We are just trying to sharpen the Minister's blade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#K00400","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I compliment my colleague and friend Senator Crown on his gloriously mixed metaphor.  It was a remarkable stylistic achievement but we all agree with the Senator.  He has such an impish sense of fun, which I believe is also shared by the Minister.<\/p><p>This amendment seems to be in concert with the Minister's ambition.  Sunset clauses are not unknown in legislation.  They serve a useful purpose in sharpening the focus of those involved.  Where it is the clear intention of the Government to wind down the HSE, nothing concentrates the mind better than a death sentence.  This is basically what pertains in this instance.  The HSE has not worked and has been a great disappointment.  I am sure there are staff within it who have worked very hard but there has been far too much managerial fat.  We will all be very happy to see a clear limit placed on the organisation's existence.<\/p><p>The period of three years offers plenty of time for the organisation to be wound down efficiently.  It is not a question of rushed business; it should be possible to accomplish the task within three years.  As Senators Crown and Barrett have said, the proposed clause is properly known as a sunset clause.  However, the sun is very likely to be sinking on the Government in three years, inevitably because of the deadline for parliamentary elections.  It is likely that the Government may survive three years but it cannot survive much longer, simply because of the constitutional arrangements made for the holding of elections.

Therefore, the amendment is not some kind of light little souffl\u00e9 that was manufactured on this side of the House for the purpose of throwing a pie of some kind in the Minister\u2019s face.

In other words, we are simply retaining the people who are already there.  I am not sure that in every instance we can repose great confidence in them.  We have had this problem with the banks.

It is a temporary one.

This is a directorate of the HSE and it has to be formed from members of the HSE but there is nothing to stop me appointing new national directors from outside the executive and bringing in new blood that way.  I can assure him that there is no question of us trying to maintain what is there.  It is the very antithesis of what I am about.  I want to change the <i>status quo<\/i> in favour of the patient.  I want a new directorate that will oversee the transition to the new universal health insurance that we all wish to see, where everyone in this country can be treated equally and will have fair and timely access to heath care regardless of their income or means.  They will be treated on the basis of need.  If people want to have <i>cordon bleu <\/i>cooking and five star hotel accommodation, they can pay a higher insurance premium for that but it will not get them their colonoscopy one minute before the next person who has the standard insurance.  <\/p><p>  I hear the Senator's concern but he slightly misunderstands what we are about.  This is a temporary arrangement that I do not see lasting much beyond 2015 or 2016.  I  certainly do not see it lasting longer than 2016. I envisage the new integrated agency will come into place in 2015 and this board will then no longer be in place.  It is a directorate to oversee the transition phase.  It is not limited in essence to people within the HSE because we can bring in people from outside the executive.  As Senator Gilroy said, this is providing for expediting the change as quickly as possible.  If we were to go through a formal advertising process, it would take anywhere between six months and a year and we do not have that time.  I want to see the changes brought in quickly.  We have seen huge change occur within the health service already in the past 18 months in the way services are being delivered by consultants on the ground, notwithstanding our difficulties with one of the consultant organisations in the Labour Court.

First, this is a question of openness, transparency and accountability, of that there is no doubt.   I remember when the Competition Authority legislation was going through this House under the direction of a previous Minister, who subsequently curiously became Minister for Health, the then Deputy Mary Harney, one element that was absent from it was a competition for the post of director.  There was no provision for the advertising of the position.  I understand from recollection that I managed, by amendment, to get that rectified.<\/p><p>It is very important that we pay respect to the whole area of mental health.  This area has been sadly neglected in the past.  We have a strategy to improve this situation.  We cannot treat the post of director for mental health in any kind of offhand way.  This is a post where we need the best and we get the best by publicly advertising the position and allowing somebody to achieve that position on the basis of the strict criteria mentioned by Senator MacSharry.  <\/p><p>I assume the Minister will plead the time argument again but I do not accept the argument that was made in response to the previous amendment because, as I clearly pointed out, the Minister will be out of time anyway and so it becomes completely academic.  By the end of three years the Minister will be out of time - the previous amendment was well argued.  I do not accept the validity of the argument that what was proposed would put shackles on the Minister - far from it.  It sought to simply ensure that the deed got done and the same principle applies to this amendment. <\/p><p>The post of director of mental health is a crucial one, particularly with the levels of depression, the incidence of suicide and the condition of facilities for people who are mentally unwell in this country.  It would be very regrettable if we did not take this appointment with the utmost seriousness and do everything we can to ensure that this post is filled by the most appropriate person.  Everybody would agree that the most appropriate way of filling it is by a proper publicly advertised search.  I strongly support this amendment.  I feel very strongly about this issue.  A previous Government made a mistake at the heart of the Competition Bill and this House rectified that.  I hope that again today this House will rectify what I think is an error.  I do not believe it is malign or done in bad faith but I genuinely believe it is a serious flaw in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#O00600","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I call Senator James Gilroy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#O00700","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thought the Acting Chairman might have been referring to my cousin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#O00800","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":166,"content":"<p>My apologies, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#O00900","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":167,"content":"<p>Nobody inside or outside the House would disagree with the sentiments in the amendment requiring that the post of a director of mental health be established.

Obviously, my party disagrees with this and believes that under no circumstances should it apply to the first director general.  Indeed, to my knowledge, the first director general will be a person who was hand-picked for the particular role anyway, without going through a recruitment process.  I again make crystal clear this is not to impugn the qualifications or abilities of the person in question.  However, regardless of how good the Minister knows that person to be or how good on paper the credentials may appear, a recruitment process is laid down in the Statute Book that must be followed but it is not.  Consequently, he already has been in place as the Minister's interim figure and from henceforth, one will have this temporary little arrangement, which will last for up to three years or for God knows how long thereafter, depending presumably on who is in government.  This again weakens what the legislation is trying to achieve.  The Minister could usefully have considered this issue in more detail.  Is the issue that there were cost implications arising from a recruitment process?  Is this the reason there has been a reluctance to take the transparent route and put it out to tender?  Alternatively, is there a fear that someone better might be found than currently is in place?

The Government proposes to hand-pick an individual and I must note this debate is not about the individual person but about the principle itself.

In its programme for Government, the Administration proposed that all such appointments would be made through an open public process but that is not proposed in this case.  Tosach maith leath na hoibre and while a good start is half the job, the Minister has not made a good start in this regard.  He has gone completely against the programme for Government.

In the case of all the people appointed over the years, I am sure the Ministers concerned thought the country was lucky to have them.  However, that is not the point, which is that these appointments are supposed to be taken out of the political process.  Such appointments are supposed to be made in a transparent manner but that has not been done in this case.

While the first director general will be appointed by the Minister, subsequent directors general will be appointed by the Minister following a recruitment process under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  I note that subsection (4) is not unique.  There are precedents in legislation to provide that the first person who is appointed to an office may be appointed by a Minister, as envisaged under subsection (4).  These include legislative provisions for the charities regulatory authority, the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board, the qualifications and quality assurance authority of Ireland and the National Tourism Development Authority.  In my view, the use of this provision is the most practical way to advance the new directorate arrangements.<\/p><p>In response to Senator Byrne, who claims there has been no action, there has been a lot of action.  There has been an 85% reduction in the number of people who wait a year for an inpatient procedure.  There has been a 91% reduction in the number of people who wait nine months or longer.  There has been an 18% reduction in those who wait three months or longer for an inpatient procedure.  The number of people who are obliged to endure long trolley waits is more than 16,000 smaller than was the case last year.  A stroke programme has been put in place which is saving one life a week, as well as pre-empting the need for three others to end up in long-term care per week.  A transitional care programme is being rolled out, which affords people who are older and frail a much better service in so far as they will be admitted to a specialist ward where their medical problems will be dealt with and they can commence their rehabilitation immediately.  If this will take longer than three or four days, they can move to a transitional facility in which it can continue for up to ten weeks.  Moreover, if it becomes apparent early on that they will need long-term care, such care will be available in a transitional setting until they find a place of their choice.

More has been done within the past 18 months than was done in the previous ten years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#P00600","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":185,"content":"<p>On openness and transparency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#P00700","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I will not accept this amendment because I wish to expedite the health reform process and to do that I must act fast.

The section indicates the director general is not required to give an answer to any Oireachtas committee on any matter relating to the administration of the executive that is or is likely to be the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal of the State.  We believe the term &quot;likely to be&quot; is weak and this amendment asks that there should be some risk assessment of the likelihood.  We cannot have somebody refusing to answer questions with an excuse that it could be the subject of some proceedings.  We should know where the advice comes from and the risk assessment process used.  It is a technique widely used in Government bodies.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 8 deals with what happens elsewhere in the Oireachtas where a Member feels there was a misleading response or a refusal to answer.  The Ceann Comhairle would intervene and I gather the current holder of the post sometimes does this to the assistance of Deputies, contacting Departments and indicating that a question should be answered in a more complete way.<\/p><p>  These amendments were put down before the recent incident where a person walked out of a committee.  They would protect Parliament against a defence from a person pleading an inability to answer a question because it might be the subject of proceedings elsewhere.  In such a case the person should indicate the advice and risk assessment.  It should be possible for a member of a committee to ask the Ceann Comhairle, rather than a court, to help in such matters.  The Ceann Comhairle seems to have effectively taken on this role with regard to answers given during Question Time in the D\u00e1il.  Public servants should answer questions that are asked by an Oireachtas committee or by Members.<\/p> <p>We seek to protect Parliament against almost a shrug of the shoulder and individuals saying there might be a case and, therefore, they will not answer questions.  That is significant in a Parliament and we seek to include those two protections so that Parliament finds out what is going on, including, as we on this side of the House have said, support for what the Minister is trying to reform.  Involving Parliament and parliamentarians is better than individuals saying they will not answer questions because they might be the subject of proceedings.  These are two ways to allow that to happen.  If the risk assessment shows there is a very strong chance something will appear in court or, if the Ceann Comhairle has formed the same view, the individual refusing to answer the questions has that degree of protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#R01100","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I second Senator Barrett's amendment.

I have looked at the provisions as a whole and I point out that under subsection (3), the director general must give reasons in writing where he or she believes a matter is likely to be the subject of proceedings before a court or a tribunal.  This seems to give an Oireachtas committee a clear picture as to why the director general has taken a view that a matter is likely to be the subject of proceedings.  If the issues arise when the director general is actually before the committee, I would expect the director general to give the reasons to the committee at that point.

In addition, section 31(9) allows the Minister to direct the HSE to amend the service plan if the plan has been prepared without sufficient regard to priorities and performance targets.<\/p><p>Section 37 of the Health Act 2004 also provides that the annual report of the HSE must include a report on the implementation of the service plan.  The executive is expected to take proper account of priorities set by the Minister in delivering its services.  The concerns of the Senators are, therefore, dealt with in other ways under the legislation.  I do not propose to accept the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#T01200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1351074600,"counter":237,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1351074600,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 12 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1351074600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 13:\r\nIn page 21, line 46, after &quot;accordance&quot; to insert &quot;with&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>This is a minor technical amendment that I ask Senators to accept.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#T01600","speaker":"952"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1351074600,"counter":241,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 14:<ul><br>In page 22, line 35, to delete &#8220;Directorate&#8221; and substitute the following:<br>&quot;Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority&quot;.<\/ul>This relates to the important function of the Accounting Officer and the audit committee and it is recognised as having been a problem on many occasions in the past.  It is why Ms Niamh Brennan, professor of accounting in UCD, was asked to examine this a number of years ago.  My colleague and friend, Senator Colm Burke, has raised his concern several times about people without qualifications being in charge of audit and accounting functions.  The amendment we tabled on Committee Stage provided that members of professional accounting bodies should be members of the audit committee but it was rejected by the Minster because he felt other qualifications were needed.  Protection against this problem is still needed and that is why I have asked that the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, should at least vet people's qualifications in order that we do not rely on the opinion of the directorate which we have heard repeatedly is a collection of insiders anyway.  Any attempt we have made to prise that open has been resisted.  The IAASA is the regulatory body for auditing and accounting and the Minister should seek its opinion to establish whether people are qualified to carry out auditing and accounting of books with tens of billions of euro on them in recognition of the fact that this has been a problem in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#T01800","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#T01900","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I appreciate the sentiment behind the amendment.

It means the loss of thinking.  This is worth thinking about for a moment.  It is our capacity to think that sets us apart.  Our capacity to reason is at the core of who we are as human beings.  <i>Cogito, ergo sum<\/i>, as Descartes once said.  We have been saying it ever since because of its simple and direct truth.<\/p><p>  Each of the 42,000 people living in Ireland with dementia has a tale to tell about how his or her thinking is lost or on the way to being lost.  These people have a story to tell about how they are losing themselves.  The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS, defines dementia as:<ul>[A] word for a group of symptoms caused by disorders that affect the brain.  It is not a specific disease.  People with dementia may not be able to think well enough to do normal activities, such as getting dressed or eating.  They may lose their ability to solve problems or control their emotions.  Their personalities may change.  They may become agitated or see things that are not there.<br>Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, a group of disorders that impairs mental functioning.  At the moment, Alzheimer's is progressive and irreversible.  Abnormal changes in the brain worsen over time, eventually interfering with many aspects of brain function.  Memory loss is one of the earliest symptoms, along with a gradual decline of other intellectual and thinking abilities, called cognitive functions, and changes in personality or behaviour.<\/ul>If we consider that we have 42,000 people already struggling with dementia and best estimates suggest that the number will have risen to approximately 140,000 within a mere 30 years, it is clear that a national dementia strategy is an urgent requirement.<\/p><p>  Much money is being spent worldwide on research to cure or contain Alzheimer's disease, ranging from brain imaging techniques to identify brain changes, medications to treat the biological changes in the brain, and research to try to manage the behavioural symptoms that cause so much difficulty.  Researchers in the US have identified a particular protein that becomes toxic in the brain of someone with Alzheimer's disease and believe they may be able to develop a treatment that would go some way towards alleviating the symptoms and-or halting the progression of the condition.  We cannot wait that long for research or rely on it to save us or to stop the numbers increasing.  We must not wait.  Recently, the World Health Organization, WHO, published a document calling on countries to treat Alzheimer's disease as a public health priority.<\/p><p>  Many of us have heard stories of those with Alzheimer's disease.  Some of us have experienced it at first hand in families.  Today, 50,000 carers, especially family carers, know that they cannot wait for research to help them with the care of their loved ones.  I pay tribute to their enormous efforts, work and dedication.<\/p><p>  I note and welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to a national dementia strategy in the programme for Government.  Many matters are vying for the attention of the Cabinet, but these statistics are well known.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State and his colleagues know the urgency of the matter.<\/p><p>I urge that the development of that strategy place dementia not just in a medical context, but in a societal context, where those who have dementia live, because of the impact it has on family and friends.  There is a need for a response from society to those with the condition.  Even if researchers could in the morning conjure up great new drugs, they will never replace the need for a strategy.  A lack of strategy will always imply a more haphazard and less efficient approach, even with the best will in the world, and there is plenty of really good will out there, banging the drum for better care and treatment.<\/p><p>The strategy will only work if the medical aspect is combined with joined-up thinking that comes from placing this very firmly in a societal context.  The national dementia strategy will require a whole-of-government approach.  It may fall in the lap of the Minister of State to drive it but reaching out to other key Departments, including those dealing with housing, transport and health, among others, and to voluntary organisations who do so much, will be the way to make it succeed.<\/p><p>What might a strategy look like?  Specifically, a strategy needs to offer common standards of care for dementia.  Those standards need to be derived from clinicians, experts, academics, voluntary groups and those with experience of dementia and the care of dementia.  Ensuring that those with dementia are part of the solution is key to making any strategy work.  It will also ensure that their dignity is at the core of the strategy.  Person-centred care - long espoused by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland - should remain central to the strategy, and the strategy must also ensure rights to treatment.  Carers and those with dementia must be treated with dignity and the standards need to reflect that.<\/p><p>The strategy needs to urge a move away from high cost, long-term care to community-based services in which those with dementia and their families have a role to play, as many do now, although not in an organised, recognised and strategic way.  Early diagnosis will be key to making this model succeed and it should be central to shift treatment away from an over-reliance on drugs.  Continued research into dementia should form part of any strategy, as should the good management of all data relating to the care of those with dementia.  The strategy should urge the appointment of a clinical director within the HSE with specific responsibility for dementia, and there should be specific training of staff, who work with those with dementia, and who should improve their knowledge and skills.  It should also recognise in particular the needs of those with early-onset dementia and address their needs.<\/p><p>A budget ring-fenced for the care of dementia would be ideal.  As it stands, the budget is not ring-fenced and the true cost implications of treating dementia in Ireland are not currently known.  Estimates suggest that \u20ac1.4 billion is spent directly and indirectly on the care of Alzheimer's disease.  The strategy is not a call for a budget but it should rather motivate a whole-of-government rethink which must include gathering the data that gives not just the cost of care, but the way in which care is delivered and the impact of that care.  We must seek ways to spend resources more carefully and efficiently.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the work being done for the national positive ageing strategy, and I am confident that the obvious overlap between these two strategies will benefit both.  The forthcoming capacity legislation will form another vital pillar of support for people with dementia and many others too, including those with intellectual disabilities and acquired brain injury.  Ireland has already signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities but to ratify we must move to this legislation very quickly.<\/p><p>The basis for the legislation must be the &quot;will and preferences&quot; of those directly affected and people with dementia or any other condition or injury must have the right not to have their decision-making skills interfered with or reduced as they currently are on a daily basis.  Remarkably, the 1871 Lunacy Act is still with us.  It is time to jettison it and the production of a national dementia strategy would be a good time to send the signal to herald in the capacity Act, which would encourage and promote people making their own decisions or, where necessary, supported decisions.<\/p><p>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland in particular has done sterling work over many years and its national conference is taking place tomorrow.  I welcome the opportunity to speak to this very important motion, which fundamentally is to underline the urgency of this strategy for the thousands who are affected and the many thousands who will be affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#V00300","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I second the motion.

It has started to work, by way of a review, on dementia in our society.  Senator O'Keeffe has provided a very detailed outline of the position in this country.  I will take a different perspective, which is from personal experience.  Anybody who has seen the effect of Alzheimer's disease in a family member or a close friend will know it is probably one of the worst conditions anybody could have the misfortune to encounter.<\/p><p>Currently in this country there is, unfortunately, almost an unwillingness to accept that the initial problems with Alzheimer's disease exist.  We can end up with cases where the problem has gone too far, and the only solution in such cases is acceptance by family and the affected person, if the person is capable of it.  That leads to nursing homes or long-stay hospital cases.<\/p><p>We must ensure that we put a strategy in place, and we will begin work on that very soon.  The strategy must deal with a number of specific elements, including prevention, delaying the illness, early diagnosis and awareness within communities that people may have symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.  People must be aware of this, and much good work has been done by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and various other groups around the country.  We are getting to grips with the issue but we must put such work into the strategy, along with a care management element.  We must bring services out into the community and examine residential care as part of the strategy.  The strategy for dealing with Alzheimer's disease must be completely transformative.<\/p><p>This Government has the willingness to act.  We hear about budgets every day of the week which relate to every government item but a budget must be ring-fenced for this issue.

At a recent conference on dementia, it was estimated that 4,000 people in the country will be diagnosed every year with the condition.<\/p><p>  I have worked with an organisation called Western Alzheimers for a number of years and its biggest difficulty - a lack of funding - arises from the fact that it already deals with 381 families in Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  Home care packages are key to this.

I have always complimented people who have always given to good causes, even in hard times.  It is crucial that Government funding is put in place and that there are not cuts to home care packages.<\/p><p> I refer to the community employment schemes.  They have no difficulty getting approval for CE employees but they have difficulty finding people to do the work.  Many lone parents, who were allowed to keep their lone parents allowance and get a community employment allowance, were taking up those jobs and were very complimentary of them.  That facility has been taken away and they must depend entirely on CE money.  Community employment schemes are therefore finding it very difficult to get CE workers.<\/p><p> On the economics of not funding home care packages and respite services and putting people into high dependency beds in selected nursing homes, not every nursing home can deal with dementia patients.

We got a reprieve from the Minister, Deputy Reilly, but it was my first experience of seeing 80 patients, who suffer from Alzheimer's, in one long room.  It was a horrific experience and it brought me back to reality.  This issue should be addressed.  If one has not dealt with people who have Alzheimer's, it is very difficult to empathise with the situation.<\/p><p>Some of my colleagues know that, in 2006, I produced a policy document, A New Approach to Ageing and Ageism, and it gives me pleasure to support this Labour Party motion.  I was honoured to be asked by Deputy Martin to produce the Fianna F\u00e1il policy document on older people, active ageing and quality care.  It is a Fianna F\u00e1il policy paper to promote the human potential of, and human rights for, older Irish citizens.<\/p><p>Over six months, during the course of my extensive research for the preparation of this document, I learned a great deal about the afflictions and issues which face elderly citizens every day.

This is a clear indicator that we must, as a matter of urgency, put provisions in place within our health system to tackle this terrifying epidemic.  There are no signs of this growing problem abating.  It is estimated that a major increase in the number of people with dementia is likely to occur after 2021, with the numbers growing to between 141,000 and 147,000 by 2041.<\/p><p>When one considers that dementia costs more than cancer, heart disease and stroke combined, at a current cost of \u20ac1.6 billion per annum, it is clear that this is a severe issue which could cripple an already damaged health system.  An emphasis must be placed, therefore, on the development of co-ordinated, multi-layered and well-resourced services which will be responsible to the individual needs of people with dementia and those who care for them.<\/p><p>Fianna F\u00e1il outlined the complexity and range of issues involved in the effective management of dementia in the 1999 action plan for dementia.  Following the publication of this report, community supports were enhanced and increased levels of funding were made available to develop a wide range of community services, including community nursing, paramedic and home help services, and support to family carers.  During our time in office, enormous strides were made in the concept and practice of services for older people as we took the view that there was an intimate link between the care of older people and that of people with dementia.<\/p><p>The need to provide support and dignity and independence through the provision of the appropriate people and carers was heavily stressed during our time in office.  The Government must make the dramatic changes which are clearly needed to aid the 41,700 people suffering from dementia, to halt the inevitable growth of this affliction and to help the countless family members and close friends who incur most of the responsibility of care, which is nothing short of a disgrace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#X00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":268,"content":"<p>It is great to see all-party support for this vital motion.  Sometimes I become frustrated at having to discuss these issues because they are, effectively, a fundamental human right.  I am glad to welcome An tAire St\u00e1it go dt\u00ed an Teach.  It must be his fourth or fifth time here.  He obviously liked the Seanad when he was a Member, so he is welcome back.<\/p><p>This issue is of exceptional importance in that 42,000 of our citizens, primarily, the citizens who built up this country and gave it the character and integrity it has, are at either the early or advanced stages of this condition.  The effects of the condition and its different strands have been articulated very well.  This motion is a re-affirmation of the Government's commitment to deal with this issue head on.<\/p><p>I am very heartened having listened to Senator Mary White's contribution.  I remember in a previous capacity she produced a policy document on older people which highlighted and added to the debate on this issue.  That work has not gone unnoticed.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact the national dementia strategy is at an advanced stage.  I understand the public consultation process has been completed successfully and the Minister and his people are analysing the submissions with a view to setting up a working group.  I hope we will have a national strategy in 2013, which is the commitment.  The only way we can deal with this is by having a professional national strategy which is well thought out, well researched and, most important, funded.  There are a number of areas for which we need to ring-fence funding and this is one of them because, with our ageing population, we are looking at an increase of 4,000 to 5,000 per year in the number of people suffering from dementia.  We need to take cognisance of that and direct action towards it.  This Government is 20 months into its time in office and I have no doubt that, by 2017, the end of its time in office, we will be well on the way to at least having the support structures and basic requirements in place for people who find themselves suffering from this condition.<\/p><p>I am keenly aware of the fact that preparation of the mental capacity legislation is at an advanced stage.  It will revolutionise the way people with mental health conditions are treated.<\/p> <p>The legislation dealing with capacity goes back to the 1860s when Gladstone was the Prime Minister of England and Ireland and Queen Victoria was in power.  That signifies how dated it is.  There is a great deal happening under the radar in this area within Government, which does not receive the media attention it deserves.  In 2013, Ireland will hold the EU Presidency for six months and a national dementia strategy together with mental capacity legislation will be published.  All this will feed into the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.  Would it not be great for our country if we could ratify the convention during our EU Presidency in the first six months of next year?  That is an achievable goal and there is no reason we cannot achieve it.  It would enshrine our presidency in European history for the right reason, which is for looking after the most vulnerable in our society.<\/p><p>I attended a meeting with the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sean Sherlock, prior to the debate about a UN declaration for people with print disabilities.  Currently, they only have access to 5% of the books the rest of society can access.  If Members walked into Easons and 95% of the shelves were empty, they would walk out because of the lack of choice.  That is what faces almost 300 million citizens throughout the world.  Significant work is ongoing to come up with a treaty to deal with the issue of copyright and intellectual property which is choking access to literature for people with print disabilities.  I spoke to the Minister of State earlier and a serious meeting will take place on 19 November.  Hopefully, the Irish delegation will have an input to ensure a treaty, which will deal with the intellectual property minefield, is advanced during our Presidency.  There is a great deal happening.  The Government is committed to the most vulnerable in our society and we are trying to do this professionally and inclusively in the most appalling economic circumstances to ensure that we embrace a wide church and that the most vulnerable are not alone looked after, but can advocate regarding their needs in a respectful fashion.  We are trying to ensure all the interest groups, some of whom are represented in the Visitors Gallery are brought along.  Amnesty International held a good event yesterday at which the chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality spoke.<\/p><p>I commend my Labour Party colleagues on the motion.  While we should not even have to have these discussions, it is important to put them on the record of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I acknowledge the input from Fianna F\u00e1il and Senator Mary White.  While this is not a party political issue, it is a political issue and we need to make significant advances in the next 12 to 18 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#X00300","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I thank my Labour Party colleagues for tabling the motion.  It is great that there is harmony in the House as everyone welcomes the initiatives and strategies to deal with mental capacity legislation, dementia, Alzheimer's and positive ageing.  I would like to move beyond words and explore ways we can make the issues before us tangible.  We can all say these words but we all know action speaks louder than words.<\/p><p>I would like two issues to be fed into the national dementia strategy before it is published.  First, expert opinion is that earlier and accurate diagnosis is important, as colleagues have said, for the individual but also for family members because of what such a diagnosis will deliver for them and it is imperative that coming out of the implementation of the strategy, resources will be put in place or reconfigured that will result in a nationwide health service, which provides timely diagnosis and provision for early intervention supports and services.  A crucial component of this will be access to a uniform assessment of needs for both the patient and their carer.  My understanding is that the HSE is piloting a single assessment tool, which will need to be such that it provides the necessary early indication of the onset of a dementia and acts as an early detection mechanism which leads on to the necessary follow up of interventions and support services.<\/p><p>Currently, the first port of call for most patients who present themselves to our health service with possible symptoms of a dementia is at GP level.  Making a diagnosis of dementia is not easy and Irish research, including anecdotal evidence from my local GP, has shown that many GPs, like their counterparts in other countries, are reluctant to get involved in the area because of lack of confidence and training, stigma, difficulties differentiating normal ageing from the signs and symptoms of dementia and resource issues.  There is a requirement, therefore, to ensure all health care officials at GP, primary care or residential care levels are skilled in the detection and diagnosis of dementia and are suitably equipped with the necessary people skills to handle the delivery of the diagnosis to patients and their families.<\/p><p>The second issue relates to community-based services.  Following on from the early diagnosis of dementia and consistent with the Department of Health\u2019s stated policy to shift the emphasis of care back into community settings, there is a need to ensure these settings are age and dementia friendly.  Access to clinical dementia experts at local community levels will form the basis of key community services for those with dementia and their carers.  People who need and receive community care, whether through home help, respite, home care packages, hospice and palliative care services, value these supports enormously.  However, access is discretionary, unequal and problematic.  The root of this issue is the lack of legislation to underpin access to these services.  There is no statutory entitlement to home care and community care services.  Since access is discretionary, it is extremely difficult for individuals, families and carers to get information and reliable access at critical points for example at discharge from hospital, onset of disability, diagnosis of dementia, long-term or life-limiting illness.  I agree with the Ombudsman who observes that &quot;people do not know where they stand in terms of their entitlements and in terms of the HSE\u2019s obligations to provide services&quot;.  I also support the call made by Older and Bolder for the inclusion, as part of a national dementia strategy, of the development of long-promised legislation to establish a clear right to community care.  Only this can provide the clarity and security to individuals and families.<\/p><p>I stress that I welcome this motion and I recognise the Government\u2019s achievements in this area such as the publication of the national carers strategy in 2012, which was broadly welcomed by carers groups as an aspirational document that provides a solid basis for informing future policy decisions.  However, I also note the reaction from some groups I work with in the areas in question that a motion such as this is nothing more than a series of platitudes unless accompanied by action such as the tangible recognition of the vital work carried out by family carers.  While 50,000 carers are responsible for Alzheimer's and dementia patients, 137,000 other carers look after other people with disabilities spanning all age groups from children to the elderly.  Recognition of their work can be shown by the provision of adequate and ring-fenced resources, including payments to carers, which should not be seen as income supports but as direct supports for their caring duties.<\/p><p>We are all conscious that we are approaching budget 2013.  The Minister for Social Protection recently gave us assurances that core benefits will be protected but we are still wondering what are core benefits?  For example, is the half rate carers allowance a core benefit?   I refer to the funding sources for carers, which include the Department of Social Protection, which covers benefits and allowance; the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which administers the housing adaptation grant; and the Department of Health, which deals with hospital and respite care.  When I consider this, I wonder whether the citizen or the Government is at the centre of policy, as he or she must constantly run around.  He or she has to be assessed several times before a decision on his or her care and he or she must repeatedly go through his or her family history.<\/p> <p>I wonder if we can reconfigure resources to put the patient and the carer at the centre, so that we do not waste resources.<\/p><p>Capacity legislation is mentioned and I support the idea of doing more.  I advise the Minister to read the document prepared by 15 stakeholder organisations on essential principles of Irish legal capacity.  Advanced care directives are legal in Ireland but do not enjoy statutory footing.  It is important that people in an already disempowered position, facing dementia or the onset of Alzheimer's among many capacity diminishing conditions, are not further disempowered by uncertainty about whether their health care wishes will be respected.  The Minister for Health provided an answer on 8 June to the effect that advanced care directives are not on a statutory footing.  Can we get clarification from the Department of Health and the Department of Justice and Equality to work in a co-ordinated fashion to ensure a section on direct care directives will be inserted into the forthcoming capacity legislation?<\/p><p>I commend the community-based project of the Irish Hospice Foundation, Think Ahead, currently being piloted in Louth and Limerick.  It encourages people to think about, discuss and record their preferences for future care.  Advanced care directives are an issue we must talk about in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#Y00200","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I commend the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il Senators, the Independent Senators nominated by the Taoiseach, on the all-party agreement on the motion.  Although I will support the motion, I have a small quibble with one sentence in it, as I wonder whether it despairs too much: \"[T]hat strategy recognises the societal rather than the medical context of dementia and Alzheimer's\".  Would there not be a high return on research when we consider the cost of \u20ac1.6 billion and the 42,000 people affected by it?  There is a large research budget and it seems to be a priority to see what we can come up with and whether we can form links with exercise, drugs, diet, the environment, lifestyle, counselling and positive mental health.  We all get older and it is not an illness.  It will happen to us and, not to medicalise it unnecessarily, we have a very large drugs industry with which the Department negotiates.  There is some relationship there and we give them a good price.  Do they have international research that might help the Department?  Can we head it off by the appropriate medical treatment and research?<\/p><p>Ireland has a particular problem, as Senator Kelly said.  Social studies research reflects the heavy rate of institutionalisation in the past.  There were huge mental hospitals in Ballinasloe and Mullingar.  Are we too deeply in that tradition or are there more positive ways of dealing with it?  What would follow if the Minister and his Mediterranean colleagues got together?  Countries in the Mediterranean seem to treat old age differently and there may be some hope in that.<\/p><p>Senator Mary White is proposing legislation to abolish compulsory retirement.  Can we use research, intelligence, contacts with the drugs industry and the Minister's contacts with Mediterranean countries and eastern Europe so that we do not have to deal with dreadful consequences for patients and relatives?  In places like Georgia, people live very long lives and do not experience these problems.  Rather than accepting that there will be these sick people and having to provide them with accommodation care, should we refuse to accept it as inevitable?<\/p><p>I asked people in alternative medicine whether the decline of old people could be arrested and they responded that it would be very difficult.  Perhaps there is some hope and scope in the large research budget of the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sherlock.  There may be a return to shifting some of it and getting into the best international research where this is a problem.  This will help the Minister to cater for disasters that happen to people and their families but to try to head some of them off before they happen and take preventative measures to promote positive mental health.  We would support the Minister under such circumstances, as I support this motion.  The motion contains a tinge of accepting this as inevitable and perhaps we can find scope to assist the Minister so that it is not inevitable and we can combat the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#Z00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire go dt\u00ed an Teach.  I welcome this Private Members' motion and congratulate those responsible for it.  It will have cross-party support.  A report was published in January of this year, public consultation was completed in August and submissions are currently under review with a view to establishing a working group to develop the strategy by 2013.  I hope the working group will have its work completed sooner rather than later.  I congratulate Senator White on her work for the aged.<\/p><p>There are over 41,000 people living in Ireland with dementia and the projected increase in the number of people with the condition is such that it will reach 140,000 to 150,000 before 2041.  The first stage was to assemble the research and evidence on which the policy was developed and this was completed this year.  A research review for Ireland's national dementia strategy was presented to the Minister for Health and published in January.  A summary of its key findings are set out.  The next stage set out the publication and consultation process and the closing date for submissions was 31 August.  Officials are examining the responses.  I am trying to get the action group working as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The HSE provides a range of services for people with dementia, including primary care services, home support services, daycare, respite, housing with care and continuing care services.  Carer support groups have been established across the country.  There are approximately 42,000 people with dementia in Ireland, which is a substantial population.  Some 26,000 of them live at home.  I had the experience with my late father, God be good to him, who died when he was 93 years old.  We cared for him in his home for as long as we could.  At one stage, he had to go into the local nursing home for three weeks and every single day he wanted to be at home and to die at home.<\/p><p>A major increase in the number of Irish people with dementia is expected, due to our ageing population.  Numbers are expected to increase to 147,000.  Our strategy must be far-seeing over the coming 30 or 40 years, a crucial period.  The cost of dementia is approximately \u20ac1.69 billion per year, as stated by Senator Mary White.  There is no doubt that cost will increase and we should allow for the anticipated costs and the anticipated population increase for those with dementia.<\/p> <p>Recently I read, I hope I am correct, that it costs approximately \u20ac40,000 per annum.  I am not complaining about the cost.  These people have made significant contributions to the country for 60 or 70 years and we must look after them.  Somebody mentioned early diagnosis.  In the case of my father I honestly did not see it happening.  He was a man who was active, walked, read and kept up to date with everyday occurrences and suddenly it happened.  One will probably say it will happen to every aged person but that is not the way it should be.  <\/p><p>The recent review suggests that community services in Ireland are underdeveloped, inequitable and fragmented with only a small proportion of people with dementia availing of critical services, day care, public health, nursing home, care packages, respite, etc.  As already stated, a greater number of those people want to live at home.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#Z00300","speaker":"1138","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I commend Labour Party Senators for tabling a motion which has strong sentiments which I fully support.  It is encouraging when Government representatives have an opportunity to table motions in Private Members' time, that they have substance and deal with important issues.  I am impressed by the wording of the motion which I do not think anybody in opposition could have framed any differently.  I am pleased to pledge my party's wholehearted support to the motion.  Government and Opposition parties have called for a positive ageing strategy and a national dementia strategy for many years.  In the past a number of joint motions were supported by Sinn F\u00e9in and the Labour Party which called for the implementation of these strategies.<\/p><p>In the other House last week, Sinn F\u00e9in used its Private Members' time to table a motion on home help and home care services.  One of the elements of the motion was the call for the national dementia strategy to be ratified before the end of 2013 and likewise a national positive ageing strategy.  That is something we called for during a constructive engagement with representatives of older people and older people themselves through the Seanad Public Consultation Committee on the rights of older persons which took place in this Chamber.  A report was published which the Minister should take on board when examining this area as it dealt with a whole range of issues which affect older people.  In the motion we supported proposals relating to quality standards for home care packages, health statistics audits for community care, a greater degree of flexibility in respect of carer's allowance and clarity on entitlements for older people.  <\/p><p>The Seanad Public Consultation Committee report also sought that the whole area of wardship be revised.  I emphasise this concept is out of date and is no longer fit for purpose as it fails to respect the humanity of those who find themselves subject to wardship.  The scheme which was set up under the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 effectively means that decisions are made for people without their consultation.  I was contacted by Diarmuid Hanifin of Amnesty International, who is in the Visitors' Gallery, as I am sure all Senators were as part of our preparation for the debate on the issue.  It is appropriate to raise the issue in the context of the motion.  I concur with Amnesty International in its analysis that only when all attempts at supports are exhausted should decisions be taken on somebody's behalf.  <\/p><p>In 2007 Ireland signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  To ratify the convention, our capacity legislation needs to be brought into compliance with international human rights law.  Article 12 of the UN convention requires that persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with everybody else and if people need support to make decisions they should get it.  In order to comply with international human rights law, any new capacity law which the Minister for Health or, perhaps, the Minister for Justice and Equality may bring forward must reflect this ethos and also set out a statutory framework for supports.  The ramifications of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities are clear.  Ireland needs to move away from guardianship and assessment of mental capacity to assessment of how people can be supported to make decisions.  That must be the basis of any principle which should underpin any reform of the capacity legislation.   Amnesty International has also advanced a number of points that should be taken into consideration when bringing forward any such capacity legislation.  It is clear that the capacity legislation and the Mental Health Act 2001 should complement each other.  The 2001 Act was supposed to provide for a rights-based approach.  However, this has been suppressed, to some extent, by its interpretation and emphasis on paternalism. <\/p><p>There are a number of other points I wish to make but it is not possible to do that in six minutes.   Sometimes motions which are well intentioned - this is a good motion - can wring hollow when set against other decisions made, such as reducing 1 million home help hours which people need.  I am sure there is no public representative who has not been contacted by individuals who have been affected by the cuts in home help.  We could argue rightly that cuts in this area are socially wrong because of their impact.  This is an era when we need to make savings and to interpret the outcomes of decisions made.  It is clear from my analysis, at least, and an analysis of all the groups who represent older people and people with disabilities that cuts to these areas while they might reduce spend in one area, increase spend in other areas.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout made the point that community care and caring for people in the home is meant to be the cornerstone of Government policy.  If supports in the home are taken away there is a danger that will lead to people going into nursing homes and private nursing homes resulting in subvention and all the ancillary costs.  While that is a possibility, it must be borne in mind when we make adjustments, cuts and savings.  If we are saving on one part of spending, are we increasing spending in another area as a consequence of the action being taken?  I reiterate my full support for the motion.  It is one of the best motions I have seen from the Government in terms of substance and I am pleased to give it my enthusiastic support.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#AA00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#AA00300","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":277,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for the opportunity to address the motion on mental capacity legislation and dementia.  It is encouraging and gratifying to note the level of agreement across the House in respect of the issues dealt with in the motion.  It was tabled initially by my colleagues in the Labour Party, supported by Fine Gael colleagues in government, the Taoiseach's nominees, Fianna F\u00e1il, Sinn F\u00e9in and Independent Senators, all of whom have stated their strong support not just for the sentiments but the commitments and necessary actions that are required to be taken in the context of this challenging area.  The level of cross-party support is encouraging as is the level of engagement with the debate, and the insights various Members have brought to it, in some instances from a personal experience, are always important.  For example, Senator Barrett, who was never without an insight in respect of any of these matters, pointed to the importance of research and evidence that our policy making should be based on evidence.<\/p> <p>It is extremely important that such research should be done in so far as it is possible.  I believe Senator Barrett also made the point about prevention and the broader holistic view of the health-care system.  We should not simply regard our strategy as one of reaction to an emerging problem an individual has, but it should be, as it were, a whole-of-life strategy.  Certainly an element of our health-care strategy should not be based simply on reacting to people who become ill, but to have ways and strategies for anticipating that and the system responding to it in so far as it is possible for us.<\/p><p> On coming into office the Government made a firm commitment in the programme for national recovery to introduce a mental capacity Bill that is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The mental capacity Bill will reform the law in respect of adults who are vulnerable in the sense that they may lack some or all capacity to make important decisions for themselves.  It will modernise the law on capacity, some of which dates back 200 years, and will bring Irish capacity legislation into line with current thinking and modern legislative frameworks worldwide.  The purpose of the Bill is to put in place a comprehensive legal framework to support adults who do not have full decision-making capability.  This covers a wide spectrum, ranging from people with dementia to persons with intellectual disabilities or acquired brain injuries.<\/p><p> In summary, the Bill will: reform legislation protecting adults who, owing to intellectual disability, illness or accident, are unable to make decisions for themselves or exercise their legal capacity; provide a new understanding of mental capacity based upon a time-specific and issue-specific, functional approach; replace the wards of court system which is the existing mechanism for managing the affairs of persons who lack decision making capacity; progress the process towards ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was signed by Ireland on 30 March 2007; and give effect to the Hague Convention on the International Protection of Adults.  The statutory guiding principles underpinning every support or intervention made in regard to persons lacking capacity will reflect the UN convention principles of respecting the dignity and the autonomy of each individual person, including the freedom to make his or her own choices.<\/p><p> In the drafting of the Bill careful attention has been given to putting in place safeguards to protect vulnerable adults from exploitation.  In particular, the Bill will contain detailed provisions for the supervision of personal guardians of adults lacking capacity and also of donees of enduring powers of attorney.  The Government legislation programme indicates that the Bill is expected to be published in this session.<\/p><p> Our health services are caring for an ageing population with varying needs and conditions including dementia, which is a progressive condition that not only has a huge impact on the physical, psychological and emotional state of the person with dementia, but also on their families and carers.  We all want to see people given more opportunities to live full and meaningful lives on their own terms.  It is vital that people with dementia are not defined by the disease.  We must remember that with the correct supports in place, people can live full and active lives even after a diagnosis.<\/p><p> There is no doubt that society is enriched by the positive participation of all its members and our objective is to have a society where those at risk of social exclusion are fully integrated into their local communities, and are supported to participate to their full potential within those communities.  Government policy aims to support people with dementia to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  I am confident that there is common agreement across the House with this philosophy.<\/p><p> The programme for Government makes a clear commitment to develop a national strategy for dementia by 2013.  It is worth quoting this commitment, because I take the point made by Senator Cullinane and others that while a motion is very important and can focus our thinking, commitment and engagement, what is really important at the end of the day is what flows from the commitments given and the action taken.  The programme for Government states:<ul><ul>We will develop a national Alzheimer's and other dementias strategy by 2013 to increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention, and development of enhanced community based services.  This strategy will be implemented over five years.<\/ul><\/ul> I believe we can all agree that relevant and accurate research is a key ingredient in ensuring that policy development is proactive as opposed to reactive and avoids crisis-driven service delivery into the future.  The first stage of the process was to assemble the research evidence upon which the policy will be developed.  This body of work was completed in January when the report entitled Creating Excellence in Dementia Care: A Research Review for Ireland's National Dementia Strategy was presented to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.<\/p><p> At present, it is estimated that more than 41,000 people living in Ireland have dementia.  The pressing need for a strategy on dementia is best understood in the context of projected increases in the number of people with this disease reaching between 141,000 and 147,000 by 2041.  We obviously need to plan for this significant increase and the resulting demands on our health services in the future.<\/p><p> The review has estimated the overall cost associated with dementia in Ireland to be almost &#8364;1.7 billion per annum, with 48% of this figure representing informal care provided by family and friends and a further 43% representing residential long-stay care costs for those living with dementia in the community.  This research highlights the primary importance of the role that families and communities play in affecting the environment of care for people with dementia.<\/p><p> Among the key elements arising from the research which need to be considered in light of the strategy are: enhancing public awareness about dementia; increasing the numbers of early diagnoses; and introducing measures to improve quality of life and quality of care for those with dementia.  These and other key elements will influence the development of the strategy.  It is important to acknowledge the hard work and commitment invested by the advisory committee that guided and oversaw this research.  It provides a solid foundation and clear framework within which to achieve our objectives.<\/p><p> The next stage of the process involved a public consultation process and the closing date for submissions was 31 August.  The Department sought the views of interested parties, whether individuals or organisations, to help inform the development of the strategy, with a particular request to hear the views of those directly affected by Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, including people who have been diagnosed with one of these conditions, and their families and carers.<\/p><p> I am pleased to say that we received more than 70 responses to the call for submissions.  Submissions were received from individuals, representative organisations, family carers and health-care professionals.  I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to those who participated.  These contributions will serve as a platform for discussion and will further inform the development of the overall strategy.  The next step will see the establishment of a working group to develop the strategy fully in 2013.<\/p><p> The central focus of service provision must always be that it is person-centred, a point made by Senator O'Keeffe at the outset of the debate.  We need to recognise, respect and support the individual, and ensure that we keep them and their families at the very centre of all decisions and decision making.<\/p><p> The Health Service Executive provides a range of services for people with dementia including primary care services, in which I have a particular interest, involvement and lead role; home support services; day care; respite and continuing care services.  These services are delivered through the HSE's network of local offices, via public health nursing, day-care centres and public and private residential care facilities and, where appropriate, psychiatry of old age teams.  The HSE also funds non-governmental agencies, for example, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, Caring for Carers Ireland, and Western Alzheimers.<\/p> <p>A limited number of memory clinics and specialist services are available.  Respite care is the most commonly requested service and is provided in a number of ways, including the provision of a home care package to support respite in a person's home or day respite within dementia specific or generic day care centres.  Respite is also provided in residential homes.  In addition, care or support groups have been established throughout the country, details of which can be obtained from individual local primary care teams.<\/p><p>I would like to acknowledge in particular the magnificent and impressive role played over so many years by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, which this year is celebrating 30 years of representing the needs and interests of dementia patients and their carers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#AA00400","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":280,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#CC00200","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":281,"content":"<p>The society has grown over the years to become a professional nationwide charity, with a network of regional branches, staff and volunteers providing a range of services, including home care, day care, support homes, respite care and social clubs.<\/p><p>We have had the opportunity in recent months of launching a number of initiatives.  The HSE has entered into a service level agreement with the Genio Trust to develop and test new service models with a view to improving the range of community-based supports for people with dementia, to influence public policy and investment in the area and to build leadership in the field.  The total cost of these projects is in the region of \u20ac4.3 million.  Atlantic Philanthropies has generously provided \u20ac2.3 million, with the remainder provided by the Health Service Executive.<\/p><p>Four dementia projects were selected earlier this year.  The successful demonstration sites are located in Mayo, Kinsale, south Tipperary and D\u00fan Laoghaire.  The outcomes from each project will be evaluated and learning disseminated beyond the demonstration sites to the wider system, and to inform future operational policies of the HSE.  These are terrific examples of good ideas and good practice, which seek to move away from a situation where, too often, the service user had to fit into the service being provided to others in the local area to one where the service user is the key stakeholder in service design at the outset.<\/p><p>As we know, currently, there is no cure for dementia and people can live a long life with the illness.  In this regard, we acknowledge that their needs and those of their families and carers increase as the disease progresses.  Carers are vital to the success of Government policy in relation to older people, children and adults with an illness or a disability.  I am fully aware that every day in this country tens of thousands of family members, friends, partners, parents, children or neighbours provide care for someone who, through a variety of circumstances, is in need of that care.  The Government is under no illusion in relation to the challenges that carers face every day.  This is why the Taoiseach committed to developing the national carers' strategy, which was launched in July of this year.  The strategy sets the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided by Departments and agencies for carers.<\/p><p>The national carers strategy is the first of its kind to be developed in recognition of the invaluable role and contribution of carers in Ireland.  It places carers firmly on the national agenda and sets the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided by Departments and agencies for Irish carers.  It sets out a vision to work towards and an ambitious set of national goals and objectives to guide policy development and service delivery to ensure carers feel valued and supported to manage their caring responsibilities with confidence and are empowered to have a life of their own outside of caring.  I take this opportunity to recognise and acknowledge the level of dedication and commitment which carers show to their loved ones every day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#CC00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":282,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#CC00400","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":283,"content":"<p>In this, the European Year for Active Ageing, I am keenly aware of the importance of positive ageing not alone for each of us as individuals but also for our communities and society as whole.  The Government acknowledges the need to better recognise the position of older people in society.  The programme for Government has committed to completing and implementing the national positive ageing strategy in order that older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live independent full lives.  The strategy will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland and sets out a common framework for the development of operational plans by a number of Departments, clearly setting out each Department's objectives relating to older people.  Mechanisms designed to monitor the implementation of measures contained in operational plans will also be included in the strategy.  It is not envisaged, however, that the strategy will propose new service developments.  Rather, it will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland.<\/p><p>A considerable amount of preparatory work has been completed.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, who is the lead Minister in this area, intends to bring a draft strategy to Government in the final quarter of 2012.  I reiterate that the development of a national dementia strategy is a priority for this Government.  The research that was carried out earlier this year highlighted the primary importance of the role that families and communities play in the environment of care for people with dementia.  The financial cost, to which I alluded, is only one aspect of the overall costs.  Non-economic costs include the social, emotional and psychological strain the illness confers on people with dementia and their carers.  While I cannot at this stage pre-empt the findings of the working group that will develop the dementia strategy, having commissioned the research review and engaged in a public consultation, I can assure Senators that we are listening to what everyone has to say, including Members of this and the Lower House and outside interests across the board.  We are committed to examining all options and views put forward in this context.  I am confident this House will help inform our deliberations.  Senators can rest assured their recommendations, and insights provided by colleagues in the course of this debate, will be considered and will influence the strategy development.<\/p><p>In the current economic climate, it is very important that available resources are targeted at those most in need and that, where possible, care is provided in the community and the home.  The continuing pressure on resources in the health sector generally will make it an imperative that we obtain the very best targeting of resources towards those most in need.  The development of a national dementia strategy, combined with these other two important strategies to which I referred, will be a significant step forward in this regard.  Together with the enactment of the mental capacity legislation, they will form a solid foundation in ensuring the rights of some of our most vulnerable citizens are protected.  They, their families and carers are, and will continue to be, the focus of our considerations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#CC00500","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":284,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome his positive approach to this important aspect of Government policy.  The Minister of State has set the bar very high.  I wish him luck in achievement of the aspirations set out in the national dementia strategy and look forward to the successful conclusion of the deliberations that are under way in this regard and to our having an opportunity to discuss the proposals brought forward by the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch.  I also welcome that a draft of the strategy will be brought to Government during the final quarter of 2012.  I say this in the context of a rather interesting opinion that dementia services cost more than cancer, heart disease and stroke services combined.  Despite this, as an illness it fails to attract commensurate political and budgetary attention.  In that context, the aspirations as outlined by the Minister of State are to be welcomed.<\/p><p>As has been stated in the debate and will be stated again in future debates, there are few families that have not been touched by dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  My late aunt suffered from dementia in her declining years.  A close neighbour of mine was diagnosed with dementia at the early age of 57 years.  He was a mathematics teacher and brilliant man who was active in his community.  He died within years of his diagnosis.  The point has been made that people with dementia, as opposed to people with Alzheimer's - I understand there is a medical distinction between the two - can go on to live long lives, which places a great deal of responsibility and burden on families, friends and neighbours.  Sadly, there are also those like my neighbour who died not as a result of his condition but because of associated physical complications arising from his incapacity.<\/p> <p> The other aspect of this debate, which I know the Minister of State would be in favour of, is that in whatever strategy is developed, where possible those suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease stay in the home or in an environment to which family and friends have access.  I know this would be a priority of the Government - and I do not mean this to sound cynical - because it would be cheaper and less of a burden on the Government if those suffering from Alzheimer's disease and dementia are looked after by their family and friends rather than being institutionalised.  This also has medical benefits.  I hope the strategy will reflect this.<\/p><p>I am glad the Minister of State referred to the major costs outside of the economic and financial costs associated with dementia, as they often remain unrecognised.  I am particularly pleased he paid tribute to family and carers as well as to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  It is rather interesting that the scale of dementia is such that governments throughout the world are being forced to review their policies and reconfigure services for older people, as the Government here is doing.  It is a sad reality of life that the figures are increasing.  I do not know whether this has to do with environmental reasons.  I assume the Government provides funding in other areas of medical and scientific research, and I wonder whether it feels it has any role in advancing the research actively under way by pharmaceutical companies.  I presume they are closely monitoring results in this regard; it would be helpful in the context of the work that will be done on the strategy by the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, which might focus on the medical advances under way.  While they have not cracked it, and it seems to be a long way off, anybody who has more than a passing interest in this field will know there are regular updates on increasing discoveries about what causes Alzheimer's disease and dementia.<\/p><p>I wish to pay tribute to two people.  The first is my friend and colleague, Senator Mary White, who prepared a policy paper for our party on active ageing and quality caring.  She has been more than active in this regard, to the point that those of us in the party have had on occasion to restrain her in her enthusiasm for the subject.  I admire her, and I am sure the House would agree, for focusing on an area that does not always get the attention it deserves.  I do not mean to be at all political in this regard but I also pay tribute to the former Minister of State, \u00c1ine Brady, who from 2010 to the end of the Fianna F\u00e1il-led Administration initiated a number of policies which have been continued and expanded by the Government.  This reflects the all-party, non-political, non-partisan nature of this terrible medical condition.  I congratulate the Labour Party for bringing this important motion to the House.  We enthusiastically embrace all of its aspects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#CC00600","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am also delighted to welcome the members of the public who are in the Gallery.  They have an interest in this subject and I thank them for giving up their time.  I am glad the Minister of State has grasped the concept so well and I know he will be on top of his brief.  It is very important the national dementia strategy is put in place as soon as possible because it affects all families at some level.  According to the statistics, people in their 60s have a one in 100 chance of suffering from it, which increases to a 20 in 100 chance when one is in one's late 80s.  With our population ageing and living longer most people in this room will be affected either directly or through someone very close to them.  It is a real issue in the country.<\/p><p>Perhaps in the past the condition was not regarded as a major disablement because people stayed at home with their families, but it is a debilitating condition.  It is extremely difficult for families to watch a younger person develop early onset of dementia.  The Government and society has a role in dealing with this issue and in assisting the carers, as the difficulty of coping is sometimes left out of the loop.<\/p><p>The Department of Justice and Equality can make people wards of court and it can be awarded powers of attorney, which can be a difficulty for families and we must address this.  People physically capable of going on holiday but who need the assistance of a carer should be assisted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade if they want to go on holidays in the early stages of the disease.  At local government level, we must make towns, villages and services more friendly for people suffering from Alzheimer's disease and the onset of dementia.  According to statistics, by 2040 some 80 million people worldwide will suffer from Alzheimer's disease and dementia, as it doubles every ten years.  By that time, dementia it will be a major issue for families, and local and central government have a massive job to help communities become more friendly for people.<\/p><p>Many people are physically active into their 80s, but carers need support from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and State agencies involved in sport.  Evidence suggests Alzheimer's disease may not be as rampant in people who are more physically active, so from a cardiovascular point of view it is important the body is working.  People far more qualified than me state cardiovascular and stroke issues can lead to the early onset of dementia.  Therefore, our entire outlook on health is important for the national strategy on dementia.  The future for people in this position must be positive.<\/p><p>The HSE has a role to play in the community and voluntary sector to assist people who want to get involved.  Community employment schemes must be protected along with home help.  This is not a temporary issue we can solve; we must put in place a long-term plan.  We have seen support today from all parties.  This is something everyone supports and wants to work because this is our future as well as that of our parents and children.<\/p><p>In other countries the extended family has a role and people look after their grandparents.  This was easier to do years ago when people worked around the home and on farms.  People now travel and cannot afford to leave their parents in this position.  The Departments and agencies I mentioned have a role and must have an input into the strategy.  I look forward to the launch and delivery of the strategy on dementia.  Most people doing voluntary work are not appreciated and I thank them for their support.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and giving his time and considerate response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#DD00200","speaker":"1144"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":287,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is welcome to the House.  While listening to this debate it occurred to me that approximately one third of all debates in the House are directly related to health care.  This emphasises the importance of the issue and I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this extremely important motion.  It is an area on which we need to focus and bring about the necessary changes to assist families who must deal with a member of their family who has Alzheimer's disease or dementia.<\/p> <p>It is extremely important for us to give every possible support.<\/p><p>The Minister of State's speech was very comprehensive in setting out a clear agenda for what he intends to do in this area over the next two to three years.  Senator Cullinane and the Minister of State referred to wards of court.  One area we have not worked on over the past number of years is enduring powers of attorney even though we did bring about the change in the law.  We have not sold it as an area for people to sign up to.  That means people can assign enduring power of attorney while they are fully competent and set out clear guidelines as to how they want their affairs managed should they wind up unable to manage their affairs.  We need to do much more in that area to get across the message that this procedure is available.  As someone practising in the legal world, I find that people come to me when the person is a borderline case and it is unclear whether he or she has dementia or not.  We then try to get reports from doctors to ascertain if it is safe to get documents signed.  In nearly 50% of cases, it is too late to get that enduring power of attorney assigned.  We need to let the public know that this procedure is available.<\/p><p>I also welcome the many people in the Visitors' Gallery and thank them for their work and for putting the pressure on us to deliver in this area.  Pressure needs to be applied to us to ensure we can provide a better back-up support mechanism for people.  <\/p><p>Dementia is not necessarily confined to people over a certain age.  Over 4,500 people under 65 have dementia.  I remember canvassing in one election, knocking on a door and being asked in so I could discuss a particular problem with a member of the family.  The husband of this person was only in his mid-30s but was in full-time care as a result of developing Alzheimer's disease or dementia at a very early age.  The woman had four children under the age of 12.  It was absolutely frightening to think that there were no answers to the problems she faced for a long time.  It is not confined to an older age group and we also need proper systems of support for affected people in younger age categories.  We need to be conscious of this to ensure we do not ignore them in developing any policy changes.<\/p><p>This morning, I attended the launch of a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit about health care.  We are reacting to problems as they arise rather than looking at them before they arise and carrying out long-term planning.  We need to be proactive about screening and making sure people go for medical checks, not because they suddenly have pain or a problem but because they should have regular medical checks.  We need to promote this more.  People have a policy of only going to a doctor when they have a problem whereas we should be encouraging six-month or 12-month checks where problems can be dealt with far earlier.  <\/p><p>Screening has been introduced in Abu Dhabi across the country and 95% of the population have been screened.  Reports have been given to every individual setting out the lifestyle changes he or she needs to make.  We need to be more proactive in respect of our health care policy in this area and in getting people to look at their lifestyles, making sure they get proper advice and helping them change those lifestyles so that the cost of medical care will automatically be reduced.  <\/p><p>This is a very important topic and I fully support the motion tabled by the Labour Party group.  It is very comprehensive in an area where we need to bring about changes.  I know those changes will occur with the Minister of State's help and we will all be behind him in bringing about the required change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#DD00300","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for small business, Deputy John Perry, for the rest of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#EE00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House where he is always a welcome face.  I welcome the commitment of the Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, Deputy White, to ensuring the publication of the national dementia strategy in 2013.  We would all like to envisage an Ireland where everyone could live the life of their choosing and have a good quality of life despite their disability or despite being diagnosed with a terrible illness.  With this illness, somebody has a perfect body but his or her mind goes.  It is very sad and hurtful for the person and his or her family.  I worked in a nursing home years ago and distinctly recall a family member coming home from the US to visit his mother who did not recognise him.  The mother was in a happy place but he was not.  It was heartbreaking and wrenching to see a grown man cry because his own mother did not recognise him.<\/p><p>Obviously, early diagnosis and intervention must be looked at and developed to the highest degree.  All experts say that the earlier the diagnosis, the better the quality of life for the sufferer and the family looking after him or her.  Following on from early diagnosis of dementia, as stated in Department of Health policy, the move is to get people back into the community and living in their homes.  For that to happen, we need to put the services in place.  Part of the issue is the lack of legislation to underpin access to these services.  We need to put legislation in place to give people what they are entitled to, otherwise services are discretionary, as they are at the moment.  I know the single assessment tool will be introduced but we need to look at the services that are in place.  <\/p><p>It is very hard for people to access services on the ground, regardless of what people will say and put down on paper.  It is hard to know when people are to leave hospital or whether there will be home help available.  It is a long and hard road for the family members looking after a person with dementia.  It is hard enough to have to live with it and see one's loved one in this condition without having to fight the system.  Unfortunately, I find that people are constantly fighting the system and looking for their entitlements and rights.  As part of the strategy, we must ensure people's access and entitlement to these services is included in legislation.  <\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy White, sang the praises of carers and rightly so.  I continually fought for carers even before I was elected a Member of the Oireachtas because they are one of the most valuable assets this country has.  They are saving the State a fortune and we must look after and value them.  Once a carer is taken away from a person, he or she will inevitably end up in a nursing home or in care, which is very sad, so we must protect our carers.  The national carers' strategy has gone a long way towards underpinning their rights.  I will leave it at that because everything has been said by other Senators who have all highlighted what they want in the strategy.  I am sure the Minister of State will take on board their views and revert to the Ministers on this subject in his own time.  I thank him for taking the time to listen. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#EE00300","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I support this wide-ranging motion.  In the current economic climate, providing support for sufferers of dementia and their families is very challenging.  Unfortunately, action on the Government's commitment to introduce legislation on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is long overdue.  In response to questions on when the convention would be ratified, all Ministers who have held portfolios on this topic have said they want legislation in  place beforehand.  While we have signed up for ratification, we have not addressed all the elements required.  While our aspiration to ratify the treaty is noble, we do not recognise the urgency of doing so.  I acknowledge this was also the case under the previous Government.  Although strides were made under former Minister of State, Mr. John Moloney, to implement a new strategy on disability and mental illness, they were not enough.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, to ensure legislation is put in place in this regard.  While many of its provisions will require financial assistance, it must be acknowledged that rights do not always have financial consequences for the Exchequer.  There are many rights enshrined in the UN convention that are not upheld at present.<\/p><p>Under the Good Friday Agreement, Irish sign language is supposed to be recognised both north and south of the Border.  In the North, one can gain access to one's government through Irish sign language but this is not possible in the South.  This is amazing considering the content of the Good Friday Agreement and the UN convention.  One despairs over the fact that on one side of the Border, one will have access to government services and rights whereas, on the other, in the South, one will not.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this.  While we seem to be very good at signing up to the ratification of UN conventions, our implementation is less than desirable.  While I note the commitment on carers and others, I believe that if we are serious about ratifying UN conventions, we must ascribe to the process a greater degree of urgency than we have heretofore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#FF00100","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":292,"content":"<p>This is one of the most important issues on the agenda.  I have a copy of the report launched on 18 January 2012 in Trinity College Dublin by the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, Creating Excellence in Dementia Care.  I pay tribute to the authors, Professor Eamon O\u2019Shea, NUIG, Professor Suzanne Cahill and Dr. Maria Pierce, and I commend the work of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.<\/p><p>So much work has been done in producing the report that we do not have to reinvent the wheel.  It is an outstanding report.  The Minister, in launching it, stated there is a commitment in the programme for Government to launch a national strategy.  I look forward to its implementation.  The deadline given for this is 2013.  We are approaching 2013 so I hope all the work will be done by then.  The report is invaluable in informing this work.  One does not have to reinvent the wheel because the report is evidence based and was produced by eminent people.  Three quarters of the work is already done.  I thank the philanthropists who provided much of the funding for the work on which the report is based.  I acknowledge the work of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in its preparation.<\/p><p>Everybody has spoken about the importance of early diagnosis.  In 2010, the then Minister launched a national dementia education programme.  It seemed to identify gaps in specific education and training for nursing and non-nursing staff dealing with dementia.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, might bring that to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to determine whether there has been any re-evaluation of the programme.  What was found?  What is working and what is not working?<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke tabled a motion on the training of nurses, including gerontological training.  This is mentioned in the programme.  The Seanad engaged in community consultation with all the relevant groups associated with the elderly.  These issues, particularly training, were raised heretofore.<\/p><p>We heard so much about community care in the past few weeks.  Much of the news was bad but the good news is that community care for those suffering from dementia is vital.  Many people enter long-term care before they are ready for it.  The education, training and community-awareness programmes are not tailored to address this issue.  Two thirds of those in long-term care are estimated to have dementia.  Some are believed to be put in care prematurely.<\/p><p>One of the weaknesses of the home care services is that they are not underpinned by legislation, nor are they provided for statutorily.  Senator Moloney said that, while aspirations are fine, it is vital that there be a statutory basis to implementation.  In the absence of community support at the desired level, people with dementia continue to be placed in long-term care prematurely.<\/p><p>I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to consider funding.  I was working with a lady recently whose husband, who is quite young, has dementia.  She found two nursing homes that were willing to take him.  It is sometimes difficult to get the right nursing home to take a person because specific care is required.  However, the funding system is such that some institutions are deemed unsuitable while others are deemed suitable.  It is important that the funding system be changed to accommodate those who are willing, able, trained and HIQA approved.<\/p><p>Let us consider the emphasis on prevention.   In this regard, I was looking at the BBC only yesterday.  I happened to be in Glasgow, where I was speaking at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly on the UN declaration on disabilities.  Senator Mark Daly will be delighted to know that I have been advocating action on Irish sign language for years.  I spoke about Irish sign language at the meeting.  A motion was passed yesterday and it will be forwarded to the relevant authorities in Scotland, Wales and Ireland.  I assure the Senator that we are working on the matter.<\/p><p>With regard to music programmes, it has been found that music helps those with dementia.  While the benefits of doing crosswords, Sudoku, etc., have always been known, new research has shown that grey matter increases significantly among those who do physical exercise.

I also commend the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, on his excellent speech.  He pointed us in the right direction by outlining what is being done and what was outlined in the programme for Government.  I welcome the cross-party support by Senators.  This is a great day for the Seanad and we are all singing from the same hymn sheet.<\/p><p>Much of what I had planned to say has already been covered by my fellow Senators.  Everyone has mentioned the importance of early diagnosis and training for doctors and diagnosticians.  <\/p><p>I also welcome the mental capacity Bill and add my voice of support.  It is imperative that the Bill is brought forward and published as soon as possible.  As has been said today, it would be brilliant to have it published during the first six months of next year during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union.<\/p><p>In reference to planning for the future, I would like to highlight the work that has been done by all of the excellent societies and associations.  The Alzheimer Society has been congratulated on its 30th anniversary but there are many other groups that provide care and services.  I note that Mr. Diarmuid Hanifin from Amnesty International was here earlier.  I also note the work done by Older &amp; Bolder, the Positive Age groups and through the national positive ageing strategy.  Recently I launched positive ageing week in Dundalk and I was amazed to see the services that are available and provided by volunteers.<\/p><p>I wish to mention the work done by the Irish Hospice Foundation through its Think Ahead project.  It urges people to think about and pre-record their wishes in the event of serious illness or death.  The Think Ahead form was launched on 12 October at the forum on the end of life and I was involved in the project.  A pilot programme is being rolled out in County Louth.  It is one of the counties being used for the pilot scheme.  The Think Ahead project presents us with a wonderful opportunity.  I urge everybody, from fellow colleagues to associations, to watch out for the scheme being rolled out in their area as it gives everyone an opportunity to plan for later in life.  For people in the early stages of dementia the form is a wonderful tool and will ensure that their wishes are carried out even when they are no longer able to speak for themselves.  The scheme is invaluable when a person's capacity to make important choices fluctuates.  I have mentioned how important it is to introduce and publish the mental capacity Bill as soon as possible.<\/p><p>An issue was brought to my attention this week by someone who works in dementia care and the issue was not raised earlier.  I refer to the safeguarding of people with dementia who are at risk of abuse, particularly in their homes.  We all hope that the children's referendum will be passed on 10 November.  It will ensure that children at risk can be removed to a place of safety in order to protect them in exceptional circumstances. So much work must also be done to protect a person with dementia who is at risk.  At present the only places of safety that are available to them are the accident and emergency department of a hospital or a Garda barracks.  Neither is suitable for a severely confused person.  I want to bring the matter to the Minister of State's attention and I ask for it to be considered when the strategy is being rolled out.  I know that some work has been done and is ongoing regarding the matter.  It is vital that we examine it further.<\/p><p>As has been said many times today, carers are the lynchpin and we could not provide a service without them.  I wish to express my sincere thanks to them for all of their work.  There are thousands of carers and they provide care to dementia sufferers, people with disabilities and older people.  Yesterday I spoke to a girl who rang me because she was distraught and worried about her 92-year old grandparents.  She was simply looking for a night's sleep and wanted care to be provided.  The care service is important.  Again, I thank the carers for all of the work they do.           <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#GG00300","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351074600,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I call Senator Susan O'Keeffe and she has four minutes to conclude the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#GG00400","nonspeaker":"Acting Chairman (Senator Pat O'Neil)"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, for replacing the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White.<\/p><p>  I thank my colleagues in the Labour Party for all of the work that has been done to table the motion today and I thank Senator Landy for seconding it.  I also thank all of my colleagues in the Seanad.  As a Senator has rightly expressed, it is political but not party political.  The way Senators have robustly supported the motion reminds us all of its importance.  It sends a clear message to those who will be charged with pulling together the important strategy.  It proves that we all care about dementia and that there are many ways to form the strategy.  I hope that some of what we have offered today will become part of the strategy.  <\/p><p>  I welcome Deputy Alex White's commitment to publish the mental capacity legislation during this session.  I welcome his reiteration that the national dementia strategy will be delivered and implemented over the next five years.  It is important to note, while we are here being positive together, that the Government is driving the strategy forward.  The commitment given in the programme for Government stands as a real commitment to the people inside and outside of the chamber and also to the thousands of people who struggle with dementia and care for their loved ones.  Those people want to see that resources and budgets are spent wisely and in a more targeted way in the future.<\/p><p>  Tomorrow the Alzheimer Society will host a conference where <font color=\"#222222\">Gr\u00e1inne McGettrick <\/font>will speak about transforming the lives of people with dementia.  The national dementia strategy wants to transform the lives of those who have dementia and their carers.  I shall remind Members of what was cited earlier.  We said that: carers are crucial to the strategy and its implementation; that its approach is person-centred when providing care and services; that it is based, as far as possible, in the community; that there would be more and specified training; that standards of care are outlined in the strategy; that the budget, if it can be, is ring-fenced and targeted with a better direction of all resources; and that a clinical director in the HSE be appointed to take care of the latter.  <\/p><p>  The Minister asked me about research.  One of the advantages of having a relatively homogenous population in Ireland means that an EU joint programme initiative is commencing through the Health Research Board.  Ireland will participate in the research on Alzheimer's disease and the strategic research agenda is being prepared.  The measure will add to the entire work.  Many people work in the dementia sector and many of whom will be present at the Alzheimer Society's conference tomorrow.  I commend the work done by the Alzheimer Society and the many organisations that care about dementia and for the people who care about dementia.  I thank the Members for a robust and strong debate and I am glad that we have managed to reach agreement on the motion.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#GG00500","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1351074600,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from D\u00e1il","time":1351074600,"count":299,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#HH00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":300,"content":"<p>D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann agreed on 23 October 2012 to the amendments made by Seanad \u00c9ireann to the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2008.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#HH00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Amendment to Terms of Reference of Tribunal of Inquiry: Motion","time":1351074600,"count":301,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#HH00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":302,"content":"<p>I move:<ul><br>That Seanad \u00c9ireann resolves that the terms of reference contained in the Resolution passed by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann on 23 March 2005 and by Seanad \u00c9ireann on 24 March 2005, as amended by the Resolutions passed by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and Seanad \u00c9ireann on 1 June 2011, the Resolution passed by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann on 16 November 2011 and by Seanad \u00c9ireann on 17 November 2011, and the Resolutions passed by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and Seanad \u00c9ireann on 23 May 2012, pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2011, be further amended as follows: <ul>1. in paragraph (I), by substituting 'not later than 31 January, 2013 and 30 April, 2013 and, on each of those occasions, shall set out:' for 'not later than 9 March, 2012 setting out:'; and <br>2. in paragraph (IV), by substituting 'not later than 31 July, 2013' for 'not later than 31 October, 2012'.&quot;<i><\/i><\/ul><\/ul><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#HH00400","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":303,"content":"<p>This motion proposes to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry into suggestions of collusion by members of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na or other employees of the State in the murder by the Provisional IRA of RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and RUC Superintendent Bob Buchanan in March 1989.  The tribunal, as Members know, was established by the Oireachtas in 2005 and it is chaired by Judge Peter Smithwick, former President of the District Court.  The Smithwick tribunal was established arising from the Weston Park talks in 2001 and in light of Judge Peter Cory's subsequent report on the murder of the RUC officers.  Its purpose is to get at the truth of these suggestions of collusion both in the public interest and, importantly, in the interests of the families who were bereaved by this atrocity.<\/p><p>Senators will be aware that, on 12 October, the Clerk of the D\u00e1il received a letter from the tribunal chairman requesting an extension of the deadline for the conclusion of the tribunal's work.  The Clerk of the D\u00e1il laid that letter before both Houses.  This motion will provide for an extension of nine months, that is, to 31 July 2013, to the current date established for the conclusion of the tribunal's inquiries and the submission of its final report.  This is fully in line with Judge Smithwick's request, and the Government hopes the tribunal can fulfil its mandate within the revised timefrarne which has been set out.<\/p><p>In his recent letter the tribunal chairman states that due to the serious illness of a key witness and based on the medical advice of the witness's doctor, the taking of evidence from that witness has had to be deferred for a period of five or six months.  This witness is considered fundamental to the tribunal's remit and the chairman indicates he must provide for completing his evidence when the witness is medically fit so to do.  The chairman notes that, due to the ill-health of this witness, the taking of his evidence has been significantly delayed.<\/p><p>Judge Smithwick also states that additional intelligence-based material was only recently and unexpectedly presented to the tribunal.  In July and again in September of this year, the British authorities and the Police Service of Northern Ireland provided this new material to the tribunal.  The chairman considers this material to be highly relevant to the work of the tribunal and that he must, therefore, investigate it and provide for hearings related to it, if need be.<\/p><p>It is clearly a matter of concern that significant information should emerge at such a late stage in the tribunal's hearings.  However, it is a matter for the tribunal at this stage to address the issues arising and the House will appreciate that I could not comment in detail on the matter without becoming involved in the substance of the work being carried on at the tribunal.  I note, however, that the chairman makes the point in his letter that some of this new material is currently highly sensitive and characterised as being &quot;of the moment&quot;.  I regard it as surprising that new material of relevance to the tribunal's work has been furnished to it only very recently having regard to the duration of the tribunal's engagement.  I believe it is essential such information that does exist and that is of relevance to the tribunal's terms of reference is made available fully to the tribunal and that the completion of its important work and of its deliberations is not unnecessarily delayed.  In light of the late emergence of this material, I have been assured by the British authorities that every assistance is being afforded by them to the tribunal.  In addition, I have assured Judge Smithwick that I remain available to assist him in this regard if at any stage he feels it necessary or appropriate.<\/p><p>The Government, having considered the tribunal chairman's request, proposes that the D\u00e1il should resolve to extend the timeframe for the tribunal as requested and that this House should do so as well.  As an additional measure and to ensure this House is kept fully abreast of the tribunal's progress towards conclusion in this additional period, the proposal provides for two further interim reports from the tribunal to be submitted by 31 January 2013 and by 31 April 2013.  I emphasise, as I have done previously, that if, for any reason, it does not prove possible for the tribunal to meet the timeframe set out, the chairman can report this to the Clerk of the D\u00e1il in order that the House might consider the matter further.  I can also reassure this House that, as we have demonstrated to date, the Government's response to such an approach from the chairman would be fully cognisant of and consistent with the need for the tribunal to fulfil its obligations fully and as expeditiously as possible.<\/p><p>The Government respects the importance of the tribunal chairman carrying out his inquiries fully and without fear or favour, and is anxious to support him in doing that.  I am confident this motion will assist in that endeavour and I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#HH00500","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>I support the proposal of the Government in the Seanad.

They were awful murders, but this was par for the course for an organisation which murdered a total of 656 members of the British forces, 621 civilians, 272 police officers, 35 loyalist terrorists, six garda\u00ed, and a soldier, as well as a number of its own members.<\/p><p>The Weston Park talks were the catalyst for the setting up of the Smithwick tribunal.  There were suggestions of collusion in a number of murders by the security forces on both sides of the Border.  Following a review by Judge Cory, the Smithwick tribunal was set up in this jurisdiction to examine the murders of Harry Breen and Robert Buchanan.<\/p> <p>Serious allegations were made in respect of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and it is crucial that the Smithwick tribunal gets to the truth of this matter.  One also must ask members of the Government to do more to press their colleagues in the British Government in respect of investigating the murder of Mr. Pat Finucane.<\/p><p>The Smithwick tribunal has been working for a number of years and the Minister has set out, both today and on a number of previous occasions, the reasons the judge has stated his work will take some time.  The Oireachtas must give the judge the additional time.  One hopes this will be the last extension but Members must be guided by the judge in respect of his needs and the needs of witnesses, balanced with the needs of the families of the murdered officers to get to the truth, as well as for the peace process to move forward.  One must always bear in mind that this particular tribunal is an integral part of the peace process, which is still ongoing.<\/p><p>There would be no necessity to spend millions of euro on tribunals were those who were involved in those murders and their colleagues from the Sinn F\u00e9in Party, some of whom are Members of these Houses but who are absent today, to give information they have.

They should answer the questions and should give as much information as they have.  They should answer the questions in respect of various despicable and cowardly murders that have taken place.  They also should answer the questions in respect of the burial of bodies in my part of County Meath in Oristown, Coghalstown and Wilkinstown.  Members of Sinn F\u00e9in, which provided political support for these murders over the years, must co-operate and give as much information as they have.

I support the motion he has presented before Members and compliment the previous speaker on his support for the motion and on outlining some of the background to the problems on the northern part of our land.  When the Minister came before the House previously, it was hoped that such an extension as is now being proposed would not be necessary.  What is most important, however, is that the Smithwick tribunal has the time and resources available to it to carry out its important work and to report to Members at the earliest possible date.  It is highly significant that Judge Smithwick has put on record his requirement for an extension of time, as well as the possibility of significant new evidence being available.  While everyone obviously wishes such evidence had been available at an earlier date, it is never the wrong time for the right thing, so to speak, and this evidence must be investigated fully.<\/p><p>This particular tragedy from 1989 obviously is one of the many tragedies the people, North and South, experienced over a number of decades during the IRA-led violence.  One must recognise, however, that there were horrible incidents on all sides of the political divide and, as part of our attempt to build a new and peaceful future on this island, we must, in so far as possible, bring truth and reconciliation to the table.  At the onset of this tribunal, many people may have felt that although it was being set up, it somehow was little more than a type of political sop.  Nothing could be further from the reality, however, and this is a serious tribunal engaged in important work.  Members must give it the time and space it seeks of them.<\/p><p>I support the motion with these few words and note Members must not and cannot be afraid of the truth being revealed.  The truth, as it relates to the dreadful campaign of violence across the island, and across Northern Ireland in particular, for almost 30 years, will be painful, but Members must deal with that reality and support the work of this tribunal.

It is undoubtedly frustrating that Members are back here again, but given what the Minister has indicated, they all must accept there is no alternative and the tribunal has good reason to seek this extension at this time.  It must be stated, however, that more than six years have elapsed since the tribunal was instituted.  It commenced its investigations in early 2006 and is now due to report by 31 July 2013, by which time it will have been in being for more than seven years.  Consequently, it is unfortunate it has been obliged to take so long.  There is no doubt that the murders of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and RUC Superintendent Bob Buchanan were especially heinous, and I believe all Members have expressed sympathy to their families as well as an understanding that the tribunal is undertaking necessary work in investigating the circumstances of those murders.<\/p><p>  The Minister has explained the two key reasons the chair of the tribunal has sought the extension of time, namely, the illness of a key witness and the fact of evidence newly provided by the PSNI and the British authorities.  In what perhaps was a strong understatement, the Minister noted it is surprising the new material has been furnished only recently to the tribunal.  It certainly appears to be material that is or may be of particular value to the tribunal and, consequently, the latter clearly will require more time.  It also is of concern that one of the key witnesses has been very ill, and I imagine all Members hope for his speedy recovery and certainly hope he will be able to give the evidence required within the timeframe provided for by the extension.

In respect of the other reason for seeking an extension, I merely state my hope, in the context of this motion being passed, that any individual or group on this island or elsewhere who has additional information that falls within the terms of reference of this tribunal would furnish that information to the tribunal without any further delay.<\/p><p>I hope it will not prove necessary to extend further the life of the tribunal.

It is crucial, if there is anything of any relevance that anyone has in his or her possession which would inform the deliberations of the tribunal and assist it in reaching its conclusion and which remains outstanding, that it is furnished to the tribunal.

We are all very acutely aware of the facts and reminded on a daily basis of the serious financial difficulty we have and the shortfall of &#8364;16 billion.  There are also requirements under the terms of the EU-IMF bailout agreement to reduce our borrowing for 2013 by &#8364;3.5 billion.  The Minister's Department has a budget of &#8364;20.5 billion, accounting for 40% of overall Government expenditure, and I am very aware she is required to reduce the budget by &#8364;540 million in 2013.  I appreciate the difficult decisions that have to be taken and cuts that must be made.<\/p><p>  To build on the comments of my colleague, Senator Zappone, in the first part of this debate last week, there is a question about how these cuts are made and against whom they are directed.  These are ultimately political decisions.  There is nothing more disheartening as a Senator than to feel my interventions about any budgetary cuts are futile in the face of a done deal, so I welcome the Minister's reassurance that no decisions have been finalised in respect of the 2013 budget.<\/p><p>  We need to stop plugging the dam and looking for immediate savings, which are ultimately bankrupting us of our moral fibre.  As a Government and society we must firmly establish our red lines, or the values and principles that we are unwilling to yield.  An example of this was aptly articulated yesterday in the audiovisual room by the community and voluntary pillar, when it presented an alternative budget for 2013, with values such as dignity, sustainability, equality, human rights and working for the common good.  Such values inherently seek to protect children, the elderly, disabled, weak, vulnerable and marginalised, it makes for a value system that I support and endorse.<\/p><p>  We must articulate a vision for the Ireland we want in ten years, developing strategies that are necessary to achieve this vision by incorporating values and aligning them with national policies.  We can do this and I do not agree that Ireland is bound by the current policies for achieving the &#8364;3.5 billion reduction in borrowing as set out in the letter of intent, memorandum of economic and financial policies, and the technical memorandum of understanding.  Within the document I note the paragraph following the proposed revenue measures and expenditure reduction in the memorandum, which states:<ul>Without prejudice to the minimum consolidation amount referred to in the previous paragraph and to the requirements to achieve the agreed fiscal targets, the Government may, in consultation with the staff of the European Commission, the IMF and the ECB, replace one or more of the above measures with others of equally good quality based on the options identified in the comprehensive review of expenditure.<\/ul>I am not alone in reading this to mean that Ireland is free to change the method through which the requisite saving is made, once it is made.<\/p><p>  It is interesting to note that Social Justice Ireland agreed with 130 of the 131 recommendations made by the Commission on Taxation report from 2009 on tax breaks.  The exception was the recommendation on child benefit.  Lists of savings are possible, and I strongly encourage the Government to consider the proposals.  I do this on behalf of the more than 700,000 people in Ireland, of which 200,000 are children, at risk of poverty, and the more than one in four children between age 12 and 17 already living in poverty.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service gave a good presentation earlier this morning on the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, demonstrating that households with children are at more of a disadvantage and are more likely to enter poverty.  Our current policy is not working, although it may satisfy the troika and meet international requirements.  It is not working for the raft of Irish people bearing the brunt of the cuts.<\/p><p>  In preparing for today's discussion I pondered how we have a multi-annual plan for the troika and education officials are considering school infrastructure, responding to change in demographics with a multi-annual plan.  The action plan for jobs brings us up to 2016.  The plan for the country's people, however, is missing.  Where is that plan?  I have spoken with friends who are holding on to savings despite being encouraged to spend.  When there is no plan for the people, it is an issue.<\/p> <p>Those living in extremely marginalised and vulnerable conditions do not know where the safety net is and feel it keeps moving.  They are walking on this tightrope and are asking where the safety net is because it has moved again.<\/p><p>We need to look not only at one budget - all the focus now is on budget 2013 - but at things much more in advance.  The programme for Government referred to working across Departments.  If one looks solely at the issue of child benefit, the question is whether we tax or means test it rather the Minister's Department looking outside itself and asking why we are giving child benefit and the purpose of it.  Is there a better way to achieve the outcomes we wish other than by purely looking at cash transfers?  I suppose I am trying to encourage the Minister and her colleagues in Cabinet not to look simplistically at cash savings but to have a plan for the people to say this is where we are going.  We can do it for jobs and for the troika but can we do it for the people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#LL00200","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I did not get an opportunity on the previous occasion she was in the House to speak on matters relating to social welfare and I am glad I have the opportunity to do so now.  I was in the Mansion House today where the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, introduced a proposal to reform the social welfare appeals system, which was launched by the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly.  It is looking for it to be independent of the social welfare staff who run it currently.  I agree with much of what I heard.  Presentations were also made by people from Northern Ireland where the appeals system is totally independent.<\/p><p>Our system is not transparent.  If one applies for a social welfare payment, one does not know who is dealing with it.  The deciding officer may not be the person who dealt with the case.  One does not know the doctors dealing with it and, as I often say, doctors differ and patients die.  There are many medical referees and they would all have varying opinions, but one does not have access to the file.  If a person wants to appeal a decision of a deciding officer, he or she does not get access to the full file, something of which the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, was critical.  She was also critical of some of the deciding officers' decisions.  An interesting statistic was that where people got the benefit of an oral hearing, 49% of cases were overturned because people were able to present their cases.  Social welfare application forms are very confusing for ordinary people to complete.  Many of the 30 to 40 pages are nonsense and do not apply to them.<\/p><p>There was also a presentation by the chief appeals officer and, listening to her, it would seem there is no problem in the Department.  There are problems and I know the Minister has been fundamental in bringing about a change in the scanning system in the Department, but there are historical cases which are just left there, as it were.  I have been dealing with a case since last January and I do not know how many telephones calls I have made to the invalidity pension section.  I telephoned it two weeks ago, said I was frustrated and that I needed someone to deal with the case.  I happened to talk to a nice lady and it was like as if she had a box of files beside her.  She told me to hold on for a second.  She came straight back to me and said she had the file, that it had been there for a while and that she would get it sent on for a medical re-evaluation.  I telephoned again today to find out at what stage the medical re-evaluation was.  The girl said it had been sent on but that she did not know when it would be dealt with.  I asked her to give me an indication as to whether it would be one month, two months, six months or a year.  She said she had no idea.  I am frustrated by what people must go through.  I am going through it too because I am taking all the telephone calls on this.  The Minister needs to talk to the chief appeals officer and to question this.  I can give her examples of historical cases in respect of which nothing has happened for 12 to 14 months.<\/p><p>Rent caps were adjusted some time ago but it seems they were just slashed by 25% across the board.  There was nothing scientific about the way the new rent caps were devised.  In Roscommon town, where there is a shortage of houses, because it did not benefit from the tax incentive scheme and oceans of houses were not built with landlords crying out to rent them, the rent cap for a single person is \u20ac69 per week.  If one heads south from Roscommon and in the direction of County Galway, one will come to a little village called Creggs on the Galway-Roscommon border.  If one happens to live outside the village of Creggs in the middle of nowhere, the rent cap is \u20ac103 per week because it is in County Galway.  We must look realistically at rent caps and at the likes of Roscommon town.<\/p><p>I refer to an issue which is not specific to the Minister but which I raised with the Minister for Health and other Ministers, namely, the proposed cuts to home help hours.  I have made a proposal to the Minister for Health that he should consider opening it up to the community employment schemes to replace the hours proposed to be cut.  At a minimum cost of \u20ac750,000, we could replace the necessary home help hours which are proposed to be cut.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#MM00200","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to make a few brief points.  Everyone appreciates the Minister is in a very difficult position.  She is more used to being in my position than that which she is in now and she will know that whatever she does, she will be wrong.  That is the difficulty the Minister for Social Protection faces at this time.<\/p><p>Senator Kelly made a point I was thinking about in the context of appeals processes and representations made in regard to invalidity pension in particular.  The analogy I was thinking about was not so much the box.  When I telephone the Department I sometimes feel it is as elusive as my ticket being drawn on &quot;Winning Streak&quot; because at times one wonders if there is a filing system at all because of the length of time it takes.<\/p><p>This is a serious issue.  We are dealing with the most vulnerable who are in the most difficulty.  It is hand to mouth survival stuff as opposed to looking after people.  Notwithstanding that the people in the relevant Departments are working hard, are there enough people?   Do we need overtime?  Does more time need to be put in?  Indeed, Senator Kelly made a very good suggestion in regard to CE schemes.  Let us use the JobBridge programme, bring people in, give them administrative experience, give them the extra \u20ac50 per week and get them to work through this.<\/p><p>One of the criticisms I would have of the public service generally is that, in the main, the culture is that one works from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  In the private sector and in the political world, it is a bit different in that one works until the job is done.  I know that might not be quite realistic in the context of so many applications, files and so on but one thing is certain: we cannot, with credibility, stand over the system in operation and say everyone is doing all he or she can.  We are failing miserably in that regard.  I am sure all Members of this House and the other would say the most frequent requests with which they must deal relate to invalidity pensions and delays with appeals, along with medical cards.<\/p><p>The Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, and FLAC are correct, and I am thinking of the mortgage arrears resolution process, the code of conduct and the inadequate way we are dealing with that problem.  The banks adjudicate on the appeals process where a person feels he or she has not been treated fairly.  The appeals process in the Department of Social Protection is adjudicated on by people in that Department.  I can think of no justification where a plaintiff or a defendant would preside over an appeal in a court of law.<\/p><\/a> <p>This should and must be examined.<\/p><p>The Minister can make no cut or saving that anybody on this side of the House will welcome and she knows all about that from her time in opposition.  I appeal to her to be as fair as she can.  She should be careful with child benefit.  People have gone to the media to say they do not need child benefit or they can survive without it because they have a high salary.  I am thinking of someone in the entertainment world particularly who made a statement in this regard lately.  A book should not be judged by its cover.  As when trade unionists talk about core income being what others might call allowances, the child benefit payment is probably used to pay essential bills such as light and heating rather than contributing to the needs of children, for which the payment was envisaged, and, therefore, it forms part of the core income to run the family home in many instances.  It will be difficult to deal with that issue.  Means testing would be the ideal way to go but the cost of administration makes that difficult.  I do not know how the Minister will deal with it.  If I had a solution, I would give it to her but I appeal to her to be careful about it.  I wish her well in her deliberations over the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#MM00300","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":318,"content":"<\/a> <p>I compliment the Minister on the many reforms she has introduced in the social welfare system over the past 18 months.  Significant amounts have been taken in as a result of tackling fraud in the system and I am sure the Minister will agree there is a long road to go and more to be done in that regard.  I compliment her on the JobBridge programme and she should be complimented in many other areas.   However, we all dwell on the problems in the system.  I will relay many of the issues raised on the Order of Business over the past number of weeks.  The issue of FLAC and the independent appeals system has been raised.  I thought the entire system was independent but the Minister will address that in her reply.<\/p><p>The long delays in processing various allowances is a problem.  The delay in processing carer's allowance and invalidity applications is almost 12 months.  Additional staff have been taken on and community welfare officers are now under the ambit of Social Protection but I agree that if there is need to take more staff in that area, it should be done to address the delays because the vast majority applying for these benefits are bona fide applicants and they should be dealt with speedily.<\/p><p>I also compliment the Minister on the report she commissioned on pensions.  She is seeking suggestions in this area over the next three months.  Many Members raised this on the Order of Business earlier and they would like an input into that.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister will come to the House to address the issue at a later date.<\/p><p>The Minister for Health has received proposals from Senator Kelly, which he also sent to me, to use people on community employment schemes to provide home help services but I doubt there will be a rush of people on social welfare benefits to take up community employment schemes for an additional \u20ac25 a week.<\/p><p>I finally refer to the old chestnut of children's allowances.  The reason they could not be taxed previously was the incompatibility of the IT systems in the Department with those of Revenue and other Departments.  Has this been rectified?  Is there light at the end of the tunnel?  What is the situation in this regard?  I wish the Minister well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#NN00200","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":319,"content":"<\/a> <p>I welcome the Minister.  While the Department of Social Protection has a role in the protection of the most needy in our society, it also has a duty of care to people in employment because people feel there is inequality in regard to the benefits some claimants get under the social welfare system which they cannot access in employment.  Many Members referred to children's allowance and the fact that the most wealthy people in the country are in receipt of it.  The problem has been the inability to means test because computer systems were not linked.  Would the Minister consider a basic rate of &#8364;70, &#8364;80 or &#8364;100 a week with people having to apply for a top up in order that they receive the payment automatically from the Government?  If, for example, a claimant's income is below a certain threshold, he or she could be entitled to an additional payment for children.  It would be worth considering because the administration of that would not be as onerous as means testing and taxing the benefit.<\/p><p>  I refer to the social welfare culture in the country.  There was a great article in <i>The Times<\/i> a few months ago about the establishment of the social welfare system in England.  In cities in England, three generations of some families have never worked in their lives and rely on social welfare.  That is down to education and to administrators such as us making sure these people have proper opportunities to access education and training schemes.  Will the Minister consider a cap on the amount of social welfare that goes into certain houses?  This issue has been raised with me when I meet people on the street.  They say they have neighbours with five people in the house who are all on social welfare while they are out working.  A man who works in the public service said to me, &quot;I have educated my family and sent them through university.  For me to gain the equivalent of somebody down the road from me who is on social welfare and married with four children, I would have to earn &#8364;62,000 because of the benefits these people can claim&quot;.  That is an example of the inequalities in the social protection system.  People feel it is not beneficial to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#NN00300","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":320,"content":"<\/a> <p>I will return to some of the issues raised last week as well.  With regard to the issues relating to applications for demand-led schemes such as illness and disability benefit and invalidity pension, we do not appreciate in this country that 300,000 people and their families are on these three schemes, which comprises 16% of the working age population.

A total of 300,000 people are on one form of illness support payment or other and they may have dependants and children.  That equates to 16% of adults of working age.<\/p> <p>That is a very high figure.  Countries that we recognise as having good social welfare systems and that have reformed social welfare, such as Denmark, Holland and the Scandinavian countries, have changed from a passive system, where one qualifies for payment and is left alone forever, to an active system where we try to encourage people back to work.  This applies in particular to illness benefits.  The best international medical evidence and occupational health evidence is that, where people have had an illness and have been able to physically recover, what most helps their recovery is to get back to work and to be in an active environment with work colleagues.  They may not be able to do so on a full-time basis but the evidence from doctors in recent years points this way.  We have not had that in our system.  Much of my focus is to say that the social contract in Ireland is that people will be supported if they lose their jobs, fall ill or have a disability.  Taxpayers and citizens want to see a solid system of social support but it is a two-way contract.  Equally, the other side of the contract is that the people receiving income support are obliged, on behalf of their fellow citizens and taxpayers, to do their best to get themselves back to work and to become financially independent.  That is a cultural change we require.<\/p><p>Regarding Senator MacSharry's point, I was astonished to see that, at the height of the Celtic tiger, some 100,000 extra people went onto various illness benefit payments.

We could all work out different elements of the explanation and, when people talk about reform, it is a significant number.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout referred to children.  The worst poverty outcome for children is to be in jobless households.  The most important thing for a child to be successful, in terms of being financially independent and self-sustaining, is that the child is in a household where there is some work.  The worst outcomes for children are in jobless households and, unfortunately in terms of our problem at the moment, we have many jobless households.  In terms of any reform programme, the employment situation, which was referred to by many Senators, is absolutely vital.<\/p><p>Members asked questions about carers, the half-rate carer's allowance and delays.  The delays occur because of the enormous volume of applications.  There are 52,000 people in receipt of a carer's allowance, which is an enormous increase on the position a number of years ago.  Some 22,000 of those people receive the half rate carer's allowance.  In the budget strategy and the budget outcome last year, the carer's allowance was protected because carers are providing full-time care and are doing a very important job.  It is a priority of the Government to acknowledge it, recognise it and support it in terms of income.<\/p><p>Senator Norris asked whether the carer's allowance could be extended and whether fuel allowances could be frontloaded to allow people to buy oil in bulk.  We have a winter fuel allowance for five months.  We do not have the capacity to prepay.  It is possibly not the best idea in all circumstances.  Senator Norris referred to people getting a fill of oil but most oil suppliers will accept a weekly or monthly budget plan.  I would be wary of handing out the money in one lump sum.  The experience of the Department in large lump sum handouts is not universally great.  In some cases, the money might not be directed to the purpose for which it is intended.  We need to study Senator Norris's proposal very carefully.<\/p><p>Senators Thomas Byrne and John Kelly referred to delays in applications for carer's allowance.  The problem is the numbers.  We are changing the computer systems.  Many of the computer processes in the Department go back to the 1980s, when they were top of the range, but it is several decades later and they need to be substantially overhauled.  One of the things I regret about the boom period is that more was not done to update the ICT systems.  It is a slow process that is under way.  Senators will find that, in the case of invalidity, there is a significant advance in completing the new systems.  Current applications are being dealt with much more quickly.  I meet regularly with officials with a view to prioritising the clearance of the backlog.<\/p><p>Senator Mullins referred to the abuse of the free travel pass and suggested a charge for the travel pass and getting holders to register every year to confirm an entitlement.  The number in receipt of a travel pass has increased and it is a significant issue.  Some 750,000 pensioners and those with a disability have a free travel pass but there are another 300,000 companion passes.  There is a concern among a number of operators that some people are using the pass even though they are not entitled to it.  Our pensioners are not the problem in respect of the travel pass.  The review group was brought together to examine the matter.<\/p><p>This year, we have produced 40,000 PPS cards with photographic identity.  This will be rolled out next year and it will greatly help in cutting out abuse.  It is important because people next door and up and down the road are aware of abuse and they are consenting, as taxpayers, to pay for a good social welfare system but they are not consenting to people who abuse it.  I was in the Seanad Chamber last year and I asked for powers for social welfare inspectors to ask questions at the airport of people coming in and out.  Those powers are being significantly used and a number of prosecutions have taken place.<\/p><p>Members have asked about not having cuts to certain areas but no decisions have been made on the budget.  The Department must find savings of over \u20ac500 million.  We will do so in the best way possible but the best way is to get more people back to work.  At that point, the cost to the State decreases by at least \u20ac200 per week and maybe more and the person gradually pays tax, pays PRSI and purchases more.  We rebalance the system by getting people back to work.<\/p> <p>The social welfare appeals office is independent of the social welfare offices.  Many people, including Senator Kelly, do not feel that is the case but it is independent.  I will convey what has been said here to the people in the social welfare appeals office.<\/p><p>Senator Van Turnhout and others raised the question of child benefit.  I have spoken here before on this.  One of our problems is that at the moment minimum direct cash payments to a family completely dependent on social welfare amount to \u20ac30 per week in direct payment for a qualified child and \u20ac140 per month in child benefit.  That is equivalent to \u20ac65 per week per child.  It is a significant amount.<\/p><p>Are there better ways to target that?  That is the issue.  Could there be a universal payment at a high level that retains the principle of universality, which is of benefit to women in particular?  I certainly benefited from it, as did many of the other women here.  Perhaps some of the men did but it generally goes to the caring parent, the mother.  What would be a better way than a universal payment at a certain level and then targeting the balance?<\/p><p>In Finland, when the banking system collapsed, the Finnish Government decided it needed to invest in education and started with pre-school.  If we could have more pre-school and after-school care, although we would not get it immediately on the Finnish scale, it would pay a dividend throughout the school system.  The late Brian Lenihan converted the early childhood payment into a free year of child care, which saved about half the amount and I can see the benefit of that scheme every day.  I see children gaining from it and parents broadly approving of it.<\/p><p>We could do more there.  The Department spends \u20ac35 million on the hot meals schemes in disadvantaged schools.  That is some of the best spent money by the Department and I would love to see that service expanded.  A child who comes into school may not suffer from a lack of money in the home but a lack of organisation.  There could be parental disorganisation or failure.  Not everyone is up to speed.  Children come into school and if they can sit down to a hot meal in a social space with their friends before the start of the school day, it is a great addition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#OO00300","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":327,"content":"<p>What about the family resource centres?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#PP00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":328,"content":"<p>The Senator mentioned that to me and it merits consideration.

In the context of the structure of the Irish system, that would be difficult.  At the moment there might be a family with payments for themselves and their children, some of those payments as carers, some as payments for disability, some as payments from the HSE.  In countries like Austria, people have an account so we can see the flows of support.  Some of those supports, however, are not counted by the Department, such as education, in the same way as other countries.  This should be considered but it would be difficult in the current situation.<\/p><p>We are, however, constantly writing to recipients of child benefit to check they are still in the State and at the address that was given when the claim was made.  A case was widely publicised last week of the actor who was stealing to support his children.  From what I read, he had moved and had received at least two letters from the Department asking him to respond to demonstrate he was still entitled to child benefit.  Unfortunately he did not respond.

Fishermen being lost at sea is a major issue on the south-eastern and southern coast of Ireland, as it is across the entire country.  We have lost many fishermen all around Ireland and I know many families personally who have been affected by this in the south east.<\/p> <p>One only needs to consider the grief and sorrow left in the wake of tragedies such as the <i>Tit Bonhomme<\/i>, the <i>Honey Dew II<\/i>and others.  More needs to be done to ensure the safety of our fishermen.  It is clear that the first few hours are crucial in finding fishermen alive - or finding them at all - after they have gone overboard.  If we are able to track them or find them via GPS in those first few crucial hours, many lives could be saved.  Deputy Colreavy asked a parliamentary question on this matter in March.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport replied:<ul><ul>Currently all Irish registered fishing vessels are required to be fitted with Emergency Indicating Position Beacons (EPIRBs).  All fishing vessels over 12 metres in length must carry an automatically activating float-free automatic EPIRB and vessels less than 12 metres LOA (length over all) only have to carry a manually operated EPIRB.<\/ul><\/ul>However, this is focused on the vessel rather than the individual and therefore does not assist in any significant way in locating those who have gone overboard.<\/p><p> The Minister indicated in March that officials from his Department were examining, in conjunction with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, issues relating to the carriage of personal locator beacons, PLBs, by fishermen as an enhancement to existing measures.  He said they would be assessing the effectiveness of such electronic devices when used in conjunction with existing safety measures such as lifejackets and personal floatation devices.  In the seven months since this was raised in the D\u00e1il, what progress has been made on these PLB systems?<\/p><p> According to the Fishing Vessel (Personal Flotation Devices) Regulations 2001 every fishing vessel must carry a suitable personal flotation device for every person on board, and the personal flotation device must be worn at all times by the crew of the fishing vessel when on the exposed deck of the vessel, whether at sea, in harbour or coming to and from moorings.<\/p><p> A personal locator beacon, PLB, is a small transmitter that gives the position of the person but it is not as powerful as an EPIRB - the equipment for the boat itself.  A PLB is often worn like a watch by divers.  Surely it should not be too difficult for flotation devices, generally life jackets, to have PLB devices or some other form of similar system with a small device on the life jacket?  The Government should take steps to ensure that this happens, as it would save lives.  It would make it much easier for fishermen to be found in the first few hours.  As the Minister of State will know it becomes extremely difficult to locate people or bodies after 24 hours.  However, it is highly likely that they would be found within that time, and before they have sunk, and indeed could often be found within an hour or two.<\/p><p> These devices are not expensive and the Government could support their purchase.  They can cost as little as &#8364;120 before VAT.  Fishermen have argued that they could be exempt from VAT or that grant aid could be provided.  The devices can fit into a pocket, or be worn around the neck or wrist.  If fishermen had such devices on their person and if someone were to go overboard or the boat sank and the emergency crew got there within a couple of hours, they would be able to find the bodies.  It would obviously assist in locating and saving the lives of people who have gone overboard.  However, even when families experience the tragedy of the loss of a life, it can take days or weeks to locate the body - sometimes the body is never found.  If modern devices can be used to improve the systems, then tragedies such as the recent one off the coast of Union Hall and others could be avoided.<\/p><p> What steps can the Department take to assist in this regard?  We should use new advanced technology to improve the safety for fishermen.  We should have the same types of safety measures in place for fishermen as we provide for passengers in cars and aeroplanes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#PP01500","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address this issue today.  Currently all Irish-registered fishing vessels are required to be fitted with emergency indicating position beacons, EPIRBs.  All fishing vessels over 12 m in length must carry an automatically activating float-free EPIRB and vessels less than 12 m length overall only have to carry a manually operated EPIRB.  Officials from my Department are examining, in conjunction with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, issues relating to the carriage of personal locator beacons by fishermen as an enhancement to existing measures.<\/p><p>Arising from discussions last week, further work is being done by my officials in conjunction with BIM officials who work under the auspices of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, on initiatives to enhance the safety of Irish fishing vessels.  As a first priority, it is intended to incentivise the provision of automatic float-free GPS-enabled EPIRB beacons for all fishing vessels.  This will address a key safety recommendation made in a number of Marine Casualty Investigation Board reports into the loss of fishing vessels, where such a vessel beacon could have contributed significantly to rescue efforts.<\/p><p>A second priority will be to encourage the use of personal locator beacons for fishermen on all Irish-registered fishing vessels.  These personal locator beacons are designed and operated in accordance with recognised international standards and will be required to be registered with the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  It is intended that my Department will take measures with a view to making the provision of personal locator beacons and vessel beacons mandatory under appropriate legislation and my Department's code of practice for the safety of fishing vessels less than 15 m.  In implementing this initiative on personal locator beacons, provision will be made for maximum flexibility to allow for whether such beacons are separate from, or integrated into lifejackets.<\/p><p>I cannot emphasise enough the importance of wearing lifejackets at all times on the water.  Statutory requirements on the wearing of lifejackets and personal flotation devices on fishing vessels are set out in the Fishing Vessel (Personal Flotation Devices) Regulations 2001 as amended by the Fishing Vessel (Personal Flotation Devices)(Amendment) Regulations 2008.  Under the regulations, every fishing vessel is required to carry a suitable personal flotation device for every person on board.  The personal flotation device shall be worn at all times by the crew of the fishing vessel, when on the exposed deck of the vessel or, in the case of open undecked vessels, on board the vessel, whether at sea, in harbour or coming to and from moorings.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the regulations require that the skipper of a fishing vessel shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all crewmembers wear a personal flotation device in accordance with the regulations.  The Merchant Shipping Act 1992 provides that if there is a contravention of these regulations, the owner and, if the vessel is in use, the master of the vessel are each guilty of an offence and each is liable on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding \u20ac5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both.<\/p><p>The requirement for a personal flotation device to be available on-board for all crewmembers is checked as part of the safety surveys that all commercial fishing vessels are required to undertake.  The requirements for the wearing of personal flotation devices are also communicated to fishermen during these surveys.  In addition, guidance on the selection of personal flotation devices for use on board fishing vessels is conveyed through the issuing of marine notices from my Department.<\/p><p>A final important element of an integrated safety technology package for vessel beacons and for personal locator beacons will be a link to training.  My Department is working with BIM to develop appropriate training and refresher training to enable fishermen to gain maximum benefit from these technological enhancements to personal safety in the fishing industry.  It is expected to implement the new integrated package on a phased basis as part of the existing BIM fleet safety scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#QQ00200","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I welcome that, as per the Minister of State's reply, the Minister and Department intend to introduce legislation which will make personal locator and vessel beacons mandatory and further to introduce a code of practice for the safety of fishing vessels of less than 15 metres, which is a significant improvement in terms of where we were on this six months ago.  It is hoped the relevant legislation will be brought forward as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  These devices work in depths of up to 22 metres.  Some of the bodies found on, for example, the <i>Tit Bonhomme<\/i> were down about 12 m, which shows that these devices can save lives.  The Minister will have the support of Sinn F\u00e9in and, I am sure, of all other public and elected representatives in terms of the introduction of any legislation to make these devices mandatory.  This is about saving lives and ensuring people who earn a living, often in dangerous situations, are properly protected.

It is a central pillar of the Government's objective to have large numbers of those who are currently out of work gain meaningful employment as a means of rectifying our current economic crisis.  I commend the efforts made by the Government in this regard, including the increase in foreign direct investment to our shores, the introduction of an action plan for jobs, a schools building programme and significant capital spending on infrastructure, as outlined in the July stimulus plan.  However, as an Oireachtas Member for east Galway, I must focus on how Government and associated agencies can remove barriers to work for those in my constituency.  I want to ensure that all my constituents have accessibility to the workforce and that boundaries and barriers to work are eliminated by the Government.  For us to achieve anything of significance in this regard, we need to address the delay in processing of applications for Garda vetting.<\/p><p>I acknowledge and understand that the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na are providing a great service in terms of ensuring a process of quality control and that it is of the utmost importance that nothing comes between those who want to work and employment.  The fact that people are having to wait months for Garda clearance is acting as a barrier to entry into the workforce.  In my home town of Athenry, some 63 students who are studying child care, health care, nursing and social studies in Athenry vocational school, who expected to undertake work experience a number of weeks ago as part of their course, have been unable to do so in circumstances where they have yet to receive Garda clearance.  This means they are being significantly delayed in completing their courses and entering the marketplace for work.<\/p><p>Following on from my raising this issue in the Seanad yesterday, I was contacted by a self-employed man who told me he had to cease work for three weeks as he did not have the requisite Garda vetting for his business.  It is fair to say he probably endured some degree of financial hardship as a consequence.  This is a terrible indictment of our processes in Ireland and serves only to deter and discourage people from entering the workforce.  We must be mindful that students and self-employed people are the people we expect to assist us in rebuilding Ireland.  They are the ones who have not emigrated and want to work in or develop their businesses in Athenry, a town where currently 30 business units remain empty.  I am sure this situation is being replicated throughout the country.  Steps need to be taken to ensure that these delays are abated, if not eliminated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#RR00500","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":349,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Deputy Shatter.<\/p><p>The Minister is aware that apparent delays in the processing of vetting applications causes anxiety for those awaiting vetting certificates so that they can take up employment positions or voluntary roles.  Both the Garda central vetting unit in Thurles and the Minister are acutely aware of the need to minimise the turn-around time for vetting applications.  At a time when people are keen to get back into the workforce we must ensure that the vetting process does not interfere with this.<\/p><p>For the sake of clarity and to put the matter in context, I would like to outline the purpose of the vetting process.  The Garda central vetting unit provides employment vetting for approximately 20,000 organisations in Ireland which are registered with the Garda for this purpose.  These are organisations which employ persons working in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity with children and-or vulnerable adults.  The primary purpose of the process is the protection of children and vulnerable adults.  This is the paramount consideration.  The number of vetting applications received up to September 2012 is 212,558, with an expected outturn for the year of 350,000.  The number of applications dealt with during the past few years have increased, from 218,404 in 2008 to 315,100 in 2011.  Garda vetting disclosures are made to registered organisations following the signed authorisation by a vetting subject permitting the Garda central vetting unit to disclose to the registered organisation details of all prosecutions, successful or not, pending or completed and-or convictions which may be recorded in respect of him or her in the State or elsewhere.  Alternatively, the disclosure will state that there are no prosecutions or convictions recorded in respect of the person.<\/p><p>The function of the Garda central vetting unit is to make disclosure, in accordance with a written authorisation from the vetting subject, to the registered organisation.  Decisions on the suitability of the person concerned rests at all times with the recruiting organisation to which a vetting disclosure is made.  As I mentioned earlier, the vetting unit currently processes over 300,000 vetting applications per annum.  The staff of the vetting unit are to be commended for their work in reducing the processing time for vetting applications, from some 12 to 14 weeks at the time the Minister was appointed in March 2011 to between two and three weeks by May 2012.  This improvement was of enormous benefit to individuals and organisations throughout the State.  However, the number of staff in the unit decreased by 20 between March and May this year as temporary staff contracts came to an end.  This reduction in staff numbers has been partly offset by the redeployment of 15 clerical officers from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to a sub-office of the vetting unit in Ennis in May.  The new staff have, at this stage, completed their training period.  In the interim, however, processing times again increased and the current processing time vetting applications is eight weeks.  Seasonal fluctuations such as the start of the school year and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion. <\/p><p>The Garda central vetting unit, which will become the National Vetting Bureau and will have a substantially expanded role under new legislation, and the Minister are engaged in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure adequate staffing to meet these new demands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400009#RR00600","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speech","time":1351074600,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his succinct response on this matter.

Where such person also wishes to train a Gaelic or soccer team, he or she is required to make a further application for Garda vetting.

I agree completely with the sentiments expressed by Senator Barrett.  The HSE is a failed experiment.  The notion of having a single, nationally commanded and controlled managerialist bureaucracy micro-managing every aspect of our hospitals and other parts of health system has failed.  We need to hasten the model's extinction.  Many people, on hearing this argument, will think that the only alternative is to have a rigid, Darwinian, <i>laissez-faire<\/i>, winner-takes-all health system based on the survival of the fittest and not on social solidarity.  This is not the case, as the Minister knows.<\/p><p>  We all believe health care should be delivered according to the principle of social solidarity, with the better off subsidising the health care of the less well off.  It should also be based on the principle of access based on need and not on the ability to pay.  What often gets lost in the fog of debate is the fact that there are other ways to this nirvana.  Not all of them involve going through a Byzantine, unitary national bureaucracy.  If one considers the ranking of OECD countries' access to health care, one will note that those countries ranked in the top ten follow the alternative model, one which is based on insurance.  When people use the word insurance, they become terrified because they believe it is a question of only-for-profit insurance companies.  We believe the principle should involve a mixture with some for-profit insurance companies and some not-for-profit social insurance companies of the type that exists in many countries, such as Canada, Germany and Israel.  In truth, this is the type that exists in this country in the form of the VHI.<\/p><p>  In seeking to impose the deadline, we are aware that the Minister will be an axe-wielding huntsman looking for appropriate bureaucratic targets to decapitate on the way to achieving our ultimate insurance-based feast.

Sunset clauses are not unknown in legislation.  They serve a useful purpose in sharpening the focus of those involved.  Where it is the clear intention of the Government to wind down the HSE, nothing concentrates the mind better than a death sentence.  This is basically what pertains in this instance.  The HSE has not worked and has been a great disappointment.  I am sure there are staff within it who have worked very hard but there has been far too much managerial fat.  We will all be very happy to see a clear limit placed on the organisation's existence.<\/p><p>The period of three years offers plenty of time for the organisation to be wound down efficiently.  It is not a question of rushed business; it should be possible to accomplish the task within three years.  As Senators Crown and Barrett have said, the proposed clause is properly known as a sunset clause.  However, the sun is very likely to be sinking on the Government in three years, inevitably because of the deadline for parliamentary elections.  It is likely that the Government may survive three years but it cannot survive much longer, simply because of the constitutional arrangements made for the holding of elections.  This should also concentrate the mind because the sunset of the Government will occur at the same time as the sunset of the HSE.

The Bill, as drafted, gives him that discretion so I cannot support the amendment on this occasion, unfortunately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400011#K00800","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1351075500,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I thank the Senators for supporting the Bill and reform programme.

In other words, we are simply retaining the people who are already there.  I am not sure that in every instance we can repose great confidence in them.  We have had this problem with the banks.

Was some kind of pressure brought to bear by a group within the HSE in order that they should be placed in a situation where they could not be dislodged by new blood?  Surely to God what we need is new blood.

It is a temporary one.  It is a transition phase on the way to moving to an integrated care agency ultimately and thus the abolition of the HSE.<\/p><p>  In regard to the Senator's concern, which is very reasonable, there are two things to be said.  This is a directorate of the HSE and it has to be formed from members of the HSE but there is nothing to stop me appointing new national directors from outside the executive and bringing in new blood that way.  I can assure him that there is no question of us trying to maintain what is there.  It is the very antithesis of what I am about.  I want to change the <i>status quo<\/i> in favour of the patient.  I want a new directorate that will oversee the transition to the new universal health insurance that we all wish to see, where everyone in this country can be treated equally and will have fair and timely access to heath care regardless of their income or means.  They will be treated on the basis of need.  If people want to have <i>cordon bleu <\/i>cooking and five star hotel accommodation, they can pay a higher insurance premium for that but it will not get them their colonoscopy one minute before the next person who has the standard insurance.  <\/p><p>  I hear the Senator's concern but he slightly misunderstands what we are about.  This is a temporary arrangement that I do not see lasting much beyond 2015 or 2016.  I  certainly do not see it lasting longer than 2016. I envisage the new integrated agency will come into place in 2015 and this board will then no longer be in place.  It is a directorate to oversee the transition phase.  It is not limited in essence to people within the HSE because we can bring in people from outside the executive.  As Senator Gilroy said, this is providing for expediting the change as quickly as possible.  If we were to go through a formal advertising process, it would take anywhere between six months and a year and we do not have that time.  I want to see the changes brought in quickly.  We have seen huge change occur within the health service already in the past 18 months in the way services are being delivered by consultants on the ground, notwithstanding our difficulties with one of the consultant organisations in the Labour Court.

First, this is a question of openness, transparency and accountability, of that there is no doubt.   I remember when the Competition Authority legislation was going through this House under the direction of a previous Minister, who subsequently curiously became Minister for Health, the then Deputy Mary Harney, one element that was absent from it was a competition for the post of director.  There was no provision for the advertising of the position.  I understand from recollection that I managed, by amendment, to get that rectified.<\/p><p>It is very important that we pay respect to the whole area of mental health.  This area has been sadly neglected in the past.  We have a strategy to improve this situation.  We cannot treat the post of director for mental health in any kind of offhand way.  This is a post where we need the best and we get the best by publicly advertising the position and allowing somebody to achieve that position on the basis of the strict criteria mentioned by Senator MacSharry.  <\/p><p>I assume the Minister will plead the time argument again but I do not accept the argument that was made in response to the previous amendment because, as I clearly pointed out, the Minister will be out of time anyway and so it becomes completely academic.  By the end of three years the Minister will be out of time - the previous amendment was well argued.  I do not accept the validity of the argument that what was proposed would put shackles on the Minister - far from it.  It sought to simply ensure that the deed got done and the same principle applies to this amendment. <\/p><p>The post of director of mental health is a crucial one, particularly with the levels of depression, the incidence of suicide and the condition of facilities for people who are mentally unwell in this country.  It would be very regrettable if we did not take this appointment with the utmost seriousness and do everything we can to ensure that this post is filled by the most appropriate person.  Everybody would agree that the most appropriate way of filling it is by a proper publicly advertised search.  I strongly support this amendment.  I feel very strongly about this issue.  A previous Government made a mistake at the heart of the Competition Bill and this House rectified that.  I hope that again today this House will rectify what I think is an error.  I do not believe it is malign or done in bad faith but I genuinely believe it is a serious flaw in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#O00600","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I call Senator James Gilroy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#O00700","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":419,"content":"<p>I thought the Acting Chairman might have been referring to my cousin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#O00800","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":420,"content":"<p>My apologies, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#O00900","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":421,"content":"<p>Nobody inside or outside the House would disagree with the sentiments in the amendment requiring that the post of a director of mental health be established.

Obviously, my party disagrees with this and believes that under no circumstances should it apply to the first director general.  Indeed, to my knowledge, the first director general will be a person who was hand-picked for the particular role anyway, without going through a recruitment process.  I again make crystal clear this is not to impugn the qualifications or abilities of the person in question.  However, regardless of how good the Minister knows that person to be or how good on paper the credentials may appear, a recruitment process is laid down in the Statute Book that must be followed but it is not.  Consequently, he already has been in place as the Minister's interim figure and from henceforth, one will have this temporary little arrangement, which will last for up to three years or for God knows how long thereafter, depending presumably on who is in government.  This again weakens what the legislation is trying to achieve.  The Minister could usefully have considered this issue in more detail.  Is the issue that there were cost implications arising from a recruitment process?  Is this the reason there has been a reluctance to take the transparent route and put it out to tender?  Alternatively, is there a fear that someone better might be found than currently is in place?

The Government proposes to hand-pick an individual and I must note this debate is not about the individual person but about the principle itself.

In its programme for Government, the Administration proposed that all such appointments would be made through an open public process but that is not proposed in this case.  Tosach maith leath na hoibre and while a good start is half the job, the Minister has not made a good start in this regard.  He has gone completely against the programme for Government.

In the case of all the people appointed over the years, I am sure the Ministers concerned thought the country was lucky to have them.  However, that is not the point, which is that these appointments are supposed to be taken out of the political process.  Such appointments are supposed to be made in a transparent manner but that has not been done in this case.

While the first director general will be appointed by the Minister, subsequent directors general will be appointed by the Minister following a recruitment process under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  I note that subsection (4) is not unique.  There are precedents in legislation to provide that the first person who is appointed to an office may be appointed by a Minister, as envisaged under subsection (4).  These include legislative provisions for the charities regulatory authority, the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board, the qualifications and quality assurance authority of Ireland and the National Tourism Development Authority.  In my view, the use of this provision is the most practical way to advance the new directorate arrangements.<\/p><p>In response to Senator Byrne, who claims there has been no action, there has been a lot of action.  There has been an 85% reduction in the number of people who wait a year for an inpatient procedure.  There has been a 91% reduction in the number of people who wait nine months or longer.  There has been an 18% reduction in those who wait three months or longer for an inpatient procedure.  The number of people who are obliged to endure long trolley waits is more than 16,000 smaller than was the case last year.  A stroke programme has been put in place which is saving one life a week, as well as pre-empting the need for three others to end up in long-term care per week.  A transitional care programme is being rolled out, which affords people who are older and frail a much better service in so far as they will be admitted to a specialist ward where their medical problems will be dealt with and they can commence their rehabilitation immediately.  If this will take longer than three or four days, they can move to a transitional facility in which it can continue for up to ten weeks.  Moreover, if it becomes apparent early on that they will need long-term care, such care will be available in a transitional setting until they find a place of their choice.

Mr. Joe O'Toole, a former Senator of many years standing, always used to make the point that rushed legislation is bad legislation.  Interim scenarios and proposals like this are wrong.  Moreover, as I believe the Minister also knows this, there must be some other reason to prevent the adoption of due process in this regard.<\/p> <p>There must be another reason for not allowing these people through the recruitment process quickly.  It could be done to give the public confidence and cover all of the bases in terms of what the Minister is trying to achieve and what we on this side of the House are anxious to support.

The section indicates the director general is not required to give an answer to any Oireachtas committee on any matter relating to the administration of the executive that is or is likely to be the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal of the State.  We believe the term &quot;likely to be&quot; is weak and this amendment asks that there should be some risk assessment of the likelihood.  We cannot have somebody refusing to answer questions with an excuse that it could be the subject of some proceedings.  We should know where the advice comes from and the risk assessment process used.  It is a technique widely used in Government bodies.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 8 deals with what happens elsewhere in the Oireachtas where a Member feels there was a misleading response or a refusal to answer.  The Ceann Comhairle would intervene and I gather the current holder of the post sometimes does this to the assistance of Deputies, contacting Departments and indicating that a question should be answered in a more complete way.<\/p><p>  These amendments were put down before the recent incident where a person walked out of a committee.  They would protect Parliament against a defence from a person pleading an inability to answer a question because it might be the subject of proceedings elsewhere.  In such a case the person should indicate the advice and risk assessment.  It should be possible for a member of a committee to ask the Ceann Comhairle, rather than a court, to help in such matters.  The Ceann Comhairle seems to have effectively taken on this role with regard to answers given during Question Time in the D\u00e1il.  Public servants should answer questions that are asked by an Oireachtas committee or by Members.<\/p> <p>We seek to protect Parliament against almost a shrug of the shoulder and individuals saying there might be a case and, therefore, they will not answer questions.  That is significant in a Parliament and we seek to include those two protections so that Parliament finds out what is going on, including, as we on this side of the House have said, support for what the Minister is trying to reform.  Involving Parliament and parliamentarians is better than individuals saying they will not answer questions because they might be the subject of proceedings.  These are two ways to allow that to happen.  If the risk assessment shows there is a very strong chance something will appear in court or, if the Ceann Comhairle has formed the same view, the individual refusing to answer the questions has that degree of protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#R01100","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I second Senator Barrett's amendment.

I have looked at the provisions as a whole and I point out that under subsection (3), the director general must give reasons in writing where he or she believes a matter is likely to be the subject of proceedings before a court or a tribunal.  This seems to give an Oireachtas committee a clear picture as to why the director general has taken a view that a matter is likely to be the subject of proceedings.  If the issues arise when the director general is actually before the committee, I would expect the director general to give the reasons to the committee at that point.

The IAASA is the regulatory body for auditing and accounting and the Minister should seek its opinion to establish whether people are qualified to carry out auditing and accounting of books with tens of billions of euro on them in recognition of the fact that this has been a problem in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#T01800","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":497,"content":"<p>I second the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#T01900","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I appreciate the sentiment behind the amendment.

I am keen for that reason not to overly restrict the membership.  The net effect of the amendment would be that another body would decide which people had the skills to act as members of the HSE audit committee.

It means the loss of thinking.  This is worth thinking about for a moment.  It is our capacity to think that sets us apart.  Our capacity to reason is at the core of who we are as human beings.  <i>Cogito, ergo sum<\/i>, as Descartes once said.  We have been saying it ever since because of its simple and direct truth.<\/p><p>  Each of the 42,000 people living in Ireland with dementia has a tale to tell about how his or her thinking is lost or on the way to being lost.  These people have a story to tell about how they are losing themselves.  The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS, defines dementia as:<ul>[A] word for a group of symptoms caused by disorders that affect the brain.  It is not a specific disease.  People with dementia may not be able to think well enough to do normal activities, such as getting dressed or eating.  They may lose their ability to solve problems or control their emotions.  Their personalities may change.  They may become agitated or see things that are not there.<br>Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, a group of disorders that impairs mental functioning.  At the moment, Alzheimer's is progressive and irreversible.  Abnormal changes in the brain worsen over time, eventually interfering with many aspects of brain function.  Memory loss is one of the earliest symptoms, along with a gradual decline of other intellectual and thinking abilities, called cognitive functions, and changes in personality or behaviour.<\/ul>If we consider that we have 42,000 people already struggling with dementia and best estimates suggest that the number will have risen to approximately 140,000 within a mere 30 years, it is clear that a national dementia strategy is an urgent requirement.<\/p><p>  Much money is being spent worldwide on research to cure or contain Alzheimer's disease, ranging from brain imaging techniques to identify brain changes, medications to treat the biological changes in the brain, and research to try to manage the behavioural symptoms that cause so much difficulty.  Researchers in the US have identified a particular protein that becomes toxic in the brain of someone with Alzheimer's disease and believe they may be able to develop a treatment that would go some way towards alleviating the symptoms and-or halting the progression of the condition.  We cannot wait that long for research or rely on it to save us or to stop the numbers increasing.  We must not wait.  Recently, the World Health Organization, WHO, published a document calling on countries to treat Alzheimer's disease as a public health priority.<\/p><p>  Many of us have heard stories of those with Alzheimer's disease.  Some of us have experienced it at first hand in families.  Today, 50,000 carers, especially family carers, know that they cannot wait for research to help them with the care of their loved ones.  I pay tribute to their enormous efforts, work and dedication.<\/p><p>  I note and welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to a national dementia strategy in the programme for Government.  Many matters are vying for the attention of the Cabinet, but these statistics are well known.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State and his colleagues know the urgency of the matter.<\/p><p>I urge that the development of that strategy place dementia not just in a medical context, but in a societal context, where those who have dementia live, because of the impact it has on family and friends.  There is a need for a response from society to those with the condition.  Even if researchers could in the morning conjure up great new drugs, they will never replace the need for a strategy.  A lack of strategy will always imply a more haphazard and less efficient approach, even with the best will in the world, and there is plenty of really good will out there, banging the drum for better care and treatment.<\/p><p>The strategy will only work if the medical aspect is combined with joined-up thinking that comes from placing this very firmly in a societal context.  The national dementia strategy will require a whole-of-government approach.  It may fall in the lap of the Minister of State to drive it but reaching out to other key Departments, including those dealing with housing, transport and health, among others, and to voluntary organisations who do so much, will be the way to make it succeed.<\/p><p>What might a strategy look like?  Specifically, a strategy needs to offer common standards of care for dementia.  Those standards need to be derived from clinicians, experts, academics, voluntary groups and those with experience of dementia and the care of dementia.  Ensuring that those with dementia are part of the solution is key to making any strategy work.  It will also ensure that their dignity is at the core of the strategy.  Person-centred care - long espoused by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland - should remain central to the strategy, and the strategy must also ensure rights to treatment.  Carers and those with dementia must be treated with dignity and the standards need to reflect that.<\/p><p>The strategy needs to urge a move away from high cost, long-term care to community-based services in which those with dementia and their families have a role to play, as many do now, although not in an organised, recognised and strategic way.  Early diagnosis will be key to making this model succeed and it should be central to shift treatment away from an over-reliance on drugs.  Continued research into dementia should form part of any strategy, as should the good management of all data relating to the care of those with dementia.  The strategy should urge the appointment of a clinical director within the HSE with specific responsibility for dementia, and there should be specific training of staff, who work with those with dementia, and who should improve their knowledge and skills.  It should also recognise in particular the needs of those with early-onset dementia and address their needs.<\/p><p>A budget ring-fenced for the care of dementia would be ideal.  As it stands, the budget is not ring-fenced and the true cost implications of treating dementia in Ireland are not currently known.  Estimates suggest that \u20ac1.4 billion is spent directly and indirectly on the care of Alzheimer's disease.  The strategy is not a call for a budget but it should rather motivate a whole-of-government rethink which must include gathering the data that gives not just the cost of care, but the way in which care is delivered and the impact of that care.  We must seek ways to spend resources more carefully and efficiently.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the work being done for the national positive ageing strategy, and I am confident that the obvious overlap between these two strategies will benefit both.  The forthcoming capacity legislation will form another vital pillar of support for people with dementia and many others too, including those with intellectual disabilities and acquired brain injury.  Ireland has already signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities but to ratify we must move to this legislation very quickly.<\/p><p>The basis for the legislation must be the &quot;will and preferences&quot; of those directly affected and people with dementia or any other condition or injury must have the right not to have their decision-making skills interfered with or reduced as they currently are on a daily basis.  Remarkably, the 1871 Lunacy Act is still with us.  It is time to jettison it and the production of a national dementia strategy would be a good time to send the signal to herald in the capacity Act, which would encourage and promote people making their own decisions or, where necessary, supported decisions.<\/p><p>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland in particular has done sterling work over many years and its national conference is taking place tomorrow.  I welcome the opportunity to speak to this very important motion, which fundamentally is to underline the urgency of this strategy for the thousands who are affected and the many thousands who will be affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#V00300","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I second the motion.

It has started to work, by way of a review, on dementia in our society.  Senator O'Keeffe has provided a very detailed outline of the position in this country.  I will take a different perspective, which is from personal experience.  Anybody who has seen the effect of Alzheimer's disease in a family member or a close friend will know it is probably one of the worst conditions anybody could have the misfortune to encounter.<\/p><p>Currently in this country there is, unfortunately, almost an unwillingness to accept that the initial problems with Alzheimer's disease exist.  We can end up with cases where the problem has gone too far, and the only solution in such cases is acceptance by family and the affected person, if the person is capable of it.  That leads to nursing homes or long-stay hospital cases.<\/p><p>We must ensure that we put a strategy in place, and we will begin work on that very soon.  The strategy must deal with a number of specific elements, including prevention, delaying the illness, early diagnosis and awareness within communities that people may have symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.  People must be aware of this, and much good work has been done by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and various other groups around the country.  We are getting to grips with the issue but we must put such work into the strategy, along with a care management element.  We must bring services out into the community and examine residential care as part of the strategy.  The strategy for dealing with Alzheimer's disease must be completely transformative.<\/p><p>This Government has the willingness to act.  We hear about budgets every day of the week which relate to every government item but a budget must be ring-fenced for this issue.

I wish him well in his post.  I am from County Roscommon, which has the highest rate of dementia <i>per capit<\/i>a in the country.  At a recent conference on dementia, it was estimated that 4,000 people in the country will be diagnosed every year with the condition.<\/p><p>  I have worked with an organisation called Western Alzheimers for a number of years and its biggest difficulty - a lack of funding - arises from the fact that it already deals with 381 families in Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  Home care packages are key to this.  I bat for those three counties because that is the area where the association operates.<\/p> <p>It is crucial there are no funding cuts to home care packages in those areas, in particular in my area, for which I have just given the figures, because we have the highest rate<i>per capita<\/i>.<\/p><p> I am a big supporter of Western Alzheimers and have raised funds for it.  Part of its service delivery is to raise funds to deliver a service, but we are going through hard times and people do not have the money any more to contribute as much as they would like to.  I have always complimented people who have always given to good causes, even in hard times.  It is crucial that Government funding is put in place and that there are not cuts to home care packages.<\/p><p> I refer to the community employment schemes.  They have no difficulty getting approval for CE employees but they have difficulty finding people to do the work.  Many lone parents, who were allowed to keep their lone parents allowance and get a community employment allowance, were taking up those jobs and were very complimentary of them.  That facility has been taken away and they must depend entirely on CE money.  Community employment schemes are therefore finding it very difficult to get CE workers.<\/p><p> On the economics of not funding home care packages and respite services and putting people into high dependency beds in selected nursing homes, not every nursing home can deal with dementia patients.  Given the small cost we are talking about, it makes economic sense to keep these people at home with the services the likes of Western Alzheimers provide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#W00500","speaker":"1161","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him.  It was very moving listening to Senators O'Keeffe, Landy and Kelly speaking about this frightful disease.  I fought to maintain the public nursing home in Crooksling, which is close to Tallaght.  We got a reprieve from the Minister, Deputy Reilly, but it was my first experience of seeing 80 patients, who suffer from Alzheimer's, in one long room.  It was a horrific experience and it brought me back to reality.  This issue should be addressed.  If one has not dealt with people who have Alzheimer's, it is very difficult to empathise with the situation.<\/p><p>Some of my colleagues know that, in 2006, I produced a policy document, A New Approach to Ageing and Ageism, and it gives me pleasure to support this Labour Party motion.  I was honoured to be asked by Deputy Martin to produce the Fianna F\u00e1il policy document on older people, active ageing and quality care.  It is a Fianna F\u00e1il policy paper to promote the human potential of, and human rights for, older Irish citizens.<\/p><p>Over six months, during the course of my extensive research for the preparation of this document, I learned a great deal about the afflictions and issues which face elderly citizens every day.  Dementia is an extremely distressing condition for those who suffer from it, and it causes much anguish and pain to their families and close friends.  The situation presents a problem of great magnitude and a formidable challenge to health and social services.<\/p><p>The shocking fact is that, currently, roughly 41,700 people in Ireland suffer from dementia, more than 26,000 of whom live at home.  What is even more shocking is that, every year, approximately 4,000 new cases arise.  This is a clear indicator that we must, as a matter of urgency, put provisions in place within our health system to tackle this terrifying epidemic.  There are no signs of this growing problem abating.  It is estimated that a major increase in the number of people with dementia is likely to occur after 2021, with the numbers growing to between 141,000 and 147,000 by 2041.<\/p><p>When one considers that dementia costs more than cancer, heart disease and stroke combined, at a current cost of \u20ac1.6 billion per annum, it is clear that this is a severe issue which could cripple an already damaged health system.  An emphasis must be placed, therefore, on the development of co-ordinated, multi-layered and well-resourced services which will be responsible to the individual needs of people with dementia and those who care for them.<\/p><p>Fianna F\u00e1il outlined the complexity and range of issues involved in the effective management of dementia in the 1999 action plan for dementia.  Following the publication of this report, community supports were enhanced and increased levels of funding were made available to develop a wide range of community services, including community nursing, paramedic and home help services, and support to family carers.  During our time in office, enormous strides were made in the concept and practice of services for older people as we took the view that there was an intimate link between the care of older people and that of people with dementia.<\/p><p>The need to provide support and dignity and independence through the provision of the appropriate people and carers was heavily stressed during our time in office.  The Government must make the dramatic changes which are clearly needed to aid the 41,700 people suffering from dementia, to halt the inevitable growth of this affliction and to help the countless family members and close friends who incur most of the responsibility of care, which is nothing short of a disgrace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#X00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":522,"content":"<p>It is great to see all-party support for this vital motion.

I understand the public consultation process has been completed successfully and the Minister and his people are analysing the submissions with a view to setting up a working group.  I hope we will have a national strategy in 2013, which is the commitment.  The only way we can deal with this is by having a professional national strategy which is well thought out, well researched and, most important, funded.  There are a number of areas for which we need to ring-fence funding and this is one of them because, with our ageing population, we are looking at an increase of 4,000 to 5,000 per year in the number of people suffering from dementia.  We need to take cognisance of that and direct action towards it.  This Government is 20 months into its time in office and I have no doubt that, by 2017, the end of its time in office, we will be well on the way to at least having the support structures and basic requirements in place for people who find themselves suffering from this condition.<\/p><p>I am keenly aware of the fact that preparation of the mental capacity legislation is at an advanced stage.  It will revolutionise the way people with mental health conditions are treated.<\/p> <p>The legislation dealing with capacity goes back to the 1860s when Gladstone was the Prime Minister of England and Ireland and Queen Victoria was in power.  That signifies how dated it is.  There is a great deal happening under the radar in this area within Government, which does not receive the media attention it deserves.  In 2013, Ireland will hold the EU Presidency for six months and a national dementia strategy together with mental capacity legislation will be published.  All this will feed into the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.  Would it not be great for our country if we could ratify the convention during our EU Presidency in the first six months of next year?  That is an achievable goal and there is no reason we cannot achieve it.  It would enshrine our presidency in European history for the right reason, which is for looking after the most vulnerable in our society.<\/p><p>I attended a meeting with the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sean Sherlock, prior to the debate about a UN declaration for people with print disabilities.  Currently, they only have access to 5% of the books the rest of society can access.  If Members walked into Easons and 95% of the shelves were empty, they would walk out because of the lack of choice.  That is what faces almost 300 million citizens throughout the world.  Significant work is ongoing to come up with a treaty to deal with the issue of copyright and intellectual property which is choking access to literature for people with print disabilities.  I spoke to the Minister of State earlier and a serious meeting will take place on 19 November.  Hopefully, the Irish delegation will have an input to ensure a treaty, which will deal with the intellectual property minefield, is advanced during our Presidency.  There is a great deal happening.  The Government is committed to the most vulnerable in our society and we are trying to do this professionally and inclusively in the most appalling economic circumstances to ensure that we embrace a wide church and that the most vulnerable are not alone looked after, but can advocate regarding their needs in a respectful fashion.  We are trying to ensure all the interest groups, some of whom are represented in the Visitors Gallery are brought along.  Amnesty International held a good event yesterday at which the chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality spoke.<\/p><p>I commend my Labour Party colleagues on the motion.  While we should not even have to have these discussions, it is important to put them on the record of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I acknowledge the input from Fianna F\u00e1il and Senator Mary White.  While this is not a party political issue, it is a political issue and we need to make significant advances in the next 12 to 18 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#X00300","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":524,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I thank my Labour Party colleagues for tabling the motion.  It is great that there is harmony in the House as everyone welcomes the initiatives and strategies to deal with mental capacity legislation, dementia, Alzheimer's and positive ageing.  I would like to move beyond words and explore ways we can make the issues before us tangible.  We can all say these words but we all know action speaks louder than words.<\/p><p>I would like two issues to be fed into the national dementia strategy before it is published.  First, expert opinion is that earlier and accurate diagnosis is important, as colleagues have said, for the individual but also for family members because of what such a diagnosis will deliver for them and it is imperative that coming out of the implementation of the strategy, resources will be put in place or reconfigured that will result in a nationwide health service, which provides timely diagnosis and provision for early intervention supports and services.  A crucial component of this will be access to a uniform assessment of needs for both the patient and their carer.  My understanding is that the HSE is piloting a single assessment tool, which will need to be such that it provides the necessary early indication of the onset of a dementia and acts as an early detection mechanism which leads on to the necessary follow up of interventions and support services.<\/p><p>Currently, the first port of call for most patients who present themselves to our health service with possible symptoms of a dementia is at GP level.  Making a diagnosis of dementia is not easy and Irish research, including anecdotal evidence from my local GP, has shown that many GPs, like their counterparts in other countries, are reluctant to get involved in the area because of lack of confidence and training, stigma, difficulties differentiating normal ageing from the signs and symptoms of dementia and resource issues.  There is a requirement, therefore, to ensure all health care officials at GP, primary care or residential care levels are skilled in the detection and diagnosis of dementia and are suitably equipped with the necessary people skills to handle the delivery of the diagnosis to patients and their families.<\/p><p>The second issue relates to community-based services.  Following on from the early diagnosis of dementia and consistent with the Department of Health\u2019s stated policy to shift the emphasis of care back into community settings, there is a need to ensure these settings are age and dementia friendly.  Access to clinical dementia experts at local community levels will form the basis of key community services for those with dementia and their carers.  People who need and receive community care, whether through home help, respite, home care packages, hospice and palliative care services, value these supports enormously.  However, access is discretionary, unequal and problematic.  The root of this issue is the lack of legislation to underpin access to these services.  There is no statutory entitlement to home care and community care services.  Since access is discretionary, it is extremely difficult for individuals, families and carers to get information and reliable access at critical points for example at discharge from hospital, onset of disability, diagnosis of dementia, long-term or life-limiting illness.  I agree with the Ombudsman who observes that &quot;people do not know where they stand in terms of their entitlements and in terms of the HSE\u2019s obligations to provide services&quot;.  I also support the call made by Older and Bolder for the inclusion, as part of a national dementia strategy, of the development of long-promised legislation to establish a clear right to community care.  Only this can provide the clarity and security to individuals and families.<\/p><p>I stress that I welcome this motion and I recognise the Government\u2019s achievements in this area such as the publication of the national carers strategy in 2012, which was broadly welcomed by carers groups as an aspirational document that provides a solid basis for informing future policy decisions.  However, I also note the reaction from some groups I work with in the areas in question that a motion such as this is nothing more than a series of platitudes unless accompanied by action such as the tangible recognition of the vital work carried out by family carers.  While 50,000 carers are responsible for Alzheimer's and dementia patients, 137,000 other carers look after other people with disabilities spanning all age groups from children to the elderly.  Recognition of their work can be shown by the provision of adequate and ring-fenced resources, including payments to carers, which should not be seen as income supports but as direct supports for their caring duties.<\/p><p>We are all conscious that we are approaching budget 2013.  The Minister for Social Protection recently gave us assurances that core benefits will be protected but we are still wondering what are core benefits?  For example, is the half rate carers allowance a core benefit?   I refer to the funding sources for carers, which include the Department of Social Protection, which covers benefits and allowance; the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which administers the housing adaptation grant; and the Department of Health, which deals with hospital and respite care.  When I consider this, I wonder whether the citizen or the Government is at the centre of policy, as he or she must constantly run around.  He or she has to be assessed several times before a decision on his or her care and he or she must repeatedly go through his or her family history.<\/p> <p>I wonder if we can reconfigure resources to put the patient and the carer at the centre, so that we do not waste resources.<\/p><p>Capacity legislation is mentioned and I support the idea of doing more.  I advise the Minister to read the document prepared by 15 stakeholder organisations on essential principles of Irish legal capacity.  Advanced care directives are legal in Ireland but do not enjoy statutory footing.  It is important that people in an already disempowered position, facing dementia or the onset of Alzheimer's among many capacity diminishing conditions, are not further disempowered by uncertainty about whether their health care wishes will be respected.  The Minister for Health provided an answer on 8 June to the effect that advanced care directives are not on a statutory footing.  Can we get clarification from the Department of Health and the Department of Justice and Equality to work in a co-ordinated fashion to ensure a section on direct care directives will be inserted into the forthcoming capacity legislation?<\/p><p>I commend the community-based project of the Irish Hospice Foundation, Think Ahead, currently being piloted in Louth and Limerick.  It encourages people to think about, discuss and record their preferences for future care.  Advanced care directives are an issue we must talk about in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#Y00200","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I commend the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il Senators, the Independent Senators nominated by the Taoiseach, on the all-party agreement on the motion.  Although I will support the motion, I have a small quibble with one sentence in it, as I wonder whether it despairs too much: \"[T]hat strategy recognises the societal rather than the medical context of dementia and Alzheimer's\".  Would there not be a high return on research when we consider the cost of \u20ac1.6 billion and the 42,000 people affected by it?  There is a large research budget and it seems to be a priority to see what we can come up with and whether we can form links with exercise, drugs, diet, the environment, lifestyle, counselling and positive mental health.  We all get older and it is not an illness.  It will happen to us and, not to medicalise it unnecessarily, we have a very large drugs industry with which the Department negotiates.  There is some relationship there and we give them a good price.  Do they have international research that might help the Department?  Can we head it off by the appropriate medical treatment and research?<\/p><p>Ireland has a particular problem, as Senator Kelly said.  Social studies research reflects the heavy rate of institutionalisation in the past.  There were huge mental hospitals in Ballinasloe and Mullingar.  Are we too deeply in that tradition or are there more positive ways of dealing with it?  What would follow if the Minister and his Mediterranean colleagues got together?  Countries in the Mediterranean seem to treat old age differently and there may be some hope in that.<\/p><p>Senator Mary White is proposing legislation to abolish compulsory retirement.  Can we use research, intelligence, contacts with the drugs industry and the Minister's contacts with Mediterranean countries and eastern Europe so that we do not have to deal with dreadful consequences for patients and relatives?  In places like Georgia, people live very long lives and do not experience these problems.  Rather than accepting that there will be these sick people and having to provide them with accommodation care, should we refuse to accept it as inevitable?<\/p><p>I asked people in alternative medicine whether the decline of old people could be arrested and they responded that it would be very difficult.  Perhaps there is some hope and scope in the large research budget of the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sherlock.  There may be a return to shifting some of it and getting into the best international research where this is a problem.  This will help the Minister to cater for disasters that happen to people and their families but to try to head some of them off before they happen and take preventative measures to promote positive mental health.  We would support the Minister under such circumstances, as I support this motion.  The motion contains a tinge of accepting this as inevitable and perhaps we can find scope to assist the Minister so that it is not inevitable and we can combat the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#Z00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":527,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire go dt\u00ed an Teach.  I welcome this Private Members' motion and congratulate those responsible for it.  It will have cross-party support.  A report was published in January of this year, public consultation was completed in August and submissions are currently under review with a view to establishing a working group to develop the strategy by 2013.  I hope the working group will have its work completed sooner rather than later.  I congratulate Senator White on her work for the aged.<\/p><p>There are over 41,000 people living in Ireland with dementia and the projected increase in the number of people with the condition is such that it will reach 140,000 to 150,000 before 2041.  The first stage was to assemble the research and evidence on which the policy was developed and this was completed this year.  A research review for Ireland's national dementia strategy was presented to the Minister for Health and published in January.  A summary of its key findings are set out.  The next stage set out the publication and consultation process and the closing date for submissions was 31 August.  Officials are examining the responses.  I am trying to get the action group working as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The HSE provides a range of services for people with dementia, including primary care services, home support services, daycare, respite, housing with care and continuing care services.  Carer support groups have been established across the country.  There are approximately 42,000 people with dementia in Ireland, which is a substantial population.  Some 26,000 of them live at home.  I had the experience with my late father, God be good to him, who died when he was 93 years old.  We cared for him in his home for as long as we could.  At one stage, he had to go into the local nursing home for three weeks and every single day he wanted to be at home and to die at home.<\/p><p>A major increase in the number of Irish people with dementia is expected, due to our ageing population.  Numbers are expected to increase to 147,000.  Our strategy must be far-seeing over the coming 30 or 40 years, a crucial period.  The cost of dementia is approximately \u20ac1.69 billion per year, as stated by Senator Mary White.  There is no doubt that cost will increase and we should allow for the anticipated costs and the anticipated population increase for those with dementia.<\/p> <p>Recently I read, I hope I am correct, that it costs approximately \u20ac40,000 per annum.  I am not complaining about the cost.  These people have made significant contributions to the country for 60 or 70 years and we must look after them.  Somebody mentioned early diagnosis.  In the case of my father I honestly did not see it happening.  He was a man who was active, walked, read and kept up to date with everyday occurrences and suddenly it happened.  One will probably say it will happen to every aged person but that is not the way it should be.  <\/p><p>The recent review suggests that community services in Ireland are underdeveloped, inequitable and fragmented with only a small proportion of people with dementia availing of critical services, day care, public health, nursing home, care packages, respite, etc.  As already stated, a greater number of those people want to live at home.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#Z00300","speaker":"1138","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":529,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I commend Labour Party Senators for tabling a motion which has strong sentiments which I fully support.  It is encouraging when Government representatives have an opportunity to table motions in Private Members' time, that they have substance and deal with important issues.  I am impressed by the wording of the motion which I do not think anybody in opposition could have framed any differently.  I am pleased to pledge my party's wholehearted support to the motion.  Government and Opposition parties have called for a positive ageing strategy and a national dementia strategy for many years.  In the past a number of joint motions were supported by Sinn F\u00e9in and the Labour Party which called for the implementation of these strategies.<\/p><p>In the other House last week, Sinn F\u00e9in used its Private Members' time to table a motion on home help and home care services.  One of the elements of the motion was the call for the national dementia strategy to be ratified before the end of 2013 and likewise a national positive ageing strategy.  That is something we called for during a constructive engagement with representatives of older people and older people themselves through the Seanad Public Consultation Committee on the rights of older persons which took place in this Chamber.  A report was published which the Minister should take on board when examining this area as it dealt with a whole range of issues which affect older people.  In the motion we supported proposals relating to quality standards for home care packages, health statistics audits for community care, a greater degree of flexibility in respect of carer's allowance and clarity on entitlements for older people.  <\/p><p>The Seanad Public Consultation Committee report also sought that the whole area of wardship be revised.  I emphasise this concept is out of date and is no longer fit for purpose as it fails to respect the humanity of those who find themselves subject to wardship.  The scheme which was set up under the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 effectively means that decisions are made for people without their consultation.  I was contacted by Diarmuid Hanifin of Amnesty International, who is in the Visitors' Gallery, as I am sure all Senators were as part of our preparation for the debate on the issue.  It is appropriate to raise the issue in the context of the motion.  I concur with Amnesty International in its analysis that only when all attempts at supports are exhausted should decisions be taken on somebody's behalf.  <\/p><p>In 2007 Ireland signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  To ratify the convention, our capacity legislation needs to be brought into compliance with international human rights law.  Article 12 of the UN convention requires that persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with everybody else and if people need support to make decisions they should get it.  In order to comply with international human rights law, any new capacity law which the Minister for Health or, perhaps, the Minister for Justice and Equality may bring forward must reflect this ethos and also set out a statutory framework for supports.  The ramifications of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities are clear.  Ireland needs to move away from guardianship and assessment of mental capacity to assessment of how people can be supported to make decisions.  That must be the basis of any principle which should underpin any reform of the capacity legislation.   Amnesty International has also advanced a number of points that should be taken into consideration when bringing forward any such capacity legislation.  It is clear that the capacity legislation and the Mental Health Act 2001 should complement each other.  The 2001 Act was supposed to provide for a rights-based approach.  However, this has been suppressed, to some extent, by its interpretation and emphasis on paternalism. <\/p><p>There are a number of other points I wish to make but it is not possible to do that in six minutes.   Sometimes motions which are well intentioned - this is a good motion - can wring hollow when set against other decisions made, such as reducing 1 million home help hours which people need.  I am sure there is no public representative who has not been contacted by individuals who have been affected by the cuts in home help.  We could argue rightly that cuts in this area are socially wrong because of their impact.  This is an era when we need to make savings and to interpret the outcomes of decisions made.  It is clear from my analysis, at least, and an analysis of all the groups who represent older people and people with disabilities that cuts to these areas while they might reduce spend in one area, increase spend in other areas.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout made the point that community care and caring for people in the home is meant to be the cornerstone of Government policy.  If supports in the home are taken away there is a danger that will lead to people going into nursing homes and private nursing homes resulting in subvention and all the ancillary costs.  While that is a possibility, it must be borne in mind when we make adjustments, cuts and savings.  If we are saving on one part of spending, are we increasing spending in another area as a consequence of the action being taken?  I reiterate my full support for the motion.  It is one of the best motions I have seen from the Government in terms of substance and I am pleased to give it my enthusiastic support.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#AA00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":530,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#AA00300","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":531,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for the opportunity to address the motion on mental capacity legislation and dementia.  It is encouraging and gratifying to note the level of agreement across the House in respect of the issues dealt with in the motion.  It was tabled initially by my colleagues in the Labour Party, supported by Fine Gael colleagues in government, the Taoiseach's nominees, Fianna F\u00e1il, Sinn F\u00e9in and Independent Senators, all of whom have stated their strong support not just for the sentiments but the commitments and necessary actions that are required to be taken in the context of this challenging area.  The level of cross-party support is encouraging as is the level of engagement with the debate, and the insights various Members have brought to it, in some instances from a personal experience, are always important.  For example, Senator Barrett, who was never without an insight in respect of any of these matters, pointed to the importance of research and evidence that our policy making should be based on evidence.<\/p> <p>It is extremely important that such research should be done in so far as it is possible.  I believe Senator Barrett also made the point about prevention and the broader holistic view of the health-care system.  We should not simply regard our strategy as one of reaction to an emerging problem an individual has, but it should be, as it were, a whole-of-life strategy.  Certainly an element of our health-care strategy should not be based simply on reacting to people who become ill, but to have ways and strategies for anticipating that and the system responding to it in so far as it is possible for us.<\/p><p> On coming into office the Government made a firm commitment in the programme for national recovery to introduce a mental capacity Bill that is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The mental capacity Bill will reform the law in respect of adults who are vulnerable in the sense that they may lack some or all capacity to make important decisions for themselves.  It will modernise the law on capacity, some of which dates back 200 years, and will bring Irish capacity legislation into line with current thinking and modern legislative frameworks worldwide.  The purpose of the Bill is to put in place a comprehensive legal framework to support adults who do not have full decision-making capability.  This covers a wide spectrum, ranging from people with dementia to persons with intellectual disabilities or acquired brain injuries.<\/p><p> In summary, the Bill will: reform legislation protecting adults who, owing to intellectual disability, illness or accident, are unable to make decisions for themselves or exercise their legal capacity; provide a new understanding of mental capacity based upon a time-specific and issue-specific, functional approach; replace the wards of court system which is the existing mechanism for managing the affairs of persons who lack decision making capacity; progress the process towards ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was signed by Ireland on 30 March 2007; and give effect to the Hague Convention on the International Protection of Adults.  The statutory guiding principles underpinning every support or intervention made in regard to persons lacking capacity will reflect the UN convention principles of respecting the dignity and the autonomy of each individual person, including the freedom to make his or her own choices.<\/p><p> In the drafting of the Bill careful attention has been given to putting in place safeguards to protect vulnerable adults from exploitation.  In particular, the Bill will contain detailed provisions for the supervision of personal guardians of adults lacking capacity and also of donees of enduring powers of attorney.  The Government legislation programme indicates that the Bill is expected to be published in this session.<\/p><p> Our health services are caring for an ageing population with varying needs and conditions including dementia, which is a progressive condition that not only has a huge impact on the physical, psychological and emotional state of the person with dementia, but also on their families and carers.  We all want to see people given more opportunities to live full and meaningful lives on their own terms.  It is vital that people with dementia are not defined by the disease.  We must remember that with the correct supports in place, people can live full and active lives even after a diagnosis.<\/p><p> There is no doubt that society is enriched by the positive participation of all its members and our objective is to have a society where those at risk of social exclusion are fully integrated into their local communities, and are supported to participate to their full potential within those communities.  Government policy aims to support people with dementia to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  I am confident that there is common agreement across the House with this philosophy.<\/p><p> The programme for Government makes a clear commitment to develop a national strategy for dementia by 2013.  It is worth quoting this commitment, because I take the point made by Senator Cullinane and others that while a motion is very important and can focus our thinking, commitment and engagement, what is really important at the end of the day is what flows from the commitments given and the action taken.  The programme for Government states:<ul><ul>We will develop a national Alzheimer's and other dementias strategy by 2013 to increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention, and development of enhanced community based services.  This strategy will be implemented over five years.<\/ul><\/ul> I believe we can all agree that relevant and accurate research is a key ingredient in ensuring that policy development is proactive as opposed to reactive and avoids crisis-driven service delivery into the future.  The first stage of the process was to assemble the research evidence upon which the policy will be developed.  This body of work was completed in January when the report entitled Creating Excellence in Dementia Care: A Research Review for Ireland's National Dementia Strategy was presented to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.<\/p><p> At present, it is estimated that more than 41,000 people living in Ireland have dementia.  The pressing need for a strategy on dementia is best understood in the context of projected increases in the number of people with this disease reaching between 141,000 and 147,000 by 2041.  We obviously need to plan for this significant increase and the resulting demands on our health services in the future.<\/p><p> The review has estimated the overall cost associated with dementia in Ireland to be almost &#8364;1.7 billion per annum, with 48% of this figure representing informal care provided by family and friends and a further 43% representing residential long-stay care costs for those living with dementia in the community.  This research highlights the primary importance of the role that families and communities play in affecting the environment of care for people with dementia.<\/p><p> Among the key elements arising from the research which need to be considered in light of the strategy are: enhancing public awareness about dementia; increasing the numbers of early diagnoses; and introducing measures to improve quality of life and quality of care for those with dementia.  These and other key elements will influence the development of the strategy.  It is important to acknowledge the hard work and commitment invested by the advisory committee that guided and oversaw this research.  It provides a solid foundation and clear framework within which to achieve our objectives.<\/p><p> The next stage of the process involved a public consultation process and the closing date for submissions was 31 August.  The Department sought the views of interested parties, whether individuals or organisations, to help inform the development of the strategy, with a particular request to hear the views of those directly affected by Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, including people who have been diagnosed with one of these conditions, and their families and carers.<\/p><p> I am pleased to say that we received more than 70 responses to the call for submissions.  Submissions were received from individuals, representative organisations, family carers and health-care professionals.  I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to those who participated.  These contributions will serve as a platform for discussion and will further inform the development of the overall strategy.  The next step will see the establishment of a working group to develop the strategy fully in 2013.<\/p><p> The central focus of service provision must always be that it is person-centred, a point made by Senator O'Keeffe at the outset of the debate.  We need to recognise, respect and support the individual, and ensure that we keep them and their families at the very centre of all decisions and decision making.<\/p><p> The Health Service Executive provides a range of services for people with dementia including primary care services, in which I have a particular interest, involvement and lead role; home support services; day care; respite and continuing care services.  These services are delivered through the HSE's network of local offices, via public health nursing, day-care centres and public and private residential care facilities and, where appropriate, psychiatry of old age teams.  The HSE also funds non-governmental agencies, for example, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, Caring for Carers Ireland, and Western Alzheimers.<\/p> <p>A limited number of memory clinics and specialist services are available.  Respite care is the most commonly requested service and is provided in a number of ways, including the provision of a home care package to support respite in a person's home or day respite within dementia specific or generic day care centres.  Respite is also provided in residential homes.  In addition, care or support groups have been established throughout the country, details of which can be obtained from individual local primary care teams.<\/p><p>I would like to acknowledge in particular the magnificent and impressive role played over so many years by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, which this year is celebrating 30 years of representing the needs and interests of dementia patients and their carers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#AA00400","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":534,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#CC00200","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":535,"content":"<p>The society has grown over the years to become a professional nationwide charity, with a network of regional branches, staff and volunteers providing a range of services, including home care, day care, support homes, respite care and social clubs.<\/p><p>We have had the opportunity in recent months of launching a number of initiatives.

The total cost of these projects is in the region of \u20ac4.3 million.  Atlantic Philanthropies has generously provided \u20ac2.3 million, with the remainder provided by the Health Service Executive.<\/p><p>Four dementia projects were selected earlier this year.  The successful demonstration sites are located in Mayo, Kinsale, south Tipperary and D\u00fan Laoghaire.  The outcomes from each project will be evaluated and learning disseminated beyond the demonstration sites to the wider system, and to inform future operational policies of the HSE.  These are terrific examples of good ideas and good practice, which seek to move away from a situation where, too often, the service user had to fit into the service being provided to others in the local area to one where the service user is the key stakeholder in service design at the outset.<\/p><p>As we know, currently, there is no cure for dementia and people can live a long life with the illness.  In this regard, we acknowledge that their needs and those of their families and carers increase as the disease progresses.  Carers are vital to the success of Government policy in relation to older people, children and adults with an illness or a disability.  I am fully aware that every day in this country tens of thousands of family members, friends, partners, parents, children or neighbours provide care for someone who, through a variety of circumstances, is in need of that care.  The Government is under no illusion in relation to the challenges that carers face every day.  This is why the Taoiseach committed to developing the national carers' strategy, which was launched in July of this year.  The strategy sets the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided by Departments and agencies for carers.<\/p><p>The national carers strategy is the first of its kind to be developed in recognition of the invaluable role and contribution of carers in Ireland.  It places carers firmly on the national agenda and sets the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided by Departments and agencies for Irish carers.  It sets out a vision to work towards and an ambitious set of national goals and objectives to guide policy development and service delivery to ensure carers feel valued and supported to manage their caring responsibilities with confidence and are empowered to have a life of their own outside of caring.  I take this opportunity to recognise and acknowledge the level of dedication and commitment which carers show to their loved ones every day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#CC00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":536,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#CC00400","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":537,"content":"<p>In this, the European Year for Active Ageing, I am keenly aware of the importance of positive ageing not alone for each of us as individuals but also for our communities and society as whole.  The Government acknowledges the need to better recognise the position of older people in society.  The programme for Government has committed to completing and implementing the national positive ageing strategy in order that older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live independent full lives.  The strategy will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland and sets out a common framework for the development of operational plans by a number of Departments, clearly setting out each Department's objectives relating to older people.  Mechanisms designed to monitor the implementation of measures contained in operational plans will also be included in the strategy.  It is not envisaged, however, that the strategy will propose new service developments.  Rather, it will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland.<\/p><p>A considerable amount of preparatory work has been completed.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, who is the lead Minister in this area, intends to bring a draft strategy to Government in the final quarter of 2012.  I reiterate that the development of a national dementia strategy is a priority for this Government.  The research that was carried out earlier this year highlighted the primary importance of the role that families and communities play in the environment of care for people with dementia.  The financial cost, to which I alluded, is only one aspect of the overall costs.  Non-economic costs include the social, emotional and psychological strain the illness confers on people with dementia and their carers.  While I cannot at this stage pre-empt the findings of the working group that will develop the dementia strategy, having commissioned the research review and engaged in a public consultation, I can assure Senators that we are listening to what everyone has to say, including Members of this and the Lower House and outside interests across the board.  We are committed to examining all options and views put forward in this context.  I am confident this House will help inform our deliberations.  Senators can rest assured their recommendations, and insights provided by colleagues in the course of this debate, will be considered and will influence the strategy development.<\/p><p>In the current economic climate, it is very important that available resources are targeted at those most in need and that, where possible, care is provided in the community and the home.  The continuing pressure on resources in the health sector generally will make it an imperative that we obtain the very best targeting of resources towards those most in need.  The development of a national dementia strategy, combined with these other two important strategies to which I referred, will be a significant step forward in this regard.  Together with the enactment of the mental capacity legislation, they will form a solid foundation in ensuring the rights of some of our most vulnerable citizens are protected.  They, their families and carers are, and will continue to be, the focus of our considerations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#CC00500","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":538,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome his positive approach to this important aspect of Government policy.  The Minister of State has set the bar very high.  I wish him luck in achievement of the aspirations set out in the national dementia strategy and look forward to the successful conclusion of the deliberations that are under way in this regard and to our having an opportunity to discuss the proposals brought forward by the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch.  I also welcome that a draft of the strategy will be brought to Government during the final quarter of 2012.  I say this in the context of a rather interesting opinion that dementia services cost more than cancer, heart disease and stroke services combined.  Despite this, as an illness it fails to attract commensurate political and budgetary attention.  In that context, the aspirations as outlined by the Minister of State are to be welcomed.<\/p><p>As has been stated in the debate and will be stated again in future debates, there are few families that have not been touched by dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  My late aunt suffered from dementia in her declining years.  A close neighbour of mine was diagnosed with dementia at the early age of 57 years.  He was a mathematics teacher and brilliant man who was active in his community.  He died within years of his diagnosis.  The point has been made that people with dementia, as opposed to people with Alzheimer's - I understand there is a medical distinction between the two - can go on to live long lives, which places a great deal of responsibility and burden on families, friends and neighbours.  Sadly, there are also those like my neighbour who died not as a result of his condition but because of associated physical complications arising from his incapacity.<\/p> <p> The other aspect of this debate, which I know the Minister of State would be in favour of, is that in whatever strategy is developed, where possible those suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease stay in the home or in an environment to which family and friends have access.  I know this would be a priority of the Government - and I do not mean this to sound cynical - because it would be cheaper and less of a burden on the Government if those suffering from Alzheimer's disease and dementia are looked after by their family and friends rather than being institutionalised.  This also has medical benefits.  I hope the strategy will reflect this.<\/p><p>I am glad the Minister of State referred to the major costs outside of the economic and financial costs associated with dementia, as they often remain unrecognised.  I am particularly pleased he paid tribute to family and carers as well as to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  It is rather interesting that the scale of dementia is such that governments throughout the world are being forced to review their policies and reconfigure services for older people, as the Government here is doing.  It is a sad reality of life that the figures are increasing.  I do not know whether this has to do with environmental reasons.  I assume the Government provides funding in other areas of medical and scientific research, and I wonder whether it feels it has any role in advancing the research actively under way by pharmaceutical companies.  I presume they are closely monitoring results in this regard; it would be helpful in the context of the work that will be done on the strategy by the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, which might focus on the medical advances under way.  While they have not cracked it, and it seems to be a long way off, anybody who has more than a passing interest in this field will know there are regular updates on increasing discoveries about what causes Alzheimer's disease and dementia.<\/p><p>I wish to pay tribute to two people.  The first is my friend and colleague, Senator Mary White, who prepared a policy paper for our party on active ageing and quality caring.  She has been more than active in this regard, to the point that those of us in the party have had on occasion to restrain her in her enthusiasm for the subject.  I admire her, and I am sure the House would agree, for focusing on an area that does not always get the attention it deserves.  I do not mean to be at all political in this regard but I also pay tribute to the former Minister of State, \u00c1ine Brady, who from 2010 to the end of the Fianna F\u00e1il-led Administration initiated a number of policies which have been continued and expanded by the Government.  This reflects the all-party, non-political, non-partisan nature of this terrible medical condition.  I congratulate the Labour Party for bringing this important motion to the House.  We enthusiastically embrace all of its aspects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#CC00600","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am also delighted to welcome the members of the public who are in the Gallery.  They have an interest in this subject and I thank them for giving up their time.  I am glad the Minister of State has grasped the concept so well and I know he will be on top of his brief.  It is very important the national dementia strategy is put in place as soon as possible because it affects all families at some level.  According to the statistics, people in their 60s have a one in 100 chance of suffering from it, which increases to a 20 in 100 chance when one is in one's late 80s.  With our population ageing and living longer most people in this room will be affected either directly or through someone very close to them.  It is a real issue in the country.<\/p><p>Perhaps in the past the condition was not regarded as a major disablement because people stayed at home with their families, but it is a debilitating condition.  It is extremely difficult for families to watch a younger person develop early onset of dementia.  The Government and society has a role in dealing with this issue and in assisting the carers, as the difficulty of coping is sometimes left out of the loop.<\/p><p>The Department of Justice and Equality can make people wards of court and it can be awarded powers of attorney, which can be a difficulty for families and we must address this.  People physically capable of going on holiday but who need the assistance of a carer should be assisted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade if they want to go on holidays in the early stages of the disease.  At local government level, we must make towns, villages and services more friendly for people suffering from Alzheimer's disease and the onset of dementia.  According to statistics, by 2040 some 80 million people worldwide will suffer from Alzheimer's disease and dementia, as it doubles every ten years.  By that time, dementia it will be a major issue for families, and local and central government have a massive job to help communities become more friendly for people.<\/p><p>Many people are physically active into their 80s, but carers need support from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and State agencies involved in sport.  Evidence suggests Alzheimer's disease may not be as rampant in people who are more physically active, so from a cardiovascular point of view it is important the body is working.  People far more qualified than me state cardiovascular and stroke issues can lead to the early onset of dementia.  Therefore, our entire outlook on health is important for the national strategy on dementia.  The future for people in this position must be positive.<\/p><p>The HSE has a role to play in the community and voluntary sector to assist people who want to get involved.  Community employment schemes must be protected along with home help.  This is not a temporary issue we can solve; we must put in place a long-term plan.  We have seen support today from all parties.  This is something everyone supports and wants to work because this is our future as well as that of our parents and children.<\/p><p>In other countries the extended family has a role and people look after their grandparents.  This was easier to do years ago when people worked around the home and on farms.  People now travel and cannot afford to leave their parents in this position.  The Departments and agencies I mentioned have a role and must have an input into the strategy.  I look forward to the launch and delivery of the strategy on dementia.  Most people doing voluntary work are not appreciated and I thank them for their support.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and giving his time and considerate response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#DD00200","speaker":"1144"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":541,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is welcome to the House.  While listening to this debate it occurred to me that approximately one third of all debates in the House are directly related to health care.  This emphasises the importance of the issue and I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this extremely important motion.  It is an area on which we need to focus and bring about the necessary changes to assist families who must deal with a member of their family who has Alzheimer's disease or dementia.<\/p> <p>It is extremely important for us to give every possible support.<\/p><p>The Minister of State's speech was very comprehensive in setting out a clear agenda for what he intends to do in this area over the next two to three years.  Senator Cullinane and the Minister of State referred to wards of court.  One area we have not worked on over the past number of years is enduring powers of attorney even though we did bring about the change in the law.  We have not sold it as an area for people to sign up to.  That means people can assign enduring power of attorney while they are fully competent and set out clear guidelines as to how they want their affairs managed should they wind up unable to manage their affairs.  We need to do much more in that area to get across the message that this procedure is available.  As someone practising in the legal world, I find that people come to me when the person is a borderline case and it is unclear whether he or she has dementia or not.  We then try to get reports from doctors to ascertain if it is safe to get documents signed.  In nearly 50% of cases, it is too late to get that enduring power of attorney assigned.  We need to let the public know that this procedure is available.<\/p><p>I also welcome the many people in the Visitors' Gallery and thank them for their work and for putting the pressure on us to deliver in this area.  Pressure needs to be applied to us to ensure we can provide a better back-up support mechanism for people.  <\/p><p>Dementia is not necessarily confined to people over a certain age.  Over 4,500 people under 65 have dementia.  I remember canvassing in one election, knocking on a door and being asked in so I could discuss a particular problem with a member of the family.  The husband of this person was only in his mid-30s but was in full-time care as a result of developing Alzheimer's disease or dementia at a very early age.  The woman had four children under the age of 12.  It was absolutely frightening to think that there were no answers to the problems she faced for a long time.  It is not confined to an older age group and we also need proper systems of support for affected people in younger age categories.  We need to be conscious of this to ensure we do not ignore them in developing any policy changes.<\/p><p>This morning, I attended the launch of a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit about health care.  We are reacting to problems as they arise rather than looking at them before they arise and carrying out long-term planning.  We need to be proactive about screening and making sure people go for medical checks, not because they suddenly have pain or a problem but because they should have regular medical checks.  We need to promote this more.  People have a policy of only going to a doctor when they have a problem whereas we should be encouraging six-month or 12-month checks where problems can be dealt with far earlier.  <\/p><p>Screening has been introduced in Abu Dhabi across the country and 95% of the population have been screened.  Reports have been given to every individual setting out the lifestyle changes he or she needs to make.  We need to be more proactive in respect of our health care policy in this area and in getting people to look at their lifestyles, making sure they get proper advice and helping them change those lifestyles so that the cost of medical care will automatically be reduced.  <\/p><p>This is a very important topic and I fully support the motion tabled by the Labour Party group.  It is very comprehensive in an area where we need to bring about changes.  I know those changes will occur with the Minister of State's help and we will all be behind him in bringing about the required change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#DD00300","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":543,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for small business, Deputy John Perry, for the rest of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#EE00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":544,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House where he is always a welcome face.  I welcome the commitment of the Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, Deputy White, to ensuring the publication of the national dementia strategy in 2013.  We would all like to envisage an Ireland where everyone could live the life of their choosing and have a good quality of life despite their disability or despite being diagnosed with a terrible illness.  With this illness, somebody has a perfect body but his or her mind goes.  It is very sad and hurtful for the person and his or her family.  I worked in a nursing home years ago and distinctly recall a family member coming home from the US to visit his mother who did not recognise him.  The mother was in a happy place but he was not.  It was heartbreaking and wrenching to see a grown man cry because his own mother did not recognise him.<\/p><p>Obviously, early diagnosis and intervention must be looked at and developed to the highest degree.  All experts say that the earlier the diagnosis, the better the quality of life for the sufferer and the family looking after him or her.  Following on from early diagnosis of dementia, as stated in Department of Health policy, the move is to get people back into the community and living in their homes.  For that to happen, we need to put the services in place.  Part of the issue is the lack of legislation to underpin access to these services.  We need to put legislation in place to give people what they are entitled to, otherwise services are discretionary, as they are at the moment.  I know the single assessment tool will be introduced but we need to look at the services that are in place.  <\/p><p>It is very hard for people to access services on the ground, regardless of what people will say and put down on paper.  It is hard to know when people are to leave hospital or whether there will be home help available.  It is a long and hard road for the family members looking after a person with dementia.  It is hard enough to have to live with it and see one's loved one in this condition without having to fight the system.  Unfortunately, I find that people are constantly fighting the system and looking for their entitlements and rights.  As part of the strategy, we must ensure people's access and entitlement to these services is included in legislation.  <\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy White, sang the praises of carers and rightly so.  I continually fought for carers even before I was elected a Member of the Oireachtas because they are one of the most valuable assets this country has.  They are saving the State a fortune and we must look after and value them.  Once a carer is taken away from a person, he or she will inevitably end up in a nursing home or in care, which is very sad, so we must protect our carers.  The national carers' strategy has gone a long way towards underpinning their rights.  I will leave it at that because everything has been said by other Senators who have all highlighted what they want in the strategy.  I am sure the Minister of State will take on board their views and revert to the Ministers on this subject in his own time.  I thank him for taking the time to listen. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#EE00300","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":545,"content":"<p>I support this wide-ranging motion.  In the current economic climate, providing support for sufferers of dementia and their families is very challenging.  Unfortunately, action on the Government's commitment to introduce legislation on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is long overdue.  In response to questions on when the convention would be ratified, all Ministers who have held portfolios on this topic have said they want legislation in  place beforehand.  While we have signed up for ratification, we have not addressed all the elements required.  While our aspiration to ratify the treaty is noble, we do not recognise the urgency of doing so.  I acknowledge this was also the case under the previous Government.  Although strides were made under former Minister of State, Mr. John Moloney, to implement a new strategy on disability and mental illness, they were not enough.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, to ensure legislation is put in place in this regard.  While many of its provisions will require financial assistance, it must be acknowledged that rights do not always have financial consequences for the Exchequer.  There are many rights enshrined in the UN convention that are not upheld at present.<\/p><p>Under the Good Friday Agreement, Irish sign language is supposed to be recognised both north and south of the Border.  In the North, one can gain access to one's government through Irish sign language but this is not possible in the South.  This is amazing considering the content of the Good Friday Agreement and the UN convention.  One despairs over the fact that on one side of the Border, one will have access to government services and rights whereas, on the other, in the South, one will not.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this.  While we seem to be very good at signing up to the ratification of UN conventions, our implementation is less than desirable.  While I note the commitment on carers and others, I believe that if we are serious about ratifying UN conventions, we must ascribe to the process a greater degree of urgency than we have heretofore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#FF00100","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":546,"content":"<p>This is one of the most important issues on the agenda.  I have a copy of the report launched on 18 January 2012 in Trinity College Dublin by the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, Creating Excellence in Dementia Care.  I pay tribute to the authors, Professor Eamon O\u2019Shea, NUIG, Professor Suzanne Cahill and Dr. Maria Pierce, and I commend the work of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.<\/p><p>So much work has been done in producing the report that we do not have to reinvent the wheel.  It is an outstanding report.  The Minister, in launching it, stated there is a commitment in the programme for Government to launch a national strategy.  I look forward to its implementation.  The deadline given for this is 2013.  We are approaching 2013 so I hope all the work will be done by then.  The report is invaluable in informing this work.  One does not have to reinvent the wheel because the report is evidence based and was produced by eminent people.  Three quarters of the work is already done.  I thank the philanthropists who provided much of the funding for the work on which the report is based.  I acknowledge the work of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in its preparation.<\/p><p>Everybody has spoken about the importance of early diagnosis.  In 2010, the then Minister launched a national dementia education programme.  It seemed to identify gaps in specific education and training for nursing and non-nursing staff dealing with dementia.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, might bring that to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to determine whether there has been any re-evaluation of the programme.  What was found?  What is working and what is not working?<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke tabled a motion on the training of nurses, including gerontological training.  This is mentioned in the programme.  The Seanad engaged in community consultation with all the relevant groups associated with the elderly.  These issues, particularly training, were raised heretofore.<\/p><p>We heard so much about community care in the past few weeks.  Much of the news was bad but the good news is that community care for those suffering from dementia is vital.  Many people enter long-term care before they are ready for it.  The education, training and community-awareness programmes are not tailored to address this issue.  Two thirds of those in long-term care are estimated to have dementia.  Some are believed to be put in care prematurely.<\/p><p>One of the weaknesses of the home care services is that they are not underpinned by legislation, nor are they provided for statutorily.  Senator Moloney said that, while aspirations are fine, it is vital that there be a statutory basis to implementation.  In the absence of community support at the desired level, people with dementia continue to be placed in long-term care prematurely.<\/p><p>I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to consider funding.  I was working with a lady recently whose husband, who is quite young, has dementia.  She found two nursing homes that were willing to take him.  It is sometimes difficult to get the right nursing home to take a person because specific care is required.  However, the funding system is such that some institutions are deemed unsuitable while others are deemed suitable.  It is important that the funding system be changed to accommodate those who are willing, able, trained and HIQA approved.<\/p><p>Let us consider the emphasis on prevention.   In this regard, I was looking at the BBC only yesterday.  I happened to be in Glasgow, where I was speaking at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly on the UN declaration on disabilities.  Senator Mark Daly will be delighted to know that I have been advocating action on Irish sign language for years.  I spoke about Irish sign language at the meeting.  A motion was passed yesterday and it will be forwarded to the relevant authorities in Scotland, Wales and Ireland.  I assure the Senator that we are working on the matter.<\/p><p>With regard to music programmes, it has been found that music helps those with dementia.  While the benefits of doing crosswords, Sudoku, etc., have always been known, new research has shown that grey matter increases significantly among those who do physical exercise.  I encourage everyone to get up on his or her exercise machine.<\/p> <p>They say prevention is as good as a cure but perhaps not in this case.  I do not have the details of the new research but we should all promote it.  I congratulate the Alzheimer Society on its 30 years of hard work and I hope that we can do what it requests of us.      <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#FF00200","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351076700,"counter":548,"content":"<p>I call Senator Mary Moran.

It urges people to think about and pre-record their wishes in the event of serious illness or death.  The Think Ahead form was launched on 12 October at the forum on the end of life and I was involved in the project.  A pilot programme is being rolled out in County Louth.  It is one of the counties being used for the pilot scheme.  The Think Ahead project presents us with a wonderful opportunity.  I urge everybody, from fellow colleagues to associations, to watch out for the scheme being rolled out in their area as it gives everyone an opportunity to plan for later in life.  For people in the early stages of dementia the form is a wonderful tool and will ensure that their wishes are carried out even when they are no longer able to speak for themselves.  The scheme is invaluable when a person's capacity to make important choices fluctuates.  I have mentioned how important it is to introduce and publish the mental capacity Bill as soon as possible.<\/p><p>An issue was brought to my attention this week by someone who works in dementia care and the issue was not raised earlier.  I refer to the safeguarding of people with dementia who are at risk of abuse, particularly in their homes.  We all hope that the children's referendum will be passed on 10 November.  It will ensure that children at risk can be removed to a place of safety in order to protect them in exceptional circumstances. So much work must also be done to protect a person with dementia who is at risk.  At present the only places of safety that are available to them are the accident and emergency department of a hospital or a Garda barracks.  Neither is suitable for a severely confused person.  I want to bring the matter to the Minister of State's attention and I ask for it to be considered when the strategy is being rolled out.  I know that some work has been done and is ongoing regarding the matter.  It is vital that we examine it further.<\/p><p>As has been said many times today, carers are the lynchpin and we could not provide a service without them.  I wish to express my sincere thanks to them for all of their work.  There are thousands of carers and they provide care to dementia sufferers, people with disabilities and older people.  Yesterday I spoke to a girl who rang me because she was distraught and worried about her 92-year old grandparents.  She was simply looking for a night's sleep and wanted care to be provided.  The care service is important.  Again, I thank the carers for all of the work they do.           <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#GG00300","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351076700,"counter":550,"content":"<p>I call Senator Susan O'Keeffe and she has four minutes to conclude the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#GG00400","nonspeaker":"Acting Chairman (Senator Pat O'Neil)"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, for replacing the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White.<\/p><p>  I thank my colleagues in the Labour Party for all of the work that has been done to table the motion today and I thank Senator Landy for seconding it.  I also thank all of my colleagues in the Seanad.  As a Senator has rightly expressed, it is political but not party political.  The way Senators have robustly supported the motion reminds us all of its importance.  It sends a clear message to those who will be charged with pulling together the important strategy.  It proves that we all care about dementia and that there are many ways to form the strategy.  I hope that some of what we have offered today will become part of the strategy.  <\/p><p>  I welcome Deputy Alex White's commitment to publish the mental capacity legislation during this session.  I welcome his reiteration that the national dementia strategy will be delivered and implemented over the next five years.  It is important to note, while we are here being positive together, that the Government is driving the strategy forward.  The commitment given in the programme for Government stands as a real commitment to the people inside and outside of the chamber and also to the thousands of people who struggle with dementia and care for their loved ones.  Those people want to see that resources and budgets are spent wisely and in a more targeted way in the future.<\/p><p>  Tomorrow the Alzheimer Society will host a conference where <font color=\"#222222\">Gr\u00e1inne McGettrick <\/font>will speak about transforming the lives of people with dementia.  The national dementia strategy wants to transform the lives of those who have dementia and their carers.  I shall remind Members of what was cited earlier.  We said that: carers are crucial to the strategy and its implementation; that its approach is person-centred when providing care and services; that it is based, as far as possible, in the community; that there would be more and specified training; that standards of care are outlined in the strategy; that the budget, if it can be, is ring-fenced and targeted with a better direction of all resources; and that a clinical director in the HSE be appointed to take care of the latter.  <\/p><p>  The Minister asked me about research.  One of the advantages of having a relatively homogenous population in Ireland means that an EU joint programme initiative is commencing through the Health Research Board.  Ireland will participate in the research on Alzheimer's disease and the strategic research agenda is being prepared.  The measure will add to the entire work.  Many people work in the dementia sector and many of whom will be present at the Alzheimer Society's conference tomorrow.  I commend the work done by the Alzheimer Society and the many organisations that care about dementia and for the people who care about dementia.  I thank the Members for a robust and strong debate and I am glad that we have managed to reach agreement on the motion.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#GG00500","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1351076700,"counter":552,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from D\u00e1il","time":1351076700,"count":553,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#HH00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":554,"content":"<p>D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann agreed on 23 October 2012 to the amendments made by Seanad \u00c9ireann to the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2008.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#HH00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Amendment to Terms of Reference of Tribunal of Inquiry: Motion","time":1351076700,"count":555,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#HH00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I move:<ul><br>That Seanad \u00c9ireann resolves that the terms of reference contained in the Resolution passed by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann on 23 March 2005 and by Seanad \u00c9ireann on 24 March 2005, as amended by the Resolutions passed by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and Seanad \u00c9ireann on 1 June 2011, the Resolution passed by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann on 16 November 2011 and by Seanad \u00c9ireann on 17 November 2011, and the Resolutions passed by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and Seanad \u00c9ireann on 23 May 2012, pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2011, be further amended as follows: <ul>1. in paragraph (I), by substituting 'not later than 31 January, 2013 and 30 April, 2013 and, on each of those occasions, shall set out:' for 'not later than 9 March, 2012 setting out:'; and <br>2. in paragraph (IV), by substituting 'not later than 31 July, 2013' for 'not later than 31 October, 2012'.&quot;<i><\/i><\/ul><\/ul><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#HH00400","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":557,"content":"<p>This motion proposes to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry into suggestions of collusion by members of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na or other employees of the State in the murder by the Provisional IRA of RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and RUC Superintendent Bob Buchanan in March 1989.  The tribunal, as Members know, was established by the Oireachtas in 2005 and it is chaired by Judge Peter Smithwick, former President of the District Court.  The Smithwick tribunal was established arising from the Weston Park talks in 2001 and in light of Judge Peter Cory's subsequent report on the murder of the RUC officers.  Its purpose is to get at the truth of these suggestions of collusion both in the public interest and, importantly, in the interests of the families who were bereaved by this atrocity.<\/p><p>Senators will be aware that, on 12 October, the Clerk of the D\u00e1il received a letter from the tribunal chairman requesting an extension of the deadline for the conclusion of the tribunal's work.  The Clerk of the D\u00e1il laid that letter before both Houses.  This motion will provide for an extension of nine months, that is, to 31 July 2013, to the current date established for the conclusion of the tribunal's inquiries and the submission of its final report.  This is fully in line with Judge Smithwick's request, and the Government hopes the tribunal can fulfil its mandate within the revised timefrarne which has been set out.<\/p><p>In his recent letter the tribunal chairman states that due to the serious illness of a key witness and based on the medical advice of the witness's doctor, the taking of evidence from that witness has had to be deferred for a period of five or six months.  This witness is considered fundamental to the tribunal's remit and the chairman indicates he must provide for completing his evidence when the witness is medically fit so to do.  The chairman notes that, due to the ill-health of this witness, the taking of his evidence has been significantly delayed.<\/p><p>Judge Smithwick also states that additional intelligence-based material was only recently and unexpectedly presented to the tribunal.  In July and again in September of this year, the British authorities and the Police Service of Northern Ireland provided this new material to the tribunal.  The chairman considers this material to be highly relevant to the work of the tribunal and that he must, therefore, investigate it and provide for hearings related to it, if need be.<\/p><p>It is clearly a matter of concern that significant information should emerge at such a late stage in the tribunal's hearings.  However, it is a matter for the tribunal at this stage to address the issues arising and the House will appreciate that I could not comment in detail on the matter without becoming involved in the substance of the work being carried on at the tribunal.  I note, however, that the chairman makes the point in his letter that some of this new material is currently highly sensitive and characterised as being &quot;of the moment&quot;.  I regard it as surprising that new material of relevance to the tribunal's work has been furnished to it only very recently having regard to the duration of the tribunal's engagement.  I believe it is essential such information that does exist and that is of relevance to the tribunal's terms of reference is made available fully to the tribunal and that the completion of its important work and of its deliberations is not unnecessarily delayed.  In light of the late emergence of this material, I have been assured by the British authorities that every assistance is being afforded by them to the tribunal.  In addition, I have assured Judge Smithwick that I remain available to assist him in this regard if at any stage he feels it necessary or appropriate.<\/p><p>The Government, having considered the tribunal chairman's request, proposes that the D\u00e1il should resolve to extend the timeframe for the tribunal as requested and that this House should do so as well.  As an additional measure and to ensure this House is kept fully abreast of the tribunal's progress towards conclusion in this additional period, the proposal provides for two further interim reports from the tribunal to be submitted by 31 January 2013 and by 31 April 2013.  I emphasise, as I have done previously, that if, for any reason, it does not prove possible for the tribunal to meet the timeframe set out, the chairman can report this to the Clerk of the D\u00e1il in order that the House might consider the matter further.  I can also reassure this House that, as we have demonstrated to date, the Government's response to such an approach from the chairman would be fully cognisant of and consistent with the need for the tribunal to fulfil its obligations fully and as expeditiously as possible.<\/p><p>The Government respects the importance of the tribunal chairman carrying out his inquiries fully and without fear or favour, and is anxious to support him in doing that.  I am confident this motion will assist in that endeavour and I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#HH00500","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I support the proposal of the Government in the Seanad.

They were awful murders, but this was par for the course for an organisation which murdered a total of 656 members of the British forces, 621 civilians, 272 police officers, 35 loyalist terrorists, six garda\u00ed, and a soldier, as well as a number of its own members.<\/p><p>The Weston Park talks were the catalyst for the setting up of the Smithwick tribunal.  There were suggestions of collusion in a number of murders by the security forces on both sides of the Border.  Following a review by Judge Cory, the Smithwick tribunal was set up in this jurisdiction to examine the murders of Harry Breen and Robert Buchanan.<\/p> <p>Serious allegations were made in respect of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and it is crucial that the Smithwick tribunal gets to the truth of this matter.  One also must ask members of the Government to do more to press their colleagues in the British Government in respect of investigating the murder of Mr. Pat Finucane.<\/p><p>The Smithwick tribunal has been working for a number of years and the Minister has set out, both today and on a number of previous occasions, the reasons the judge has stated his work will take some time.  The Oireachtas must give the judge the additional time.  One hopes this will be the last extension but Members must be guided by the judge in respect of his needs and the needs of witnesses, balanced with the needs of the families of the murdered officers to get to the truth, as well as for the peace process to move forward.  One must always bear in mind that this particular tribunal is an integral part of the peace process, which is still ongoing.<\/p><p>There would be no necessity to spend millions of euro on tribunals were those who were involved in those murders and their colleagues from the Sinn F\u00e9in Party, some of whom are Members of these Houses but who are absent today, to give information they have.

They should answer the questions and should give as much information as they have.  They should answer the questions in respect of various despicable and cowardly murders that have taken place.  They also should answer the questions in respect of the burial of bodies in my part of County Meath in Oristown, Coghalstown and Wilkinstown.  Members of Sinn F\u00e9in, which provided political support for these murders over the years, must co-operate and give as much information as they have.

I support the motion he has presented before Members and compliment the previous speaker on his support for the motion and on outlining some of the background to the problems on the northern part of our land.  When the Minister came before the House previously, it was hoped that such an extension as is now being proposed would not be necessary.  What is most important, however, is that the Smithwick tribunal has the time and resources available to it to carry out its important work and to report to Members at the earliest possible date.  It is highly significant that Judge Smithwick has put on record his requirement for an extension of time, as well as the possibility of significant new evidence being available.  While everyone obviously wishes such evidence had been available at an earlier date, it is never the wrong time for the right thing, so to speak, and this evidence must be investigated fully.<\/p><p>This particular tragedy from 1989 obviously is one of the many tragedies the people, North and South, experienced over a number of decades during the IRA-led violence.  One must recognise, however, that there were horrible incidents on all sides of the political divide and, as part of our attempt to build a new and peaceful future on this island, we must, in so far as possible, bring truth and reconciliation to the table.  At the onset of this tribunal, many people may have felt that although it was being set up, it somehow was little more than a type of political sop.  Nothing could be further from the reality, however, and this is a serious tribunal engaged in important work.  Members must give it the time and space it seeks of them.<\/p><p>I support the motion with these few words and note Members must not and cannot be afraid of the truth being revealed.  The truth, as it relates to the dreadful campaign of violence across the island, and across Northern Ireland in particular, for almost 30 years, will be painful, but Members must deal with that reality and support the work of this tribunal.

It is undoubtedly frustrating that Members are back here again, but given what the Minister has indicated, they all must accept there is no alternative and the tribunal has good reason to seek this extension at this time.  It must be stated, however, that more than six years have elapsed since the tribunal was instituted.  It commenced its investigations in early 2006 and is now due to report by 31 July 2013, by which time it will have been in being for more than seven years.  Consequently, it is unfortunate it has been obliged to take so long.  There is no doubt that the murders of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and RUC Superintendent Bob Buchanan were especially heinous, and I believe all Members have expressed sympathy to their families as well as an understanding that the tribunal is undertaking necessary work in investigating the circumstances of those murders.<\/p><p>  The Minister has explained the two key reasons the chair of the tribunal has sought the extension of time, namely, the illness of a key witness and the fact of evidence newly provided by the PSNI and the British authorities.  In what perhaps was a strong understatement, the Minister noted it is surprising the new material has been furnished only recently to the tribunal.  It certainly appears to be material that is or may be of particular value to the tribunal and, consequently, the latter clearly will require more time.  It also is of concern that one of the key witnesses has been very ill, and I imagine all Members hope for his speedy recovery and certainly hope he will be able to give the evidence required within the timeframe provided for by the extension.

In respect of the other reason for seeking an extension, I merely state my hope, in the context of this motion being passed, that any individual or group on this island or elsewhere who has additional information that falls within the terms of reference of this tribunal would furnish that information to the tribunal without any further delay.<\/p><p>I hope it will not prove necessary to extend further the life of the tribunal.

It is crucial, if there is anything of any relevance that anyone has in his or her possession which would inform the deliberations of the tribunal and assist it in reaching its conclusion and which remains outstanding, that it is furnished to the tribunal.

We are all very acutely aware of the facts and reminded on a daily basis of the serious financial difficulty we have and the shortfall of &#8364;16 billion.  There are also requirements under the terms of the EU-IMF bailout agreement to reduce our borrowing for 2013 by &#8364;3.5 billion.  The Minister's Department has a budget of &#8364;20.5 billion, accounting for 40% of overall Government expenditure, and I am very aware she is required to reduce the budget by &#8364;540 million in 2013.  I appreciate the difficult decisions that have to be taken and cuts that must be made.<\/p><p>  To build on the comments of my colleague, Senator Zappone, in the first part of this debate last week, there is a question about how these cuts are made and against whom they are directed.  These are ultimately political decisions.  There is nothing more disheartening as a Senator than to feel my interventions about any budgetary cuts are futile in the face of a done deal, so I welcome the Minister's reassurance that no decisions have been finalised in respect of the 2013 budget.<\/p><p>  We need to stop plugging the dam and looking for immediate savings, which are ultimately bankrupting us of our moral fibre.  As a Government and society we must firmly establish our red lines, or the values and principles that we are unwilling to yield.  An example of this was aptly articulated yesterday in the audiovisual room by the community and voluntary pillar, when it presented an alternative budget for 2013, with values such as dignity, sustainability, equality, human rights and working for the common good.  Such values inherently seek to protect children, the elderly, disabled, weak, vulnerable and marginalised, it makes for a value system that I support and endorse.<\/p><p>  We must articulate a vision for the Ireland we want in ten years, developing strategies that are necessary to achieve this vision by incorporating values and aligning them with national policies.  We can do this and I do not agree that Ireland is bound by the current policies for achieving the &#8364;3.5 billion reduction in borrowing as set out in the letter of intent, memorandum of economic and financial policies, and the technical memorandum of understanding.  Within the document I note the paragraph following the proposed revenue measures and expenditure reduction in the memorandum, which states:<ul>Without prejudice to the minimum consolidation amount referred to in the previous paragraph and to the requirements to achieve the agreed fiscal targets, the Government may, in consultation with the staff of the European Commission, the IMF and the ECB, replace one or more of the above measures with others of equally good quality based on the options identified in the comprehensive review of expenditure.<\/ul>I am not alone in reading this to mean that Ireland is free to change the method through which the requisite saving is made, once it is made.<\/p><p>  It is interesting to note that Social Justice Ireland agreed with 130 of the 131 recommendations made by the Commission on Taxation report from 2009 on tax breaks.  The exception was the recommendation on child benefit.  Lists of savings are possible, and I strongly encourage the Government to consider the proposals.  I do this on behalf of the more than 700,000 people in Ireland, of which 200,000 are children, at risk of poverty, and the more than one in four children between age 12 and 17 already living in poverty.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service gave a good presentation earlier this morning on the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, demonstrating that households with children are at more of a disadvantage and are more likely to enter poverty.  Our current policy is not working, although it may satisfy the troika and meet international requirements.  It is not working for the raft of Irish people bearing the brunt of the cuts.<\/p><p>  In preparing for today's discussion I pondered how we have a multi-annual plan for the troika and education officials are considering school infrastructure, responding to change in demographics with a multi-annual plan.  The action plan for jobs brings us up to 2016.  The plan for the country's people, however, is missing.  Where is that plan?  I have spoken with friends who are holding on to savings despite being encouraged to spend.  When there is no plan for the people, it is an issue.<\/p> <p>Those living in extremely marginalised and vulnerable conditions do not know where the safety net is and feel it keeps moving.  They are walking on this tightrope and are asking where the safety net is because it has moved again.<\/p><p>We need to look not only at one budget - all the focus now is on budget 2013 - but at things much more in advance.  The programme for Government referred to working across Departments.  If one looks solely at the issue of child benefit, the question is whether we tax or means test it rather the Minister's Department looking outside itself and asking why we are giving child benefit and the purpose of it.  Is there a better way to achieve the outcomes we wish other than by purely looking at cash transfers?  I suppose I am trying to encourage the Minister and her colleagues in Cabinet not to look simplistically at cash savings but to have a plan for the people to say this is where we are going.  We can do it for jobs and for the troika but can we do it for the people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#LL00200","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":569,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.

I was in the Mansion House today where the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, introduced a proposal to reform the social welfare appeals system, which was launched by the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly.  It is looking for it to be independent of the social welfare staff who run it currently.  I agree with much of what I heard.  Presentations were also made by people from Northern Ireland where the appeals system is totally independent.<\/p><p>Our system is not transparent.  If one applies for a social welfare payment, one does not know who is dealing with it.  The deciding officer may not be the person who dealt with the case.  One does not know the doctors dealing with it and, as I often say, doctors differ and patients die.  There are many medical referees and they would all have varying opinions, but one does not have access to the file.  If a person wants to appeal a decision of a deciding officer, he or she does not get access to the full file, something of which the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, was critical.  She was also critical of some of the deciding officers' decisions.  An interesting statistic was that where people got the benefit of an oral hearing, 49% of cases were overturned because people were able to present their cases.  Social welfare application forms are very confusing for ordinary people to complete.  Many of the 30 to 40 pages are nonsense and do not apply to them.<\/p><p>There was also a presentation by the chief appeals officer and, listening to her, it would seem there is no problem in the Department.  There are problems and I know the Minister has been fundamental in bringing about a change in the scanning system in the Department, but there are historical cases which are just left there, as it were.  I have been dealing with a case since last January and I do not know how many telephones calls I have made to the invalidity pension section.  I telephoned it two weeks ago, said I was frustrated and that I needed someone to deal with the case.  I happened to talk to a nice lady and it was like as if she had a box of files beside her.  She told me to hold on for a second.  She came straight back to me and said she had the file, that it had been there for a while and that she would get it sent on for a medical re-evaluation.  I telephoned again today to find out at what stage the medical re-evaluation was.  The girl said it had been sent on but that she did not know when it would be dealt with.  I asked her to give me an indication as to whether it would be one month, two months, six months or a year.  She said she had no idea.  I am frustrated by what people must go through.  I am going through it too because I am taking all the telephone calls on this.  The Minister needs to talk to the chief appeals officer and to question this.  I can give her examples of historical cases in respect of which nothing has happened for 12 to 14 months.<\/p><p>Rent caps were adjusted some time ago but it seems they were just slashed by 25% across the board.  There was nothing scientific about the way the new rent caps were devised.  In Roscommon town, where there is a shortage of houses, because it did not benefit from the tax incentive scheme and oceans of houses were not built with landlords crying out to rent them, the rent cap for a single person is \u20ac69 per week.  If one heads south from Roscommon and in the direction of County Galway, one will come to a little village called Creggs on the Galway-Roscommon border.  If one happens to live outside the village of Creggs in the middle of nowhere, the rent cap is \u20ac103 per week because it is in County Galway.  We must look realistically at rent caps and at the likes of Roscommon town.<\/p><p>I refer to an issue which is not specific to the Minister but which I raised with the Minister for Health and other Ministers, namely, the proposed cuts to home help hours.  I have made a proposal to the Minister for Health that he should consider opening it up to the community employment schemes to replace the hours proposed to be cut.  At a minimum cost of \u20ac750,000, we could replace the necessary home help hours which are proposed to be cut.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#MM00200","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to make a few brief points.  Everyone appreciates the Minister is in a very difficult position.  She is more used to being in my position than that which she is in now and she will know that whatever she does, she will be wrong.  That is the difficulty the Minister for Social Protection faces at this time.<\/p><p>Senator Kelly made a point I was thinking about in the context of appeals processes and representations made in regard to invalidity pension in particular.  The analogy I was thinking about was not so much the box.  When I telephone the Department I sometimes feel it is as elusive as my ticket being drawn on &quot;Winning Streak&quot; because at times one wonders if there is a filing system at all because of the length of time it takes.<\/p><p>This is a serious issue.  We are dealing with the most vulnerable who are in the most difficulty.  It is hand to mouth survival stuff as opposed to looking after people.  Notwithstanding that the people in the relevant Departments are working hard, are there enough people?   Do we need overtime?  Does more time need to be put in?  Indeed, Senator Kelly made a very good suggestion in regard to CE schemes.  Let us use the JobBridge programme, bring people in, give them administrative experience, give them the extra \u20ac50 per week and get them to work through this.<\/p><p>One of the criticisms I would have of the public service generally is that, in the main, the culture is that one works from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  In the private sector and in the political world, it is a bit different in that one works until the job is done.  I know that might not be quite realistic in the context of so many applications, files and so on but one thing is certain: we cannot, with credibility, stand over the system in operation and say everyone is doing all he or she can.  We are failing miserably in that regard.  I am sure all Members of this House and the other would say the most frequent requests with which they must deal relate to invalidity pensions and delays with appeals, along with medical cards.<\/p><p>The Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, and FLAC are correct, and I am thinking of the mortgage arrears resolution process, the code of conduct and the inadequate way we are dealing with that problem.  The banks adjudicate on the appeals process where a person feels he or she has not been treated fairly.  The appeals process in the Department of Social Protection is adjudicated on by people in that Department.  I can think of no justification where a plaintiff or a defendant would preside over an appeal in a court of law.<\/p><\/a> <p>This should and must be examined.<\/p><p>The Minister can make no cut or saving that anybody on this side of the House will welcome and she knows all about that from her time in opposition.  I appeal to her to be as fair as she can.  She should be careful with child benefit.  People have gone to the media to say they do not need child benefit or they can survive without it because they have a high salary.  I am thinking of someone in the entertainment world particularly who made a statement in this regard lately.  A book should not be judged by its cover.  As when trade unionists talk about core income being what others might call allowances, the child benefit payment is probably used to pay essential bills such as light and heating rather than contributing to the needs of children, for which the payment was envisaged, and, therefore, it forms part of the core income to run the family home in many instances.  It will be difficult to deal with that issue.  Means testing would be the ideal way to go but the cost of administration makes that difficult.  I do not know how the Minister will deal with it.  If I had a solution, I would give it to her but I appeal to her to be careful about it.  I wish her well in her deliberations over the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#MM00300","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":572,"content":"<\/a> <p>I compliment the Minister on the many reforms she has introduced in the social welfare system over the past 18 months.  Significant amounts have been taken in as a result of tackling fraud in the system and I am sure the Minister will agree there is a long road to go and more to be done in that regard.  I compliment her on the JobBridge programme and she should be complimented in many other areas.   However, we all dwell on the problems in the system.  I will relay many of the issues raised on the Order of Business over the past number of weeks.  The issue of FLAC and the independent appeals system has been raised.  I thought the entire system was independent but the Minister will address that in her reply.<\/p><p>The long delays in processing various allowances is a problem.  The delay in processing carer's allowance and invalidity applications is almost 12 months.  Additional staff have been taken on and community welfare officers are now under the ambit of Social Protection but I agree that if there is need to take more staff in that area, it should be done to address the delays because the vast majority applying for these benefits are bona fide applicants and they should be dealt with speedily.<\/p><p>I also compliment the Minister on the report she commissioned on pensions.  She is seeking suggestions in this area over the next three months.  Many Members raised this on the Order of Business earlier and they would like an input into that.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister will come to the House to address the issue at a later date.<\/p><p>The Minister for Health has received proposals from Senator Kelly, which he also sent to me, to use people on community employment schemes to provide home help services but I doubt there will be a rush of people on social welfare benefits to take up community employment schemes for an additional \u20ac25 a week.<\/p><p>I finally refer to the old chestnut of children's allowances.  The reason they could not be taxed previously was the incompatibility of the IT systems in the Department with those of Revenue and other Departments.  Has this been rectified?  Is there light at the end of the tunnel?  What is the situation in this regard?

While the Department of Social Protection has a role in the protection of the most needy in our society, it also has a duty of care to people in employment because people feel there is inequality in regard to the benefits some claimants get under the social welfare system which they cannot access in employment.  Many Members referred to children's allowance and the fact that the most wealthy people in the country are in receipt of it.  The problem has been the inability to means test because computer systems were not linked.  Would the Minister consider a basic rate of &#8364;70, &#8364;80 or &#8364;100 a week with people having to apply for a top up in order that they receive the payment automatically from the Government?  If, for example, a claimant's income is below a certain threshold, he or she could be entitled to an additional payment for children.  It would be worth considering because the administration of that would not be as onerous as means testing and taxing the benefit.<\/p><p>  I refer to the social welfare culture in the country.  There was a great article in <i>The Times<\/i> a few months ago about the establishment of the social welfare system in England.  In cities in England, three generations of some families have never worked in their lives and rely on social welfare.  That is down to education and to administrators such as us making sure these people have proper opportunities to access education and training schemes.  Will the Minister consider a cap on the amount of social welfare that goes into certain houses?  This issue has been raised with me when I meet people on the street.  They say they have neighbours with five people in the house who are all on social welfare while they are out working.  A man who works in the public service said to me, &quot;I have educated my family and sent them through university.  For me to gain the equivalent of somebody down the road from me who is on social welfare and married with four children, I would have to earn &#8364;62,000 because of the benefits these people can claim&quot;.  That is an example of the inequalities in the social protection system.  People feel it is not beneficial to work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#NN00300","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":574,"content":"<\/a> <p>I will return to some of the issues raised last week as well.

A total of 300,000 people are on one form of illness support payment or other and they may have dependants and children.  That equates to 16% of adults of working age.<\/p> <p>That is a very high figure.  Countries that we recognise as having good social welfare systems and that have reformed social welfare, such as Denmark, Holland and the Scandinavian countries, have changed from a passive system, where one qualifies for payment and is left alone forever, to an active system where we try to encourage people back to work.  This applies in particular to illness benefits.  The best international medical evidence and occupational health evidence is that, where people have had an illness and have been able to physically recover, what most helps their recovery is to get back to work and to be in an active environment with work colleagues.  They may not be able to do so on a full-time basis but the evidence from doctors in recent years points this way.  We have not had that in our system.  Much of my focus is to say that the social contract in Ireland is that people will be supported if they lose their jobs, fall ill or have a disability.  Taxpayers and citizens want to see a solid system of social support but it is a two-way contract.  Equally, the other side of the contract is that the people receiving income support are obliged, on behalf of their fellow citizens and taxpayers, to do their best to get themselves back to work and to become financially independent.  That is a cultural change we require.<\/p><p>Regarding Senator MacSharry's point, I was astonished to see that, at the height of the Celtic tiger, some 100,000 extra people went onto various illness benefit payments.

We could all work out different elements of the explanation and, when people talk about reform, it is a significant number.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout referred to children.  The worst poverty outcome for children is to be in jobless households.  The most important thing for a child to be successful, in terms of being financially independent and self-sustaining, is that the child is in a household where there is some work.  The worst outcomes for children are in jobless households and, unfortunately in terms of our problem at the moment, we have many jobless households.  In terms of any reform programme, the employment situation, which was referred to by many Senators, is absolutely vital.<\/p><p>Members asked questions about carers, the half-rate carer's allowance and delays.  The delays occur because of the enormous volume of applications.  There are 52,000 people in receipt of a carer's allowance, which is an enormous increase on the position a number of years ago.  Some 22,000 of those people receive the half rate carer's allowance.  In the budget strategy and the budget outcome last year, the carer's allowance was protected because carers are providing full-time care and are doing a very important job.  It is a priority of the Government to acknowledge it, recognise it and support it in terms of income.<\/p><p>Senator Norris asked whether the carer's allowance could be extended and whether fuel allowances could be frontloaded to allow people to buy oil in bulk.  We have a winter fuel allowance for five months.  We do not have the capacity to prepay.  It is possibly not the best idea in all circumstances.  Senator Norris referred to people getting a fill of oil but most oil suppliers will accept a weekly or monthly budget plan.  I would be wary of handing out the money in one lump sum.  The experience of the Department in large lump sum handouts is not universally great.  In some cases, the money might not be directed to the purpose for which it is intended.  We need to study Senator Norris's proposal very carefully.<\/p><p>Senators Thomas Byrne and John Kelly referred to delays in applications for carer's allowance.  The problem is the numbers.  We are changing the computer systems.  Many of the computer processes in the Department go back to the 1980s, when they were top of the range, but it is several decades later and they need to be substantially overhauled.  One of the things I regret about the boom period is that more was not done to update the ICT systems.  It is a slow process that is under way.  Senators will find that, in the case of invalidity, there is a significant advance in completing the new systems.  Current applications are being dealt with much more quickly.  I meet regularly with officials with a view to prioritising the clearance of the backlog.<\/p><p>Senator Mullins referred to the abuse of the free travel pass and suggested a charge for the travel pass and getting holders to register every year to confirm an entitlement.  The number in receipt of a travel pass has increased and it is a significant issue.  Some 750,000 pensioners and those with a disability have a free travel pass but there are another 300,000 companion passes.  There is a concern among a number of operators that some people are using the pass even though they are not entitled to it.  Our pensioners are not the problem in respect of the travel pass.  The review group was brought together to examine the matter.<\/p><p>This year, we have produced 40,000 PPS cards with photographic identity.  This will be rolled out next year and it will greatly help in cutting out abuse.  It is important because people next door and up and down the road are aware of abuse and they are consenting, as taxpayers, to pay for a good social welfare system but they are not consenting to people who abuse it.  I was in the Seanad Chamber last year and I asked for powers for social welfare inspectors to ask questions at the airport of people coming in and out.  Those powers are being significantly used and a number of prosecutions have taken place.<\/p><p>Members have asked about not having cuts to certain areas but no decisions have been made on the budget.  The Department must find savings of over \u20ac500 million.  We will do so in the best way possible but the best way is to get more people back to work.  At that point, the cost to the State decreases by at least \u20ac200 per week and maybe more and the person gradually pays tax, pays PRSI and purchases more.  We rebalance the system by getting people back to work.<\/p> <p>The social welfare appeals office is independent of the social welfare offices.  Many people, including Senator Kelly, do not feel that is the case but it is independent.  I will convey what has been said here to the people in the social welfare appeals office.<\/p><p>Senator Van Turnhout and others raised the question of child benefit.  I have spoken here before on this.  One of our problems is that at the moment minimum direct cash payments to a family completely dependent on social welfare amount to \u20ac30 per week in direct payment for a qualified child and \u20ac140 per month in child benefit.  That is equivalent to \u20ac65 per week per child.  It is a significant amount.<\/p><p>Are there better ways to target that?  That is the issue.  Could there be a universal payment at a high level that retains the principle of universality, which is of benefit to women in particular?  I certainly benefited from it, as did many of the other women here.  Perhaps some of the men did but it generally goes to the caring parent, the mother.  What would be a better way than a universal payment at a certain level and then targeting the balance?<\/p><p>In Finland, when the banking system collapsed, the Finnish Government decided it needed to invest in education and started with pre-school.  If we could have more pre-school and after-school care, although we would not get it immediately on the Finnish scale, it would pay a dividend throughout the school system.  The late Brian Lenihan converted the early childhood payment into a free year of child care, which saved about half the amount and I can see the benefit of that scheme every day.  I see children gaining from it and parents broadly approving of it.<\/p><p>We could do more there.  The Department spends \u20ac35 million on the hot meals schemes in disadvantaged schools.  That is some of the best spent money by the Department and I would love to see that service expanded.  A child who comes into school may not suffer from a lack of money in the home but a lack of organisation.  There could be parental disorganisation or failure.  Not everyone is up to speed.  Children come into school and if they can sit down to a hot meal in a social space with their friends before the start of the school day, it is a great addition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#OO00300","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":581,"content":"<p>What about the family resource centres?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#PP00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":582,"content":"<p>The Senator mentioned that to me and it merits consideration.

In the context of the structure of the Irish system, that would be difficult.  At the moment there might be a family with payments for themselves and their children, some of those payments as carers, some as payments for disability, some as payments from the HSE.  In countries like Austria, people have an account so we can see the flows of support.  Some of those supports, however, are not counted by the Department, such as education, in the same way as other countries.  This should be considered but it would be difficult in the current situation.<\/p><p>We are, however, constantly writing to recipients of child benefit to check they are still in the State and at the address that was given when the claim was made.  A case was widely publicised last week of the actor who was stealing to support his children.  From what I read, he had moved and had received at least two letters from the Department asking him to respond to demonstrate he was still entitled to child benefit.  Unfortunately he did not respond.

All fishing vessels over 12 metres in length must carry an automatically activating float-free automatic EPIRB and vessels less than 12 metres LOA (length over all) only have to carry a manually operated EPIRB.<\/ul><\/ul>However, this is focused on the vessel rather than the individual and therefore does not assist in any significant way in locating those who have gone overboard.<\/p><p> The Minister indicated in March that officials from his Department were examining, in conjunction with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, issues relating to the carriage of personal locator beacons, PLBs, by fishermen as an enhancement to existing measures.  He said they would be assessing the effectiveness of such electronic devices when used in conjunction with existing safety measures such as lifejackets and personal floatation devices.  In the seven months since this was raised in the D\u00e1il, what progress has been made on these PLB systems?<\/p><p> According to the Fishing Vessel (Personal Flotation Devices) Regulations 2001 every fishing vessel must carry a suitable personal flotation device for every person on board, and the personal flotation device must be worn at all times by the crew of the fishing vessel when on the exposed deck of the vessel, whether at sea, in harbour or coming to and from moorings.<\/p><p> A personal locator beacon, PLB, is a small transmitter that gives the position of the person but it is not as powerful as an EPIRB - the equipment for the boat itself.  A PLB is often worn like a watch by divers.  Surely it should not be too difficult for flotation devices, generally life jackets, to have PLB devices or some other form of similar system with a small device on the life jacket?  The Government should take steps to ensure that this happens, as it would save lives.  It would make it much easier for fishermen to be found in the first few hours.  As the Minister of State will know it becomes extremely difficult to locate people or bodies after 24 hours.  However, it is highly likely that they would be found within that time, and before they have sunk, and indeed could often be found within an hour or two.<\/p><p> These devices are not expensive and the Government could support their purchase.  They can cost as little as &#8364;120 before VAT.  Fishermen have argued that they could be exempt from VAT or that grant aid could be provided.  The devices can fit into a pocket, or be worn around the neck or wrist.  If fishermen had such devices on their person and if someone were to go overboard or the boat sank and the emergency crew got there within a couple of hours, they would be able to find the bodies.  It would obviously assist in locating and saving the lives of people who have gone overboard.  However, even when families experience the tragedy of the loss of a life, it can take days or weeks to locate the body - sometimes the body is never found.  If modern devices can be used to improve the systems, then tragedies such as the recent one off the coast of Union Hall and others could be avoided.<\/p><p> What steps can the Department take to assist in this regard?  We should use new advanced technology to improve the safety for fishermen.  We should have the same types of safety measures in place for fishermen as we provide for passengers in cars and aeroplanes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#PP01500","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address this issue today.  Currently all Irish-registered fishing vessels are required to be fitted with emergency indicating position beacons, EPIRBs.  All fishing vessels over 12 m in length must carry an automatically activating float-free EPIRB and vessels less than 12 m length overall only have to carry a manually operated EPIRB.  Officials from my Department are examining, in conjunction with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, issues relating to the carriage of personal locator beacons by fishermen as an enhancement to existing measures.<\/p><p>Arising from discussions last week, further work is being done by my officials in conjunction with BIM officials who work under the auspices of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, on initiatives to enhance the safety of Irish fishing vessels.  As a first priority, it is intended to incentivise the provision of automatic float-free GPS-enabled EPIRB beacons for all fishing vessels.  This will address a key safety recommendation made in a number of Marine Casualty Investigation Board reports into the loss of fishing vessels, where such a vessel beacon could have contributed significantly to rescue efforts.<\/p><p>A second priority will be to encourage the use of personal locator beacons for fishermen on all Irish-registered fishing vessels.  These personal locator beacons are designed and operated in accordance with recognised international standards and will be required to be registered with the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  It is intended that my Department will take measures with a view to making the provision of personal locator beacons and vessel beacons mandatory under appropriate legislation and my Department's code of practice for the safety of fishing vessels less than 15 m.  In implementing this initiative on personal locator beacons, provision will be made for maximum flexibility to allow for whether such beacons are separate from, or integrated into lifejackets.<\/p><p>I cannot emphasise enough the importance of wearing lifejackets at all times on the water.  Statutory requirements on the wearing of lifejackets and personal flotation devices on fishing vessels are set out in the Fishing Vessel (Personal Flotation Devices) Regulations 2001 as amended by the Fishing Vessel (Personal Flotation Devices)(Amendment) Regulations 2008.  Under the regulations, every fishing vessel is required to carry a suitable personal flotation device for every person on board.  The personal flotation device shall be worn at all times by the crew of the fishing vessel, when on the exposed deck of the vessel or, in the case of open undecked vessels, on board the vessel, whether at sea, in harbour or coming to and from moorings.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the regulations require that the skipper of a fishing vessel shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all crewmembers wear a personal flotation device in accordance with the regulations.  The Merchant Shipping Act 1992 provides that if there is a contravention of these regulations, the owner and, if the vessel is in use, the master of the vessel are each guilty of an offence and each is liable on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding \u20ac5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both.<\/p><p>The requirement for a personal flotation device to be available on-board for all crewmembers is checked as part of the safety surveys that all commercial fishing vessels are required to undertake.  The requirements for the wearing of personal flotation devices are also communicated to fishermen during these surveys.  In addition, guidance on the selection of personal flotation devices for use on board fishing vessels is conveyed through the issuing of marine notices from my Department.<\/p><p>A final important element of an integrated safety technology package for vessel beacons and for personal locator beacons will be a link to training.  My Department is working with BIM to develop appropriate training and refresher training to enable fishermen to gain maximum benefit from these technological enhancements to personal safety in the fishing industry.  It is expected to implement the new integrated package on a phased basis as part of the existing BIM fleet safety scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#QQ00200","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I welcome that, as per the Minister of State's reply, the Minister and Department intend to introduce legislation which will make personal locator and vessel beacons mandatory and further to introduce a code of practice for the safety of fishing vessels of less than 15 metres, which is a significant improvement in terms of where we were on this six months ago.  It is hoped the relevant legislation will be brought forward as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  These devices work in depths of up to 22 metres.  Some of the bodies found on, for example, the <i>Tit Bonhomme<\/i> were down about 12 m, which shows that these devices can save lives.  The Minister will have the support of Sinn F\u00e9in and, I am sure, of all other public and elected representatives in terms of the introduction of any legislation to make these devices mandatory.  This is about saving lives and ensuring people who earn a living, often in dangerous situations, are properly protected.

It is a central pillar of the Government's objective to have large numbers of those who are currently out of work gain meaningful employment as a means of rectifying our current economic crisis.  I commend the efforts made by the Government in this regard, including the increase in foreign direct investment to our shores, the introduction of an action plan for jobs, a schools building programme and significant capital spending on infrastructure, as outlined in the July stimulus plan.  However, as an Oireachtas Member for east Galway, I must focus on how Government and associated agencies can remove barriers to work for those in my constituency.  I want to ensure that all my constituents have accessibility to the workforce and that boundaries and barriers to work are eliminated by the Government.  For us to achieve anything of significance in this regard, we need to address the delay in processing of applications for Garda vetting.<\/p><p>I acknowledge and understand that the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na are providing a great service in terms of ensuring a process of quality control and that it is of the utmost importance that nothing comes between those who want to work and employment.  The fact that people are having to wait months for Garda clearance is acting as a barrier to entry into the workforce.  In my home town of Athenry, some 63 students who are studying child care, health care, nursing and social studies in Athenry vocational school, who expected to undertake work experience a number of weeks ago as part of their course, have been unable to do so in circumstances where they have yet to receive Garda clearance.  This means they are being significantly delayed in completing their courses and entering the marketplace for work.<\/p><p>Following on from my raising this issue in the Seanad yesterday, I was contacted by a self-employed man who told me he had to cease work for three weeks as he did not have the requisite Garda vetting for his business.  It is fair to say he probably endured some degree of financial hardship as a consequence.  This is a terrible indictment of our processes in Ireland and serves only to deter and discourage people from entering the workforce.  We must be mindful that students and self-employed people are the people we expect to assist us in rebuilding Ireland.  They are the ones who have not emigrated and want to work in or develop their businesses in Athenry, a town where currently 30 business units remain empty.  I am sure this situation is being replicated throughout the country.  Steps need to be taken to ensure that these delays are abated, if not eliminated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#RR00500","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Deputy Shatter.<\/p><p>The Minister is aware that apparent delays in the processing of vetting applications causes anxiety for those awaiting vetting certificates so that they can take up employment positions or voluntary roles.  Both the Garda central vetting unit in Thurles and the Minister are acutely aware of the need to minimise the turn-around time for vetting applications.  At a time when people are keen to get back into the workforce we must ensure that the vetting process does not interfere with this.<\/p><p>For the sake of clarity and to put the matter in context, I would like to outline the purpose of the vetting process.  The Garda central vetting unit provides employment vetting for approximately 20,000 organisations in Ireland which are registered with the Garda for this purpose.  These are organisations which employ persons working in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity with children and-or vulnerable adults.  The primary purpose of the process is the protection of children and vulnerable adults.  This is the paramount consideration.  The number of vetting applications received up to September 2012 is 212,558, with an expected outturn for the year of 350,000.  The number of applications dealt with during the past few years have increased, from 218,404 in 2008 to 315,100 in 2011.  Garda vetting disclosures are made to registered organisations following the signed authorisation by a vetting subject permitting the Garda central vetting unit to disclose to the registered organisation details of all prosecutions, successful or not, pending or completed and-or convictions which may be recorded in respect of him or her in the State or elsewhere.  Alternatively, the disclosure will state that there are no prosecutions or convictions recorded in respect of the person.<\/p><p>The function of the Garda central vetting unit is to make disclosure, in accordance with a written authorisation from the vetting subject, to the registered organisation.  Decisions on the suitability of the person concerned rests at all times with the recruiting organisation to which a vetting disclosure is made.  As I mentioned earlier, the vetting unit currently processes over 300,000 vetting applications per annum.  The staff of the vetting unit are to be commended for their work in reducing the processing time for vetting applications, from some 12 to 14 weeks at the time the Minister was appointed in March 2011 to between two and three weeks by May 2012.  This improvement was of enormous benefit to individuals and organisations throughout the State.  However, the number of staff in the unit decreased by 20 between March and May this year as temporary staff contracts came to an end.  This reduction in staff numbers has been partly offset by the redeployment of 15 clerical officers from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to a sub-office of the vetting unit in Ennis in May.  The new staff have, at this stage, completed their training period.  In the interim, however, processing times again increased and the current processing time vetting applications is eight weeks.  Seasonal fluctuations such as the start of the school year and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion. <\/p><p>The Garda central vetting unit, which will become the National Vetting Bureau and will have a substantially expanded role under new legislation, and the Minister are engaged in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure adequate staffing to meet these new demands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400013#RR00600","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speech","time":1351076700,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his succinct response on this matter.

Where such person also wishes to train a Gaelic or soccer team, he or she is required to make a further application for Garda vetting.  It should be possible to streamline the process and to ensure a turnaround of one or two weeks, at most.

First, this is a question of openness, transparency and accountability, of that there is no doubt.   I remember when the Competition Authority legislation was going through this House under the direction of a previous Minister, who subsequently curiously became Minister for Health, the then Deputy Mary Harney, one element that was absent from it was a competition for the post of director.  There was no provision for the advertising of the position.  I understand from recollection that I managed, by amendment, to get that rectified.<\/p><p>It is very important that we pay respect to the whole area of mental health.  This area has been sadly neglected in the past.  We have a strategy to improve this situation.  We cannot treat the post of director for mental health in any kind of offhand way.  This is a post where we need the best and we get the best by publicly advertising the position and allowing somebody to achieve that position on the basis of the strict criteria mentioned by Senator MacSharry.  <\/p><p>I assume the Minister will plead the time argument again but I do not accept the argument that was made in response to the previous amendment because, as I clearly pointed out, the Minister will be out of time anyway and so it becomes completely academic.  By the end of three years the Minister will be out of time - the previous amendment was well argued.  I do not accept the validity of the argument that what was proposed would put shackles on the Minister - far from it.  It sought to simply ensure that the deed got done and the same principle applies to this amendment. <\/p><p>The post of director of mental health is a crucial one, particularly with the levels of depression, the incidence of suicide and the condition of facilities for people who are mentally unwell in this country.  It would be very regrettable if we did not take this appointment with the utmost seriousness and do everything we can to ensure that this post is filled by the most appropriate person.  Everybody would agree that the most appropriate way of filling it is by a proper publicly advertised search.  I strongly support this amendment.  I feel very strongly about this issue.  A previous Government made a mistake at the heart of the Competition Bill and this House rectified that.  I hope that again today this House will rectify what I think is an error.  I do not believe it is malign or done in bad faith but I genuinely believe it is a serious flaw in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400015#O00600","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1351077600,"counter":615,"content":"<p>I call Senator James Gilroy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400015#O00700","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1351077600,"counter":616,"content":"<p>I thought the Acting Chairman might have been referring to my cousin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400015#O00800","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1351077600,"counter":617,"content":"<p>My apologies, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400015#O00900","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1351077600,"counter":618,"content":"<p>Nobody inside or outside the House would disagree with the sentiments in the amendment requiring that the post of a director of mental health be established.

I again make crystal clear this is not to impugn the qualifications or abilities of the person in question.  However, regardless of how good the Minister knows that person to be or how good on paper the credentials may appear, a recruitment process is laid down in the Statute Book that must be followed but it is not.  Consequently, he already has been in place as the Minister's interim figure and from henceforth, one will have this temporary little arrangement, which will last for up to three years or for God knows how long thereafter, depending presumably on who is in government.  This again weakens what the legislation is trying to achieve.  The Minister could usefully have considered this issue in more detail.  Is the issue that there were cost implications arising from a recruitment process?  Is this the reason there has been a reluctance to take the transparent route and put it out to tender?  Alternatively, is there a fear that someone better might be found than currently is in place?

In its programme for Government, the Administration proposed that all such appointments would be made through an open public process but that is not proposed in this case.  Tosach maith leath na hoibre and while a good start is half the job, the Minister has not made a good start in this regard.  He has gone completely against the programme for Government.

In the case of all the people appointed over the years, I am sure the Ministers concerned thought the country was lucky to have them.  However, that is not the point, which is that these appointments are supposed to be taken out of the political process.

While the first director general will be appointed by the Minister, subsequent directors general will be appointed by the Minister following a recruitment process under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  I note that subsection (4) is not unique.  There are precedents in legislation to provide that the first person who is appointed to an office may be appointed by a Minister, as envisaged under subsection (4).  These include legislative provisions for the charities regulatory authority, the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board, the qualifications and quality assurance authority of Ireland and the National Tourism Development Authority.  In my view, the use of this provision is the most practical way to advance the new directorate arrangements.<\/p><p>In response to Senator Byrne, who claims there has been no action, there has been a lot of action.  There has been an 85% reduction in the number of people who wait a year for an inpatient procedure.  There has been a 91% reduction in the number of people who wait nine months or longer.  There has been an 18% reduction in those who wait three months or longer for an inpatient procedure.  The number of people who are obliged to endure long trolley waits is more than 16,000 smaller than was the case last year.  A stroke programme has been put in place which is saving one life a week, as well as pre-empting the need for three others to end up in long-term care per week.  A transitional care programme is being rolled out, which affords people who are older and frail a much better service in so far as they will be admitted to a specialist ward where their medical problems will be dealt with and they can commence their rehabilitation immediately.  If this will take longer than three or four days, they can move to a transitional facility in which it can continue for up to ten weeks.  Moreover, if it becomes apparent early on that they will need long-term care, such care will be available in a transitional setting until they find a place of their choice.

The section indicates the director general is not required to give an answer to any Oireachtas committee on any matter relating to the administration of the executive that is or is likely to be the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal of the State.  We believe the term &quot;likely to be&quot; is weak and this amendment asks that there should be some risk assessment of the likelihood.  We cannot have somebody refusing to answer questions with an excuse that it could be the subject of some proceedings.  We should know where the advice comes from and the risk assessment process used.  It is a technique widely used in Government bodies.<\/p><p>  Amendment No. 8 deals with what happens elsewhere in the Oireachtas where a Member feels there was a misleading response or a refusal to answer.  The Ceann Comhairle would intervene and I gather the current holder of the post sometimes does this to the assistance of Deputies, contacting Departments and indicating that a question should be answered in a more complete way.<\/p><p>  These amendments were put down before the recent incident where a person walked out of a committee.  They would protect Parliament against a defence from a person pleading an inability to answer a question because it might be the subject of proceedings elsewhere.  In such a case the person should indicate the advice and risk assessment.  It should be possible for a member of a committee to ask the Ceann Comhairle, rather than a court, to help in such matters.  The Ceann Comhairle seems to have effectively taken on this role with regard to answers given during Question Time in the D\u00e1il.  Public servants should answer questions that are asked by an Oireachtas committee or by Members.<\/p> <p>We seek to protect Parliament against almost a shrug of the shoulder and individuals saying there might be a case and, therefore, they will not answer questions.  That is significant in a Parliament and we seek to include those two protections so that Parliament finds out what is going on, including, as we on this side of the House have said, support for what the Minister is trying to reform.  Involving Parliament and parliamentarians is better than individuals saying they will not answer questions because they might be the subject of proceedings.  These are two ways to allow that to happen.  If the risk assessment shows there is a very strong chance something will appear in court or, if the Ceann Comhairle has formed the same view, the individual refusing to answer the questions has that degree of protection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400018#R01100","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351079400,"counter":660,"content":"<p>I second Senator Barrett's amendment.

It means the loss of thinking.  This is worth thinking about for a moment.  It is our capacity to think that sets us apart.  Our capacity to reason is at the core of who we are as human beings.  <i>Cogito, ergo sum<\/i>, as Descartes once said.  We have been saying it ever since because of its simple and direct truth.<\/p><p>  Each of the 42,000 people living in Ireland with dementia has a tale to tell about how his or her thinking is lost or on the way to being lost.  These people have a story to tell about how they are losing themselves.  The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS, defines dementia as:<ul>[A] word for a group of symptoms caused by disorders that affect the brain.  It is not a specific disease.  People with dementia may not be able to think well enough to do normal activities, such as getting dressed or eating.  They may lose their ability to solve problems or control their emotions.  Their personalities may change.  They may become agitated or see things that are not there.<br>Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, a group of disorders that impairs mental functioning.  At the moment, Alzheimer's is progressive and irreversible.  Abnormal changes in the brain worsen over time, eventually interfering with many aspects of brain function.  Memory loss is one of the earliest symptoms, along with a gradual decline of other intellectual and thinking abilities, called cognitive functions, and changes in personality or behaviour.<\/ul>If we consider that we have 42,000 people already struggling with dementia and best estimates suggest that the number will have risen to approximately 140,000 within a mere 30 years, it is clear that a national dementia strategy is an urgent requirement.<\/p><p>  Much money is being spent worldwide on research to cure or contain Alzheimer's disease, ranging from brain imaging techniques to identify brain changes, medications to treat the biological changes in the brain, and research to try to manage the behavioural symptoms that cause so much difficulty.  Researchers in the US have identified a particular protein that becomes toxic in the brain of someone with Alzheimer's disease and believe they may be able to develop a treatment that would go some way towards alleviating the symptoms and-or halting the progression of the condition.  We cannot wait that long for research or rely on it to save us or to stop the numbers increasing.  We must not wait.  Recently, the World Health Organization, WHO, published a document calling on countries to treat Alzheimer's disease as a public health priority.<\/p><p>  Many of us have heard stories of those with Alzheimer's disease.  Some of us have experienced it at first hand in families.  Today, 50,000 carers, especially family carers, know that they cannot wait for research to help them with the care of their loved ones.  I pay tribute to their enormous efforts, work and dedication.<\/p><p>  I note and welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to a national dementia strategy in the programme for Government.  Many matters are vying for the attention of the Cabinet, but these statistics are well known.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State and his colleagues know the urgency of the matter.<\/p><p>I urge that the development of that strategy place dementia not just in a medical context, but in a societal context, where those who have dementia live, because of the impact it has on family and friends.  There is a need for a response from society to those with the condition.  Even if researchers could in the morning conjure up great new drugs, they will never replace the need for a strategy.  A lack of strategy will always imply a more haphazard and less efficient approach, even with the best will in the world, and there is plenty of really good will out there, banging the drum for better care and treatment.<\/p><p>The strategy will only work if the medical aspect is combined with joined-up thinking that comes from placing this very firmly in a societal context.  The national dementia strategy will require a whole-of-government approach.  It may fall in the lap of the Minister of State to drive it but reaching out to other key Departments, including those dealing with housing, transport and health, among others, and to voluntary organisations who do so much, will be the way to make it succeed.<\/p><p>What might a strategy look like?  Specifically, a strategy needs to offer common standards of care for dementia.  Those standards need to be derived from clinicians, experts, academics, voluntary groups and those with experience of dementia and the care of dementia.  Ensuring that those with dementia are part of the solution is key to making any strategy work.  It will also ensure that their dignity is at the core of the strategy.  Person-centred care - long espoused by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland - should remain central to the strategy, and the strategy must also ensure rights to treatment.  Carers and those with dementia must be treated with dignity and the standards need to reflect that.<\/p><p>The strategy needs to urge a move away from high cost, long-term care to community-based services in which those with dementia and their families have a role to play, as many do now, although not in an organised, recognised and strategic way.  Early diagnosis will be key to making this model succeed and it should be central to shift treatment away from an over-reliance on drugs.  Continued research into dementia should form part of any strategy, as should the good management of all data relating to the care of those with dementia.  The strategy should urge the appointment of a clinical director within the HSE with specific responsibility for dementia, and there should be specific training of staff, who work with those with dementia, and who should improve their knowledge and skills.  It should also recognise in particular the needs of those with early-onset dementia and address their needs.<\/p><p>A budget ring-fenced for the care of dementia would be ideal.  As it stands, the budget is not ring-fenced and the true cost implications of treating dementia in Ireland are not currently known.  Estimates suggest that \u20ac1.4 billion is spent directly and indirectly on the care of Alzheimer's disease.  The strategy is not a call for a budget but it should rather motivate a whole-of-government rethink which must include gathering the data that gives not just the cost of care, but the way in which care is delivered and the impact of that care.  We must seek ways to spend resources more carefully and efficiently.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the work being done for the national positive ageing strategy, and I am confident that the obvious overlap between these two strategies will benefit both.  The forthcoming capacity legislation will form another vital pillar of support for people with dementia and many others too, including those with intellectual disabilities and acquired brain injury.  Ireland has already signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities but to ratify we must move to this legislation very quickly.<\/p><p>The basis for the legislation must be the &quot;will and preferences&quot; of those directly affected and people with dementia or any other condition or injury must have the right not to have their decision-making skills interfered with or reduced as they currently are on a daily basis.  Remarkably, the 1871 Lunacy Act is still with us.  It is time to jettison it and the production of a national dementia strategy would be a good time to send the signal to herald in the capacity Act, which would encourage and promote people making their own decisions or, where necessary, supported decisions.<\/p><p>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland in particular has done sterling work over many years and its national conference is taking place tomorrow.  I welcome the opportunity to speak to this very important motion, which fundamentally is to underline the urgency of this strategy for the thousands who are affected and the many thousands who will be affected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400022#V00300","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351081800,"counter":713,"content":"<p>I second the motion.

It has started to work, by way of a review, on dementia in our society.  Senator O'Keeffe has provided a very detailed outline of the position in this country.  I will take a different perspective, which is from personal experience.  Anybody who has seen the effect of Alzheimer's disease in a family member or a close friend will know it is probably one of the worst conditions anybody could have the misfortune to encounter.<\/p><p>Currently in this country there is, unfortunately, almost an unwillingness to accept that the initial problems with Alzheimer's disease exist.  We can end up with cases where the problem has gone too far, and the only solution in such cases is acceptance by family and the affected person, if the person is capable of it.  That leads to nursing homes or long-stay hospital cases.<\/p><p>We must ensure that we put a strategy in place, and we will begin work on that very soon.  The strategy must deal with a number of specific elements, including prevention, delaying the illness, early diagnosis and awareness within communities that people may have symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.  People must be aware of this, and much good work has been done by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and various other groups around the country.  We are getting to grips with the issue but we must put such work into the strategy, along with a care management element.  We must bring services out into the community and examine residential care as part of the strategy.  The strategy for dealing with Alzheimer's disease must be completely transformative.<\/p><p>This Government has the willingness to act.  We hear about budgets every day of the week which relate to every government item but a budget must be ring-fenced for this issue.  As I stated earlier, it is probably one of the worst illnesses that anybody could encounter.  I welcome the Minister of State's presence and await the rest of the debate.

I wish him well in his post.  I am from County Roscommon, which has the highest rate of dementia <i>per capit<\/i>a in the country.  At a recent conference on dementia, it was estimated that 4,000 people in the country will be diagnosed every year with the condition.<\/p><p>  I have worked with an organisation called Western Alzheimers for a number of years and its biggest difficulty - a lack of funding - arises from the fact that it already deals with 381 families in Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.  Home care packages are key to this.  I bat for those three counties because that is the area where the association operates.<\/p> <p>It is crucial there are no funding cuts to home care packages in those areas, in particular in my area, for which I have just given the figures, because we have the highest rate<i>per capita<\/i>.<\/p><p> I am a big supporter of Western Alzheimers and have raised funds for it.  Part of its service delivery is to raise funds to deliver a service, but we are going through hard times and people do not have the money any more to contribute as much as they would like to.  I have always complimented people who have always given to good causes, even in hard times.  It is crucial that Government funding is put in place and that there are not cuts to home care packages.<\/p><p> I refer to the community employment schemes.  They have no difficulty getting approval for CE employees but they have difficulty finding people to do the work.  Many lone parents, who were allowed to keep their lone parents allowance and get a community employment allowance, were taking up those jobs and were very complimentary of them.  That facility has been taken away and they must depend entirely on CE money.  Community employment schemes are therefore finding it very difficult to get CE workers.<\/p><p> On the economics of not funding home care packages and respite services and putting people into high dependency beds in selected nursing homes, not every nursing home can deal with dementia patients.  Given the small cost we are talking about, it makes economic sense to keep these people at home with the services the likes of Western Alzheimers provide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400023#W00500","speaker":"1161","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351082400,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him.  It was very moving listening to Senators O'Keeffe, Landy and Kelly speaking about this frightful disease.  I fought to maintain the public nursing home in Crooksling, which is close to Tallaght.  We got a reprieve from the Minister, Deputy Reilly, but it was my first experience of seeing 80 patients, who suffer from Alzheimer's, in one long room.  It was a horrific experience and it brought me back to reality.  This issue should be addressed.  If one has not dealt with people who have Alzheimer's, it is very difficult to empathise with the situation.<\/p><p>Some of my colleagues know that, in 2006, I produced a policy document, A New Approach to Ageing and Ageism, and it gives me pleasure to support this Labour Party motion.  I was honoured to be asked by Deputy Martin to produce the Fianna F\u00e1il policy document on older people, active ageing and quality care.  It is a Fianna F\u00e1il policy paper to promote the human potential of, and human rights for, older Irish citizens.<\/p><p>Over six months, during the course of my extensive research for the preparation of this document, I learned a great deal about the afflictions and issues which face elderly citizens every day.  Dementia is an extremely distressing condition for those who suffer from it, and it causes much anguish and pain to their families and close friends.  The situation presents a problem of great magnitude and a formidable challenge to health and social services.<\/p><p>The shocking fact is that, currently, roughly 41,700 people in Ireland suffer from dementia, more than 26,000 of whom live at home.  What is even more shocking is that, every year, approximately 4,000 new cases arise.  This is a clear indicator that we must, as a matter of urgency, put provisions in place within our health system to tackle this terrifying epidemic.  There are no signs of this growing problem abating.  It is estimated that a major increase in the number of people with dementia is likely to occur after 2021, with the numbers growing to between 141,000 and 147,000 by 2041.<\/p><p>When one considers that dementia costs more than cancer, heart disease and stroke combined, at a current cost of \u20ac1.6 billion per annum, it is clear that this is a severe issue which could cripple an already damaged health system.  An emphasis must be placed, therefore, on the development of co-ordinated, multi-layered and well-resourced services which will be responsible to the individual needs of people with dementia and those who care for them.<\/p><p>Fianna F\u00e1il outlined the complexity and range of issues involved in the effective management of dementia in the 1999 action plan for dementia.  Following the publication of this report, community supports were enhanced and increased levels of funding were made available to develop a wide range of community services, including community nursing, paramedic and home help services, and support to family carers.  During our time in office, enormous strides were made in the concept and practice of services for older people as we took the view that there was an intimate link between the care of older people and that of people with dementia.<\/p><p>The need to provide support and dignity and independence through the provision of the appropriate people and carers was heavily stressed during our time in office.  The Government must make the dramatic changes which are clearly needed to aid the 41,700 people suffering from dementia, to halt the inevitable growth of this affliction and to help the countless family members and close friends who incur most of the responsibility of care, which is nothing short of a disgrace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400024#X00200","speaker":"1156"},{"type":"speech","time":1351082400,"counter":719,"content":"<p>It is great to see all-party support for this vital motion.

It must be his fourth or fifth time here.  He obviously liked the Seanad when he was a Member, so he is welcome back.<\/p><p>This issue is of exceptional importance in that 42,000 of our citizens, primarily, the citizens who built up this country and gave it the character and integrity it has, are at either the early or advanced stages of this condition.  The effects of the condition and its different strands have been articulated very well.  This motion is a re-affirmation of the Government's commitment to deal with this issue head on.<\/p><p>I am very heartened having listened to Senator Mary White's contribution.  I remember in a previous capacity she produced a policy document on older people which highlighted and added to the debate on this issue.  That work has not gone unnoticed.<\/p><p>I welcome the fact the national dementia strategy is at an advanced stage.  I understand the public consultation process has been completed successfully and the Minister and his people are analysing the submissions with a view to setting up a working group.  I hope we will have a national strategy in 2013, which is the commitment.  The only way we can deal with this is by having a professional national strategy which is well thought out, well researched and, most important, funded.  There are a number of areas for which we need to ring-fence funding and this is one of them because, with our ageing population, we are looking at an increase of 4,000 to 5,000 per year in the number of people suffering from dementia.  We need to take cognisance of that and direct action towards it.  This Government is 20 months into its time in office and I have no doubt that, by 2017, the end of its time in office, we will be well on the way to at least having the support structures and basic requirements in place for people who find themselves suffering from this condition.<\/p><p>I am keenly aware of the fact that preparation of the mental capacity legislation is at an advanced stage.  It will revolutionise the way people with mental health conditions are treated.<\/p> <p>The legislation dealing with capacity goes back to the 1860s when Gladstone was the Prime Minister of England and Ireland and Queen Victoria was in power.  That signifies how dated it is.  There is a great deal happening under the radar in this area within Government, which does not receive the media attention it deserves.  In 2013, Ireland will hold the EU Presidency for six months and a national dementia strategy together with mental capacity legislation will be published.  All this will feed into the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.  Would it not be great for our country if we could ratify the convention during our EU Presidency in the first six months of next year?  That is an achievable goal and there is no reason we cannot achieve it.  It would enshrine our presidency in European history for the right reason, which is for looking after the most vulnerable in our society.<\/p><p>I attended a meeting with the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sean Sherlock, prior to the debate about a UN declaration for people with print disabilities.  Currently, they only have access to 5% of the books the rest of society can access.  If Members walked into Easons and 95% of the shelves were empty, they would walk out because of the lack of choice.  That is what faces almost 300 million citizens throughout the world.  Significant work is ongoing to come up with a treaty to deal with the issue of copyright and intellectual property which is choking access to literature for people with print disabilities.  I spoke to the Minister of State earlier and a serious meeting will take place on 19 November.  Hopefully, the Irish delegation will have an input to ensure a treaty, which will deal with the intellectual property minefield, is advanced during our Presidency.  There is a great deal happening.  The Government is committed to the most vulnerable in our society and we are trying to do this professionally and inclusively in the most appalling economic circumstances to ensure that we embrace a wide church and that the most vulnerable are not alone looked after, but can advocate regarding their needs in a respectful fashion.  We are trying to ensure all the interest groups, some of whom are represented in the Visitors Gallery are brought along.  Amnesty International held a good event yesterday at which the chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality spoke.<\/p><p>I commend my Labour Party colleagues on the motion.  While we should not even have to have these discussions, it is important to put them on the record of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I acknowledge the input from Fianna F\u00e1il and Senator Mary White.  While this is not a party political issue, it is a political issue and we need to make significant advances in the next 12 to 18 months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400024#X00300","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351083000,"counter":721,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I thank my Labour Party colleagues for tabling the motion.  It is great that there is harmony in the House as everyone welcomes the initiatives and strategies to deal with mental capacity legislation, dementia, Alzheimer's and positive ageing.  I would like to move beyond words and explore ways we can make the issues before us tangible.  We can all say these words but we all know action speaks louder than words.<\/p><p>I would like two issues to be fed into the national dementia strategy before it is published.  First, expert opinion is that earlier and accurate diagnosis is important, as colleagues have said, for the individual but also for family members because of what such a diagnosis will deliver for them and it is imperative that coming out of the implementation of the strategy, resources will be put in place or reconfigured that will result in a nationwide health service, which provides timely diagnosis and provision for early intervention supports and services.  A crucial component of this will be access to a uniform assessment of needs for both the patient and their carer.  My understanding is that the HSE is piloting a single assessment tool, which will need to be such that it provides the necessary early indication of the onset of a dementia and acts as an early detection mechanism which leads on to the necessary follow up of interventions and support services.<\/p><p>Currently, the first port of call for most patients who present themselves to our health service with possible symptoms of a dementia is at GP level.  Making a diagnosis of dementia is not easy and Irish research, including anecdotal evidence from my local GP, has shown that many GPs, like their counterparts in other countries, are reluctant to get involved in the area because of lack of confidence and training, stigma, difficulties differentiating normal ageing from the signs and symptoms of dementia and resource issues.  There is a requirement, therefore, to ensure all health care officials at GP, primary care or residential care levels are skilled in the detection and diagnosis of dementia and are suitably equipped with the necessary people skills to handle the delivery of the diagnosis to patients and their families.<\/p><p>The second issue relates to community-based services.  Following on from the early diagnosis of dementia and consistent with the Department of Health\u2019s stated policy to shift the emphasis of care back into community settings, there is a need to ensure these settings are age and dementia friendly.  Access to clinical dementia experts at local community levels will form the basis of key community services for those with dementia and their carers.  People who need and receive community care, whether through home help, respite, home care packages, hospice and palliative care services, value these supports enormously.  However, access is discretionary, unequal and problematic.  The root of this issue is the lack of legislation to underpin access to these services.  There is no statutory entitlement to home care and community care services.  Since access is discretionary, it is extremely difficult for individuals, families and carers to get information and reliable access at critical points for example at discharge from hospital, onset of disability, diagnosis of dementia, long-term or life-limiting illness.  I agree with the Ombudsman who observes that &quot;people do not know where they stand in terms of their entitlements and in terms of the HSE\u2019s obligations to provide services&quot;.  I also support the call made by Older and Bolder for the inclusion, as part of a national dementia strategy, of the development of long-promised legislation to establish a clear right to community care.  Only this can provide the clarity and security to individuals and families.<\/p><p>I stress that I welcome this motion and I recognise the Government\u2019s achievements in this area such as the publication of the national carers strategy in 2012, which was broadly welcomed by carers groups as an aspirational document that provides a solid basis for informing future policy decisions.  However, I also note the reaction from some groups I work with in the areas in question that a motion such as this is nothing more than a series of platitudes unless accompanied by action such as the tangible recognition of the vital work carried out by family carers.  While 50,000 carers are responsible for Alzheimer's and dementia patients, 137,000 other carers look after other people with disabilities spanning all age groups from children to the elderly.  Recognition of their work can be shown by the provision of adequate and ring-fenced resources, including payments to carers, which should not be seen as income supports but as direct supports for their caring duties.<\/p><p>We are all conscious that we are approaching budget 2013.  The Minister for Social Protection recently gave us assurances that core benefits will be protected but we are still wondering what are core benefits?  For example, is the half rate carers allowance a core benefit?   I refer to the funding sources for carers, which include the Department of Social Protection, which covers benefits and allowance; the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which administers the housing adaptation grant; and the Department of Health, which deals with hospital and respite care.  When I consider this, I wonder whether the citizen or the Government is at the centre of policy, as he or she must constantly run around.  He or she has to be assessed several times before a decision on his or her care and he or she must repeatedly go through his or her family history.<\/p> <p>I wonder if we can reconfigure resources to put the patient and the carer at the centre, so that we do not waste resources.<\/p><p>Capacity legislation is mentioned and I support the idea of doing more.  I advise the Minister to read the document prepared by 15 stakeholder organisations on essential principles of Irish legal capacity.  Advanced care directives are legal in Ireland but do not enjoy statutory footing.  It is important that people in an already disempowered position, facing dementia or the onset of Alzheimer's among many capacity diminishing conditions, are not further disempowered by uncertainty about whether their health care wishes will be respected.  The Minister for Health provided an answer on 8 June to the effect that advanced care directives are not on a statutory footing.  Can we get clarification from the Department of Health and the Department of Justice and Equality to work in a co-ordinated fashion to ensure a section on direct care directives will be inserted into the forthcoming capacity legislation?<\/p><p>I commend the community-based project of the Irish Hospice Foundation, Think Ahead, currently being piloted in Louth and Limerick.  It encourages people to think about, discuss and record their preferences for future care.  Advanced care directives are an issue we must talk about in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400025#Y00200","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351083600,"counter":723,"content":"<p>I commend the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il Senators, the Independent Senators nominated by the Taoiseach, on the all-party agreement on the motion.  Although I will support the motion, I have a small quibble with one sentence in it, as I wonder whether it despairs too much: \"[T]hat strategy recognises the societal rather than the medical context of dementia and Alzheimer's\".  Would there not be a high return on research when we consider the cost of \u20ac1.6 billion and the 42,000 people affected by it?  There is a large research budget and it seems to be a priority to see what we can come up with and whether we can form links with exercise, drugs, diet, the environment, lifestyle, counselling and positive mental health.  We all get older and it is not an illness.  It will happen to us and, not to medicalise it unnecessarily, we have a very large drugs industry with which the Department negotiates.  There is some relationship there and we give them a good price.  Do they have international research that might help the Department?  Can we head it off by the appropriate medical treatment and research?<\/p><p>Ireland has a particular problem, as Senator Kelly said.  Social studies research reflects the heavy rate of institutionalisation in the past.  There were huge mental hospitals in Ballinasloe and Mullingar.  Are we too deeply in that tradition or are there more positive ways of dealing with it?  What would follow if the Minister and his Mediterranean colleagues got together?  Countries in the Mediterranean seem to treat old age differently and there may be some hope in that.<\/p><p>Senator Mary White is proposing legislation to abolish compulsory retirement.  Can we use research, intelligence, contacts with the drugs industry and the Minister's contacts with Mediterranean countries and eastern Europe so that we do not have to deal with dreadful consequences for patients and relatives?  In places like Georgia, people live very long lives and do not experience these problems.  Rather than accepting that there will be these sick people and having to provide them with accommodation care, should we refuse to accept it as inevitable?<\/p><p>I asked people in alternative medicine whether the decline of old people could be arrested and they responded that it would be very difficult.  Perhaps there is some hope and scope in the large research budget of the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sherlock.  There may be a return to shifting some of it and getting into the best international research where this is a problem.  This will help the Minister to cater for disasters that happen to people and their families but to try to head some of them off before they happen and take preventative measures to promote positive mental health.  We would support the Minister under such circumstances, as I support this motion.  The motion contains a tinge of accepting this as inevitable and perhaps we can find scope to assist the Minister so that it is not inevitable and we can combat the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400026#Z00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1351083600,"counter":724,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire go dt\u00ed an Teach.

A research review for Ireland's national dementia strategy was presented to the Minister for Health and published in January.  A summary of its key findings are set out.  The next stage set out the publication and consultation process and the closing date for submissions was 31 August.  Officials are examining the responses.  I am trying to get the action group working as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The HSE provides a range of services for people with dementia, including primary care services, home support services, daycare, respite, housing with care and continuing care services.  Carer support groups have been established across the country.  There are approximately 42,000 people with dementia in Ireland, which is a substantial population.  Some 26,000 of them live at home.  I had the experience with my late father, God be good to him, who died when he was 93 years old.  We cared for him in his home for as long as we could.  At one stage, he had to go into the local nursing home for three weeks and every single day he wanted to be at home and to die at home.<\/p><p>A major increase in the number of Irish people with dementia is expected, due to our ageing population.  Numbers are expected to increase to 147,000.  Our strategy must be far-seeing over the coming 30 or 40 years, a crucial period.  The cost of dementia is approximately \u20ac1.69 billion per year, as stated by Senator Mary White.  There is no doubt that cost will increase and we should allow for the anticipated costs and the anticipated population increase for those with dementia.<\/p> <p>Recently I read, I hope I am correct, that it costs approximately \u20ac40,000 per annum.  I am not complaining about the cost.  These people have made significant contributions to the country for 60 or 70 years and we must look after them.  Somebody mentioned early diagnosis.  In the case of my father I honestly did not see it happening.  He was a man who was active, walked, read and kept up to date with everyday occurrences and suddenly it happened.  One will probably say it will happen to every aged person but that is not the way it should be.  <\/p><p>The recent review suggests that community services in Ireland are underdeveloped, inequitable and fragmented with only a small proportion of people with dementia availing of critical services, day care, public health, nursing home, care packages, respite, etc.  As already stated, a greater number of those people want to live at home.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400026#Z00300","speaker":"1138","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351084200,"counter":726,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I commend Labour Party Senators for tabling a motion which has strong sentiments which I fully support.  It is encouraging when Government representatives have an opportunity to table motions in Private Members' time, that they have substance and deal with important issues.  I am impressed by the wording of the motion which I do not think anybody in opposition could have framed any differently.  I am pleased to pledge my party's wholehearted support to the motion.  Government and Opposition parties have called for a positive ageing strategy and a national dementia strategy for many years.  In the past a number of joint motions were supported by Sinn F\u00e9in and the Labour Party which called for the implementation of these strategies.<\/p><p>In the other House last week, Sinn F\u00e9in used its Private Members' time to table a motion on home help and home care services.  One of the elements of the motion was the call for the national dementia strategy to be ratified before the end of 2013 and likewise a national positive ageing strategy.  That is something we called for during a constructive engagement with representatives of older people and older people themselves through the Seanad Public Consultation Committee on the rights of older persons which took place in this Chamber.  A report was published which the Minister should take on board when examining this area as it dealt with a whole range of issues which affect older people.  In the motion we supported proposals relating to quality standards for home care packages, health statistics audits for community care, a greater degree of flexibility in respect of carer's allowance and clarity on entitlements for older people.  <\/p><p>The Seanad Public Consultation Committee report also sought that the whole area of wardship be revised.  I emphasise this concept is out of date and is no longer fit for purpose as it fails to respect the humanity of those who find themselves subject to wardship.  The scheme which was set up under the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871 effectively means that decisions are made for people without their consultation.  I was contacted by Diarmuid Hanifin of Amnesty International, who is in the Visitors' Gallery, as I am sure all Senators were as part of our preparation for the debate on the issue.  It is appropriate to raise the issue in the context of the motion.  I concur with Amnesty International in its analysis that only when all attempts at supports are exhausted should decisions be taken on somebody's behalf.  <\/p><p>In 2007 Ireland signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  To ratify the convention, our capacity legislation needs to be brought into compliance with international human rights law.  Article 12 of the UN convention requires that persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with everybody else and if people need support to make decisions they should get it.  In order to comply with international human rights law, any new capacity law which the Minister for Health or, perhaps, the Minister for Justice and Equality may bring forward must reflect this ethos and also set out a statutory framework for supports.  The ramifications of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities are clear.  Ireland needs to move away from guardianship and assessment of mental capacity to assessment of how people can be supported to make decisions.  That must be the basis of any principle which should underpin any reform of the capacity legislation.   Amnesty International has also advanced a number of points that should be taken into consideration when bringing forward any such capacity legislation.  It is clear that the capacity legislation and the Mental Health Act 2001 should complement each other.  The 2001 Act was supposed to provide for a rights-based approach.  However, this has been suppressed, to some extent, by its interpretation and emphasis on paternalism. <\/p><p>There are a number of other points I wish to make but it is not possible to do that in six minutes.   Sometimes motions which are well intentioned - this is a good motion - can wring hollow when set against other decisions made, such as reducing 1 million home help hours which people need.  I am sure there is no public representative who has not been contacted by individuals who have been affected by the cuts in home help.  We could argue rightly that cuts in this area are socially wrong because of their impact.  This is an era when we need to make savings and to interpret the outcomes of decisions made.  It is clear from my analysis, at least, and an analysis of all the groups who represent older people and people with disabilities that cuts to these areas while they might reduce spend in one area, increase spend in other areas.<\/p><p>Senator van Turnhout made the point that community care and caring for people in the home is meant to be the cornerstone of Government policy.  If supports in the home are taken away there is a danger that will lead to people going into nursing homes and private nursing homes resulting in subvention and all the ancillary costs.  While that is a possibility, it must be borne in mind when we make adjustments, cuts and savings.  If we are saving on one part of spending, are we increasing spending in another area as a consequence of the action being taken?  I reiterate my full support for the motion.  It is one of the best motions I have seen from the Government in terms of substance and I am pleased to give it my enthusiastic support.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400027#AA00200","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1351084200,"counter":727,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400027#AA00300","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1351084200,"counter":728,"content":"<p>I thank Senators for the opportunity to address the motion on mental capacity legislation and dementia.  It is encouraging and gratifying to note the level of agreement across the House in respect of the issues dealt with in the motion.  It was tabled initially by my colleagues in the Labour Party, supported by Fine Gael colleagues in government, the Taoiseach's nominees, Fianna F\u00e1il, Sinn F\u00e9in and Independent Senators, all of whom have stated their strong support not just for the sentiments but the commitments and necessary actions that are required to be taken in the context of this challenging area.  The level of cross-party support is encouraging as is the level of engagement with the debate, and the insights various Members have brought to it, in some instances from a personal experience, are always important.  For example, Senator Barrett, who was never without an insight in respect of any of these matters, pointed to the importance of research and evidence that our policy making should be based on evidence.<\/p> <p>It is extremely important that such research should be done in so far as it is possible.  I believe Senator Barrett also made the point about prevention and the broader holistic view of the health-care system.  We should not simply regard our strategy as one of reaction to an emerging problem an individual has, but it should be, as it were, a whole-of-life strategy.  Certainly an element of our health-care strategy should not be based simply on reacting to people who become ill, but to have ways and strategies for anticipating that and the system responding to it in so far as it is possible for us.<\/p><p> On coming into office the Government made a firm commitment in the programme for national recovery to introduce a mental capacity Bill that is in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The mental capacity Bill will reform the law in respect of adults who are vulnerable in the sense that they may lack some or all capacity to make important decisions for themselves.  It will modernise the law on capacity, some of which dates back 200 years, and will bring Irish capacity legislation into line with current thinking and modern legislative frameworks worldwide.  The purpose of the Bill is to put in place a comprehensive legal framework to support adults who do not have full decision-making capability.  This covers a wide spectrum, ranging from people with dementia to persons with intellectual disabilities or acquired brain injuries.<\/p><p> In summary, the Bill will: reform legislation protecting adults who, owing to intellectual disability, illness or accident, are unable to make decisions for themselves or exercise their legal capacity; provide a new understanding of mental capacity based upon a time-specific and issue-specific, functional approach; replace the wards of court system which is the existing mechanism for managing the affairs of persons who lack decision making capacity; progress the process towards ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which was signed by Ireland on 30 March 2007; and give effect to the Hague Convention on the International Protection of Adults.  The statutory guiding principles underpinning every support or intervention made in regard to persons lacking capacity will reflect the UN convention principles of respecting the dignity and the autonomy of each individual person, including the freedom to make his or her own choices.<\/p><p> In the drafting of the Bill careful attention has been given to putting in place safeguards to protect vulnerable adults from exploitation.  In particular, the Bill will contain detailed provisions for the supervision of personal guardians of adults lacking capacity and also of donees of enduring powers of attorney.  The Government legislation programme indicates that the Bill is expected to be published in this session.<\/p><p> Our health services are caring for an ageing population with varying needs and conditions including dementia, which is a progressive condition that not only has a huge impact on the physical, psychological and emotional state of the person with dementia, but also on their families and carers.  We all want to see people given more opportunities to live full and meaningful lives on their own terms.  It is vital that people with dementia are not defined by the disease.  We must remember that with the correct supports in place, people can live full and active lives even after a diagnosis.<\/p><p> There is no doubt that society is enriched by the positive participation of all its members and our objective is to have a society where those at risk of social exclusion are fully integrated into their local communities, and are supported to participate to their full potential within those communities.  Government policy aims to support people with dementia to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  I am confident that there is common agreement across the House with this philosophy.<\/p><p> The programme for Government makes a clear commitment to develop a national strategy for dementia by 2013.  It is worth quoting this commitment, because I take the point made by Senator Cullinane and others that while a motion is very important and can focus our thinking, commitment and engagement, what is really important at the end of the day is what flows from the commitments given and the action taken.  The programme for Government states:<ul><ul>We will develop a national Alzheimer's and other dementias strategy by 2013 to increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention, and development of enhanced community based services.  This strategy will be implemented over five years.<\/ul><\/ul> I believe we can all agree that relevant and accurate research is a key ingredient in ensuring that policy development is proactive as opposed to reactive and avoids crisis-driven service delivery into the future.  The first stage of the process was to assemble the research evidence upon which the policy will be developed.  This body of work was completed in January when the report entitled Creating Excellence in Dementia Care: A Research Review for Ireland's National Dementia Strategy was presented to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.<\/p><p> At present, it is estimated that more than 41,000 people living in Ireland have dementia.  The pressing need for a strategy on dementia is best understood in the context of projected increases in the number of people with this disease reaching between 141,000 and 147,000 by 2041.  We obviously need to plan for this significant increase and the resulting demands on our health services in the future.<\/p><p> The review has estimated the overall cost associated with dementia in Ireland to be almost &#8364;1.7 billion per annum, with 48% of this figure representing informal care provided by family and friends and a further 43% representing residential long-stay care costs for those living with dementia in the community.  This research highlights the primary importance of the role that families and communities play in affecting the environment of care for people with dementia.<\/p><p> Among the key elements arising from the research which need to be considered in light of the strategy are: enhancing public awareness about dementia; increasing the numbers of early diagnoses; and introducing measures to improve quality of life and quality of care for those with dementia.  These and other key elements will influence the development of the strategy.  It is important to acknowledge the hard work and commitment invested by the advisory committee that guided and oversaw this research.  It provides a solid foundation and clear framework within which to achieve our objectives.<\/p><p> The next stage of the process involved a public consultation process and the closing date for submissions was 31 August.  The Department sought the views of interested parties, whether individuals or organisations, to help inform the development of the strategy, with a particular request to hear the views of those directly affected by Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, including people who have been diagnosed with one of these conditions, and their families and carers.<\/p><p> I am pleased to say that we received more than 70 responses to the call for submissions.  Submissions were received from individuals, representative organisations, family carers and health-care professionals.  I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to those who participated.  These contributions will serve as a platform for discussion and will further inform the development of the overall strategy.  The next step will see the establishment of a working group to develop the strategy fully in 2013.<\/p><p> The central focus of service provision must always be that it is person-centred, a point made by Senator O'Keeffe at the outset of the debate.  We need to recognise, respect and support the individual, and ensure that we keep them and their families at the very centre of all decisions and decision making.<\/p><p> The Health Service Executive provides a range of services for people with dementia including primary care services, in which I have a particular interest, involvement and lead role; home support services; day care; respite and continuing care services.  These services are delivered through the HSE's network of local offices, via public health nursing, day-care centres and public and private residential care facilities and, where appropriate, psychiatry of old age teams.  The HSE also funds non-governmental agencies, for example, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, Caring for Carers Ireland, and Western Alzheimers.<\/p> <p>A limited number of memory clinics and specialist services are available.  Respite care is the most commonly requested service and is provided in a number of ways, including the provision of a home care package to support respite in a person's home or day respite within dementia specific or generic day care centres.  Respite is also provided in residential homes.  In addition, care or support groups have been established throughout the country, details of which can be obtained from individual local primary care teams.<\/p><p>I would like to acknowledge in particular the magnificent and impressive role played over so many years by the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, which this year is celebrating 30 years of representing the needs and interests of dementia patients and their carers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400027#AA00400","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351085400,"counter":731,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400029#CC00200","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1351085400,"counter":732,"content":"<p>The society has grown over the years to become a professional nationwide charity, with a network of regional branches, staff and volunteers providing a range of services, including home care, day care, support homes, respite care and social clubs.<\/p><p>We have had the opportunity in recent months of launching a number of initiatives.  The HSE has entered into a service level agreement with the Genio Trust to develop and test new service models with a view to improving the range of community-based supports for people with dementia, to influence public policy and investment in the area and to build leadership in the field.  The total cost of these projects is in the region of \u20ac4.3 million.  Atlantic Philanthropies has generously provided \u20ac2.3 million, with the remainder provided by the Health Service Executive.<\/p><p>Four dementia projects were selected earlier this year.  The successful demonstration sites are located in Mayo, Kinsale, south Tipperary and D\u00fan Laoghaire.  The outcomes from each project will be evaluated and learning disseminated beyond the demonstration sites to the wider system, and to inform future operational policies of the HSE.  These are terrific examples of good ideas and good practice, which seek to move away from a situation where, too often, the service user had to fit into the service being provided to others in the local area to one where the service user is the key stakeholder in service design at the outset.<\/p><p>As we know, currently, there is no cure for dementia and people can live a long life with the illness.  In this regard, we acknowledge that their needs and those of their families and carers increase as the disease progresses.  Carers are vital to the success of Government policy in relation to older people, children and adults with an illness or a disability.  I am fully aware that every day in this country tens of thousands of family members, friends, partners, parents, children or neighbours provide care for someone who, through a variety of circumstances, is in need of that care.  The Government is under no illusion in relation to the challenges that carers face every day.  This is why the Taoiseach committed to developing the national carers' strategy, which was launched in July of this year.  The strategy sets the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided by Departments and agencies for carers.<\/p><p>The national carers strategy is the first of its kind to be developed in recognition of the invaluable role and contribution of carers in Ireland.  It places carers firmly on the national agenda and sets the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided by Departments and agencies for Irish carers.  It sets out a vision to work towards and an ambitious set of national goals and objectives to guide policy development and service delivery to ensure carers feel valued and supported to manage their caring responsibilities with confidence and are empowered to have a life of their own outside of caring.  I take this opportunity to recognise and acknowledge the level of dedication and commitment which carers show to their loved ones every day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400029#CC00300","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1351085400,"counter":733,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400029#CC00400","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1351085400,"counter":734,"content":"<p>In this, the European Year for Active Ageing, I am keenly aware of the importance of positive ageing not alone for each of us as individuals but also for our communities and society as whole.  The Government acknowledges the need to better recognise the position of older people in society.  The programme for Government has committed to completing and implementing the national positive ageing strategy in order that older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live independent full lives.  The strategy will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland and sets out a common framework for the development of operational plans by a number of Departments, clearly setting out each Department's objectives relating to older people.  Mechanisms designed to monitor the implementation of measures contained in operational plans will also be included in the strategy.  It is not envisaged, however, that the strategy will propose new service developments.  Rather, it will set the strategic direction for future policies, programmes and services for older people in Ireland.<\/p><p>A considerable amount of preparatory work has been completed.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, who is the lead Minister in this area, intends to bring a draft strategy to Government in the final quarter of 2012.  I reiterate that the development of a national dementia strategy is a priority for this Government.  The research that was carried out earlier this year highlighted the primary importance of the role that families and communities play in the environment of care for people with dementia.  The financial cost, to which I alluded, is only one aspect of the overall costs.  Non-economic costs include the social, emotional and psychological strain the illness confers on people with dementia and their carers.  While I cannot at this stage pre-empt the findings of the working group that will develop the dementia strategy, having commissioned the research review and engaged in a public consultation, I can assure Senators that we are listening to what everyone has to say, including Members of this and the Lower House and outside interests across the board.  We are committed to examining all options and views put forward in this context.  I am confident this House will help inform our deliberations.  Senators can rest assured their recommendations, and insights provided by colleagues in the course of this debate, will be considered and will influence the strategy development.<\/p><p>In the current economic climate, it is very important that available resources are targeted at those most in need and that, where possible, care is provided in the community and the home.  The continuing pressure on resources in the health sector generally will make it an imperative that we obtain the very best targeting of resources towards those most in need.  The development of a national dementia strategy, combined with these other two important strategies to which I referred, will be a significant step forward in this regard.  Together with the enactment of the mental capacity legislation, they will form a solid foundation in ensuring the rights of some of our most vulnerable citizens are protected.  They, their families and carers are, and will continue to be, the focus of our considerations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400029#CC00500","speaker":"1024"},{"type":"speech","time":1351085400,"counter":735,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome his positive approach to this important aspect of Government policy.  The Minister of State has set the bar very high.  I wish him luck in achievement of the aspirations set out in the national dementia strategy and look forward to the successful conclusion of the deliberations that are under way in this regard and to our having an opportunity to discuss the proposals brought forward by the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch.  I also welcome that a draft of the strategy will be brought to Government during the final quarter of 2012.  I say this in the context of a rather interesting opinion that dementia services cost more than cancer, heart disease and stroke services combined.  Despite this, as an illness it fails to attract commensurate political and budgetary attention.  In that context, the aspirations as outlined by the Minister of State are to be welcomed.<\/p><p>As has been stated in the debate and will be stated again in future debates, there are few families that have not been touched by dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  My late aunt suffered from dementia in her declining years.  A close neighbour of mine was diagnosed with dementia at the early age of 57 years.  He was a mathematics teacher and brilliant man who was active in his community.  He died within years of his diagnosis.  The point has been made that people with dementia, as opposed to people with Alzheimer's - I understand there is a medical distinction between the two - can go on to live long lives, which places a great deal of responsibility and burden on families, friends and neighbours.  Sadly, there are also those like my neighbour who died not as a result of his condition but because of associated physical complications arising from his incapacity.<\/p> <p> The other aspect of this debate, which I know the Minister of State would be in favour of, is that in whatever strategy is developed, where possible those suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease stay in the home or in an environment to which family and friends have access.  I know this would be a priority of the Government - and I do not mean this to sound cynical - because it would be cheaper and less of a burden on the Government if those suffering from Alzheimer's disease and dementia are looked after by their family and friends rather than being institutionalised.  This also has medical benefits.  I hope the strategy will reflect this.<\/p><p>I am glad the Minister of State referred to the major costs outside of the economic and financial costs associated with dementia, as they often remain unrecognised.  I am particularly pleased he paid tribute to family and carers as well as to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.  It is rather interesting that the scale of dementia is such that governments throughout the world are being forced to review their policies and reconfigure services for older people, as the Government here is doing.  It is a sad reality of life that the figures are increasing.  I do not know whether this has to do with environmental reasons.  I assume the Government provides funding in other areas of medical and scientific research, and I wonder whether it feels it has any role in advancing the research actively under way by pharmaceutical companies.  I presume they are closely monitoring results in this regard; it would be helpful in the context of the work that will be done on the strategy by the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, which might focus on the medical advances under way.  While they have not cracked it, and it seems to be a long way off, anybody who has more than a passing interest in this field will know there are regular updates on increasing discoveries about what causes Alzheimer's disease and dementia.<\/p><p>I wish to pay tribute to two people.  The first is my friend and colleague, Senator Mary White, who prepared a policy paper for our party on active ageing and quality caring.  She has been more than active in this regard, to the point that those of us in the party have had on occasion to restrain her in her enthusiasm for the subject.  I admire her, and I am sure the House would agree, for focusing on an area that does not always get the attention it deserves.  I do not mean to be at all political in this regard but I also pay tribute to the former Minister of State, \u00c1ine Brady, who from 2010 to the end of the Fianna F\u00e1il-led Administration initiated a number of policies which have been continued and expanded by the Government.  This reflects the all-party, non-political, non-partisan nature of this terrible medical condition.  I congratulate the Labour Party for bringing this important motion to the House.  We enthusiastically embrace all of its aspects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400029#CC00600","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351086000,"counter":737,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am also delighted to welcome the members of the public who are in the Gallery.  They have an interest in this subject and I thank them for giving up their time.  I am glad the Minister of State has grasped the concept so well and I know he will be on top of his brief.  It is very important the national dementia strategy is put in place as soon as possible because it affects all families at some level.  According to the statistics, people in their 60s have a one in 100 chance of suffering from it, which increases to a 20 in 100 chance when one is in one's late 80s.  With our population ageing and living longer most people in this room will be affected either directly or through someone very close to them.  It is a real issue in the country.<\/p><p>Perhaps in the past the condition was not regarded as a major disablement because people stayed at home with their families, but it is a debilitating condition.  It is extremely difficult for families to watch a younger person develop early onset of dementia.  The Government and society has a role in dealing with this issue and in assisting the carers, as the difficulty of coping is sometimes left out of the loop.<\/p><p>The Department of Justice and Equality can make people wards of court and it can be awarded powers of attorney, which can be a difficulty for families and we must address this.  People physically capable of going on holiday but who need the assistance of a carer should be assisted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade if they want to go on holidays in the early stages of the disease.  At local government level, we must make towns, villages and services more friendly for people suffering from Alzheimer's disease and the onset of dementia.  According to statistics, by 2040 some 80 million people worldwide will suffer from Alzheimer's disease and dementia, as it doubles every ten years.  By that time, dementia it will be a major issue for families, and local and central government have a massive job to help communities become more friendly for people.<\/p><p>Many people are physically active into their 80s, but carers need support from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and State agencies involved in sport.  Evidence suggests Alzheimer's disease may not be as rampant in people who are more physically active, so from a cardiovascular point of view it is important the body is working.  People far more qualified than me state cardiovascular and stroke issues can lead to the early onset of dementia.  Therefore, our entire outlook on health is important for the national strategy on dementia.  The future for people in this position must be positive.<\/p><p>The HSE has a role to play in the community and voluntary sector to assist people who want to get involved.  Community employment schemes must be protected along with home help.  This is not a temporary issue we can solve; we must put in place a long-term plan.  We have seen support today from all parties.  This is something everyone supports and wants to work because this is our future as well as that of our parents and children.<\/p><p>In other countries the extended family has a role and people look after their grandparents.  This was easier to do years ago when people worked around the home and on farms.  People now travel and cannot afford to leave their parents in this position.  The Departments and agencies I mentioned have a role and must have an input into the strategy.  I look forward to the launch and delivery of the strategy on dementia.  Most people doing voluntary work are not appreciated and I thank them for their support.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and giving his time and considerate response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400030#DD00200","speaker":"1144"},{"type":"speech","time":1351086000,"counter":738,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is welcome to the House.

That means people can assign enduring power of attorney while they are fully competent and set out clear guidelines as to how they want their affairs managed should they wind up unable to manage their affairs.  We need to do much more in that area to get across the message that this procedure is available.  As someone practising in the legal world, I find that people come to me when the person is a borderline case and it is unclear whether he or she has dementia or not.  We then try to get reports from doctors to ascertain if it is safe to get documents signed.  In nearly 50% of cases, it is too late to get that enduring power of attorney assigned.  We need to let the public know that this procedure is available.<\/p><p>I also welcome the many people in the Visitors' Gallery and thank them for their work and for putting the pressure on us to deliver in this area.  Pressure needs to be applied to us to ensure we can provide a better back-up support mechanism for people.  <\/p><p>Dementia is not necessarily confined to people over a certain age.  Over 4,500 people under 65 have dementia.  I remember canvassing in one election, knocking on a door and being asked in so I could discuss a particular problem with a member of the family.  The husband of this person was only in his mid-30s but was in full-time care as a result of developing Alzheimer's disease or dementia at a very early age.  The woman had four children under the age of 12.  It was absolutely frightening to think that there were no answers to the problems she faced for a long time.  It is not confined to an older age group and we also need proper systems of support for affected people in younger age categories.  We need to be conscious of this to ensure we do not ignore them in developing any policy changes.<\/p><p>This morning, I attended the launch of a report by the Economist Intelligence Unit about health care.  We are reacting to problems as they arise rather than looking at them before they arise and carrying out long-term planning.  We need to be proactive about screening and making sure people go for medical checks, not because they suddenly have pain or a problem but because they should have regular medical checks.  We need to promote this more.  People have a policy of only going to a doctor when they have a problem whereas we should be encouraging six-month or 12-month checks where problems can be dealt with far earlier.  <\/p><p>Screening has been introduced in Abu Dhabi across the country and 95% of the population have been screened.  Reports have been given to every individual setting out the lifestyle changes he or she needs to make.  We need to be more proactive in respect of our health care policy in this area and in getting people to look at their lifestyles, making sure they get proper advice and helping them change those lifestyles so that the cost of medical care will automatically be reduced.  <\/p><p>This is a very important topic and I fully support the motion tabled by the Labour Party group.  It is very comprehensive in an area where we need to bring about changes.  I know those changes will occur with the Minister of State's help and we will all be behind him in bringing about the required change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400030#DD00300","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351086600,"counter":740,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for small business, Deputy John Perry, for the rest of the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400031#EE00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1351086600,"counter":741,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House where he is always a welcome face.  I welcome the commitment of the Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, Deputy White, to ensuring the publication of the national dementia strategy in 2013.  We would all like to envisage an Ireland where everyone could live the life of their choosing and have a good quality of life despite their disability or despite being diagnosed with a terrible illness.  With this illness, somebody has a perfect body but his or her mind goes.  It is very sad and hurtful for the person and his or her family.  I worked in a nursing home years ago and distinctly recall a family member coming home from the US to visit his mother who did not recognise him.  The mother was in a happy place but he was not.  It was heartbreaking and wrenching to see a grown man cry because his own mother did not recognise him.<\/p><p>Obviously, early diagnosis and intervention must be looked at and developed to the highest degree.  All experts say that the earlier the diagnosis, the better the quality of life for the sufferer and the family looking after him or her.  Following on from early diagnosis of dementia, as stated in Department of Health policy, the move is to get people back into the community and living in their homes.  For that to happen, we need to put the services in place.  Part of the issue is the lack of legislation to underpin access to these services.  We need to put legislation in place to give people what they are entitled to, otherwise services are discretionary, as they are at the moment.  I know the single assessment tool will be introduced but we need to look at the services that are in place.  <\/p><p>It is very hard for people to access services on the ground, regardless of what people will say and put down on paper.  It is hard to know when people are to leave hospital or whether there will be home help available.  It is a long and hard road for the family members looking after a person with dementia.  It is hard enough to have to live with it and see one's loved one in this condition without having to fight the system.  Unfortunately, I find that people are constantly fighting the system and looking for their entitlements and rights.  As part of the strategy, we must ensure people's access and entitlement to these services is included in legislation.  <\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy White, sang the praises of carers and rightly so.  I continually fought for carers even before I was elected a Member of the Oireachtas because they are one of the most valuable assets this country has.  They are saving the State a fortune and we must look after and value them.  Once a carer is taken away from a person, he or she will inevitably end up in a nursing home or in care, which is very sad, so we must protect our carers.  The national carers' strategy has gone a long way towards underpinning their rights.  I will leave it at that because everything has been said by other Senators who have all highlighted what they want in the strategy.  I am sure the Minister of State will take on board their views and revert to the Ministers on this subject in his own time.  I thank him for taking the time to listen. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400031#EE00300","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1351087200,"counter":742,"content":"<p>I support this wide-ranging motion.  In the current economic climate, providing support for sufferers of dementia and their families is very challenging.  Unfortunately, action on the Government's commitment to introduce legislation on the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is long overdue.  In response to questions on when the convention would be ratified, all Ministers who have held portfolios on this topic have said they want legislation in  place beforehand.  While we have signed up for ratification, we have not addressed all the elements required.  While our aspiration to ratify the treaty is noble, we do not recognise the urgency of doing so.  I acknowledge this was also the case under the previous Government.  Although strides were made under former Minister of State, Mr. John Moloney, to implement a new strategy on disability and mental illness, they were not enough.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, to ensure legislation is put in place in this regard.  While many of its provisions will require financial assistance, it must be acknowledged that rights do not always have financial consequences for the Exchequer.  There are many rights enshrined in the UN convention that are not upheld at present.<\/p><p>Under the Good Friday Agreement, Irish sign language is supposed to be recognised both north and south of the Border.  In the North, one can gain access to one's government through Irish sign language but this is not possible in the South.  This is amazing considering the content of the Good Friday Agreement and the UN convention.  One despairs over the fact that on one side of the Border, one will have access to government services and rights whereas, on the other, in the South, one will not.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this.  While we seem to be very good at signing up to the ratification of UN conventions, our implementation is less than desirable.  While I note the commitment on carers and others, I believe that if we are serious about ratifying UN conventions, we must ascribe to the process a greater degree of urgency than we have heretofore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400032#FF00100","speaker":"1159"},{"type":"speech","time":1351087200,"counter":743,"content":"<p>This is one of the most important issues on the agenda.  I have a copy of the report launched on 18 January 2012 in Trinity College Dublin by the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, Creating Excellence in Dementia Care.  I pay tribute to the authors, Professor Eamon O\u2019Shea, NUIG, Professor Suzanne Cahill and Dr. Maria Pierce, and I commend the work of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland.<\/p><p>So much work has been done in producing the report that we do not have to reinvent the wheel.  It is an outstanding report.  The Minister, in launching it, stated there is a commitment in the programme for Government to launch a national strategy.  I look forward to its implementation.  The deadline given for this is 2013.  We are approaching 2013 so I hope all the work will be done by then.  The report is invaluable in informing this work.  One does not have to reinvent the wheel because the report is evidence based and was produced by eminent people.  Three quarters of the work is already done.  I thank the philanthropists who provided much of the funding for the work on which the report is based.  I acknowledge the work of the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in its preparation.<\/p><p>Everybody has spoken about the importance of early diagnosis.  In 2010, the then Minister launched a national dementia education programme.  It seemed to identify gaps in specific education and training for nursing and non-nursing staff dealing with dementia.  The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, might bring that to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to determine whether there has been any re-evaluation of the programme.  What was found?  What is working and what is not working?<\/p><p>Senator Colm Burke tabled a motion on the training of nurses, including gerontological training.  This is mentioned in the programme.  The Seanad engaged in community consultation with all the relevant groups associated with the elderly.  These issues, particularly training, were raised heretofore.<\/p><p>We heard so much about community care in the past few weeks.  Much of the news was bad but the good news is that community care for those suffering from dementia is vital.  Many people enter long-term care before they are ready for it.  The education, training and community-awareness programmes are not tailored to address this issue.  Two thirds of those in long-term care are estimated to have dementia.  Some are believed to be put in care prematurely.<\/p><p>One of the weaknesses of the home care services is that they are not underpinned by legislation, nor are they provided for statutorily.  Senator Moloney said that, while aspirations are fine, it is vital that there be a statutory basis to implementation.  In the absence of community support at the desired level, people with dementia continue to be placed in long-term care prematurely.<\/p><p>I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to consider funding.  I was working with a lady recently whose husband, who is quite young, has dementia.  She found two nursing homes that were willing to take him.  It is sometimes difficult to get the right nursing home to take a person because specific care is required.  However, the funding system is such that some institutions are deemed unsuitable while others are deemed suitable.  It is important that the funding system be changed to accommodate those who are willing, able, trained and HIQA approved.<\/p><p>Let us consider the emphasis on prevention.   In this regard, I was looking at the BBC only yesterday.  I happened to be in Glasgow, where I was speaking at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly on the UN declaration on disabilities.  Senator Mark Daly will be delighted to know that I have been advocating action on Irish sign language for years.  I spoke about Irish sign language at the meeting.  A motion was passed yesterday and it will be forwarded to the relevant authorities in Scotland, Wales and Ireland.  I assure the Senator that we are working on the matter.<\/p><p>With regard to music programmes, it has been found that music helps those with dementia.  While the benefits of doing crosswords, Sudoku, etc., have always been known, new research has shown that grey matter increases significantly among those who do physical exercise.  I encourage everyone to get up on his or her exercise machine.<\/p> <p>They say prevention is as good as a cure but perhaps not in this case.  I do not have the details of the new research but we should all promote it.  I congratulate the Alzheimer Society on its 30 years of hard work and I hope that we can do what it requests of us.      <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400032#FF00200","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351087800,"counter":745,"content":"<p>I call Senator Mary Moran.

I also commend the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, on his excellent speech.  He pointed us in the right direction by outlining what is being done and what was outlined in the programme for Government.  I welcome the cross-party support by Senators.  This is a great day for the Seanad and we are all singing from the same hymn sheet.<\/p><p>Much of what I had planned to say has already been covered by my fellow Senators.  Everyone has mentioned the importance of early diagnosis and training for doctors and diagnosticians.  <\/p><p>I also welcome the mental capacity Bill and add my voice of support.  It is imperative that the Bill is brought forward and published as soon as possible.  As has been said today, it would be brilliant to have it published during the first six months of next year during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union.<\/p><p>In reference to planning for the future, I would like to highlight the work that has been done by all of the excellent societies and associations.  The Alzheimer Society has been congratulated on its 30th anniversary but there are many other groups that provide care and services.  I note that Mr. Diarmuid Hanifin from Amnesty International was here earlier.  I also note the work done by Older &amp; Bolder, the Positive Age groups and through the national positive ageing strategy.  Recently I launched positive ageing week in Dundalk and I was amazed to see the services that are available and provided by volunteers.<\/p><p>I wish to mention the work done by the Irish Hospice Foundation through its Think Ahead project.  It urges people to think about and pre-record their wishes in the event of serious illness or death.  The Think Ahead form was launched on 12 October at the forum on the end of life and I was involved in the project.  A pilot programme is being rolled out in County Louth.  It is one of the counties being used for the pilot scheme.  The Think Ahead project presents us with a wonderful opportunity.  I urge everybody, from fellow colleagues to associations, to watch out for the scheme being rolled out in their area as it gives everyone an opportunity to plan for later in life.  For people in the early stages of dementia the form is a wonderful tool and will ensure that their wishes are carried out even when they are no longer able to speak for themselves.  The scheme is invaluable when a person's capacity to make important choices fluctuates.  I have mentioned how important it is to introduce and publish the mental capacity Bill as soon as possible.<\/p><p>An issue was brought to my attention this week by someone who works in dementia care and the issue was not raised earlier.  I refer to the safeguarding of people with dementia who are at risk of abuse, particularly in their homes.  We all hope that the children's referendum will be passed on 10 November.  It will ensure that children at risk can be removed to a place of safety in order to protect them in exceptional circumstances. So much work must also be done to protect a person with dementia who is at risk.  At present the only places of safety that are available to them are the accident and emergency department of a hospital or a Garda barracks.  Neither is suitable for a severely confused person.  I want to bring the matter to the Minister of State's attention and I ask for it to be considered when the strategy is being rolled out.  I know that some work has been done and is ongoing regarding the matter.  It is vital that we examine it further.<\/p><p>As has been said many times today, carers are the lynchpin and we could not provide a service without them.  I wish to express my sincere thanks to them for all of their work.  There are thousands of carers and they provide care to dementia sufferers, people with disabilities and older people.  Yesterday I spoke to a girl who rang me because she was distraught and worried about her 92-year old grandparents.  She was simply looking for a night's sleep and wanted care to be provided.  The care service is important.  Again, I thank the carers for all of the work they do.           <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400033#GG00300","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1351087800,"counter":747,"content":"<p>I call Senator Susan O'Keeffe and she has four minutes to conclude the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400033#GG00400","nonspeaker":"Acting Chairman (Senator Pat O'Neil)"},{"type":"speech","time":1351087800,"counter":748,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, for replacing the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White.<\/p><p>  I thank my colleagues in the Labour Party for all of the work that has been done to table the motion today and I thank Senator Landy for seconding it.  I also thank all of my colleagues in the Seanad.  As a Senator has rightly expressed, it is political but not party political.  The way Senators have robustly supported the motion reminds us all of its importance.  It sends a clear message to those who will be charged with pulling together the important strategy.  It proves that we all care about dementia and that there are many ways to form the strategy.  I hope that some of what we have offered today will become part of the strategy.  <\/p><p>  I welcome Deputy Alex White's commitment to publish the mental capacity legislation during this session.  I welcome his reiteration that the national dementia strategy will be delivered and implemented over the next five years.  It is important to note, while we are here being positive together, that the Government is driving the strategy forward.  The commitment given in the programme for Government stands as a real commitment to the people inside and outside of the chamber and also to the thousands of people who struggle with dementia and care for their loved ones.  Those people want to see that resources and budgets are spent wisely and in a more targeted way in the future.<\/p><p>  Tomorrow the Alzheimer Society will host a conference where <font color=\"#222222\">Gr\u00e1inne McGettrick <\/font>will speak about transforming the lives of people with dementia.  The national dementia strategy wants to transform the lives of those who have dementia and their carers.  I shall remind Members of what was cited earlier.  We said that: carers are crucial to the strategy and its implementation; that its approach is person-centred when providing care and services; that it is based, as far as possible, in the community; that there would be more and specified training; that standards of care are outlined in the strategy; that the budget, if it can be, is ring-fenced and targeted with a better direction of all resources; and that a clinical director in the HSE be appointed to take care of the latter.  <\/p><p>  The Minister asked me about research.  One of the advantages of having a relatively homogenous population in Ireland means that an EU joint programme initiative is commencing through the Health Research Board.  Ireland will participate in the research on Alzheimer's disease and the strategic research agenda is being prepared.  The measure will add to the entire work.  Many people work in the dementia sector and many of whom will be present at the Alzheimer Society's conference tomorrow.  I commend the work done by the Alzheimer Society and the many organisations that care about dementia and for the people who care about dementia.  I thank the Members for a robust and strong debate and I am glad that we have managed to reach agreement on the motion.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400033#GG00500","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1351087800,"counter":749,"content":"<p>Question put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from D\u00e1il","time":1351088400,"count":750,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400034#HH00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1351088400,"counter":751,"content":"<p>D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann agreed on 23 October 2012 to the amendments made by Seanad \u00c9ireann to the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2008.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400034#HH00200","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Amendment to Terms of Reference of Tribunal of Inquiry: Motion","time":1351088400,"count":752,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400034#HH00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1351088400,"counter":753,"content":"<p>I move:<ul><br>That Seanad \u00c9ireann resolves that the terms of reference contained in the Resolution passed by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann on 23 March 2005 and by Seanad \u00c9ireann on 24 March 2005, as amended by the Resolutions passed by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and Seanad \u00c9ireann on 1 June 2011, the Resolution passed by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann on 16 November 2011 and by Seanad \u00c9ireann on 17 November 2011, and the Resolutions passed by D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and Seanad \u00c9ireann on 23 May 2012, pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2011, be further amended as follows: <ul>1. in paragraph (I), by substituting 'not later than 31 January, 2013 and 30 April, 2013 and, on each of those occasions, shall set out:' for 'not later than 9 March, 2012 setting out:'; and <br>2. in paragraph (IV), by substituting 'not later than 31 July, 2013' for 'not later than 31 October, 2012'.&quot;<i><\/i><\/ul><\/ul><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400034#HH00400","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1351088400,"counter":754,"content":"<p>This motion proposes to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry into suggestions of collusion by members of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na or other employees of the State in the murder by the Provisional IRA of RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and RUC Superintendent Bob Buchanan in March 1989.  The tribunal, as Members know, was established by the Oireachtas in 2005 and it is chaired by Judge Peter Smithwick, former President of the District Court.  The Smithwick tribunal was established arising from the Weston Park talks in 2001 and in light of Judge Peter Cory's subsequent report on the murder of the RUC officers.  Its purpose is to get at the truth of these suggestions of collusion both in the public interest and, importantly, in the interests of the families who were bereaved by this atrocity.<\/p><p>Senators will be aware that, on 12 October, the Clerk of the D\u00e1il received a letter from the tribunal chairman requesting an extension of the deadline for the conclusion of the tribunal's work.  The Clerk of the D\u00e1il laid that letter before both Houses.  This motion will provide for an extension of nine months, that is, to 31 July 2013, to the current date established for the conclusion of the tribunal's inquiries and the submission of its final report.  This is fully in line with Judge Smithwick's request, and the Government hopes the tribunal can fulfil its mandate within the revised timefrarne which has been set out.<\/p><p>In his recent letter the tribunal chairman states that due to the serious illness of a key witness and based on the medical advice of the witness's doctor, the taking of evidence from that witness has had to be deferred for a period of five or six months.  This witness is considered fundamental to the tribunal's remit and the chairman indicates he must provide for completing his evidence when the witness is medically fit so to do.  The chairman notes that, due to the ill-health of this witness, the taking of his evidence has been significantly delayed.<\/p><p>Judge Smithwick also states that additional intelligence-based material was only recently and unexpectedly presented to the tribunal.  In July and again in September of this year, the British authorities and the Police Service of Northern Ireland provided this new material to the tribunal.  The chairman considers this material to be highly relevant to the work of the tribunal and that he must, therefore, investigate it and provide for hearings related to it, if need be.<\/p><p>It is clearly a matter of concern that significant information should emerge at such a late stage in the tribunal's hearings.  However, it is a matter for the tribunal at this stage to address the issues arising and the House will appreciate that I could not comment in detail on the matter without becoming involved in the substance of the work being carried on at the tribunal.  I note, however, that the chairman makes the point in his letter that some of this new material is currently highly sensitive and characterised as being &quot;of the moment&quot;.  I regard it as surprising that new material of relevance to the tribunal's work has been furnished to it only very recently having regard to the duration of the tribunal's engagement.  I believe it is essential such information that does exist and that is of relevance to the tribunal's terms of reference is made available fully to the tribunal and that the completion of its important work and of its deliberations is not unnecessarily delayed.  In light of the late emergence of this material, I have been assured by the British authorities that every assistance is being afforded by them to the tribunal.  In addition, I have assured Judge Smithwick that I remain available to assist him in this regard if at any stage he feels it necessary or appropriate.<\/p><p>The Government, having considered the tribunal chairman's request, proposes that the D\u00e1il should resolve to extend the timeframe for the tribunal as requested and that this House should do so as well.  As an additional measure and to ensure this House is kept fully abreast of the tribunal's progress towards conclusion in this additional period, the proposal provides for two further interim reports from the tribunal to be submitted by 31 January 2013 and by 31 April 2013.  I emphasise, as I have done previously, that if, for any reason, it does not prove possible for the tribunal to meet the timeframe set out, the chairman can report this to the Clerk of the D\u00e1il in order that the House might consider the matter further.  I can also reassure this House that, as we have demonstrated to date, the Government's response to such an approach from the chairman would be fully cognisant of and consistent with the need for the tribunal to fulfil its obligations fully and as expeditiously as possible.<\/p><p>The Government respects the importance of the tribunal chairman carrying out his inquiries fully and without fear or favour, and is anxious to support him in doing that.  I am confident this motion will assist in that endeavour and I commend the motion to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400034#HH00500","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1351088400,"counter":755,"content":"<p>I support the proposal of the Government in the Seanad.

One must always bear in mind that this particular tribunal is an integral part of the peace process, which is still ongoing.<\/p><p>There would be no necessity to spend millions of euro on tribunals were those who were involved in those murders and their colleagues from the Sinn F\u00e9in Party, some of whom are Members of these Houses but who are absent today, to give information they have.  While Sinn F\u00e9in will criticise other tribunals, its Members are not present today to discuss this tribunal, which relates directly to the work of an organisation with which they have been intimately connected over the decades.  They should answer the questions and should give as much information as they have.  They should answer the questions in respect of various despicable and cowardly murders that have taken place.  They also should answer the questions in respect of the burial of bodies in my part of County Meath in Oristown, Coghalstown and Wilkinstown.  Members of Sinn F\u00e9in, which provided political support for these murders over the years, must co-operate and give as much information as they have.

When the Minister came before the House previously, it was hoped that such an extension as is now being proposed would not be necessary.  What is most important, however, is that the Smithwick tribunal has the time and resources available to it to carry out its important work and to report to Members at the earliest possible date.  It is highly significant that Judge Smithwick has put on record his requirement for an extension of time, as well as the possibility of significant new evidence being available.  While everyone obviously wishes such evidence had been available at an earlier date, it is never the wrong time for the right thing, so to speak, and this evidence must be investigated fully.<\/p><p>This particular tragedy from 1989 obviously is one of the many tragedies the people, North and South, experienced over a number of decades during the IRA-led violence.  One must recognise, however, that there were horrible incidents on all sides of the political divide and, as part of our attempt to build a new and peaceful future on this island, we must, in so far as possible, bring truth and reconciliation to the table.  At the onset of this tribunal, many people may have felt that although it was being set up, it somehow was little more than a type of political sop.  Nothing could be further from the reality, however, and this is a serious tribunal engaged in important work.  Members must give it the time and space it seeks of them.<\/p><p>I support the motion with these few words and note Members must not and cannot be afraid of the truth being revealed.  The truth, as it relates to the dreadful campaign of violence across the island, and across Northern Ireland in particular, for almost 30 years, will be painful, but Members must deal with that reality and support the work of this tribunal.

It is undoubtedly frustrating that Members are back here again, but given what the Minister has indicated, they all must accept there is no alternative and the tribunal has good reason to seek this extension at this time.  It must be stated, however, that more than six years have elapsed since the tribunal was instituted.  It commenced its investigations in early 2006 and is now due to report by 31 July 2013, by which time it will have been in being for more than seven years.  Consequently, it is unfortunate it has been obliged to take so long.  There is no doubt that the murders of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and RUC Superintendent Bob Buchanan were especially heinous, and I believe all Members have expressed sympathy to their families as well as an understanding that the tribunal is undertaking necessary work in investigating the circumstances of those murders.<\/p><p>  The Minister has explained the two key reasons the chair of the tribunal has sought the extension of time, namely, the illness of a key witness and the fact of evidence newly provided by the PSNI and the British authorities.  In what perhaps was a strong understatement, the Minister noted it is surprising the new material has been furnished only recently to the tribunal.  It certainly appears to be material that is or may be of particular value to the tribunal and, consequently, the latter clearly will require more time.  It also is of concern that one of the key witnesses has been very ill, and I imagine all Members hope for his speedy recovery and certainly hope he will be able to give the evidence required within the timeframe provided for by the extension.

In respect of the other reason for seeking an extension, I merely state my hope, in the context of this motion being passed, that any individual or group on this island or elsewhere who has additional information that falls within the terms of reference of this tribunal would furnish that information to the tribunal without any further delay.<\/p><p>I hope it will not prove necessary to extend further the life of the tribunal.

We are all very acutely aware of the facts and reminded on a daily basis of the serious financial difficulty we have and the shortfall of &#8364;16 billion.  There are also requirements under the terms of the EU-IMF bailout agreement to reduce our borrowing for 2013 by &#8364;3.5 billion.  The Minister's Department has a budget of &#8364;20.5 billion, accounting for 40% of overall Government expenditure, and I am very aware she is required to reduce the budget by &#8364;540 million in 2013.  I appreciate the difficult decisions that have to be taken and cuts that must be made.<\/p><p>  To build on the comments of my colleague, Senator Zappone, in the first part of this debate last week, there is a question about how these cuts are made and against whom they are directed.  These are ultimately political decisions.  There is nothing more disheartening as a Senator than to feel my interventions about any budgetary cuts are futile in the face of a done deal, so I welcome the Minister's reassurance that no decisions have been finalised in respect of the 2013 budget.<\/p><p>  We need to stop plugging the dam and looking for immediate savings, which are ultimately bankrupting us of our moral fibre.  As a Government and society we must firmly establish our red lines, or the values and principles that we are unwilling to yield.  An example of this was aptly articulated yesterday in the audiovisual room by the community and voluntary pillar, when it presented an alternative budget for 2013, with values such as dignity, sustainability, equality, human rights and working for the common good.  Such values inherently seek to protect children, the elderly, disabled, weak, vulnerable and marginalised, it makes for a value system that I support and endorse.<\/p><p>  We must articulate a vision for the Ireland we want in ten years, developing strategies that are necessary to achieve this vision by incorporating values and aligning them with national policies.  We can do this and I do not agree that Ireland is bound by the current policies for achieving the &#8364;3.5 billion reduction in borrowing as set out in the letter of intent, memorandum of economic and financial policies, and the technical memorandum of understanding.  Within the document I note the paragraph following the proposed revenue measures and expenditure reduction in the memorandum, which states:<ul>Without prejudice to the minimum consolidation amount referred to in the previous paragraph and to the requirements to achieve the agreed fiscal targets, the Government may, in consultation with the staff of the European Commission, the IMF and the ECB, replace one or more of the above measures with others of equally good quality based on the options identified in the comprehensive review of expenditure.<\/ul>I am not alone in reading this to mean that Ireland is free to change the method through which the requisite saving is made, once it is made.<\/p><p>  It is interesting to note that Social Justice Ireland agreed with 130 of the 131 recommendations made by the Commission on Taxation report from 2009 on tax breaks.  The exception was the recommendation on child benefit.  Lists of savings are possible, and I strongly encourage the Government to consider the proposals.  I do this on behalf of the more than 700,000 people in Ireland, of which 200,000 are children, at risk of poverty, and the more than one in four children between age 12 and 17 already living in poverty.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service gave a good presentation earlier this morning on the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, demonstrating that households with children are at more of a disadvantage and are more likely to enter poverty.  Our current policy is not working, although it may satisfy the troika and meet international requirements.  It is not working for the raft of Irish people bearing the brunt of the cuts.<\/p><p>  In preparing for today's discussion I pondered how we have a multi-annual plan for the troika and education officials are considering school infrastructure, responding to change in demographics with a multi-annual plan.  The action plan for jobs brings us up to 2016.  The plan for the country's people, however, is missing.  Where is that plan?  I have spoken with friends who are holding on to savings despite being encouraged to spend.  When there is no plan for the people, it is an issue.<\/p> <p>Those living in extremely marginalised and vulnerable conditions do not know where the safety net is and feel it keeps moving.  They are walking on this tightrope and are asking where the safety net is because it has moved again.<\/p><p>We need to look not only at one budget - all the focus now is on budget 2013 - but at things much more in advance.  The programme for Government referred to working across Departments.  If one looks solely at the issue of child benefit, the question is whether we tax or means test it rather the Minister's Department looking outside itself and asking why we are giving child benefit and the purpose of it.  Is there a better way to achieve the outcomes we wish other than by purely looking at cash transfers?  I suppose I am trying to encourage the Minister and her colleagues in Cabinet not to look simplistically at cash savings but to have a plan for the people to say this is where we are going.  We can do it for jobs and for the troika but can we do it for the people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400037#LL00200","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351090200,"counter":766,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I did not get an opportunity on the previous occasion she was in the House to speak on matters relating to social welfare and I am glad I have the opportunity to do so now.  I was in the Mansion House today where the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, introduced a proposal to reform the social welfare appeals system, which was launched by the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly.  It is looking for it to be independent of the social welfare staff who run it currently.  I agree with much of what I heard.  Presentations were also made by people from Northern Ireland where the appeals system is totally independent.<\/p><p>Our system is not transparent.  If one applies for a social welfare payment, one does not know who is dealing with it.  The deciding officer may not be the person who dealt with the case.  One does not know the doctors dealing with it and, as I often say, doctors differ and patients die.  There are many medical referees and they would all have varying opinions, but one does not have access to the file.  If a person wants to appeal a decision of a deciding officer, he or she does not get access to the full file, something of which the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, was critical.  She was also critical of some of the deciding officers' decisions.  An interesting statistic was that where people got the benefit of an oral hearing, 49% of cases were overturned because people were able to present their cases.  Social welfare application forms are very confusing for ordinary people to complete.  Many of the 30 to 40 pages are nonsense and do not apply to them.<\/p><p>There was also a presentation by the chief appeals officer and, listening to her, it would seem there is no problem in the Department.  There are problems and I know the Minister has been fundamental in bringing about a change in the scanning system in the Department, but there are historical cases which are just left there, as it were.  I have been dealing with a case since last January and I do not know how many telephones calls I have made to the invalidity pension section.  I telephoned it two weeks ago, said I was frustrated and that I needed someone to deal with the case.  I happened to talk to a nice lady and it was like as if she had a box of files beside her.  She told me to hold on for a second.  She came straight back to me and said she had the file, that it had been there for a while and that she would get it sent on for a medical re-evaluation.  I telephoned again today to find out at what stage the medical re-evaluation was.  The girl said it had been sent on but that she did not know when it would be dealt with.  I asked her to give me an indication as to whether it would be one month, two months, six months or a year.  She said she had no idea.  I am frustrated by what people must go through.  I am going through it too because I am taking all the telephone calls on this.  The Minister needs to talk to the chief appeals officer and to question this.  I can give her examples of historical cases in respect of which nothing has happened for 12 to 14 months.<\/p><p>Rent caps were adjusted some time ago but it seems they were just slashed by 25% across the board.  There was nothing scientific about the way the new rent caps were devised.  In Roscommon town, where there is a shortage of houses, because it did not benefit from the tax incentive scheme and oceans of houses were not built with landlords crying out to rent them, the rent cap for a single person is \u20ac69 per week.  If one heads south from Roscommon and in the direction of County Galway, one will come to a little village called Creggs on the Galway-Roscommon border.  If one happens to live outside the village of Creggs in the middle of nowhere, the rent cap is \u20ac103 per week because it is in County Galway.  We must look realistically at rent caps and at the likes of Roscommon town.<\/p><p>I refer to an issue which is not specific to the Minister but which I raised with the Minister for Health and other Ministers, namely, the proposed cuts to home help hours.  I have made a proposal to the Minister for Health that he should consider opening it up to the community employment schemes to replace the hours proposed to be cut.  At a minimum cost of \u20ac750,000, we could replace the necessary home help hours which are proposed to be cut.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400038#MM00200","speaker":"1161"},{"type":"speech","time":1351090200,"counter":767,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to make a few brief points.  Everyone appreciates the Minister is in a very difficult position.  She is more used to being in my position than that which she is in now and she will know that whatever she does, she will be wrong.  That is the difficulty the Minister for Social Protection faces at this time.<\/p><p>Senator Kelly made a point I was thinking about in the context of appeals processes and representations made in regard to invalidity pension in particular.  The analogy I was thinking about was not so much the box.  When I telephone the Department I sometimes feel it is as elusive as my ticket being drawn on &quot;Winning Streak&quot; because at times one wonders if there is a filing system at all because of the length of time it takes.<\/p><p>This is a serious issue.  We are dealing with the most vulnerable who are in the most difficulty.  It is hand to mouth survival stuff as opposed to looking after people.  Notwithstanding that the people in the relevant Departments are working hard, are there enough people?   Do we need overtime?  Does more time need to be put in?  Indeed, Senator Kelly made a very good suggestion in regard to CE schemes.  Let us use the JobBridge programme, bring people in, give them administrative experience, give them the extra \u20ac50 per week and get them to work through this.<\/p><p>One of the criticisms I would have of the public service generally is that, in the main, the culture is that one works from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  In the private sector and in the political world, it is a bit different in that one works until the job is done.  I know that might not be quite realistic in the context of so many applications, files and so on but one thing is certain: we cannot, with credibility, stand over the system in operation and say everyone is doing all he or she can.  We are failing miserably in that regard.  I am sure all Members of this House and the other would say the most frequent requests with which they must deal relate to invalidity pensions and delays with appeals, along with medical cards.<\/p><p>The Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, and FLAC are correct, and I am thinking of the mortgage arrears resolution process, the code of conduct and the inadequate way we are dealing with that problem.  The banks adjudicate on the appeals process where a person feels he or she has not been treated fairly.  The appeals process in the Department of Social Protection is adjudicated on by people in that Department.  I can think of no justification where a plaintiff or a defendant would preside over an appeal in a court of law.<\/p><\/a> <p>This should and must be examined.<\/p><p>The Minister can make no cut or saving that anybody on this side of the House will welcome and she knows all about that from her time in opposition.  I appeal to her to be as fair as she can.  She should be careful with child benefit.  People have gone to the media to say they do not need child benefit or they can survive without it because they have a high salary.  I am thinking of someone in the entertainment world particularly who made a statement in this regard lately.  A book should not be judged by its cover.  As when trade unionists talk about core income being what others might call allowances, the child benefit payment is probably used to pay essential bills such as light and heating rather than contributing to the needs of children, for which the payment was envisaged, and, therefore, it forms part of the core income to run the family home in many instances.  It will be difficult to deal with that issue.  Means testing would be the ideal way to go but the cost of administration makes that difficult.  I do not know how the Minister will deal with it.  If I had a solution, I would give it to her but I appeal to her to be careful about it.  I wish her well in her deliberations over the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400038#MM00300","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351090800,"counter":769,"content":"<\/a> <p>I compliment the Minister on the many reforms she has introduced in the social welfare system over the past 18 months.  Significant amounts have been taken in as a result of tackling fraud in the system and I am sure the Minister will agree there is a long road to go and more to be done in that regard.  I compliment her on the JobBridge programme and she should be complimented in many other areas.   However, we all dwell on the problems in the system.  I will relay many of the issues raised on the Order of Business over the past number of weeks.  The issue of FLAC and the independent appeals system has been raised.  I thought the entire system was independent but the Minister will address that in her reply.<\/p><p>The long delays in processing various allowances is a problem.  The delay in processing carer's allowance and invalidity applications is almost 12 months.  Additional staff have been taken on and community welfare officers are now under the ambit of Social Protection but I agree that if there is need to take more staff in that area, it should be done to address the delays because the vast majority applying for these benefits are bona fide applicants and they should be dealt with speedily.<\/p><p>I also compliment the Minister on the report she commissioned on pensions.

While the Department of Social Protection has a role in the protection of the most needy in our society, it also has a duty of care to people in employment because people feel there is inequality in regard to the benefits some claimants get under the social welfare system which they cannot access in employment.  Many Members referred to children's allowance and the fact that the most wealthy people in the country are in receipt of it.  The problem has been the inability to means test because computer systems were not linked.  Would the Minister consider a basic rate of &#8364;70, &#8364;80 or &#8364;100 a week with people having to apply for a top up in order that they receive the payment automatically from the Government?  If, for example, a claimant's income is below a certain threshold, he or she could be entitled to an additional payment for children.  It would be worth considering because the administration of that would not be as onerous as means testing and taxing the benefit.<\/p><p>  I refer to the social welfare culture in the country.  There was a great article in <i>The Times<\/i> a few months ago about the establishment of the social welfare system in England.  In cities in England, three generations of some families have never worked in their lives and rely on social welfare.  That is down to education and to administrators such as us making sure these people have proper opportunities to access education and training schemes.  Will the Minister consider a cap on the amount of social welfare that goes into certain houses?  This issue has been raised with me when I meet people on the street.  They say they have neighbours with five people in the house who are all on social welfare while they are out working.  A man who works in the public service said to me, &quot;I have educated my family and sent them through university.  For me to gain the equivalent of somebody down the road from me who is on social welfare and married with four children, I would have to earn &#8364;62,000 because of the benefits these people can claim&quot;.

Countries that we recognise as having good social welfare systems and that have reformed social welfare, such as Denmark, Holland and the Scandinavian countries, have changed from a passive system, where one qualifies for payment and is left alone forever, to an active system where we try to encourage people back to work.  This applies in particular to illness benefits.  The best international medical evidence and occupational health evidence is that, where people have had an illness and have been able to physically recover, what most helps their recovery is to get back to work and to be in an active environment with work colleagues.  They may not be able to do so on a full-time basis but the evidence from doctors in recent years points this way.  We have not had that in our system.  Much of my focus is to say that the social contract in Ireland is that people will be supported if they lose their jobs, fall ill or have a disability.  Taxpayers and citizens want to see a solid system of social support but it is a two-way contract.  Equally, the other side of the contract is that the people receiving income support are obliged, on behalf of their fellow citizens and taxpayers, to do their best to get themselves back to work and to become financially independent.

The worst outcomes for children are in jobless households and, unfortunately in terms of our problem at the moment, we have many jobless households.  In terms of any reform programme, the employment situation, which was referred to by many Senators, is absolutely vital.<\/p><p>Members asked questions about carers, the half-rate carer's allowance and delays.  The delays occur because of the enormous volume of applications.  There are 52,000 people in receipt of a carer's allowance, which is an enormous increase on the position a number of years ago.  Some 22,000 of those people receive the half rate carer's allowance.  In the budget strategy and the budget outcome last year, the carer's allowance was protected because carers are providing full-time care and are doing a very important job.  It is a priority of the Government to acknowledge it, recognise it and support it in terms of income.<\/p><p>Senator Norris asked whether the carer's allowance could be extended and whether fuel allowances could be frontloaded to allow people to buy oil in bulk.  We have a winter fuel allowance for five months.  We do not have the capacity to prepay.  It is possibly not the best idea in all circumstances.  Senator Norris referred to people getting a fill of oil but most oil suppliers will accept a weekly or monthly budget plan.  I would be wary of handing out the money in one lump sum.  The experience of the Department in large lump sum handouts is not universally great.  In some cases, the money might not be directed to the purpose for which it is intended.  We need to study Senator Norris's proposal very carefully.<\/p><p>Senators Thomas Byrne and John Kelly referred to delays in applications for carer's allowance.  The problem is the numbers.  We are changing the computer systems.  Many of the computer processes in the Department go back to the 1980s, when they were top of the range, but it is several decades later and they need to be substantially overhauled.  One of the things I regret about the boom period is that more was not done to update the ICT systems.  It is a slow process that is under way.  Senators will find that, in the case of invalidity, there is a significant advance in completing the new systems.  Current applications are being dealt with much more quickly.  I meet regularly with officials with a view to prioritising the clearance of the backlog.<\/p><p>Senator Mullins referred to the abuse of the free travel pass and suggested a charge for the travel pass and getting holders to register every year to confirm an entitlement.  The number in receipt of a travel pass has increased and it is a significant issue.  Some 750,000 pensioners and those with a disability have a free travel pass but there are another 300,000 companion passes.  There is a concern among a number of operators that some people are using the pass even though they are not entitled to it.  Our pensioners are not the problem in respect of the travel pass.  The review group was brought together to examine the matter.<\/p><p>This year, we have produced 40,000 PPS cards with photographic identity.  This will be rolled out next year and it will greatly help in cutting out abuse.  It is important because people next door and up and down the road are aware of abuse and they are consenting, as taxpayers, to pay for a good social welfare system but they are not consenting to people who abuse it.  I was in the Seanad Chamber last year and I asked for powers for social welfare inspectors to ask questions at the airport of people coming in and out.  Those powers are being significantly used and a number of prosecutions have taken place.<\/p><p>Members have asked about not having cuts to certain areas but no decisions have been made on the budget.  The Department must find savings of over \u20ac500 million.  We will do so in the best way possible but the best way is to get more people back to work.  At that point, the cost to the State decreases by at least \u20ac200 per week and maybe more and the person gradually pays tax, pays PRSI and purchases more.  We rebalance the system by getting people back to work.<\/p> <p>The social welfare appeals office is independent of the social welfare offices.  Many people, including Senator Kelly, do not feel that is the case but it is independent.  I will convey what has been said here to the people in the social welfare appeals office.<\/p><p>Senator Van Turnhout and others raised the question of child benefit.  I have spoken here before on this.  One of our problems is that at the moment minimum direct cash payments to a family completely dependent on social welfare amount to \u20ac30 per week in direct payment for a qualified child and \u20ac140 per month in child benefit.  That is equivalent to \u20ac65 per week per child.  It is a significant amount.<\/p><p>Are there better ways to target that?  That is the issue.  Could there be a universal payment at a high level that retains the principle of universality, which is of benefit to women in particular?  I certainly benefited from it, as did many of the other women here.  Perhaps some of the men did but it generally goes to the caring parent, the mother.  What would be a better way than a universal payment at a certain level and then targeting the balance?<\/p><p>In Finland, when the banking system collapsed, the Finnish Government decided it needed to invest in education and started with pre-school.  If we could have more pre-school and after-school care, although we would not get it immediately on the Finnish scale, it would pay a dividend throughout the school system.  The late Brian Lenihan converted the early childhood payment into a free year of child care, which saved about half the amount and I can see the benefit of that scheme every day.  I see children gaining from it and parents broadly approving of it.<\/p><p>We could do more there.  The Department spends \u20ac35 million on the hot meals schemes in disadvantaged schools.  That is some of the best spent money by the Department and I would love to see that service expanded.  A child who comes into school may not suffer from a lack of money in the home but a lack of organisation.  There could be parental disorganisation or failure.  Not everyone is up to speed.  Children come into school and if they can sit down to a hot meal in a social space with their friends before the start of the school day, it is a great addition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400040#OO00300","speaker":"946","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351092000,"counter":778,"content":"<p>What about the family resource centres?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400041#PP00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1351092000,"counter":779,"content":"<p>The Senator mentioned that to me and it merits consideration.

In the context of the structure of the Irish system, that would be difficult.  At the moment there might be a family with payments for themselves and their children, some of those payments as carers, some as payments for disability, some as payments from the HSE.  In countries like Austria, people have an account so we can see the flows of support.  Some of those supports, however, are not counted by the Department, such as education, in the same way as other countries.  This should be considered but it would be difficult in the current situation.<\/p><p>We are, however, constantly writing to recipients of child benefit to check they are still in the State and at the address that was given when the claim was made.

Fishermen being lost at sea is a major issue on the south-eastern and southern coast of Ireland, as it is across the entire country.  We have lost many fishermen all around Ireland and I know many families personally who have been affected by this in the south east.<\/p> <p>One only needs to consider the grief and sorrow left in the wake of tragedies such as the <i>Tit Bonhomme<\/i>, the <i>Honey Dew II<\/i>and others.  More needs to be done to ensure the safety of our fishermen.  It is clear that the first few hours are crucial in finding fishermen alive - or finding them at all - after they have gone overboard.  If we are able to track them or find them via GPS in those first few crucial hours, many lives could be saved.  Deputy Colreavy asked a parliamentary question on this matter in March.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport replied:<ul><ul>Currently all Irish registered fishing vessels are required to be fitted with Emergency Indicating Position Beacons (EPIRBs).  All fishing vessels over 12 metres in length must carry an automatically activating float-free automatic EPIRB and vessels less than 12 metres LOA (length over all) only have to carry a manually operated EPIRB.<\/ul><\/ul>However, this is focused on the vessel rather than the individual and therefore does not assist in any significant way in locating those who have gone overboard.<\/p><p> The Minister indicated in March that officials from his Department were examining, in conjunction with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, issues relating to the carriage of personal locator beacons, PLBs, by fishermen as an enhancement to existing measures.  He said they would be assessing the effectiveness of such electronic devices when used in conjunction with existing safety measures such as lifejackets and personal floatation devices.  In the seven months since this was raised in the D\u00e1il, what progress has been made on these PLB systems?<\/p><p> According to the Fishing Vessel (Personal Flotation Devices) Regulations 2001 every fishing vessel must carry a suitable personal flotation device for every person on board, and the personal flotation device must be worn at all times by the crew of the fishing vessel when on the exposed deck of the vessel, whether at sea, in harbour or coming to and from moorings.<\/p><p> A personal locator beacon, PLB, is a small transmitter that gives the position of the person but it is not as powerful as an EPIRB - the equipment for the boat itself.  A PLB is often worn like a watch by divers.  Surely it should not be too difficult for flotation devices, generally life jackets, to have PLB devices or some other form of similar system with a small device on the life jacket?  The Government should take steps to ensure that this happens, as it would save lives.  It would make it much easier for fishermen to be found in the first few hours.  As the Minister of State will know it becomes extremely difficult to locate people or bodies after 24 hours.  However, it is highly likely that they would be found within that time, and before they have sunk, and indeed could often be found within an hour or two.<\/p><p> These devices are not expensive and the Government could support their purchase.  They can cost as little as &#8364;120 before VAT.  Fishermen have argued that they could be exempt from VAT or that grant aid could be provided.  The devices can fit into a pocket, or be worn around the neck or wrist.  If fishermen had such devices on their person and if someone were to go overboard or the boat sank and the emergency crew got there within a couple of hours, they would be able to find the bodies.  It would obviously assist in locating and saving the lives of people who have gone overboard.  However, even when families experience the tragedy of the loss of a life, it can take days or weeks to locate the body - sometimes the body is never found.  If modern devices can be used to improve the systems, then tragedies such as the recent one off the coast of Union Hall and others could be avoided.<\/p><p> What steps can the Department take to assist in this regard?  We should use new advanced technology to improve the safety for fishermen.  We should have the same types of safety measures in place for fishermen as we provide for passengers in cars and aeroplanes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400041#PP01500","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1351092600,"counter":794,"content":"<p>I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.  I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address this issue today.  Currently all Irish-registered fishing vessels are required to be fitted with emergency indicating position beacons, EPIRBs.  All fishing vessels over 12 m in length must carry an automatically activating float-free EPIRB and vessels less than 12 m length overall only have to carry a manually operated EPIRB.  Officials from my Department are examining, in conjunction with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, issues relating to the carriage of personal locator beacons by fishermen as an enhancement to existing measures.<\/p><p>Arising from discussions last week, further work is being done by my officials in conjunction with BIM officials who work under the auspices of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, on initiatives to enhance the safety of Irish fishing vessels.  As a first priority, it is intended to incentivise the provision of automatic float-free GPS-enabled EPIRB beacons for all fishing vessels.  This will address a key safety recommendation made in a number of Marine Casualty Investigation Board reports into the loss of fishing vessels, where such a vessel beacon could have contributed significantly to rescue efforts.<\/p><p>A second priority will be to encourage the use of personal locator beacons for fishermen on all Irish-registered fishing vessels.  These personal locator beacons are designed and operated in accordance with recognised international standards and will be required to be registered with the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  It is intended that my Department will take measures with a view to making the provision of personal locator beacons and vessel beacons mandatory under appropriate legislation and my Department's code of practice for the safety of fishing vessels less than 15 m.  In implementing this initiative on personal locator beacons, provision will be made for maximum flexibility to allow for whether such beacons are separate from, or integrated into lifejackets.<\/p><p>I cannot emphasise enough the importance of wearing lifejackets at all times on the water.  Statutory requirements on the wearing of lifejackets and personal flotation devices on fishing vessels are set out in the Fishing Vessel (Personal Flotation Devices) Regulations 2001 as amended by the Fishing Vessel (Personal Flotation Devices)(Amendment) Regulations 2008.  Under the regulations, every fishing vessel is required to carry a suitable personal flotation device for every person on board.  The personal flotation device shall be worn at all times by the crew of the fishing vessel, when on the exposed deck of the vessel or, in the case of open undecked vessels, on board the vessel, whether at sea, in harbour or coming to and from moorings.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the regulations require that the skipper of a fishing vessel shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all crewmembers wear a personal flotation device in accordance with the regulations.  The Merchant Shipping Act 1992 provides that if there is a contravention of these regulations, the owner and, if the vessel is in use, the master of the vessel are each guilty of an offence and each is liable on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding \u20ac5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both.<\/p><p>The requirement for a personal flotation device to be available on-board for all crewmembers is checked as part of the safety surveys that all commercial fishing vessels are required to undertake.  The requirements for the wearing of personal flotation devices are also communicated to fishermen during these surveys.  In addition, guidance on the selection of personal flotation devices for use on board fishing vessels is conveyed through the issuing of marine notices from my Department.<\/p><p>A final important element of an integrated safety technology package for vessel beacons and for personal locator beacons will be a link to training.  My Department is working with BIM to develop appropriate training and refresher training to enable fishermen to gain maximum benefit from these technological enhancements to personal safety in the fishing industry.  It is expected to implement the new integrated package on a phased basis as part of the existing BIM fleet safety scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400042#QQ00200","speaker":"1074"},{"type":"speech","time":1351093200,"counter":795,"content":"<p>I welcome that, as per the Minister of State's reply, the Minister and Department intend to introduce legislation which will make personal locator and vessel beacons mandatory and further to introduce a code of practice for the safety of fishing vessels of less than 15 metres, which is a significant improvement in terms of where we were on this six months ago.  It is hoped the relevant legislation will be brought forward as quickly as possible.<\/p><p>  These devices work in depths of up to 22 metres.  Some of the bodies found on, for example, the <i>Tit Bonhomme<\/i> were down about 12 m, which shows that these devices can save lives.  The Minister will have the support of Sinn F\u00e9in and, I am sure, of all other public and elected representatives in terms of the introduction of any legislation to make these devices mandatory.

It is a central pillar of the Government's objective to have large numbers of those who are currently out of work gain meaningful employment as a means of rectifying our current economic crisis.  I commend the efforts made by the Government in this regard, including the increase in foreign direct investment to our shores, the introduction of an action plan for jobs, a schools building programme and significant capital spending on infrastructure, as outlined in the July stimulus plan.  However, as an Oireachtas Member for east Galway, I must focus on how Government and associated agencies can remove barriers to work for those in my constituency.  I want to ensure that all my constituents have accessibility to the workforce and that boundaries and barriers to work are eliminated by the Government.  For us to achieve anything of significance in this regard, we need to address the delay in processing of applications for Garda vetting.<\/p><p>I acknowledge and understand that the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na are providing a great service in terms of ensuring a process of quality control and that it is of the utmost importance that nothing comes between those who want to work and employment.  The fact that people are having to wait months for Garda clearance is acting as a barrier to entry into the workforce.  In my home town of Athenry, some 63 students who are studying child care, health care, nursing and social studies in Athenry vocational school, who expected to undertake work experience a number of weeks ago as part of their course, have been unable to do so in circumstances where they have yet to receive Garda clearance.  This means they are being significantly delayed in completing their courses and entering the marketplace for work.<\/p><p>Following on from my raising this issue in the Seanad yesterday, I was contacted by a self-employed man who told me he had to cease work for three weeks as he did not have the requisite Garda vetting for his business.  It is fair to say he probably endured some degree of financial hardship as a consequence.  This is a terrible indictment of our processes in Ireland and serves only to deter and discourage people from entering the workforce.  We must be mindful that students and self-employed people are the people we expect to assist us in rebuilding Ireland.  They are the ones who have not emigrated and want to work in or develop their businesses in Athenry, a town where currently 30 business units remain empty.  I am sure this situation is being replicated throughout the country.  Steps need to be taken to ensure that these delays are abated, if not eliminated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400043#RR00500","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1351093200,"counter":800,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Deputy Shatter.<\/p><p>The Minister is aware that apparent delays in the processing of vetting applications causes anxiety for those awaiting vetting certificates so that they can take up employment positions or voluntary roles.  Both the Garda central vetting unit in Thurles and the Minister are acutely aware of the need to minimise the turn-around time for vetting applications.  At a time when people are keen to get back into the workforce we must ensure that the vetting process does not interfere with this.<\/p><p>For the sake of clarity and to put the matter in context, I would like to outline the purpose of the vetting process.  The Garda central vetting unit provides employment vetting for approximately 20,000 organisations in Ireland which are registered with the Garda for this purpose.  These are organisations which employ persons working in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity with children and-or vulnerable adults.  The primary purpose of the process is the protection of children and vulnerable adults.  This is the paramount consideration.  The number of vetting applications received up to September 2012 is 212,558, with an expected outturn for the year of 350,000.  The number of applications dealt with during the past few years have increased, from 218,404 in 2008 to 315,100 in 2011.  Garda vetting disclosures are made to registered organisations following the signed authorisation by a vetting subject permitting the Garda central vetting unit to disclose to the registered organisation details of all prosecutions, successful or not, pending or completed and-or convictions which may be recorded in respect of him or her in the State or elsewhere.  Alternatively, the disclosure will state that there are no prosecutions or convictions recorded in respect of the person.<\/p><p>The function of the Garda central vetting unit is to make disclosure, in accordance with a written authorisation from the vetting subject, to the registered organisation.  Decisions on the suitability of the person concerned rests at all times with the recruiting organisation to which a vetting disclosure is made.  As I mentioned earlier, the vetting unit currently processes over 300,000 vetting applications per annum.  The staff of the vetting unit are to be commended for their work in reducing the processing time for vetting applications, from some 12 to 14 weeks at the time the Minister was appointed in March 2011 to between two and three weeks by May 2012.  This improvement was of enormous benefit to individuals and organisations throughout the State.  However, the number of staff in the unit decreased by 20 between March and May this year as temporary staff contracts came to an end.  This reduction in staff numbers has been partly offset by the redeployment of 15 clerical officers from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to a sub-office of the vetting unit in Ennis in May.  The new staff have, at this stage, completed their training period.  In the interim, however, processing times again increased and the current processing time vetting applications is eight weeks.  Seasonal fluctuations such as the start of the school year and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion. <\/p><p>The Garda central vetting unit, which will become the National Vetting Bureau and will have a substantially expanded role under new legislation, and the Minister are engaged in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure adequate staffing to meet these new demands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400043#RR00600","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speech","time":1351093200,"counter":801,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his succinct response on this matter.  The system needs to be reformed as it is clear that there is a huge amount of duplication.  A person wishing to work in the area of social services must satisfy Garda vetting requirements in this regard.  Where such person also wishes to train a Gaelic or soccer team, he or she is required to make a further application for Garda vetting.  It should be possible to streamline the process and to ensure a turnaround of one or two weeks, at most.  I ask that the Minister consider this in light of my raising this issue here this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012102400043#RR00700","speaker":"1173"},{"type":"speech","time":1351093200,"counter":802,"content":"<p>I again thank the Senator for her interest in this matter.

The Minister, Deputy Shatter, appreciates very much the matter has been raised this evening.  We will have new legislation and new staff.
