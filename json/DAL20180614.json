Not only are banks closing down, small businesses and farmers are finding it more difficult to access loans at appropriate rates.  That is the reality for many people, in particular in rural areas.  The public banking model is about regionalised banks which focus on the region in which they are situated to provide keen interest rates and look after the people.

The LIS is a scheme for carrying out improvement works on private and non-public roads.  The type of roads covered under the scheme are not under the normal maintenance of the county councils.  However, they provide vital links for people living in rural areas and need to be maintained to enable people living in rural Ireland to access their homes, farm land or amenities.<\/p>  <p>  For many years, there was no dedicated funding for the LIS due to the constraints on the public finances.  However, I allocated &euro;10 million in funding for the LIS in September 2017.  The scheme is administered by the county councils.  The councils prioritise the roads to be repaired and carry out the works.  Based on demand for the scheme and the capacity of local authorities to complete further works before the end of last year, I allocated an additional &euro;7.4 million for LIS roads in November 2017.  Building on the success of last year's scheme, I approved &euro;10.8 million to county councils for LIS roads in February of this year.  In total, over 1,100 LIS roads will have benefited from the investment of &euro;28 million made by my Department since last September.  As part of the 2018 LIS scheme, I requested each county council to compile a secondary list of suitable LIS road projects which they could complete if additional funding becomes available for the scheme later this year.

These networks are represented on the local community development committees.

He went on to say that increasing tourism is a key pillar of the action plan for rural redevelopment.  My concern is to ensure that these projects would not all be rurally based.  There is a very significant need for these projects in urban areas to enhance tourism but also for people's well-being in terms of healthy lifestyles.  In respect of the Minister's emphasis on rural Ireland, which I understand because there is nobody better than the Minister when it comes to looking after rural Ireland, it should not be the case that people in Dublin and other urban areas do not have facilities such as the Great Western Greenway in the Minister's county.

The town and village renewal scheme is a key component in revitalising towns and villages and sustaining our rural communities.  It was introduced in 2016 and allocated &euro;10 million to 170 projects in its first year of operation.  In 2017, as part of the Action Plan for Rural Development, I launched an enhanced town and village renewal scheme with a focus on projects that could bring a positive economic impact to our rural towns and villages.  Under last year's scheme, I approved &euro;21.6 million in funding to 281 projects.  I launched a further round of the scheme in April of this year, with an allocation of &euro;15 million.  The closing date for the submission of applications to my Department is 30 June and I anticipate that up to 200 further projects will be approved arising from this call for proposals.  These projects will be completed over a 12 to 18 month period.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department provided &euro;7 million in CL&Aacute;R funding to 231 projects in 2017.  More than 400 applications have been received under this year's CL&Aacute;R programme and I will be announcing details of successful projects shortly.  I also allocated &euro;1.4 million to Tidy Towns committees throughout the country last year to mark the 60th anniversary of the competition in 2018.  I made &euro;812,000 available towards the running costs of agricultural shows around the country.  These shows attract many extra visitors to rural towns and villages.<\/p>  <p>  The new &euro;1 billion rural regeneration and development fund, which was announced by the Government recently as part of Project Ireland 2040, will provide an opportunity to deliver ambitious and integrated projects that further support the revitalisation of our rural towns and villages.  I will be announcing full details of the fund later this month.<\/p>  <p>  On the basis of the progress made to date, the target in the Action Plan for Rural Development to support the revitalisation of more than 600 rural towns and villages over the period 2017 to 2020 will be exceeded.

Vicky agreed to waive her right to privacy and also refused to sign a confidentiality clause, as she wanted other women to be made fully aware of her experiences.  We then heard the heart-rending radio interview given by Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na, a young mother of four from Kerry who had also been diagnosed with terminal cancer.  Both of these women, and many hundreds of others, were unaware that an audit had taken place which showed that they had false negatives.  Some 209 women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer were not told about subsequent audits showing that previous smear tests could have brought about a different outcome.  The Government committed to introducing mandatory disclosure in 2015, and it has indeed been HSE policy since 2013.  Yet it was exposed at the Committee of Public Accounts that CervicalCheck, the HSE and the Department of Health were informed and the audit results were knowingly withheld from the women affected.<\/p>  <p>  As we know, the head of CervicalCheck immediately resigned her post and the CEO of the HSE left.  It was and still is a national scandal.  It has been an intense and emotional few weeks for the women and their families.  It still continues.  Even this morning at the Committee of Public Accounts, CervicalCheck and the HSE had to apologise to members and to the State Claims Agency for giving them incorrect information to the effect that all women affected had been told.  The fact that Dr. Gabriel Scally, who was appointed by this D&aacute;il to carry out the scoping inquiry on 8 May, has not been given all the information he requires to do what the Government and the D&aacute;il asked him to do is absolutely outrageous.  I agree with Dr. Scally when he says himself that it is unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  He has rightly said that he will not be stonewalled.  Yet there are agencies of this State willing to drag their feet, put up obstructions and continue to behave in an inexcusable defensive manner to the Government, the D&aacute;il and most importantly the women involved, on the basis that they believe their actions are defensible.  These women, who want to get their records to examine exactly what happened, unfortunately do not have the luxury of time.  The scoping inquiry was to be completed at the end of June.  It has now been delayed until approximately the end of summer.  I know that the Government wants the scoping inquiry completed as soon as possible, but now it looks as though that will not happen.  In the scoping inquiry, information is being denied and delayed unacceptably for various administrative, medical, legal and other reasons.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Minister believe it is acceptable that it has taken a full month to send documents to the scoping inquiry, and that these documents were not sent in an accessible form to the inquiry team, particularly when a deadline of the end of June was set?  Does the Minister accept that the scoping inquiry is being buried under a mountain of paperwork and that the women affected deserve better?  Finally, does he not agree that at this stage it would be more prudent to set up a commission of inquiry now, so that information can be sought rather than dragged from the agencies involved and so that a resolution can be found sooner rather than later?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400012#K00300","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1528974000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.

The scoping inquiry has been put in place and yesterday the Minister was absolutely clear, as was the Taoiseach, that full co-operation with the Scally inquiry is demanded of every agency.  Moreover, serious unhappiness was expressed by the Minister with the fact that the documentation provided was not in searchable form, which made it difficult for Dr. Scally to do his work.  The Minister has made it categorically clear to Dr. Scally that no such interruption in his work will be tolerated, and the Minister has been in touch with the HSE to confirm that.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, the Government sanctioned the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to work with the women affected.  They are working with them case by case and meeting them on individual basis so their concerns can be fully addressed.  In the interim period, Dr. Scally has made some very worthwhile proposals.  He has made it very clear that guarantees should be given to women in the consent form that they will receive the information and that full disclosure will occur if any change in information from those smear tests is discovered.  New guarantees will be put into the consent form and the HSE has indicated that will happen immediately.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, new information notices are being provided to anyone doing these tests, so that it is very clear to women that there is a possibility of a smear test not being accurate.  That is categorically provided.  In addition he recommended that women's expenses should be provided for.  A payment of &euro;2,000 has been provided immediately, so that no woman has any difficulty in accessing the services that are being made available.  The Government has also provided a care package.  This is being rolled out to women who need it so that they can have access to care and to support for any expenses that arise.<\/p>  <p>  This inquiry is really important.  I believe the Deputy's question was addressed yesterday by the Taoiseach.  He pointed out that a commission of inquiry results in longer delays.  Each person will have to be lawyered up.

Can the Minister give us assurances and tell us what the end of the summer means in the context of the scoping inquiry?  Will this be completed by the end of June?  Will it be July?  Will it be August?

Like previous Governments before it, its record on health has been absolutely abysmal.  Nowhere is this more evident than in the context of hospital waiting lists.  Since the Government came to office, hardly a month passes without the number of people on waiting lists increasing.  The figures have risen every month since last autumn, with the exception of a small reduction in February.  The figures released by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, this morning are totally shocking.  The figures for May are up 6,200 on the previous month and the overall number has increased by more than 20,000 patients for the year.  This brings the total number of people on waiting lists in the State to more than 707,000.  That is the highest number ever recorded in the history of the State.<\/p>  <p>  When he came to office, the Taoiseach said he would be taking a special interest in the issue of health.  That special interest has amounted to overseeing an increase in hospital waiting lists to record highs.  Such failure has not been confined to the issue of hospital waiting lists alone.  Since Deputy Varadkar became Taoiseach, more than 106,000 patients have spent time on hospital trolleys.  He has presided over a recruitment and retention crisis in our hospitals and, as we heard again this week, there is chronic underinvestment in our mental health services.  There has been a significant increase in those over the age of 75 who have spent 24 hours or more in accident and emergency wards.  If this is the Taoiseach taking a special interest in health, I am loath to think what it would be like if he did not take that interest.<\/p>  <p>  I do not want to absolve the Government's partner, Fianna F&aacute;il, from its role in all of this.  When it cobbled together its deal to put the Government in office in 2016, Fianna F&aacute;il stated that it would ensure that a plan was put in place to tackle waiting lists.  Look at the situation now.  We have record levels, with 707,000 patients on hospital waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  The problem can be addressed but it is a matter of priorities and choice, and of making the right choices.  It can be done by removing private health care from public hospitals and ensuring proper oversight of private practice limits, by stopping State funds going into private interests through the NTPF, and by ensuring there is adequate public investment in funding of public hospitals so they do not have to raise their own funds.  All of this can help to bring down waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  It is long past time that the Government got serious about tackling this issue.  It might be late in the day and one year on, but it is time for the Taoiseach to take a special interest in health and fulfil the commitment he made to the people and make meaningful changes that will result in these waiting lists coming down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400013#L00400","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1528974600,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The investment in health is now at unprecedented levels.  It is encouraging that 22,000 operations are conducted each week in our hospitals.  That is a very high number.  Admittedly, there is a waiting list of 79,000.  When we think of the 22,000 being treated every week, however, it shows significant progress is being made.  The number of 22,000 per week has increased, and it has risen in each of the past five years.  We are progressively making progress on tackling the waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  The outpatient waiting list is down.  The number of patients waiting longer than nine months, which is the target for an inpatient or day-case procedure, is now down 5,800, so it is significantly down in comparison to the figures previously provided.  We are making significant progress.  The number of outpatients treated in our hospitals each week is 64,200.  Again, this is a figure that is increasing all the time.  There is a waiting list of more than 500,000 outpatients but the Minister is introducing a new outpatient action plan to address this.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is aware the NTPF has been reinstated.  It has already very successfully treated 7,500 people so far this year, taking them directly off waiting lists.  The Minister will now address the outpatient waiting lists, which do present a challenge.  It is well known that there is duplication on those lists.  We need to properly verify the lists.  A strategy is being put in place - it is close to being finalised by the Minister - to address the specific issue of outpatient waiting.<\/p>  <p>  We have to bear in mind that this is also in the context of significant improvements being made in the broader health service.  There is a strategy to increase investment in primary care centres and we see that throughout the country almost 100 additional primary care centres have been put in place.  For the first time in 25 years we have new investment in hospital infrastructure.  It is hard to believe no new hospital capacity was put in place in our health system for almost 25 years but, as the Deputy knows, the Minister is investing in a new children's hospital, a new maternity hospital and a new forensic hospital.  He has indicated in his ten-year plan that significant investments are coming in order to address needs, with almost 3,000 additional beds - some of them exclusively in hospitals dealing solely with elective procedures - being provided.  This will be a significant addition to the investment and the range of resources to address needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400013#L00500","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1528974600,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I do not know what planet the Minister lives on, coming in here and making a statement to the effect that the Government is making progress on waiting lists despite the evidence.

Since the Taoiseach assumed office, the overall number has increased by 20,000.  The report is very clear that we have the largest number of patients on waiting lists ever recorded in the history of the State.<\/p>  <p>  The Government tries to slice and dice the figures and present them in a way that makes it seem that great improvements are being made.  The only thing that can be relied on is the NTPF, but we know that is a privatisation of the system and it will never work.  What we need is investment in the public service.  What we need is proper value for money.  What the Government is doing with regard to the NTPF is siphoning off taxpayers' money into private health care that provides for routine and simple procedures which should be carried out in public hospitals.  These are procedures that cost three times more than if they were carried out in a public hospital, but there is an ideological blind spot whereby the Government believes that underinvestment in public services and dishing it out to private services is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400013#L00600","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1528974600,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Of course, any system will have people who are joining the waiting list as it is not an immediate service, but most of these patients are there less than six months and 75% are treated within 12 months.  There is a system and a pipeline for dealing with them.<\/p>  <p>  When it comes to investment, the Deputy will have read the recent investment plan.  From memory, &euro;10 billion is being invested in our health services and, as I said, this is the first series of investments in almost 25 years in expanding the capacity, not just of our hospital system but also of our primary care system, to address the needs of a growing population and an ageing population.

Either the Minister is not being told everything or is being misled or else he is simply not on top of this matter.  It could be one or the other.  The Government must immediately find out what is going on.<\/p>  <p>  CervicalCheck is run out of Limerick and I have spoken to the people who work there.  They are good people.  I am sure there are issues at a management level but the ordinary workers are good people.  Dr. Scally has never set foot in the place and has not met those workers.  The head of the HSE met them once and has now acknowledged that he must meet them more often.  Dr. Scally has never spoken to the man who is over CervicalCheck.  This is the biggest healthcare crisis in this country in decades, but after this length of time he has not sat down with the director of the programme.  How is that acceptable?<\/p>  <p>  I do not have a great deal of time for Dr. Scally's report but he was very clear that the provision of documentation was not acceptable.  Does the Minister know what we found out in the past hour?  The head of CervicalCheck offered full remote and electronic access to the programme's records but the head of the HSE, who was sitting beside the programme director, had never heard of that offer.  He thanked him for the offer and said he would take it up.  What is going on?  All of this information is available but we are four weeks on and Dr. Scally has received a dump of information that is not readable or searchable.  Nevertheless, the head of CervicalCheck, whom Dr. Scally has never met, offered electronic access to all this information through the HSE but it was turned down.  Some people might say \"cover-up\" but I wonder what is going on.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister and his Government instruct Dr. Scally to visit Limerick and the programme manager immediately?  Will the Minister for Health visit Limerick and the programme manager immediately?  We now know there will be more than 209 women affected so will the Minister outline to the House the likely number of cases?  Will he guarantee in this House that the Scally report will come back in time and the D&aacute;il will be recalled at the end of August to discuss it and commence the commission of investigation?

In my county of Tipperary, 7,041 people provide regular unpaid personal help to a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problem or disability.  This amounts to 4.4% of the county's population.  According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, a total of 195,000 persons were providing unpaid assistance to others on the last count, with the largest percentage increase seen among those aged 85 and over, where the number rose from 1,318 to 1,776, a rise of 34, which is huge.<\/p>  <p>  I want to focus, however, on the very disturbing revelation that 3,800 children under 15 years of age are engaged in providing care to others, accounting for almost 2% of all carers in the State.  That is almost 4,000 children, a shocking figure, spending their childhoods looking after their sick and disabled loved ones and family members.  We have spoken in this House recently about the harsh and cruel way in which children were treated.  Such actions were disgraceful, and it is right that we condemn them wholeheartedly and without reservation.  It is my belief, however, that in a few years we will look back and be appalled at how we could have allowed or indeed forced these young carers to bear such an extraordinary emotional burden.

We cannot.<\/p>  <p>  All of us in this House are aware of the challenges adult carers face, and how difficult it is for them to find even a moment for themselves because of a lack of home care supports or other care packages that will give them some semblance of respite.

We have not had the same certainty in respect of home caring.  We have had a mixture of tax breaks, respite grants, carer's allowance and access to home help.  The Minister has recognised, however, that we need to integrate that into a more coherent service in order that carers, be they children, as Deputy Mattie McGrath said, or adults, have a sustainable support on which they can depend.  This is clearly a priority.  We spoke earlier about hospitals and their needs, but often the unsung heroes in our health system are the carers who silently provide care 24-7.  The State must recognise them in a much more tangible way.  I am very hopeful, therefore, that the initiatives that the Minister of State is taking in this area will be very valuable.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State has also taken steps to provide immediate access to general practice care services free of charge to people on carer's allowance or carer's benefit in order that some of their concerns and pressures are addressed.  This is an area where public policy clearly needs to evolve, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is working hard to ensure this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400015#N00300","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"speech","time":1528975800,"counter":171,"content":"<p>We have had enough consultation.  It is obvious - the Minister himself admits it - that carers need support for the valuable work they do.  The provision of care by children, however, surely cannot be acceptable, and I am worried about the Minister's comments in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  On a related matter, in December of last year, the Minister, Deputy Harris, in response to a prominent \"Carers in Crisis\" special on RT&Eacute;'s \"Prime Time\", for which I thank RT&Eacute;, announced legislation to ensure that all carers in receipt of carer's allowance could access GP services without charge.  While Family Carers Ireland reads this as a step in the right direction, it believes it should be applied more broadly in order that all full-time carers, not just those in receipt of carer's allowance, would be prioritised in the roll-out of GP visit cards.  Therefore, will the Government consider using the non-means-tested carer's support grant, rather than the carer's allowance, to validate those providing full-time care for a loved one for the purpose of allocating a GP visit card?  Will the Minister incorporate this into his forthcoming legislation?<\/p>  <p>  Consultation time is over.  The needs are obvious.  We all appreciate the work carers do alongside the district nurses and home helps, but we need to have it recognised and we need the scheme proposed by the Minister to be expanded to include all carers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400015#N00400","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1528975800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>The Deputy is right that the period of consultation is over.

Regarding his other suggestion of expanding eligibility for the GP card, there is clearly an ambition on the part of the Government to extend primary care to a greater number in order that they are not charged to visit a GP.  All these issues, however, would have to be considered in a budgetary context.  What the Government has clearly signalled through the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is that we need to develop a more coherent policy in this area which would embrace access not only to medical care, as Deputy Mattie McGrath says, but also to the kinds of supports carers need.  This is a range of supports, and they have not been adequately delivered through the existing services, good as they have been for many years.  This is why the Minister of State took the time and effort to ensure that the input of people such as the associations Deputy Mattie McGrath represents, but also individual carers, would be brought to bear on designing a long-term system which would be statutorily based, so it would be an entitlement set out in law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400015#N00700","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Questions on Promised Legislation","time":1528975800,"counter":175,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400015#N00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1528975800,"counter":176,"content":"<p>We have 15 minutes for this item of business and 20 Deputies are indicating, so I will allow just one minute per Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400015#N00900","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1528975800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>Maith go leor.

SIPTU staff in the department of psychiatry in St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny have lodged their intention to take industrial action over patient safety concerns.  This department consists of 44 beds, but due to overcrowding in May and June, patients have been admitted and then told they have to sleep on couches.  If the matter is not resolved, shift nurses in the department will not take up duty until such time as the numbers are reduced to agreed safe levels.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot accept a situation in which our psychiatric nurses are forced daily to endure unfair and unsafe working conditions.  We owe it to the very dedicated staff and to their patients to reduce admission numbers to previously agreed safe levels.  This has been an ongoing problem for a long time in the south east.  As I have said, there are 44 beds in St. Luke's in Kilkenny.  Patients are being sent from all over the south east.  There are as many as 50 or 60 patients there at one time, some sleeping in armchairs.

The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 to correct the wrong which was made at the time to make open disclosure voluntary as opposed to mandatory. The decision by the Government, which was supported by a Fianna F&aacute;il abstention, to make open disclosure voluntary was a mistake.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have always opposed making open disclosure voluntary.  We, along with Independent Members and others in this House, voted to make it mandatory on 8 November 2017 during Report Stage on the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2017.  We were defeated that day, but this Bill seeks to right that wrong.  A year earlier in a Joint Committee on Health debate on open disclosure, I argued forcefully for mandatory open disclosure.<\/p><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Indeed, I argued for it again on Leaders' Questions with the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, on 21 February last in light of the case of Ms Alison McCormack, who had a breast cancer misdiagnosis.  The practice of keeping quiet when things go wrong is often prevalent in our medical culture and only a statutory duty of candour will address the situation. <\/p> <p> Most recently the fallout from the CervicalCheck scandal has shown the limitations to a process of voluntary open disclosure.  I welcome that the need for mandatory open disclosure with legislative underpinning is now accepted right across this House and was supported in the passing of a Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion calling for mandatory open disclosure.  It should not have taken another scandal to change the minds of those who wanted open disclosure to be voluntary, however.  Telling the truth where there is a patient safety incident should be mandatory and legislatively underpinned to ensure this.<\/p> <p> Nobody believes the health service can be run without error or risk but people demand that it show compassion and be truthful and honest.  That is not what has happened to date.  This is not what happened with Vicky Phelan, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na and others affected by the CervicalCheck scandal.  It is not what happed with Alison McCormack and her breast cancer misdiagnosis.  It is not what happened when there were errors leading to baby deaths and injury in Portiuncula Hospital and it is not what happened when there were errors leading to baby deaths in Portlaoise hospital.<\/p> <p> Section 2 amends the definition of \"incident\" contained in section 8(2) of the 2017 Act so as to provide that the term \"incident\" includes a patient-safety incident that has occurred within the previous five years.<\/p> <p> Section 3 amends section 12 of the 2017 Act.  Section 12 of the 2017 Act is a key provision in that it provides the mechanism under which the open disclosure of a patient safety incident is made.<\/p> <p> Section 12 of the 2017 Act is amended by replacing \"may\" with \"shall\" so that the initial wording of section 12 concerning open disclosure of a patient safety incident would instead read: \"Where a patient safety incident occurs in the course of the provision by a health services provider of a health service to a patient, the health services provider shall make, in accordance with this Part, an open disclosure of the patient safety incident\".<\/p> <p> Section 4 of the Bill amends section 18(1) of the 2017 Act.  Section 18(1) provides for the voluntary disclosure of additional information concerning a patient safety incident to the patient at any time after the initial disclosure has taken place.<\/p> <p> Section 4 of the Bill seeks to amend section 18(1) of the 2017 Act in two ways - first, by changing from voluntary to mandatory the requirement to disclose additional information to the patient where it becomes available and, second, by requiring that the additional information be made available to the patient \"as is reasonably practicable\" rather than merely \"at any time\".<\/p> <p> In order for open disclosure to work, it must be mandatory and it must be legally underpinned.  This Bill addresses the problems surrounding the current system and amends the Civil Liability Act 2017 to provide for a mandatory system of open disclosure in our health system.<\/p> <p> Collectively we have said we no longer want to see patients effectively having to go to war with the HSE to find out really basic information about themselves and their own treatment.  This House was wrong when it voted to make open disclosure voluntary.  I am proud that Sinn F&eacute;in did not support that but we now have an opportunity, regrettably in light of yet another scandal, to put that right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400017#P02200","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528977600,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400018#Q00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1528977600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400018#Q00400","speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528977600,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1528977600,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400018#Q00600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1528977600,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400018#Q00700","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528977600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"European Southern Observatory Membership: Referral to Select Committee","time":1528977600,"counter":231,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400018#Q00900"},{"type":"speech","time":1528977600,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p><blockquote>That the proposal that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the terms of the Agreement between the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere and Ireland concerning the accession of Ireland to the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere, approved by ESO Council on 5th June, 2018, a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 12th June, 2018, be referred to the Select Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in accordance with Standing Order 84A(3)(<i>b<\/i>), which, not later than 27th June, 2018, shall send a message to the D&aacute;il in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 90, and Standing Order 89(2) shall accordingly apply.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400018#Q01000","speaker":"1314"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528977600,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Death of Shane O'Farrell: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1528978200,"counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400019#R00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528978200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan on Tuesday, 12 June 2018:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528978200,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Debate resumed on amendment No. 2:<\/p><p>- (Minister for Justice and Equality)<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1528978200,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I must now deal with a postponed division relating to the motion regarding the death of Shane O'Farrell.

A cruel and inhuman past rises up again with a vengeance in Ireland.  It is about the shaming of women.  It is about the shaming of mothers.  It is about how this shaming has been inherited by their children.  I am truly sorry that this has happened.  It is also about how lies, secrets and silences, allowed and accepted by Irish society and Irish churches in the past, continue to block access to information on one's identity and to restorative justice in the present.  I hope and believe that we can change this and that we have a moral imperative to do so.  From where does this moral imperative come?  It comes from the voices of the people who were and continue to be impacted upon by the illegal practices surrounding birth registration and adoption practices in the not-too-distant past.<\/p>  <p>  I had the opportunity, along with my officials and advisers, to meet several of those to whom this matter relates and their advocates at the beginning of this week.  We listened to their stories and to their analyses and recommendations on the changes required.  One of the women, a survivor of Bethany, spoke about her arduous and painful search for her birth mother and how her desire for information was blocked at every turn.  One day, she finally found her mother buried in a pauper's grave.  With great dignity and courage, she purchased the grave, as an act of claiming identity without shame and to do the right thing where others had failed.  Her story - and those of the people in the 126 cases identified and the countless others whose lives and rights have been violated because of past practices - demands that we act in multiple ways, to enable the right to information and the knowledge of identity for those who do not have it.  These people's stories also demand that the right things are done about their records and that they are supported appropriately in the process, to recover who they are and the relationships that have been lost.  We also need ways to enable truth-telling and remembering, so that we can make a transition to a new way of valuing women, mothers and children.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from my announcement of 29 May, I want to clearly outline the evidence and share with Deputies what we know to date.  I will then outline the processes Tusla has in place and my plans to establish whether the practice is more widespread, either in the remaining St. Patrick's Guild files or in the files of other adoption societies.  Finally, I will address the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 and the mother and baby homes commission of investigation.<\/p>  <p>  The issue that has arisen regarding certain Saint Patrick's Guild files is evidence of illegal birth registrations.  In effect, babies were given to couples and registered as the children of those couples and not of the birth parents.  There were no adoption orders.  While there have been suspicions about illegal registrations for many years, it has been extremely difficult to uncover clear evidence because of the deliberate failure of those involved to keep records.  On 25 May 2016, the records of the guild were transferred to Tusla.  In the course of scanning the records, the issue of illegal birth registrations was identified.  Tusla informed An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and my Department.  Tusla validated the information against the records of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI, and the General Register Office, GRO, which resulted in the identification of 126 cases.  I moved immediately to inform Cabinet and to announce, on 29 May, that a process has been put in place to deal with these cases, led by experienced social workers.  An illegal birth registration is potentially life-changing, so the State has a responsibility to reach a high level of certainty before it contacts the individuals concerned.  This threshold has now been reached in the case of these 126 files.  The information I put into the public domain came to light because the index cards contained the words \"adopted from birth\".  This phrase raised suspicions and the cases involved were analysed further in conjunction with the AAI and the GRO.  It has been concluded that these were illegal registrations.<\/p>  <p>  Of these 126 cases, 79 have never had contact with Saint Patrick's Guild or with Tusla.  In the remaining cases, there has been some contact by the individual or a relative.  In addition to these cases, Tusla continues to examine a further 16 in which there is not enough evidence at this point to determine whether illegal registrations took place.  While I am making every effort to ensure that the numbers are accurate, I must caution the House that they will change as more records are examined.  In particular, the AAI is aware of approximately 140 cases in which existing suspicions regarding illegal registration must now be revisited.  A validation exercise is under way.<\/p>  <p>  We must reflect on the impact our actions will have on the people involved.  In addition to possible psychological issues of identity, there are potentially serious issues regarding the correction of birth records and inheritance.  We may well be called on to address further issues as they emerge.  Neither Tusla nor the AAI is out to destroy, upset or split families.  Their job is to provide information and support.  The 126 cases have already been allocated to experienced information and tracing social workers.  They will work in a measured and sensitive way and at the pace of the individuals concerned.  The process will be respectful if those who have been illegally registered choose not to engage.  It is also the case that there are people we will never be able to contact, as files may have been deliberately designed to conceal identities or people could be deceased.  Once Tusla identified the issue arising from the index cards, it informed the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The records were scanned, they were shared with the commission and the Garda sought and have been given a sample of ten files.  Let me be absolutely clear: a false registration is an offence.  The Garda must review the evidence and make a judgement with the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, on how to proceed.  I have no role in these investigations, nor should I.<\/p>  <p>  We need to know if there is further evidence of illegal registrations.  I have appointed an independent reviewer to oversee a further analysis of relevant records held by Tusla and the AAI.  Ms Marion Reynolds is a former deputy director of social services in Northern Ireland.  She has been asked to report to me within four months of the work commencing.  There are some 150,000 records at issue, of which 100,000 are currently in the custody of Tusla and the AAI and accessible to the reviewer.  First, we need a well-planned analysis of the Tusla and AAI records to see if a major trawl is likely to give us hard evidence of illegal registrations.  We must judge the likely incidence of cases that could actually be identified through the analysis and the scale of such cases.  Then, I will be in a position to judge next steps.  Some are calling for a full audit of all files and while I appreciate the motivation, our limited resources must be used as effectively as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The mother and baby homes commission of investigation is also examining adoption practices in the cases of mothers and children who were resident in the specialised institutions within its terms of reference.  It is reasonable to anticipate that this examination will provide an insight into any potential irregularities involved.  The commission is committed to investigating any such cases it comes across.  During the week, I met people directly affected by illegal registrations, advocacy groups and members of both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Many Members were part of a very useful and productive meeting yesterday, which also included colleagues from the Seanad.  The focus has been on progressing the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016.  Deputies will be aware that this Bill has passed Second Stage in the Seanad.  The Bill seeks to respect the rights to identity and privacy.  This is proving challenging because they sometimes conflict with each other.  The Bill also creates offences of destroying, mutilating, concealing or falsifying records.  All of the people I met this week, including Members of this House, all agreed on one thing, namely, that the Bill is urgently required.<\/p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Everything changed on 29 May.  What happened informed the wider public, the body politic and the media of the need to act.  My intention is that the Bill will be enacted by the end of the year.<\/p> <p> At the centre of this are people who were lied to and denied information about their true identity.  They need answers and explanations and the choice or opportunity to meet their birth parents.  It is a matter of profound regret to me that safeguards put in place by the State were circumvented.  My responsibility now is to oversee a sensitive process which seeks to give them finally the information withheld from them all these years.  I thank the House for its attention and I look forward very much to the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400026#BB00200","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528982400,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her statement.  Everybody was horrified with the outcome of the press conference she held regarding the 13,500 files.  What was astounding for most people was the falsification of birth certificates.  Up to that stage, while people might have been suspicious, once it was proven and demonstrated, that brought a new focus and spotlight on this issue.  Prior to that many people on both sides might have been fearful about the declaration of a birth mother, but many did not suspect there was falsification, lies and untruths.  It has now shifted to a different place.<\/p>  <p>  People now want the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 brought forward and I welcome the Minister's commitment, which she has reiterated numerous times, to do this before the end of the year.  Following a weekend when there was a great deal of joy nationwide, a serious damper was put on that on the Monday evening.  There was a touch of reality that while we might have come a long distance, we were brought back again.  It was not good for adoptees to realise they might be getting a phone call to tell them they might have been falsely adopted and that the names on their birth certificate might not be their parents.  I cannot imagine what it would have been like to have received that call.  It must have been life shattering.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister referred to Tusla and social workers supporting these people, but the rug has been pulled from under them and their families on many levels.  I worry whether Tusla has the resources and capacity to deal with this.  While all of this is going on, there are also accountability issues because a criminal act has been committed and lies and untruths were told.  As the Minister said, it is important that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is subject to the scoping exercise and the work undertaken with Tusla because we need to know how this happened and why people in positions of authority allowed it to happen.  We need accountability in this regard.  The 13,500 comprise only one segment of the files because there are more than 150,000.  How will Tusla approach this to select a reasonable sample to see where the agency will go from this?  Many people will have doubts in the back of their minds.<\/p>  <p>  We must also acknowledge adoptive parents in all of this, some of whom have contacted me.  They feel hurt because, in some cases, this revelation makes them look like they have done something wrong but they may not be in that cohort at all.  They adopted for the right reasons at a point in time and they feel hurt and let down.<\/p>  <p>  The junior and leaving certificate exams commenced the week the announcement was made and adopted children felt a certain amount of pressure and hurt.  While the truth was welcome, at all times we have to be sensitive about our language and how we discuss this.  To be fair, everybody has been.<\/p>  <p>  The only way we can move this forward is through the legislation.  Only yesterday I said that my party and I were prepared to work with the Minister to give her the support she needs.  I am fearful regarding how we will marry the two.  I do not know how we are going to do it.  I attended the meeting the Minister mentioned.  The advice of the Attorney General to her is that everything will be addressed in the amendments she will table.  There will be a good robust discussion here and in the Seanad when the legislation is brought forward.  Given the hurt experienced by people as a result of this, it would be unforgivable for us not to address the issue.  It is important legislation, given V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 and everything else.<\/p>  <p>  It might be uncomfortable to move this forward but we have to do so because it is the right thing to do.  The minimum to which people are entitled is the truth.  The Minister will be heading into the budget and making representations on funding for Tusla.  We will have to consider how we will support these families because it is not just individuals who need support.  The people affected are aged between 19 and 50 and possibly older.  They have families.  There are various cohorts who will need support and we, as a State, owe it to the affected people to give them this support.  The Minister wants to do this at all times.<\/p>  <p>  I do not know what it would have been like to have received the phone call to say a birth certificate had been falsified.  These people have gone through their lives not knowing the truth and then finding out that those whom they thought were their parents were not.  That must have been devastating for them.  We will be there to support whatever needs to be done over the coming months.  Bringing forward the amendments is crucial.  The Adoption (information and Tracing) Bill 2016 is essential.  The time for talking has to stop and we just need to get on with it.  I look forward to the Minister tabling the amendments on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400027#CC00200","speaker":"1231"},{"type":"speech","time":1528982400,"counter":268,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Kenny and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  I thank the Minister for her statement and for all the work she has done to date on this issue.  As I said during Question Time yesterday, we were not surprised by the scandal of the illegal adoptions by St. Patrick's Guild because survivors and many journalists have been telling us the stories for years.  Anybody who has met women incarcerated in mother and baby homes has heard these stories far too frequently.  Now we finally have the evidence regarding what was going on.  We need to start by not using the term \"incorrect registrations\".  That term makes it sound like it was an accident or a mistake.  Clearly, it was no accident.  Using that language is insulting to the mothers whose children were taken off them and to those illegally adopted.  This was a blatant attempt by adoption agencies to cover up what I believe was child trafficking.<\/p>  <p>  This week we have read that there are concerns regarding a further 700 cases at St. Patrick's Guild.  These concerns relate to the changing of names on records, cash transactions and other practices.<\/p><p>Many of those affected are also unlikely to be citizens of this State.  Many may have been illegally adopted by families in Britain or the United States and are probably unaware of their links to Ireland.  I hope we will see an investigation with a greater scope.<\/p> <p> This brings me to the sampling exercise announced by the Minister, which I welcome, albeit with major concerns.  A sampling exercise will not cut it.  It may be an acceptable approach in the short term but we must recognise that we are investigating the illegal adoption of children.  It needs to be a thorough investigation.  That is the only way to ensure that those who were illegally adopted but are unaware of it can get the full truth and support from this State.  We cannot leave people behind.  Many of the records of the illegal adoption of these children are still being held by religious organisations.  Yesterday, the Minister stated that there are over 100,000 records in the possession of the State, with an estimated 50,000 still in the possession of these societies.  These societies know that a sampling exercise is under way and I am concerned about the potential to tamper with records.  I urge the Minister to act to ensure that every single item of documentation is handed to Tusla immediately.  The Government must ensure that all necessary resources are provided for a thorough investigation into this scandal.  We are at a point where we could be losing something in this debate.  St. Patrick's Guild and other involved agencies were regulated by the State so the State allowed this to happen.  It is now up to the State to do everything in its power to right these wrongs.<\/p> <p> I will briefly touch on the Adoption (Information and tracing) Bill 2016.  The Minister has spoken with many of us in the House and we know she is enthusiastic about getting the Bill through.  This must be done right despite all the emotion.  We have heard groups talking about concerns and we must ensure everybody's concerns are addressed in this Bill.  We will support the Minister in whatever way we can to get this Bill through the House and finally ensure that adoptees have the information they need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400027#CC00300","speaker":"1362","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528983000,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic.  I acknowledge the work of the Minister to try to advance matters.  The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 needs further work and amendment.  It must ensure there is unfettered access to all records for all people involved, which is the key in all of this.  Standing back and thinking about how we came to this and many other scandals, it is about a hidden Ireland in the past.  In many ways, it was an oppressive place.<\/p>  <p>  These children, whether coming from mother and baby homes, orphanages or wherever else, were treated almost like a commodity rather than the human beings they were.  I will use today's opportunity to speak about a part of this group of people that has not been mentioned in the debate so far.  Where I come from in Country Leitrim, a rural area of which the Acting Chairman might be aware, we had people called \"home boys\".  There was a man in Carrigallen when I was growing up who had long whiskers and a long coat; he was always the butt of a joke and he lived in a little house in Drumbreanlis.  I knew another man, Mr. Johnny Golden, who came to a very sad end, unfortunately, and he was also a home boy.  There were many of them.  They came from these homes and lived with farmers when they were perhaps 12 or 13.  They had grown up in an institution and had no clue of family life or rural living.  They had no clue about anything.  They were very poorly educated and many of them could hardly read or write.  In many places these people were treated very well but, sadly, in many places they were not treated well at all.  In many homes they were treated very poorly.  It is another sad reflection on the society in which we lived.  There was another man called Paddy McLoughlin who lived in the same parish as me.<\/p>  <p>  My parents are both in their 80s and they tell me that when they grew up in the 1930s, nearly every second house had a home boy.  It was society's way of dealing with the issue.  My mother went to England in the 1950s and said she often met these home boys after they had emigrated and she saw them in dance halls and Irish clubs around London.  When they went to England, there was an equality that they did not have at home.  I use this opportunity to state that such people and so many more were legitimate citizens of this State.  This State is proud of them and how they rose above everything that was against them.  They had the strength to live and survive in that terrible position.  We must be proud of the contribution they made to our society and country.  It should be acknowledged and the best way to do this is by ensuring we do right by them in legislation that we bring forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400028#DD00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1528983000,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Week after week we are being exposed to the horrors of very dark periods from our past that were either overseen or facilitated by several arms of the State that should have been protecting its citizens rather than treating them as disgracefully as it did.  The adoption of children into loving, welcoming and caring homes in situations where all criteria set down by regulations are met and adoption is in the best interests of the birth parent or parents and the child should always be promoted and appreciated.  The history of adoption in Ireland until recent years is tarnished by lies, cover-up and deceit.  We are all now too aware of this history, and it has again come to the fore in recent weeks.  We must ensure such nightmarish occurrences never happen again.  It is my belief that to deny a person access to the very information that records their entry into this world is to deny them a very basic human right.  Birth certificates were altered and disappeared, while in some cases they were destroyed.  Children were taken illegally from parents.  These actions were disgraceful and wrong in the extreme.<\/p>  <p>  There are difficulties in striking a balance between the right to one's identity and an expectation of privacy.  I know the Minister has demonstrated a deep interest in addressing these historic wrongs.  Foremost in her consideration must be those people who have grown up not knowing their birth parents, with many having been told blatant lies.  Everything that can be done to now right this wrong must be done to assist these people.  The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 should be prioritised for the earliest possible through both the Seanad, where it is currently, and the D&aacute;il.  I welcome that the Minister referred to these false registrations as illegal birth registrations rather than incorrect birth registrations.  My colleague also mentioned that point.  Some people, including those in the media, have continued to refer to them as such even as recently as this week.<\/p>  <p>  Everybody is entitled to the recording of both birth parents on a birth certificate, and if information not recorded at birth presents later in life and can be properly verified, the information should be added to the incomplete record so a new birth certificate can be issued accordingly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400028#DD00300","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1528983000,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I know this matter is of particular interest to Deputy Burton.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400028#DD00400","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1528983000,"counter":273,"content":"<p>It is now over 20 years since Mike Leigh's movie &quot;Secrets and Lies&quot; explored the kind of tensions that a hidden adoption story can create in a family.<\/p><p>In more recent years, the book and the film of the story of Irish woman Philomena Lee have evoked much debate about the sordid history of the trade in babies that was a common but a secret feature of Irish life for decades.  In one sense it was surprising that the controversy over the faking of numerous birth certificates should have generated such an intense emotional reaction.  The basic facts of these and other dubious practices have been known for quite some time.  In another sense it is right and proper that the public should get to know again and again the personal histories of families torn apart, babies exiled and lives damaged forever by the actions of both church and State.<\/p> <p> The core political issue is one of fundamental human rights.  A person should have the right to his or her personal history and should be allowed full tracing rights.  I know there are many people buried in the Irish systems of administration and politics who think the sky will fall in if these rights are realised, but we have provided referendums on gay marriage, reproductive rights and divorce.  This is the only issue still outstanding.  Adopted people are still the only people who do not have fundamental human rights in this country.  Our laws are quite deficient in protecting the exercise of this human right and all attempts to reform the law have come up against entirely unreasonable and sometimes just mysterious barriers that do not exist in other societies that have similar legal systems to ours.  I have experienced these barriers as an adopted person in my own search for identity and contact with my birth family and as a politician - as Deputy, Minister and T&aacute;naiste - advocating reform.  Therefore, as someone who was adopted, I stress that it is absolutely urgent that we provide for legislation which allows people the right to their personal information.<\/p> <p> We need to implement the adoption tracing legislation as a matter of urgency in order that adult adoptees in Ireland can access their own records concerning their birth families.  This Government has been stalling on this for two years.  I know the Minister herself is committed to the issue, but the Government overall is inhibited by some mysterious barriers that, frankly, I have never been able to understand.  I am really concerned that the will of the Government is lacking on this issue and that the legislation will stall further as birth parents die and adopted people age, so we will \"age out\" of this issue.<\/p> <p> From all the revelations of recent decades in respect of mother and baby homes, Magdalen laundries and other institutions, including adoption societies, we know there is a great deal of hidden information concerning adopted people's birth parents and families that rightfully belongs to those adopted people.  By the way, I wish to stress to the Minister a point that relates to the scoping exercise and why I think many people have professed some unease about it.  As the Minister knows, the commission on mother and baby homes does not include St. Patrick's Guild, it does not include the Rotunda Girls Aid Society and it does not include, I reckon, at least 30 or 40 other organisations, not to mention all the freelance nuns and priests who privately arranged adoptions.  Just this morning, I sat with someone who was born in Holles Street and handed over to a loving adoptive family - no doubt about that - but as she traced her history, she discovered her adoption was not registered until years later, when the family was adopting another child.  This is multilayered and multifaceted and really needs to move before, as I said, most of the people involved die.<\/p> <p> In the period from the introduction of adoption in the early 1950s up to the 1980s, when the number of adoptions decreased dramatically, more than 40,000 people were adopted.  Most of these people are still alive; many of their parents are not.  As the Minister herself has said, we are talking about up to 150,000 records or more if we go back to the foundation of the State.  In one of the last denials of personal freedoms in Ireland, many adopted people are still locked out of access to their own files.  It is difficult to understand this when we know that the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia for close to half a century have allowed access to information once an adopted person becomes an adult.  This is one of the last veils of secrecy and it sometimes seems that adult adopted people will be the last people to get personal rights in this country.<\/p> <p> I said to the Minister yesterday, and I say it again today, that I can give an example of legislation which was worked on by all parties in this House, about which many people were concerned at the time and which was difficult to progress.  I refer to the transgender legislation.  We came back again and again to that legislation.  I did so as Minister.  People started off with very grave doubts, as many people have, though they will not say so now, about the right of adopted people to information.  We worked that out, and the Minister herself was very involved in that debate.  Will the Minister therefore take courage that she can actually do this?  She is a member of a Government comprised almost entirely of Fine Gael Members.  It is a fascinating insight to go back to the contributions of some Fine Gael Members to the debates on adoption and the fears of strangers walking onto big farms.  They are in the records of the Library, though they may not be accessible at present.  It is a compliment to the children, particularly boys, who were farmed out as labourers once they hit the age of 14 and the girls who went to work as maids and servants in doctors' practices and middle-class homes all over Ireland.  It should be borne in mind as well that when families gave children up for adoption, the minimum fee for St. Patrick's Guild, from all the records I have seen and the personal stories I know, was &pound;100 at the time of the Act for a baby plus &pound;5 for clothes.  With that, people who were often in desperate circumstances were given assurances that the baby would be well adopted.<\/p> <p> If I had an anthem for tracing on adoption, I would definitely use the Frances Black song \"All the Lies That You Told Me\" because that is what this is about.  It is about secrets and lies, and we have not rooted them out yet.  So many people who have been adopted have brothers and sisters from whom they were separated.  I know myself from working with people on this issue that many people who ended up giving up children for adoption were in long-term relationships.  That was not always acknowledged.  In some cases these people went on to marry.  The social mores and church mores of the time made them give up the first babies they had, and that baby then went on, hopefully, to be adopted by a good family.  Pretty much anything was preferable to living one's life permanently in an institution.  Of course, this was known very widely except to the adopted person.  Very often the story gradually came out at family functions - weddings, funerals and suchlike - at which people said, \"Do you not know you are adopted?\"  There was a kind of tap on the shoulder to tell the adopted person some particular feature of the adoption and of the family relations.<\/p> <p> The Minister needs to take her courage in her hands and talk to those other people in the Cabinet.  We have gone through a full five years, since I was last in government, of talking about it.<\/p><p>Deputy Enda Kenny proved persuadable that he should issue an apology to those who were in the Magdalen laundries.  It is the Minister's job to persuade this Taoiseach that he should lift the veil of secrecy.  He and others have benefited from our acknowledgement in full of other rights, but this D&aacute;il still has not acknowledged the rights of adopted people to their personal histories and information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400028#DD00500","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528984200,"counter":276,"content":"<p>The next speakers on the list are Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett and Mick Barry.

I appreciate it.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to make a few brief remarks on the issue of adoption.  What has emerged in light of the illegalities and forced adoptions in this State is a scandal that cries to heaven for justice.  The idea that young babies and children were forcibly removed from their parents without their consent is something that should cause the most serious and sustained reflection on our part.  It is a betrayal of the ethos that I and many hundreds of thousands of others in this State believe which says that every human life is precious and of infinite value.  It should never have happened regardless of the intention or the motivation.<\/p>  <p>  A mother&rsquo;s love is something sacred and utterly unique.  The bond between her and her baby is like nothing else in the natural world.  We should have cherished that love.  Instead we betrayed it and there is no hiding from that plain fact.<\/p>  <p>  I have listened to the stories of those who were caught up in the facts emerging about St Patrick&rsquo;s Guild and in particular to one story of how a young mother came back to her room to find her baby had been removed.  Who can imagine the terror and horror that that young woman experienced?  How can I or any one of us speak to the pain of such a horrible event?  We cannot.  All we can do is walk with these people and offer them the kind of compassion and friendship that they ought to have received all those years ago.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday, my staff and I attended the briefing which the Minister provided which was most informative and helpful and I thank him for that.  As the Minister observed, recent events have utterly changed the legislative landscape in terms of how we approach this issue.  There was a definite sense that what we want to achieve is the greatest possible outcome for those caught up in scandals like that of St Patrick&rsquo;s Guild.  It is an issue that I hope will rise above party squabbles and be treated with the kind of respect and dignity it deserves.  I know there are issues relating to the adoption register in terms of data protection and so on, but those can be addressed in the fullness of time during the debates that will no doubt take place in this House when the adoption Bill comes before us.<\/p>  <p>  We must address the wounds of the past.  We cannot ignore them but we must deal with them fairly.  In the heat of debate, and I am sure the Minister will agree, we cannot lose sight of that fact that justice must be extended to all those religious who genuinely gave their lives and their love to the children in their care.  While there are stories that horrify us, they are not the full picture.  Not long ago, my office was contacted by the relative of two aunts who were nuns from the 1940s until very recently.  They both gave their lives in establishing medical and orphanage care to thousands of young children in this State.  For many years before they died, people would come to them and thank them for the only instances of human warmth they ever received.  Their generosity of soul cannot be airbrushed out of history.<\/p>  <p>  Our top priority must be about establishing urgent redress for those caught up in the recent adoption scandal.  As Deputy Clare Daly noted at yesterday's briefing, age is not on the side of many of those seeking justice and the truth about their children.  Anything we can we do in terms of access to records must be done to help speed that process along.  Archbishop&rsquo;s House has indicated that it will assist in this matter, and that is to be greatly welcomed.  Subjecting these people to trauma at the beginning of their lives was bad enough but to do it to them again at the end of their life would be unforgivable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400030#FF00500","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1528984200,"counter":280,"content":"<p>We are discussing something that was an illegal practice.  It is was the falsification of birth certificates.  To my knowledge, only one person has ever been prosecuted for this crime in the history of the State, a woman named Mrs. Keating who ran an illegal adoption agency or racket from her private nursing home, St. Rita's, in Ranelagh.  Her activities were first brought to the attention of the garda&iacute; in 1954, yet she was not prosecuted until 1964, ten years later.  She was sentenced to the probation Act.  After her sentencing, a priest went to visit the then Taoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass, to plead her case so that she would not lose her nursing home licence.  While he waited in the corridor to see the Taoiseach, he bumped into the Minister for Agriculture, Charles Haughey, who asked what his business was.  When the priest told him, Haughey laughingly replied that &quot;half the babies born in St. Rita's were fathered by members of the D&aacute;il&quot;.<\/p><p>As Mike Milotte, reporting this quote, observed in a recent article:<\/p><blockquote>A gross exaggeration, no doubt, but a timely reminder that for every crisis pregnancy there was a putative father in the wings, often men in positions of authority, employers, respectable members of society, other women&rsquo;s husbands, priests even, and, yes, politicians &ndash; all of them equally protected from disclosure by the practice of falsifying birth records.<br \/><br \/>Is it any wonder it has taken so long for the State to face up to the truth?<\/blockquote><p>It is a point well made.  It is often suggested that this is something that was done as a favour to the woman or to the child, but the protection of men, including powerful and wealthy men, was also behind this particular racket.<\/p><p>This debate is situated within a wider debate of church-State relations and the historical injustices to women.  The recent referendum was passed by a landslide.  People were repelled by the misogyny of the No side, but on top of misogyny there was also hypocrisy in that it could be seen that it was never a question of loving both but rather of loving neither when it came to women and their children born out of wedlock.  This is another case which makes a power argument in favour of the separation of church and State.<\/p><p>I think it was yesterday when I engaged with the Minister in the House on this issue.  I asked her if this issue of hundreds, and potentially thousands, of illegal adoptions had been brought to the Department's attention in 2011 and again in 2013.  I pointed out that the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, assured the D&aacute;il that all adoptions in the State since 1952 had been in accordance with the law, namely, the Adoption Act 1952 and subsequent legislation.  This position was restated, not once but twice, by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, when he took over the reins in the Department of Justice and Equality.  That is false.  It was not the case.<\/p><p>The other day, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, told me there was not absolute proof in 2013.  If the proof was not absolute, there were enough strong clues to warrant a full audit of all files in the State.  That did not happen, however, and it is still not on the Minister's agenda.  She spoke of a sample audit.<\/p><p>I put it to the Minister that, on the grounds of the health of the people involved and their records alone, that is not sufficient.  There needs to be a full audit backed up with the proper resources for Tusla in terms of money and manpower to make sure we get to the bottom of this for once and for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400030#FF00600","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528984800,"counter":282,"content":"<p>There has to be a full audit because the State has failed potentially thousands of people whose identities and records were, in some cases, falsified.  In other cases we do not know if they were.  That can have very serious implications at so many different levels for the people affected in terms of their right to their identities, medical histories and heritages.  There is simply no alternative but to give the full audit that has been requested by those who have been campaigning for many years to bring this issue properly into the light and to have a full audit of the files carried out.<\/p>  <p>  This scandal arises from the fact that the Catholic Church and religious bodies were given control over adoption services in this country and that control was exercised in a story of secrets, lies, cover-ups and, in many cases, almost certainly illegal activity.  We have to get to the bottom of that.  The saga has gone on for too long.  The consequences for some can potentially be awful.  It is not a story that is over.  It is not past history for huge numbers of people but one that continues to work its way through their lives and existences now and which can have all sorts of implications.<\/p>  <p>  In my case, as one who was adopted during that period, having talked to both my birth family and my adoptive family, both insisted that things were done correctly at the time at both ends of the process.  The adoption papers are therefore in order and the original names went on the birth certificate.  What none of them know, however, is what happened in between.  That is the point over which neither the biological family nor the adoptive family, which would have acted in good faith, had any control.  They would have had no control over what the church and its institutions were doing in the middle of the process and what was motivating them.  As Deputy Barry said, in many cases their motivations were to protect the identities of prominent people, to hide more generally the reality of Irish society and to provide cover for an atmosphere and regime which they created and generated which in many cases forced women who had children outside marriage to give those children up, either by generally creating an atmosphere or often by directly physically pulling children out of the hands of their mothers.<\/p>  <p>  In my case I was very lucky.  I was adopted by a very loving family and was then lucky enough for my biological mother to also come and find me.  I have two families, which is brilliant, but for many people the adoption may not have worked out so well.  Perhaps they cannot find their biological families and they are blocked at every hand's turn.  The absence of accurate records in many of those cases means that they may be frustrated and may never find out.  There was absolute falsification in some cases.  I am aware of some of those cases.  There was absolutely blatant falsification to protect particular people.  I do not believe there is any alternative but to have a full audit to do justice for those who are caught up in this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The last point I make is that this is, yet again, a reminder of the urgency of separating out church and State in all sorts of services, whether adoption, the welfare of children in our schools, or our hospitals.  What is at the centre of this?  It is that religious morality trumped people's rights and that the institutions to which the State had outsourced these absolutely critical services, as it continues to do in the cases of health and education, believed that their particular morality was more important than the law and than the rights of individual human beings.  That lesson has to be learned and that separation has to be achieved.  That is not a statement against people's religious faith by the way.  I want to stress that.  It is not an attack on people's Catholicism or whatever.  It is about saying that religion is a private matter and that those institutions should not have control over vital services and over the lives of individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400031#GG00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1528984800,"counter":283,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that the title of the Minister's speech today is &quot;illegal birth registrations&quot; and the fact that she has used that strong terminology.  I understand from the person who works in my office that is not what is going out.  The term &quot;incorrect&quot; is going out, but the title of the speech is &quot;illegal birth registrations&quot; and I welcome that.  I also welcome the Minister's announcement on 29 May.  That is the day on which my mother died many years ago.  I cannot imagine coping with a false registration of the death or birth in addition to the grief.  I will be coming back to that in a minute.  Having looked at the documents St. Patrick's Guild had given her quite some time before, which is a point I will also come back to, the Minister announced on 29 May that there were 126 cases of illegal registration in the period between 1946 and 1969.  Nobody was shocked by that.  The shock came because it had taken so long.  My additional shock came because she made that announcement through a press conference rather than coming into the D&aacute;il, the democratic forum, and presenting her findings in context.  I have a difficulty with that.  I want to work with the Minister and believe in her bona fides.  I would have been helped in that if she had come in and explained the situation to us.  I understand that the documents from St. Patrick's Guild had been with Tusla since 2016.  The Minister then made an announcement in 2018 without putting it in context to explain the delay.<\/p><p>As I have done every time I have stood up on this subject, I will again quote from briefing papers that were given to the highest officials in the HSE with a note that said they should go all the way up to the Minister.  In respect of the mother and baby home and Bessborough, and in the context of the Magdalene laundry, where information came up the people in charge said that it was beyond their scope.  This is what they highlighted.  In both of these cases, that is, in both mother and baby homes, of concern &quot;were interference with birth and death certification which requires further investigation&quot;.  This was written in October 2012 with a note to send it up to the Minister.  This is as a result of the Martin McAleese report and his investigations.  &quot;Children, if not the mothers who passed though these systems are likely to still be alive and at the very least&quot; this should be investigated.  It goes on and on to say that this is a serious issue.  In addition I will quote one more little thing from one of the notes on 12 October 2012.  It is easy to remember.  The 12th month in the 12th year:<\/p><blockquote>This may prove to be a scandal that dwarfs other, more recent issues with the Church and State, because of the very emotive sensitivities around adoption of babies, with or without the will of the mother.<br \/><br \/>A concern is that, if there is evidence of trafficking babies, that it must have been facilitated by doctors, social workers etc., and a number of these health professionals may still be working in the system.<br \/><br \/>It is more important to send this up to the Minister as soon as possible: with a view to an Inter-Departmental Committee and a fully fledged, fully resourced forensic investigation and State Inquiry.<\/blockquote><p>That note is from 2012, this is 2018.  It was six years ago so I hope the Minister will forgive me if I appear cynical.  When one comes from a large family one inevitably encounters lots of problems and learns from them.  I was not shocked by this nor were any of the other people I know.  Indeed survivors have spoken about these illegal practices for years.  Conall &Oacute; F&aacute;tharta, who deserves an award, spoke about this back in 2010, eight years ago.<\/p><p>He has written about it practically month after month since.  The story has arisen time and again and successive Ministers have either failed or refused to act.  I cannot count the number of Ministers involved.  There were at least three, but a lot more since the 1950s.<br\/><br\/>There is knowledge and evidence dating from as far back as the 1950s.  In the 1990s, the national archivist ,Catriona Crowe, revealed the extent of the problem and the fact that the Department responsible for external affairs had knowledge of the practice as early as the 1950s.  Mike Milotte published his book <i>Banished Babies <\/i>way back in 1997, the year my second child was born.  I am not sure whether the Minister read it.  I understand it has been reissued lately.  It added much to the detail of Catriona Crowe's discovery.<br\/><br\/>Since 2010, the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>journalist Conall &Oacute; F&aacute;tharta has revealed time and again the practice of forced and illegal adoptions carried out by the State and religious and private institutions.  Furthermore, I understand that another article by the journalist this week reveals that Tusla has now raised concerns about a further 748 adoption cases from St. Patrick's Guild alone.  It is extraordinary that we have to rely on journalists for our information.  There is evidence of names being changed, references to payments being made - often of &pound;100 - the placement of children with no corresponding adoption orders and other irregularities.  What precisely is the nature of those irregularities?<br\/><br\/>Tusla has produced three interim reports.  All preceded the announcement of 29 May.  Where are they?  Can we have sight of them?  Can that be published?  Why have they not been published?  The third interim report was prepared on 10 May.  It states that 611 children were identified as having been sent overseas and that a deeper review and analysis would be required to track the journey of each infant from birth to the point where he or she left the jurisdiction.  I understand that Tusla revealed that, while dealing with tracing inequities since it took possession of St. Patrick's Guild's records in early 2016, it has discovered a significant number of suspected illegal registrations, dating as far back as June 2017.  We know that the AAI informed the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in 2013 that St. Patrick's Guild was aware of several hundred illegal registrations.  The response of the Department at the time was nothing short of insulting.  It stated that an audit of adoption records was of limited benefit and would yield little useful information.  Can one imagine that for a response?<br\/><br\/>We know this problem goes well beyond St. Patrick's Guild.  It is only one of an estimated 180 institutions that facilitated adoptions in this State.  Theresa Hiney Tinggal was illegally adopted from an agency outside St. Patrick's Guild.  She has been campaigning on this for ten years.  Her feeling is that she has been absolutely ignored by three Ministers, whom she names.  They were in power prior to the current Minister.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Paul Redmond, the chairman of Adoption Rights Now, has said the practice in St. Patrick's Guild was far more widespread.  Mr. Fergus Finlay stated on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; recently that he believes every single agency in the State was involved in illegal adoptions.  I hope I picked that up incorrectly because it is an extraordinary statement.  I do not need to tell the Minister that everybody has a right to know his or her identity.  We have an obligation to ensure people who want to know can find out where they come from.  It has implications for everything, as the Minister knows.  People far more articulate than I am have referred to this in respect of medical history and health implications.<br\/><br\/>It is imperative that there be a full and thorough investigation of all files concerning St. Patrick's Guild and all adoption agencies.  We have no choice.  If the Minister wants to start a new role, this is the only way to do it.  If she reads the briefing notes from 2012 and still sticks with the old ways, we will be lost.  This is a golden opportunity to do it right.  Having a targeted sampling exercise is just not good enough.  This cannot be a game of chance for the people involved such that some will be lucky enough to be included while others will not.  We must include all survivors in a full investigation.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the Minister's commitment to pushing the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill and ensuring it will pass through the Seanad as expeditiously as possible.  I must state, however, that I have a fundamental difficulty with the undertaking that is being asked for.  I cannot see myself voting for it, much as I would like to do so.  It is huge.  It is being stated that there will be no penalty if the undertaking is broken but that sums up Irish society.  We make people give an undertaking but if they break it, which is only human, we do not penalise them, thus bringing the law into disrepute.  The law has been brought into disrepute on every level.  Laws have been ignored and broken and laws have been made up to suit the Church.  I cannot tell the Minister what my personal and professional experience and my having the privilege of being a Deputy have done for me.  Institutions do not change.  They simply lie, cover up and hide unless leadership is shown from the outside and unless they are pushed to do what is required so we can learn.  None of this was accidental.  This was a deliberate State policy, by and large affecting poor families and poor children.  This is the subject of another day's discussion.  For today, I ask the Minister never again to make an announcement such as that made at the press conference.  If she wants us to work with her, she should set out in the D&aacute;il how the information came to her attention and the nature of the delay from 2016 onwards when she had the information and knew the implications.  If she does this, I will happily work with her and she will restore my trust in the system, which is at an all-time low.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400031#GG00300","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528985400,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I am very appreciative of the contributions of all the Deputies.  They help me and my officials as we continue to work on issues that have been of such profound significance to so many people for such a long time, as Deputy Connolly just indicated.  I am aware of this and of the various circumstances and research findings the Deputy has just shared in the Chamber.  They are exceedingly helpful and we are listening.  We are attempting to offer a way for 2018 under my leadership.<\/p>  <p>  I will try to respond to the issues raised to the best of my ability.  We will continue to come back to them, not least in the context of the Bill.  Deputies Connolly, Boyd Barrett, Mitchell and others mentioned the investigation of other records and the specific further analysis I have asked for.  I see that as a really important and sensible step in terms of the methodology of approaching the 100,000 files that are under the jurisdiction of the State.  I have not said that is the end.  I am very open to moving beyond that.  We have tried to design the process in such a way that it will be relatively quick and so we will know that, after the first four months approximately, we will be in a better position to determine how we might move forward.  Much of this concerns the issue of methodology, something of which, as a former researcher, I am aware.  Officials are now identifying a methodology to ascertain whether they can consider some aspects of a huge number of files in the initial stage in order to determine whether something should be done next and, if so, what.  From having listened to other stakeholders, in addition to Deputies here, I realise it may be recommended that we need to go further, in which case a methodology will be presented, but it strikes me that in order to move forward in this regard, we might also need to engage a wider group of stakeholders, particularly but not only inclusive of advocates, adoptees, archivists, relevant journalists - some of whom Deputy Connolly mentioned - and genealogy experts.  Deputies have called for this.  It may be that drawing on some the wider expertise, which seems to be what is needed, might help us to proceed more effectively than by using more traditional forms of research.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p> I have received, as have other Deputies, a number of representations from people who believe they are illegally registered.  Those are people who have come forward as distinct from us examining the 100,000 records we have, and they are being examined in a particular way as part of the research.  Those are a few examples that might impact on the methodology in terms of moving forward.  I do not want to pre-empt any decision that may be taken but from listening to what is being said on the airwaves, this is an issue that runs very deep across many thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people's lives.  We have an obligation to find ways to ensure that we discover the evidence of illegal registrations to the best of our ability.  That answers the question in terms of the initial investigative research.<\/p> <p> In terms of the records, and people have identified this also, we have 100,000 cases that are under the jurisdiction of the State.  An estimated 50,000 records, although the figure is probably more than that, are not in the possession of the State such as those in adoption societies where records have not yet transferred to either Tusla or the Adoption Authority of Ireland, AAI.  I refer to PACT, Cunamh, St. Brigid's Adoption Agency, nursing homes, health professionals and private individuals.  There are many more records that are not in our possession to allow us do something about it.  As Deputies are aware, the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill would provide a statutory basis to acquire those transfers but there may be other ways to do that.  I understand the urgency expressed by the Deputies about this issue.  As Deputy Mitchell said, these things are going on.  I could voluntarily request the transfer of records but there are potential difficulties with that.  It may not be clear who has what records.  A voluntary request could be ignored or complied with in part only.  The holders may cite data protection issues.  I am not saying that will not happen but there are difficulties with that also.<\/p> <p> Deputy Rabbitte raised the issue of capacity, particularly within Tusla, and conducting further research.  I am aware, and the Deputy is right to raise it, that to conduct further research to ensure that information and tracing service will require additional capacity, both to eradicate the current waiting times for people, apart from the 126 or the others who are now suspect, as well as the increased numbers that will necessarily be the case in light of the changing context.  I am aware of that capacity issue.  It is about money, but it is also about people.  We need to find a solution urgently to that issue.<\/p> <p> Deputy Burton said that we do not want to age out this issue.  I agree with her.  That is why I am trying to initiate and lead a way forward to ensure there is a deeper sense of urgency in light of what we have found in that high bar of evidence.  She said that people have a right to their personal history, which is a very helpful way of expressing it, as well as a right to information and tracing.<\/p> <p> Members referred to the fact that 740 other cases were identified by Tusla, and they may be added to the list.  My understanding is that was part of the number it started with but it sifted through those and did the cross-referencing with the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the General Register Office, GRO.  Some of those dropped out in terms of coming to a higher level of certainty in terms of evidence of illegal adoptions because, as the Deputies are aware, when we have that number of cases, we need first to move towards contacting the people.  The State requires a high level of certainty, higher than would be required in terms of making those kinds of approaches.  It is different if people are coming towards us or indicating that they would like us to investigate something.<\/p> <p> In terms of the Bill, Sinn F&eacute;in Members believe that people ought to have a right and unfettered access to information.  Deputy Burton and others are probably in agreement with that.  I mentioned meeting Deputies and Senators yesterday with my officials.  I would wish to pursue that in the context of the Bill.  I want to push the boundaries as far as we can in terms what is constitutionally permissible but we hear what they are saying.  As I said, we are operating in a changed context and I hope that gives us more possibility.  I have not covered all the questions but we will have other opportunities to discuss them.<\/p> <p> In terms of the number of actions that need to happen, I wonder if it is time to consider a process of telling and hearing the truth about the way women and children were historically mistreated in Ireland and expanding and correcting our national record of the development of the State and our treatment of one another in it.  There is a social history model coming from the mother and baby homes commission.  That will be helpful in that regard but I refer again to a mode of transitional justice.  Moving from a legacy of human rights abuses requires us to acknowledge, record, accept and apologise for those abuses and our collective responsibility for them.  It is a process that perhaps could be survivor centred and designed with the needs and the hopes of survivors in mind.<\/p> <p> It may be time to consider a scope.  We are living in a present that is still attempting to respond appropriately to the Magdalen laundries, the mother and baby homes and this adoption illegality issues.  We may need to reckon with our national history of gender and justice, inclusive of the ways in which it has impacted on boys.  I take Deputy Martin Kenny's comments about home boys as well as men.  These are other issues I will be considering as we move forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400032#HH00300","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Independent Clinical Review of Maternity Services at Portiuncula University Hospital: Statements","time":1528986000,"counter":287,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400033#JJ00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1528986000,"counter":288,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the Portiuncula University Hospital Health Service Executive, HSE, review of the maternity services and of a known number of adverse events between 2008 and November 2014, also known as the Walker report.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to begin by expressing my deepest sympathies to the families involved and welcome the completion of this review for them.  I also thank them for their engagement in the review process, which was so important.  The review was carried out by an external clinical review team led by Professor Walker.  The learning from this review will help with the development and delivery of maternity services in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The Walker report has two parts.  First, it provides a review of the maternity service provided by Portiuncula University Hospital, which is part of the Saolta University Health Care Group.  Second, it reviews the care 18 babies and their mothers received and presents the overall findings from across these cases.<\/p><p> I wish to recall what happened in Portiuncula University Hospital, how the issues came to light and how my Department and the HSE responded.  Portiuncula University Hospital provides maternity services alongside general hospital services.  It is a model 3 hospital providing 24-7 acute surgery, acute medicine, critical care, emergency department and maternity services.  In 2017, there were 1,668 births.  The maternity department comprises 33 beds and four delivery suites.<\/p> <p> In 2014, six babies were referred from the hospital for therapeutic hypothermia, also known as head cooling.  This is used to try to reduce adverse effects from a lack of oxygen to a baby&rsquo;s brain at the time of delivery.  The hospital considered that six babies being referred for head cooling was higher than expected and, in November 2014, a preliminary review of these cases was undertaken by the hospital.  This preliminary review found a cause for concern in the management of labour in some cases.  As an immediate action, Portiuncula University Hospital agreed, and put in place, corrective actions and protective measures, including a process for the ongoing monitoring of all deliveries.  The hospital undertook an audit the following month, in December 2014.  This was to assess whether the recent changes were effective.  The audit confirmed that all protective measures had been fully implemented and provided assurance that the services in place were safe.<\/p> <p> Following the preliminary review, an external review was commissioned by the Saolta University Health Care Group in February 2015.  The purpose of the review was to provide a general review on maternity services and to consider the care provided in the individual cases.  The external review team was set up to operate to a number of terms of reference.  These terms provided for a review of the maternity services in general and a review of the individual cases.  In early 2015, an expert review team of seven members was established.  This was chaired by Professor James Walker, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology from the University of Leeds.  The membership comprised two obstetricians, two midwives, two neonatologists and a patient advocate.<\/p> <p> At the commencement of the review the external team established a patient helpline for families who may have had concerns about their care.  As a result of this, an additional 12 cases involving ten families were identified.  In addition to the six babies covered by the preliminary review, the final external review covers the care provided to 18 babies and 16 families.  I am assured that throughout the review process the HSE communicated with and met families and offered any services that they required to support them in dealing with the issues that arose.  The review commenced in April 2015 and each case had an individual systems analysis conducted to identify the care received.  These individual reports were provided to the families in April 2017.<\/p> <p> I turn to the report's findings.  I wish to extend my sincere sympathies and thoughts again to the families impacted.  I thank them sincerely for coming forward, sharing their experiences and inputting to the review.  By outlining those experiences, bringing their stories forward and demanding change, they have helped us to try to improve our maternity services, leading to the improvements that have been put in place.  The clinical review team found that of the 18 cases reviewed, serious errors in management occurred in ten.  The team considered that if those errors had not occurred, there would probably have been different outcomes for those babies.  To recognise the trauma and hurt for the families, I will record for the D&aacute;il the outcome for the babies involved.  There were three stillbirths, three baby deaths, two babies with developmental delays, four babies who have ongoing issues and six babies who are considered to be doing well.<\/p> <p> We cannot underestimate the extent of the impact of these events on the families, relatives and communities involved.  It is important that the learning from the report and the experiences of these families should be a driver for change across all our maternity services in order that we can improve the experience of women and families as we go forward with our maternity services.  To distil the learning, the report identifies a number of causal and contributory factors which affected the care received.  The findings encompass a number of key areas, including lack of appropriate staffing, training across the multidisciplinary team, provision of clinical care, slow recognition of maternity incidents, communications with families, lack of open disclosure and lack of bereavement supports.<\/p> <p> Important recommendations were made and I will outline some of them to the House.  There were 35 key recommendations in total and the HSE has been asked to address them as a matter of priority.  The recommendations include changes related to the care environment, training, provision of clinical care, staffing and improvements needed to deal with communication.  The report outlines the need for the maternity services to respond to increasingly diverse and complex population needs to provide safe, evidence-based, accessible care to all women, babies and their families.  It also highlights the need for maternity networks supported by effective leadership, management and governance arrangements.  These are recommended to share expertise across maternity services.  Data collection and use of information to detect patterns and ensure ongoing review of care provided are highlighted.  Recommendations are made on the changes to how maternity services are staffed, the skill mix used and priority areas for training in order that maternity services can respond to increasingly diverse and complex population needs to provide safe, evidence-based, accessible care to all women, babies and their families.<\/p> <p> We clearly need action on foot of this review.  I have been advised that Portiuncula University Hospital has an implementation team in place to progress the recommendations and that most of the actions have been implemented.  I thank the local team that has been working on this.  Local Deputies will be aware of the work that has been ongoing to ensure the recommendations are implemented.  Some of the key changes at the hospital include additional staff and a number of senior appointments.  A director and assistant director of midwifery were appointed in 2016 and the number of consultants has increased to five from three.  In addition, I am advised that training on open disclosure, CTG reading and relevant clinical issues has taken place in the hospital.  I particularly welcome the fact that the implementation team includes input from some of the families affected.  The implementation team must involve the families to drive the changes.  That is important to ensure the findings of the review translate into meaningful improvements in care as experienced by the patients in the service.<\/p> <p> Finally, I refer to the ongoing work being undertaken at national level to facilitate the provision of a consistently safe and high quality maternity service.  Ireland's first national maternity strategy was published in 2016.  It is incredible we did not have such a strategy until 2016.  That probably gives us an insight into how maternity services were, perhaps, the Cinderella of our heath service.  I am pleased that the previous Government delivered the first strategy.  It is important and it enjoys widespread support across the House.  However, it is no good having a strategy if there is no forum in which to implement it.  The HSE national women and infants health programme was established in 2017.  The programme is entirely dedicated to women and infant health care, delivering the national maternity strategy and driving improvements in maternity services nationally.  The programme has published its implementation plan and is currently overseeing the establishment of maternity networks, an issue that arises in the Walker report, in all hospital groups.<\/p> <p> Lessons have been learned from a difficult period in our maternity services, and the lessons that need to be learned have been identified.  A number of changes have taken place in Portiuncula University Hospital, as I outlined earlier, but clearly the lessons from there must also be learned at national level.  It must be about delivering the national maternity strategy and applying the lessons across the health service in terms of staffing levels, training for staff and the development of the maternity networks.  Today's debate is a timely opportunity to reflect on the progress that has been made to date and to note the further steps that must be taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400033#JJ00300","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528986600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>On behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, I wish to extend our thoughts to the mothers, fathers and babies at the centre of the Portiuncula University Hospital report.  What the report highlights is truly outrageous and scandalous.  The report on maternity services at Portiuncula University Hospital was released approximately two months ago.  It did not get much attention because we were in the middle of the CervicalCheck scandal and a campaign to repeal the eighth amendment.  The report lays out a scandalous series of failures in respect of mothers, fathers and babies by the State.  The bitter irony is that the report on this scandal relating to women's reproductive health did not get much attention when it emerged because we were preoccupied with two other issues relating to women's reproductive health.<\/p><p> By and large, we have great maternity care in Ireland.  We have one of the lowest maternal death rates in the world thanks to the fantastic work every day of our doctors, nurses, midwives and everyone else involved.  When it comes to women&rsquo;s health and the control of women&rsquo;s bodies, however, this State has a dark past - the Magdalen laundries, mother and baby homes, symphysiotomy, forced adoptions and falsified birth certificates.  The list goes on and on.  Now added to that list is what happened at Portiuncula hospital between 2008 and 2014 and who knows when else at that hospital.<\/p> <p> A total of 18 births were examined.  Six involved either stillbirths or the death of the baby shortly after delivery.  Six of the babies who survived suffered injuries leading to lifelong disabilities.  A litany of errors led to the serious harm and deaths of those babies.  The report found that in ten of the 18 cases there was a relationship between errors made and the outcomes for the health and lives of those children.<\/p> <p> What happened?  The report found there were insufficient resources; insufficient weekend cover, with sometimes no obstetrician and no midwife at the weekends and out of hours, so who was delivering the babies; insufficient leadership; insufficient management and quality control; the wrong staff at the wrong times; the wrong training; the wrong qualifications; and the wrong layout of the hospital.  The list goes on.  The report concludes that all of these errors combined to lead to the serious harm and death of babies.  That serious harm was preventable.  Sadly and soberly, those deaths were also preventable.<\/p> <p> After all of this came the failure to investigate; the failure to tell parents that mistakes were made; the failure to tell parents about coroner reports and investigations; the failure to tell parents that a review was even taking place; the failure to inform the Minister for Health; and the repeated failure to apologise.<\/p> <p> RTE&rsquo;s \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" told the story of just one such family, whose two baby girls died in Portiuncula hospital.  A review of one of the deaths took place in 2011.  The parents were never told about the review, nor were they included in it.  They found out about the review on television years later.  When they found out, they applied for information under data protection legislation and what they discovered was damning.  It included, for example, one email from a person at the hospital saying: &ldquo;Obviously, I am concerned that the coroner&rsquo;s directive to carry out a review will be discoverable.&rdquo;  That is a cover up.  That is what happened.  In 17 of the 18 cases the report found a lack of disclosure.<\/p> <p> We welcome the recommendations and we welcome the Minister's list of things that have improved, but it is not enough.  I am asking the Minister to come back with a comprehensive report listing every recommendation in this report, stating what has happened to date, which have been completed, which have not been completed, and the timeline for when that will happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400034#KK00200","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528987200,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I will share the rest of the time with Deputy Rabbitte.  I thank both Deputy Donnelly and Deputy Rabbitte for sharing time with me.<\/p>  <p>  A shocking litany of failures and errors is outlined in this long-awaited report of an independent review of maternity services at Portiuncula hospital in County Galway.  Of the 18 maternity cases which were reviewed, six babies died and in ten cases there were there serious errors of management that would probably have made a difference to the outcome for babies.  As Deputy Donnelly said, it is important that we remember this evening the babies who died and their families, and acknowledge the horrific heartbreak and trauma which the families have endured and no doubt are still suffering as they come to terms with such huge loss.<\/p>  <p>  The report highlights a number of key issues relating to the service provided in Portiuncula hospital between 2008 and 2014.  These include delays in escalation of concerns to more senior decision-makers, deficits in both medical and nursing staff numbers, poor CTG trace interpretation, and concerns relating to the administration of oxytocin during labour.  The report raised concerns over the communication with families during and after their time in hospital.  The report also highlighted historical issues relating to the governance structures in place between the hospital and the group at that time.<\/p>  <p>  The report made 154 recommendations under five headings.  I know the Minister said that most of those had been put in place, but I would like him to inform us as quickly as possible which have not been implemented yet.  These families have suffered the greatest of all losses, the loss of a child.  That serious errors of management would probably have made a difference to the outcome for some babies in some cases compounds the tragedy.  While nothing can ever compensate for the loss of a child, the State has an obligation to these families to ensure that all of the key recommendations on maternity services at Portiuncula hospital are implemented to ensure that no other mother or father has to suffer the same heartbreak.  That is the very least we owe them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400035#LL00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1528987200,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me.  I had my baby in 2005 and was fortunate.  I gave birth in Portiuncula hospital and had a very good experience.  It is important to put that on the record at the outset.  I attended the briefing session in Ballinasloe on the night it was announced.  Maybe I am cynical, but the strategic release with only 24 hours' notice to coincide with the CervicalCheck scandal meant minimal media coverage and that it flew under the radar.  It was a cynical move by HSE at a time when people were at saturation point when it comes to national scandals and the failings of our health system.  It is another shocking example of the failings of HSE when it comes to perinatal care and health of Irish women.<\/p>  <p>  The key findings from the investigation of 18 cases that occurred from 2008 to 2014 were as follows.  Sixteen families have suffered greatly, including one family that lost two babies.  Six babies have died.  Of the 18 cases examined, serious errors occurred in ten cases which would probably have made a difference for the babies involved.<\/p>  <p>  The lengthy report included more than 150 recommendations - too many to mention here.  Not least was the lack of clinical governance and proper incident management.  The main issues were problems in clinical care and problems with communication after delivery.  For most people attending hospital, clinical care was adequate provided nothing went wrong.  This is setting the bar far too low, hoping that everything will be all right because if it is not, who knows what could happen.<\/p>  <p>  Inadequacies were found in staff ability to interpret abnormal test results and to respond appropriately, escalate care level when needed, make timely clinical decisions, and communicate effectively among themselves about women and babies in their care.  Surely these are basic skills.  The lack of communication among medical and nursing staff on the ground is indicative of a hierarchical structure in which those higher up cannot be questioned.  It is frightening that problems with staff communication after delivery are similar to problems with CervicalCheck.  Information was not given to women and their partners in an appropriate or timely way.  It is clear that this is not a one-off for the HSE but rather something that happens routinely.<\/p>  <p>  In only 20% of cases was communication to parents about what had happened to their baby deemed satisfactory.  Most women felt that they were not listened to before or during labour, that their concerns were dismissed by staff, and that no one explained how unwell their babies were and why.  There was no chance to debrief about what had happened.  Women did not understand why particular tests and procedures were being carried out.  If people do not understand what tests are about, how can they give informed consent?  Technically, to proceed without consent is a criminal offence.  It was generally felt that there was a lack of openness.  This seems to be a common theme across HSE with no open disclosure and no informed consent.  How much hurt could have been avoided by open communication?  What else are we not being told?<\/p>  <p>  Many of the key recommendations are basics and would be standard practice, including clinical handover, staffing ratios, proper induction of new staff, appropriate leadership, the presence of senior staff on wards, and following best practice guidelines.  I know I am out of time, but on the night of the presentation, I was there flicking through the report, as anyone else would do.  What stood out for me was the lack of appropriate midwifery-led care either in the clinics or on the labour ward.  In two cases when appointing the senior midwifery staff member, she was not qualified as a midwife.  That is unbelievable in a maternity hospital.<\/p>  <p>  Pat Nash described the situation in Ballinasloe that evening.<\/p><p>Nurses were not talking to each other, the level of communication was bad and personal issues were getting in the way and affecting how decisions were being made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400035#LL00300","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528987800,"counter":295,"content":"<p>I offer my sympathies to all those women and families affected by the serious and scandalous errors which occurred at Portiuncula University Hospital and resulted in their babies dying or being left with life-changing injuries and disabilities.  I thank Professor James Walker who led the expert review team and authored this report.  While the report into what happened in the care of these 18 babies was much needed, it is a shame that such errors and poor care occurred in the first instance.  As in the case of the report into baby deaths at Portlaoise hospital, this report highlights huge failures, some of which continue to exist in our health service.  Historically, maternity care has often been underfunded, subject to poor medical practices and has been investigated continually as a result of neonatal and maternal deaths and injury.<\/p>  <p>  Reports such as this report into Portiuncula hospital do not exist in isolation.  They follow a pattern of poor care for women and infants in this State.  It is not lost on the women of this State that not only do they receive inadequate maternity care, but even where care is given, there are significant problems due to understaffing, poor practices, inadequate equipment and a health service that is not sensitive to, and does not reflect, gender differences.  In other hospitals, a 20 week scan is not standard procedure.  This is a huge problem across many of our maternity hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  The report criticises the hospital for poor communication among maternity staff and a lack of skills and training to deal with emergency cases.  It found that there was a general lack of skills and training among front-line staff and a lack of obstetric consultant supervision in the labour ward.  It also found that consultants appeared to wait to be called and did not take ownership of the clinical care being given, and this resulted in an inappropriate handover of care.  The report also found that care when things were progressing normally appeared to be of a high standard but the response to a deteriorating situation was often slow and deficient.  This appears to a trend across many of our maternity hospitals and general health services.<\/p>  <p>  When one delves into the report and reads the testimony of those interviewed, one gets a feel for a hospital that was being neglected by management and plagued by difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff.  During interviews, the obstetric consultants at Portiuncula hospital expressed to the critical review team their concern that the level of training and experience of some of the non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, was not of a standard previously seen and that this was significantly compounded by the fact that there was an unfilled registrar training post in Portiuncula University Hospital, PUH, and that junior grades were often filled by locum doctors to cover registrar positions.  Yesterday, Sinn F&eacute;in received a response to a parliamentary question from the HSE, showing that Portiuncula hospital spent &euro;5.6 million on agency staff in 2017.  This is reflective of a crisis in recruiting and retaining staff.<\/p>  <p>  The result of the above problems at PUH was that doctors came with different levels of knowledge and varied knowledge of the Irish maternity system.  The clinical review team, CRT, was also informed that there were no formal clinical assessments of new appointees and no increase in supervision by consultants as there were only three consultants to run the service.  The CRT heard a lot of concerns from the midwifery staff who felt generally unsupported and that the midwifery management structure was fragmented.  The midwifery lines of responsibility were very convoluted and midwifery staff levels were deficient, with a lack of consistent CMM cover in the labour ward.  Midwives had requested more staff as early as 2013.  As a result of these staffing deficits, there was a lack of support for junior midwives, and midwives said they sometimes found it difficult to escalate to an obstetric consultant.<\/p>  <p>  The report found that in many instances systems failures, staff deficiencies, poor practices, a lack of training and skills among staff, particularly agency staff, and poor management and oversight played a significant role in the errors that occurred, which resulted in baby deaths or babies being left with life-changing injuries and disabilities.  Such failings go to the heart of the problems and crises affecting the health service.  Among the issues highlighted in this report are a recruitment and retention crisis, an underfunding of our maternity services, an over-reliance on agency staff, and a lack of appetite to implement the national maternity strategy and bring Ireland into line with Birthrate Plus standards and so on.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue pointed to in the report was a lack of open disclosure of information to the family, an issue arising in so many other areas of our health services, as dealt with in this House in recent days.  Even when information was provided, some of it was withheld and families told the CRT said that they only received information regarding events during delivery a significant time after the baby's birth, often weeks, months or years later.  The CRT acknowledged that it is incredibly frustrating for families not to get important information about their cases in an open, transparent and timely manner.  Time and again, such issues have arisen in our health service, including in the recent CervicalCheck scandal.  My colleague, Deputy Louise O&rsquo;Reilly, who cannot be here due to an engagement with survivors of the transvaginal mesh scandal, introduced a Bill earlier today to make open disclosure mandatory, not voluntary.  This is a critical issue.  The problems and hurt a lack of open disclosure have caused to the women and families affected cannot be understated.<\/p>  <p>  The recommendations contained in this report and the national maternity strategy must be implemented as a matter of urgency.  If these recommendations are not implemented and if the individuals and agencies do not take responsibility for what happened, these scandals will continue.  There should automatically be an inquest into every maternal death, neonatal death or death of a baby during delivery.  Deputy Clare Daly&rsquo;s Coroners Bill provides for automatic inquests in all cases of maternal deaths in our hospitals.  The Government refuses to progress this Bill.  We need to see such legislation enacted as a matter of urgency.<\/p>  <p>  I again offer my sympathy and the sympathy of Sinn F&eacute;in to the women, families and babies affected by this scandal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400036#MM00200","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1528987800,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of the clinical review of the maternity services as Portiuncula hospital and this opportunity to discuss its findings.  I commend the families who came forward, some of whom I know and have met.  They are very brave.  They are not happy with this report and they propose to continue the fight because they do not believe it goes far enough in terms of addressing the appalling experiences many of them had at the hospital.  Like everyone else, I extend my sympathies to the families and extended families affected by this scandal.  Following on from this report, lessons must be learned.<\/p>  <p>  This report is a damning indictment of the manner in which we have treated women in this country.  Publication of this report went below the radar because of the time at which it was published.  I share Deputies' concerns in this regard.  This report was long delayed.  I met the families who told me they had seen the preliminary version, and although they were not happy with it, they knew it was ready to be published.  This report was published at the time of the referendum and the CervicalCheck scandal, so it did not get the attention it deserved.  The Minister might want to explain why that happened because people are coming up with their own answers as to why it happened.<\/p><p>I have spoken to the families affected and they are not happy with some of the report, though they accept other parts of it.  No amount of apologies from the Saolta University Health Care Groupwill be of any comfort to them because the State let them down.  It let down people who are very vulnerable and who suffered.  One of the families, which I will call &quot;D and C&quot; and with whom I have had communications on a number of occasions, feels the review was inefficient.  They said they would like to highlight the lack of efficiency in the review, question the method and independence of it and question the group, particularly as much of what was going on at times reached the media before it reached them.<br\/><br\/>The report was due originally in the summer of 2015 and has taken almost three and a half years to complete.  This has added enormous suffering to an already traumatic experience and it is unacceptable.  The hospital group had many questions to answer in the time leading up to the report being compiled.  At the time, however, it seemed more concerned about its public relations profile than the families at the centre of this, something which, I contend, mirrors what is happening with CervicalCheck at present.  A lengthy list of the failures in the delivery of maternity services at PUH has been published.  It makes for quite difficult reading.  Serious errors of management occurred in ten cases that would have led to different outcomes.  There was a lack of management, and the process relating thereto, and leadership.<br\/><br\/>In 2014, six babies were referred from the hospital for therapeutic hypothermia, which was considered a higher figure than average at the time.  Therapeutic hypothermia, or targeted temperature management, TTM, is a treatment whereby body temperature is maintained at a specific level in order to improve outcomes following a period of reduced or stopped blood flow to the brain.  Following this, there were an additional 12 cases and we know what happened as a result.  The report represents a catastrophic failing and falls in line with other failures.  I have a very important question for the Minister.  The review has a specific timeframe but these issues did not appear out of nowhere.  I know people who believe that there are issues in this hospital dating from before this timeframe which need to be reviewed.  Will they be considered?<br\/><br\/>I will focus on a number of key points in what is a very detailed report.  The clinical review team noted that a shortage in staff numbers, limited access to training and limited availability of resources impacted upon the ability of PUH to keep up to date with some of the latest developments in skills and techniques in clinical care.  The clinical review team also noted, from interviews relating to the 18 system analysis investigations, SAIs, and PUH training records, that the experience, level of ability and training of some obstetric non-consultant hospital doctors was not at a level previously experienced, requiring greater senior support.<br\/><br\/>We are acutely aware of the ongoing crisis management in respect of staffing at the hospital and across Ireland.  We discussed this recently in the context of the volume of number not on the specialist register who have been appointed to consultant posts.  What happened in the case of Portiuncula also happened in the past, which shows where we are heading in respect of problems in the future.  Such problems will be on a mass scale across many disciplines.  If we are appointing people who are not qualified to take up roles and who do not have the experience, training or knowledge of dealing with cases, we all know where that will lead, not just in obstetrics but also in other areas.<br\/><br\/>The report is shocking and deeply worrying.  Given that the hospital was aware of its shortage of staff, it is baffling that there was no autonomous midwifery to take on low-risk care independently.  This could have taken the form of clinics, led by midwives, in intrapartum care in order to allow doctors to focus on cases where there was significant medical need.  There was also a clear breakdown in organisational terms.  It is nothing new to us to hear of the HSE breaking down in organisational terms.  In 2008, the hospital was a stand-alone operation under the umbrella of HSE west and then became part of the group it is in now.  The review is very critical of this, stating:<\/p><blockquote>... senior staff at PUH did not feel involved and believed that they no longer had ownership of their environment.  It is the view of the CRT that this may have contributed to PUH being less able to respond to the problems that arose at a local level.  At the time of the 2014 cases, incidents were reported onto Q-Pulse initially by PUH staff. Preliminary Assessment Reports (&ldquo;PAR&rdquo;) were completed by PUH and forwarded to the Serious Incident Management Team &ldquo;SIMT&rdquo; meeting.  There was no further action after the escalation of the first two cases<\/blockquote><p>Why was this?  It was because the structures of the HSE did not allow it and there was nowhere to go.  This represent the complete systemic failure of an organisation.<br\/><br\/>It is extremely difficult to read all the clinical issues identified in the report.  I welcome a number of recommendations relating to the care environment, training, clinical care, staffing improvements, the need for effective leadership, change in governance arrangements and data collection.  We all know that open disclosure did not happen but there have been key changes, with additional staff in the form of a director and assistant director of midwifery and an increase in the number of consultants to five.  However, we need to ensure that this report is implemented.  We also need to ensure that, where there are other cases, they will be dealt with independently.<br\/><br\/>We also need to learn from this on a number of fronts.  We have a national maternity strategy which, even as Opposition spokesman, I would say is brilliant but it is not being funded.  A new hospital is required in Limerick but it cannot even get a couple of million euro for it to start.  There are issues over neonatal brain injury rates.  Are voluntary hospitals sharing their neonatal brain injury data with the HSE?  Are there any outliers that we need to be concerned about?  Evidence which has been sent to me suggests that there may be.  Is there any resistance to data-sharing in this area?  Does the national women and infants health programme have sufficient authority to oversee outcomes on behalf of the Department of Health?  Are voluntary hospitals dealing with outcomes appropriately?<br\/><br\/>It would be wrong not to mention the correlation between the recommendations in this report and the Bill I introduced in the House yesterday.  The Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2018 is a critical small piece of legislation based on the death of Conor Underwood, the son of Derek and Mignon Underwood, in Wexford General Hospital.  Where a stillborn birth occurs, there is not the capacity for the family involved to seek redress.  This is an anomaly and, in the context of the issues identified in this hospital, I ask the Minister to co-operate with the Department of Justice and Equality to ensure that it can be speedily added to another Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400036#MM00300","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528988400,"counter":298,"content":"<p>First, I thank the families affected who came forward with their concerns about maternity hospital services at PUH.  I express to them the condolences of the Solidarity-People Before Profit group.<\/p>  <p>  The manner in which this State has treated women and children has been both a recurring theme and a major issue for Irish society.  Indeed, the recent referendum was part of the overall debate within society about these matters.  The neglect of women and children in the 20th century is becoming better known.<\/p><p>The House has just discussed the situation facing those who were adopted and whose births were registered illegally.  This State has a shameful record when it comes to mother and baby homes and industrial schools.  The matter we are discussing, however, relates to maternity services in this century, not the distant past.  There are people in this House who have been members of Cabinet at various points during the period in question.  The recurring theme of neglect of pregnant women and children has continued into this century.<\/p> <p> The review identified 18 cases between 2008 and 2014.  A number of children died and those that did not die suffered serious conditions such as brain damage and cerebral palsy.  The children and their parents are facing that situation.  Births, of course, are not without risk.  However, this report identifies factors in these cases that could have been avoided.  Proper practice and resources would have avoided the negative outcomes.  The report identifies that different management of obstetric care would have resulted in better outcomes for the children in ten of the 18 cases involved.<\/p> <p> The report is clear about the issues at Portiuncula.  There were clear failings in the escalation of concerns.  Staff numbers were not sufficient to meet the needs of mothers and children.  There was a clear lack of staffing at weekends and out of hours.  The relevant consultant or midwife was not on duty on several occasions.  There were also issues with training and practices when there were difficult births.  The lack of use of oxytocin is mentioned as well.  <\/p> <p> Families were not openly communicated with and this intensified their grief.  There are two examples of bereaved parents being contacted about their children by staff members at the hospital who were not aware that those children had died.  This did not happen in the distant past, it was the practice here recently.  What was the Ireland of 2008 to 2014 like?  It was the era of austerity.  Public services were cut back massively.  Political decisions were made to prioritise the bank bailout and to make workers and public services pay for that bailout.  We had severe reductions in public services, including the health service.<\/p> <p> Those in government at the time were austerity Ministers.  Budgets were slashed and burned.  Political decisions have a real effect when they reduce budgets.  We have a ballooning waiting list in our public health service, with hundreds of thousands of people awaiting various procedures.  Cuts to public spending mean fewer staff in our hospitals at times when they are needed.  Anyone visiting a hospital knows the dedication and professionalism of healthcare workers.  What happened at Portiuncula was that there was a lack of training, resources and staff to serve the needs of women and newborn children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400037#NN00200","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528989000,"counter":300,"content":"<p>The release of this report came at the height of the CervicalCheck scandal and it landed with less impact than it deserved.  The CervicalCheck scandal hit the headlines.  It was, unfortunately, an opportunity for some politicians, who may have been asleep at the wheel regarding this issue for the past ten years, to get a few headlines for themselves by shouting and roaring.  They woke up and realised that there are deep-seated problems in the HSE with respect to owning up to and learning from mistakes.  It is unfortunate that the news cycle can only fit in one scandal at a time.  Perhaps we can learn from that.  It is important that we talk about the import of the Portiuncula report.  I am sick of talking about the catastrophic failures in our maternity services.  I refer to the failure to admit mistakes which gives rise to the failure to learn from them.  That leads to catastrophic harm to women and their babies followed by delay, cover-up, denial and the whole brutal cycle starting all over again.  More than anything else, that is what strikes me about this report.<\/p>  <p>  The report was released three years late.  It was so late that Warren and Lorraine Reilly, the parents of two of the babies that died in Portiuncula, Asha in 2008 and Amber in 2010, initiated legal proceedings because of the delay.  We should say that Mr. Warren Reilly said he and his wife had never intended taking legal action.  They thought that the review, which started in January 2015, would give them the answers they sought.  It was, however, repeatedly delayed.  They had no option but to take on a solicitor to try to get the answers that they desperately wanted and deserved.  This is what happens in so many cases.  People want answers; that is all they want.  They are forced into court when they find the door slammed in their faces and then experience all of the trauma, stress and expense involved in getting those answers.<\/p>  <p>  It is wholly unacceptable and we, as a society, have to address it.  There is no doubt that serious failures are outlined in the Portiuncula report.  Those failures led to or contributed to the deaths of six babies and injuries to six others.  These major failures, which obviously had catastrophic outcomes for the babies, the women and for the families, should not come as a surprise to anyone.  Although we constantly hear about the excellent quality of our maternity services, the sad fact is that there were 31 inquests into baby deaths in the Republic of Ireland in the ten years between 2007 and 2017.  In June 2016, the investigation of baby deaths at Portiuncula hospital was only one of many.  Of our 19 maternity units, seven at that time were either under independent investigation or involved in inquests.  That is a shocking statistic.  The story of Portiuncula is the same as it has been everywhere else for the families involved.  In addition to their dreadful sense of loss, they have had to cope with the overwhelming stress of trying to get answers from frightened hospital staff and an intransigent HSE.<\/p>  <p>  I will give one example.  The inquest relating to baby Amber Reilly, who died in 2010, was held in 2011.  The Dublin coroner, Dr. Brian Farrell, wrote to Portiuncula hospital asking for a full review of its maternity services to be carried out.  In early 2015, Amber's father, Warren, said that the family had never been contacted about the review and had no idea if it ever happened.  That is unbelievable.  In February 2015, the Saolta University Health Care Group announced a review following the deaths of two other babies.  It said that the review would cover a nine month period in 2014.  The Reillys only learned of this review via the radio.  They realised at once that it was not going to cover the deaths of their two babies, Asha and Amber, both of whom died in Portiuncula.<\/p>  <p>  The Reillys were like so many families in this State.  Mark and Ro&iacute;s&iacute;n Molloy are struggling to get the truth about the death of their baby, Mark, in the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise.  The Reillys had to go public before the cases of their babies were taken into account.  How utterly shocking is that?  They only learned in 2015 - after the second review was announced - that a review of Amber's death had actually taken place in 2011 and that recommendations had been made.  Even worse, those recommendations had not been followed through at that time.  That is appalling.  After the 2011 review was completed, a doctor at Portiuncula hospital wrote to the State Claims Agency about sending a copy of the review to the Reillys.  He wrote that he did not see any place in the correspondence with the coroner where a copy of the report was required to be given to the parents of a deceased baby.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400038#OO00200","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528989000,"counter":301,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Topical Issue Debate","time":1528989600,"counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400039#PP00100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Applications","time":1528989600,"counter":303,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400039#PP00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1528989600,"counter":304,"content":"<p>Two minutes is very little time within which to convey to the public the situation surrounding the application by the Muojeke family.  The Minister is well aware of the case, based on my own representations and those of my constituency colleagues, Deputies Corcoran Kennedy and Nolan.  He is aware that the initial application for refuge or asylum by Ms Muojeke was made in 2006 and 2007, for herself and her two children, Nonso and Victor.  Following a refusal in 2009 based on legal advice, in 2016 the applicant made an application to the courts to revoke that appeal, which was dismissed by the High Court in recent weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the merits or otherwise of the application, I wish to inform the Minister that the children of Ms Muojeke have excelled, thankfully, in the meantime, against all the odds.  They have flourished in their schools, in their community and in our country.  The petition handed to the Minister today and which was made available to other Members of the D&aacute;il shows that over 20,000 people support this family's case, and support the contention that they are excelling.  Victor, the older boy, is now on a scholarship at the University of Limerick.  Nonso is at Tullamore College and is an integral part of that community and that education system.  They are as Irish, I believe, as the Minister or myself.  They have not been a financial burden on the State, and will not be going forward.  <\/p>  <p>  When one re-enters the country after having been abroad, as we all have done, it is gratifying to hear an official from the Department of Justice and Equality welcome us home.  There is a great sense of pride in that, and a sense of comfort in that welcome, and an association with community attached to that.  These children will never witness that if the Minister does not show the leniency it is within his power to show in this case.  The Minister saw the petrified looks on the faces of these children and their mother when he met them briefly today.  They believe themselves to be in a perilous situation, despite the effort and good will of everyone concerned, including school staff and students and the wider community in Tullamore. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, acknowledged the new compassion that exists in this country - which thankfully has no boundaries - in response to the recent referendum.  He said that those women that had previously taken the boat and the plane would now be offered the hand of the State.  The Minister for Justice and Equality now has an opportunity, between the application to the High Court and any subsequent application to the Supreme Court, to show compassion, based on humanitarian grounds.  Irrespective of the negligence or otherwise of the State in dealing with the case over a period of time, the State must recognise the capacity for these children to excel and to acknowledge the sense of welcome that these children experienced and which should not be forgotten.  <\/p>  <p>  I implore the Minister, in the short amount of time I have, to use the discretion available to him in this exceptional case.  I am not disregarding the processes or the legislation associated with applications for refuge or asylum.  As a Member of the Legislature I stand over those processes.  However, one has to recognise and acknowledge that Nonso, quite apart from Victor, his brother, has been here since he was two years old.  He has appreciated everything that has been afforded to him in this country.  I ask the Minister, on compassionate and humanitarian grounds, to look favourably on this matter and to use the power that is available to him by virtue of his position, to grant leave for these people to remain in this State and to let them get on with their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400039#PP00300","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1528989600,"counter":305,"content":"<p>As Deputy Cowen knows I am most familiar with this case.  Indeed, I met Nonso Muojeke today in my office.Of course, I am immensely sympathetic to his situation and I understand why there is concern among his friends.However, it is important to state that there is a huge volume of misinformation in the public domain about this case, and this is a concern to me.  As the House knows, as Minister for Justice and Equality it is not my practice to either comment publicly on individual cases or to interfere in a case that is still before the courts.  I have been informed that the legal team of the appellant has lodged papers yesterday seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, so this case remains <i>sub judice<\/i>and, accordingly, I am particularly constrained in what I can say.<\/p><p>Last year alone there were over 2,290 individual applications made for international protection by asylum seekers.  Each of these cases is processed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, in accordance with the law.  In going about its work, INIS is acting in the name of the Minister for Justice and Equality, but from a practical point of view I do not intervene in the processing of cases which are governed by clear laws and procedures and subject at all times to the supervision of the courts.  From time to time a case will come to me directly for consideration, and I have given an undertaking that when this particular case has concluded in the courts I will give the application full consideration on humanitarian grounds.  I pledge to do that.  More generally, while control of our borders and the operation of an effective immigration system are important duties of State, Ireland has always been recognised as an open and welcoming society which operates an open regime with many pathways for non-EEA nationals to enter and remain in the State lawfully.  This duty is at all times subject to the law, including our international human rights obligations.  <\/p><p>As I have already mentioned, INIS manages Ireland&rsquo;s immigration law on a daily basis.  This is a huge undertaking.  In 2017, there were over 250,000 applications in areas ranging from visa applications to citizenship applications to permissions to reside in the State.  When a person comes to Ireland seeking international protection status he or she enters a legal process, during which all aspects of the applicant&rsquo;s case, including full consideration of his or her rights to a private and a family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, are considered in some detail.  A decision is made and the applicant is either granted international protection status, granted a formal permission to remain in Ireland or is told that he or she does not qualify for either status and must therefore leave the State. <\/p><p>In circumstances where a person&rsquo;s case is refused and he or she does not avail of the option to voluntarily return to his or her country of origin, a deportation order will be made.  That person will be given time to get his or her affairs in order before removal from the State.  The Deputies should note that the decision to make a deportation order are not made lightly.  In fact, far from it.  The process is exhaustive, with various avenues of appeal open to those who get a negative outcome at first instance.  These decisions of the Department are subject to appeal, including judicial review in the superior courts.  INIS processes hundreds of thousands of cases each year.  I do not personally see these cases, and with the volume concerned nor could I be expected to.  This case was treated in the same manner as other such cases.  <\/p><p>Immigration officials often have the difficult task of balancing the individual rights of persons with the wider obligation to maintain the integrity of the State&rsquo;s immigration system, taking all factors and the circumstances of each case into account. <\/p><p>Some decisions are appealed to the courts and at that stage become <i>sub judice<\/i>.  This is the situation that has pertained in this case, so I have to comment that the matter is before the courts.  Once this case has concluded before the courts, however, I will give due consideration to the circumstances of the case, including any humanitarian considerations.  Under international law, Ireland is obliged to operate an international protection mechanism under which those who come to our shores seeking international protection can have their claims fully considered.  I am satisfied that the mechanisms in place under the International Protection Act 2015 provide for a fair and comprehensive examination of each claim made before a decision is taken to grant or refuse international protection, or to grant or refuse permission to remain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400039#PP00400","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528990200,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response and I note what he has said.  He started by saying that while he was sympathetic towards the case, he was concerned that certain aspects of it are not in the public domain.  That is worrying.  I realise the duty that is on Deputy Flanagan, as Minister with responsibility for these issues, and on the State to act in accordance with various human rights norms.  I recognise that the Minister and the Department have a duty to implement the laws concerning such applications that exist in this land.  Of course I do.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a duty on the State, and on the arms of the State that have charge of that responsibility to follow their processes.  In 2009, they did not.  It was not until 2016 that this applicant sought to revoke the deportation order.  I am puzzled to hear that an application has been made to the Supreme Court.  I am not aware of that, and I spoke to the legal representatives earlier today.  That notwithstanding, it has not been granted.  The Minister has an opportunity to intervene at this stage if he so wishes.  I take him at his word when he says that he will not intervene now but he will do so when the Supreme Court has had its say, irrespective of what the verdict might be, but especially if it is a negative one.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, during that process, irrespective of who was at fault, which somebody may well have been, these children were enrolled in State schools and were afforded an education.  They were afforded a welcome by the staff and pupils and by the communities they resided in, so much so that 20,000 people saw fit to sign a petition to implore the Minister to use the powers available to him.  I would not make a habit of this, nor would I expect anybody else within the Chamber to do so.  There are times, however, when one has to stand up.  There are times when one has to recognise that this modern country, and the modern generation of which these children are members, do not see the barriers that existed in Ireland in years past.  The recent referendum showed us that the prejudices that existed in other generations thankfully do not exist in the present and upcoming generations.<\/p>  <p>  If the Minister has made a decision not to intervene at this stage, which is his right, based on information that an application has been made to the Supreme Court and has been accepted - information that was not available to me when I spoke to the applicant's legal counsel earlier today - perhaps he will agree to intervene on the conclusion of that process, when he believes he has a right to do so.  I accept, acknowledge and appreciate that.  I would have hoped, however, that it could have been done earlier.  I hear what the Minister has said.  We will hold him to his word, and I expect those who signed that petition, everybody associated with this and those watching will do the same.  Without a doubt, we acknowledge the duty of the Minister, the State and the Government to uphold the law of the land.  If the Minister upholds the law of the land, however, he must ensure that the armoury available to it is acted upon.  If it were acted upon in this case, maybe we would not be here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400040#QQ00200","speaker":"1217"},{"type":"speech","time":1528990200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I repeat my concern that there has been a great deal of misinformation about this case in the public domain.

This case is still before the courts.  As I have consistently said, as Minister for Justice and Equality I do not interfere with cases that are before the courts.  When the court proceedings conclude, however, I will use my powers as Minister to consider this case fully, including from a humanitarian point of view.  As Minister, I do exercise ministerial discretion from time to time.  Having a functioning and transparent system is a critical component of immigration systems, not only here in Ireland but right across the world.<\/p>  <p>  I remind Deputies that 2,926 individual applications for international protection made were made last year alone.  Applicants for international protection from the UN-recognised refugee producing countries are prioritised.  Each applicant is required to comply with the laws of the country during the time their application is being processed.  Ireland has reformed its immigration system to address lengthy time periods associated with applications.  With the commencement of the 2015 Act on 31 December 2016, we now have a single procedure.  This is the biggest reform of our protection process in more than 20 years.  It is in line with our intention to provide first-instance decisions in the shortest possible timeframe.<\/p>  <p>  I do not doubt the sincerity of Deputy Cowen.  I hope that is mutual.  I regret that I cannot comment on individual cases that are before the courts because they are undergoing due process.

The hearing of the Committee of Public Accounts was extraordinary for the lack of information that the acting chief executive of the HSE has on this issue.  He has met Dr. Scally only once.  Also, the programme manager of CervicalCheck has never met him or spoken to him.  While what Dr. Scally has said about the provision of information is accurate, the head of the programme offered him a facility through the HSE for direct electronic access to all the information he required.  The head of the HSE did not know that today until I pointed it out to him, even though he was sitting beside him.  He complimented him on putting it forward, even though I had to go through the management system.<\/p>  <p>  My issue is that I sat down with the Minister and negotiated in good faith on several occasions.  Through its spokespeople, the D&aacute;il decided to go forward with this scoping inquiry, which I now regret because I think we should have voted on it.  My concern is that this scoping inquiry has drifted into becoming something different.  The D&aacute;il also decided the timeline.  The date of completion was the end of June.  Now the Government has decided to push that back to the end of August.  I want a guarantee from the Minister that this will not drift beyond the end of August, and that he will call back the D&aacute;il so we can set up the commission of investigation.  The latter point is not for debate, despite Dr. Scally saying numerous times in interviews that he would decide whether one was needed.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister give this House a guarantee that this will happen?  I am concerned that this will continue to creep.  I do knot know if Dr. Scally will be able to complete the work, as he feels it is constituted, by the end of August.  I understood that he was to have quick facts, that he would ascertain the key requirements for the terms of reference, and that then we would set up the commission of investigation.  That was his role as I understood it.  I commend him as a person.  His CV is excellent.  However, this has gone way too far.<\/p><p>I do not believe we will get the quick information we require for the families of the women who have died and for all of the women who are in very difficult health situations currently who need answers quickly.  If the Government, as opposed to the D&aacute;il, has decided that this will go to August I want it absolutely guaranteed that it will be concluded by August, because the commission of investigation cannot commence until the D&aacute;il is sitting.  The Minister will have to bring back the D&aacute;il on 1 September, or a date close to it, for the investigation to commence.  This is not what was agreed.  I am willing to give its completion the benefit of the doubt, if that is what the Minister advocates, however, that date must be locked down.  I want all ten terms of reference fully completed by that date.  I also want to see a complete change in attitude from the HSE on information provision and how Dr. Scally gets access to people and information for this.  The Minister has a role to play in this.  I request specifically that the Minister actually meets the people in CervicalCheck in Limerick.  They have asked me to ask him to do so to get a full picture of what is going on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400040#QQ00500","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528990800,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I accept Deputy Kelly's invitation to visit CervicalCheck in Limerick.  We are entering a frantic number of weeks with regard to legislation, but at the earliest possible opportunity I will visit there.  It would be extremely beneficial.  I also want to thank the people who have been working on the front line.  I believe they have been working extraordinary hours in recent weeks and months to try to get on top of this.  I heard Deputy Kelly acknowledge this earlier at the Committee of Public Accounts meeting.<\/p><p>I thank Deputy Kelly for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to update the House and answer some of the questions he put to me directly.  For the record of the House, on Tuesday I published two interim reports prepared by Dr. Scally outlining the work he has carried out so far as part of his scoping inquiry to date.  One report is a progress update and the other is a first report addressing point D of the terms of reference on information for women about screening.  This is a very important area of work.  There are nine other areas, but I know we agree rebuilding confidence in the screening programme is very important with regard to what women are told when they go to the screening programme about consent and open disclosure.<\/p><p>I welcome Dr. Scally's recommendations, as I know the Irish Cancer Society does.  I have heard a number of women and next of kin who have been impacted by the audits welcome it also.  I have accepted all six recommendations in full.  I also welcome his approach to the work.  I welcome the fact Dr. Scally seems absolutely to have the confidence not just of people in this House but of the families with whom he is interacting.  I have heard some very positive feedback from them and from some patient advocacy groups in terms of how he is going about his work.  I thank Deputy Kelly for acknowledging this.<\/p><p>Deputy Kelly is right that Dr. Scally has requested he be allowed to continue his work until the end of the summer.  He said to me quite honestly that he could, in theory, rush his report but he did not believe it would do justice to the issue and that he would like to work his way through the summer months.  This reflects the need to engage with more women and families affected and also to go through the sheer volume of documentation that he has received.  Importantly, he has not said by any manner or means that he is off until the end of the summer, good night and good luck.  He has said he will continue to provide discrete reports as they are completed so we can get on with implementing some of the practical changes.  I would like to see something on governance, on which he is working within the terms of reference, and something on the laboratories and the review of contracts.  I welcome the fact that today the HSE confirmed he will get access to those contracts very quickly.  This is vital.<\/p><p>I want to be crystal clear on the record of the House that there is no ambiguity about this.  There will be a commission of inquiry.  There will be a statutory inquiry.  I am committed to establishing one.  I brought a memo to the Government to establish one.  Let us be honest, I have to acknowledge that when I first came into the House it was my original intention to set up a HIQA inquiry.  Deputy Kelly pointed out the limitations of this and advocated very strongly.  We worked on a cross-party basis.  There will be a commission of inquiry.  I believe, as do most people in the House, that there is value in Dr. Scally answering as many of those terms of references as he possibly can over the summer period so we do not have to put a huge body of work into a commission that could go on for far too long.<\/p><p>I want to stress that Dr. Scally is very committed to the work.  It is important we give him the time he has requested to complete his inquiry in a comprehensive manner.  He has asked that that be until the end of the summer.  It should be acknowledged that Dr. Scally was only requested to provide an update on progress at this stage but he went further than that in providing one other report.  One of the recommendations made was on an <i>ex gratia<\/i>payment, which obviously we accepted in full.  I want to say on the record, in case of any confusion, this is not instead of compensation, redress or support packages.  It is an additional support and its sole purpose is to ensure there are no financial obstacles to any woman or her family participating fully in the inquiry.<\/p><p>Deputy Kelly knows that the recalling of the D&aacute;il and when the D&aacute;il sits is not a matter for me, but if Deputy Kelly is asking me whether I want to see the commission of inquiry established in September and whether I want to work with Members of the House to make it happen the answer is that I do.

Dr. Scally's comments in the media really worried me, when he thought there may not be need for a commission of investigation.  His scoping is very tight.  There are ten terms of reference but they are only to find the basic facts.<\/p>  <p>  One of the things I believe he has to do is get the cytology results of the 209 women by laboratory, by date, by grade, by cytologist and graph them and show where the issues are and, basically, put it out there so we can see where the problems are.  We do not have time to document all of these poor women's stories.  They do not have the time.  Remember, these are the same laboratories with the same shiny accreditation using the same staff and quality assurance and under the same tenders that are carrying out the smears now as in the 209 cases, which number, we heard today, will increase.<\/p>  <p>  My real issue is that as long as this creep and this drift towards a longer period continues we will not get to the bottom of how these women ended up in the situation in the first place.  We need to get there quickly and then we need an investigation as to what happened.  We need to make decisions based on Dr. Scally's scoping exercise.  The Minister has to ensure it is completed by August because I will come back in here, and the Minister knows I will, if this is not concluded by August.

I thank Dr. Scally for his superb work and I look forward to more of his recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400041#RR00600","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rare Diseases","time":1528991400,"counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400042#SS00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1528991400,"counter":319,"content":"<p>I raise the issue of a lack of a designated expert in the Health Service Executive, HSE, for those individuals who suffer from Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, EDS.  The Minister is aware that this is a group of syndromes relating to connective tissue disorders.  The way in which they affect patients varies greatly.  For some, the condition can have a profound impact on the quality of life.  It has an impact not just on health but in many cases on an individual's mobility.  That can range from relatively normal to very severe.<\/p>  <p>  I will raise two cases in Clare with which I am very familiar.  The first is Aoife Sage and the other is Zara Cronin.  Aoife was diagnosed aged nine and her condition since has deteriorated rapidly from initially having some weakness or fatigue, with episodes of fainting and dizziness, to what is now joint pain and the requirement for a wheelchair.  She is now 14.  She suffers from instability in the neck and with certain movements her neck becomes dislocated.  One can imagine the impact this has had on Aoife, who is unable to attend school.  Her condition now is such that home schooling is not even an option for her.<\/p>  <p>  There is no care available for her in the Republic.  She has visited London for certain scans and there is some assistance in that regard.  However, her condition, bad and all as it is, can be improved, along with her quality of life and mobility, if she can access surgical intervention that fuses parts of the head and spine.  I am no medical expert in that regard but I understand her parents have consulted with a private clinic in Barcelona.  I am aware that in the case of Zara Cronin the same solution could apply.  I am also aware of a number of other cases throughout the country.  They are relatively small in number but we understand there could be a significant benefit for those sufferers if they could access the surgery.<\/p>  <p>  The difficulty is the State is not in a position or has not been in a position to provide funding as the available care is not in the public service anywhere in Europe.  It is, however, provided for in this clinic in Barcelona.  It is pretty clear from what I have seen and read that this intervention would have a very significant impact on the lives of the two girls with whom I am familiar.  It is incumbent on us in this House and in the Department not to stand back from intervention because it is exploratory or at an early stage when there are recognised positive benefits for others.  I appeal to the Minister to look at the cases again.  I know there has been some communication between the Department and these families and others with a view to providing funding at this stage to ensure these children can be treated in the private facility in Barcelona.  We can then develop our skill sets so we can try to be in a position to treat other individuals who will present at a later stage.  I accept it is not possible to put in place that clinical care and intervention overnight here but it is available elsewhere.<\/p>  <p>  I met the parents of these girls and Aoife's have had to do a crowdfunding exercise.  I attended an event in Shannon the other night where the families and friends from the area around Sixmilebridge, Shannon and Newmarket came together in desperation to try to put funds together to help this family.  The people on the ground get it and understand the positive impact that this family could experience.  Anybody I have spoken with who knows the family, in some cases better and for longer than me, knows this is genuine and this will make a difference if the surgery is successful.  It cannot be done without money.<\/p>  <p>  I know we have come through a difficult time in the country but in this day and age should we be seeing a family effectively begging from their neighbours to collect money in order to have a medical service provided to their beautiful daughter?  It says much about how we as a society react to children in dire circumstances.  In fairness, the Minister while in the Department has demonstrated a great capacity to address serious matters as they arise.  I hope he can do the same here and deliver some good news.  I hope he will be in a position to meet the parents of these two children who might act as a representative of others suffering the same condition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400042#SS00300","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1528991400,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Dooley for raising this important matter.  I begin by saying he is entirely right when he says people on the ground get it and we need to do better.  It is a fair summary.  I have been familiarising myself with the condition in recent months and as the Deputy correctly states, I have heard from a number of families doing the very best for their children.  I would be happy to facilitate a meeting with the Deputy and some of these parents to discuss the matter in the coming weeks.  We can set that up shortly.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for providing an opportunity to outline where we are and what we can do to ensure we better serve these children in future.  EDS is classified as a rare disease, which is defined in the European Union, EU, as a disease or disorder affecting fewer than five in 10,000 of the European population.  Although each disease is individually rare, there are a great many rare diseases.  Collectively, rare diseases affect a large number of people and are significant contributors to a number of population health outcomes in terms of their high mortality, morbidity and disability.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland published a national plan for rare diseases in July 2014.  On foot of the plan a national clinical programme for rare diseases and a rare disease office has been established.  In 2017, the Department published a progress report and update on all 48 recommendations of the rare disease plan.  This interim report represents a detailed review of the implementation of the national plan.<\/p>  <p>  EDS is not one condition, as the Deputy knows, but a group of several clinically distinct conditions.  It has a relatively high prevalence of one in 5,000.  It affects the connective tissues and most commonly can cause joint hypermobility.  Once diagnosed, joint hypermobility syndrome can be treated with a mixture of exercise and physiotherapy.  An exercise programme to improve fitness and muscle strength may also be effective at reducing pain.  The nature of joint hypermobility syndrome means that patients are at increased risk of injuries such as dislocations and soft tissue injuries.  Managing joint hypermobility may, therefore, involve treating short-term injuries as they arise while following a long-term treatment plan.  The more severe forms of EDS, as the Deputy referred to, require specialist treatment often by multiple specialists but usually under the care of the specialist for the most severely affected organ system.  These specialists can be paediatric cardiologists, rheumatologists, neurologists and orthopaedic surgeons.  Where surgery is required, it is provided for in the context of surgical and orthopaedic services for patients with EDS.<\/p>  <p>  The most severe cases of EDS are rare and are usually managed by specialists at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  I am advised by the HSE that the total number of patients with severe EDS nationally is between 20 and 40 patients.  In late 2017, the HSE national clinical programme for rheumatology completed a significant piece of work relating to a model of care for rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this is at the final stages of approval by our health service.  This model aims to ensure that the patient is seen, assessed and treated by the right person in the right place and in the timeliest manner.  With the implementation of this model of care, the programme will develop disease-specific pathways for disease groups, including EDS as part of hypermobility diseases.  There is a new plan coming down the tracks that will include patients with EDS.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for his helpful comments and suggestions.  EDS is, without doubt, a significant condition causing very distressing symptoms and may often require a range of specialist multidisciplinary treatments.  We need to do better by these children.  For those patients most severely affected where surgery is required, surgical treatment, especially in children, forms part of the current management of symptoms.<\/p><p>I especially welcome the ongoing work of the national clinical programme for rheumatology and its new model of care for patients, which includes EDS as part of hypermobility diseases.  This can bring us to higher terrain in how we care for patients in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400042#SS00400","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528992000,"counter":322,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister's commitment at least to meet the parents of the two children in question.  I will be in contact with his office and we will try to arrange such a meeting in the next week or so.  What is clear from the Minister's answer is that the HSE is still of the belief that it has an appropriate plan and model of care to deal with these complex cases.  My interaction with the families indicates that is not the case, and I hope this will be brought home to the Minister when he meets the parents.  While some of it is exploratory, good work is being done in Barcelona on cranial fusion and fusion within the spine.  The Minister should see some examples of this work.  The HSE will obviously want to manage this disease in Ireland, but we must be prepared to look elsewhere, as we do with the management of other diseases for which we access care in other countries when specialist training is not available here.<\/p>  <p>  The families are familiar with what can be done and want to stand by their daughters and give them every chance.  The State has a duty and an obligation to assist them in this regard.  For this reason, rather than getting into a set piece here, I would like to engage with the Minister and his Department to try to find some way of assisting the families.  It is not fair, given everything they must do for their children, that these parents should spend valuable time trying to fundraise from a community that is nonetheless prepared to help.  Up to &euro;100,000 would be required to cover the various costs associated with a family relocating to Spain for a period.  For a community such as County Clare to fundraise for two families is too great a burden.  It is incumbent on us to resolve the matter here and to do so, if necessary, by way of a pilot project or programme in order that we will learn and benefit from it and that other children who present in future will have the benefit of the learning these families will, I hope, be in a position to provide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400043#TT00200","speaker":"1274"},{"type":"speech","time":1528992000,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I assure Deputy Dooley that my answer was not meant in any way to suggest that everything is absolutely appropriate and adequate in this regard.

The National Transport Authority's announcement on Tuesday of plans for new bus corridors in Dublin has caused confusion, unease and distress for many of the people living along the 16 affected routes.  Approximately 20,000 households live along these 16 routes and it is planned to procure 1,300 portions of property by means of compulsory purchase order.  As the Minister is well aware, traffic is beginning to clog up the arteries of Dublin in a way that is not sustainable and can no longer be ignored.  Naturally therefore, any plan to alleviate congestion and improve the public transport offering is to be welcomed wholeheartedly.  The Minister has overseen a great many public transport developments in his tenure, including the plan to electrify the DART network, the opening of Luas cross city and plans to deliver MetroLink and upgrade the Luas green line.  Many capital spending plans for transport have been advanced on his watch and these will leave a tremendous legacy in the decades ahead in public transport, public investment and preventing further deterioration in traffic in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  That said, the NTA's communication to the affected residents leaves much to be desired at this early stage in this sensitive process.  As I said, some 20,000 households live along these 16 routes.  We have been told specifically by the NTA that 1,300 households will have a portion of their property compulsorily purchased from them.  If the number involved is so specific, it raises the question as to whether the NTA knows exactly which properties will be affected.  I suspect it does, which raises follow-on question as to why on earth the people who will be affected were not informed, consulted, written to and treated with basic respect, not only as stakeholders in this project, but also as citizens of this country.  They deserve that at the very least.  It is a regrettable misstep by the National Transport Authority to announce a plan at this halfway point.  The NTA will make further announcements in September concerning the affected services within the existing bus network.  I am not entirely sure why it could not have liaised with the affected residents and held off on these route announcements until then.  That would seem a sensible course of action.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that this is not a problem of the Minister's or Department's creation.  However, I would appreciate it, and I know residents in my constituency and elsewhere, particularly those affected in Rathfarnham who have been in touch with me and Deputy Colm Brophy in droves, would be very grateful if the Minister used his considerable influence to impress upon the NTA the need to learn lessons from this and to communicate better and more thoughtfully and inclusively with residents and stakeholders in future.

It is unusual to get a Topical Issue matter under this heading, so I am very grateful to get one today.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy represents very well the apprehension which obviously exists among a large number of his constituents and others that they will somehow be hit by this very dramatic, transformational and radical attack on congestion in Dublin city.  I have spoken to the National Transport Authority about this matter, including its communications, and I am satisfied with its explanations, while still understanding the Deputy's view.  The NTA has indicated that the launch this week related only to what it describes as indicative routes.  Obviously, nothing is set in stone when one launches 16 indicative routes and changes may still be made.  Identifying 1,300 houses that will be affected could be dishonest and alarmist and some of the households identified may not ultimately be affected.  The NTA has, I believe, identified an approximate number as honestly as it possibly can, while leaving room for discussion on the routes.  The final decision on which households will be affected will be taken soon.  From my discussions with the authority, it appears that decision will be taken in October or about three months from now.<\/p>  <p>  What is more, the NTA is absolutely adamant that it will speak individually to every one of the affected households.  It gave me that assurance this morning.  Some people may look forward to a small section of their land being taken off them if the astronomical amounts appearing in the media are correct.<\/p><p>The problem with issuing square footage valuations is that each square foot has a different valuation.  Some places in south Dublin have incredibly high valuations, while others elsewhere are very low.  That is also the case in north Dublin.  Therefore, one could not have an average estimate by square foot. <\/p> <p> I suspect we will see very laborious but very democratic dialogue.  They will engage with each individual household on a market valuation and, inevitably, some cases will go to arbitration.  The State has a mechanism for doing so.  I hope it will be a dialogue that satisfies the Deputy and others who are rightly concerned and will remove the apprehension some people will have when the routes are identified in the future.  That will mean that this extraordinary bold step to relieve congestion will be successful.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge that the Deputy is correct in that some people will be discomfited.  That is to be regretted, but the big picture is that while we will not remove congestion forever, we will make dramatic inroads in easing it in this city.  The number cycling will increase and the time it takes people to get to work will, on average, be halved.  That is a serious goal we intend to achieve.  I am sorry that some people will be inconvenienced, but there will be real dialogue and they will be generously compensated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400043#TT00600","speaker":"1213","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528992600,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister who I appreciate has had negotiations with the NTA on this matter.  It is clear that he is on top of the issue which he is approaching with sufficient gravity and seriousness.  It is interesting that the NTA uses the phrase \"indicative routes\" for the mid-way plan it announced on Tuesday.  It also used the phrase in describing the recent metro plans, except that in that case, while there was great dissatisfaction at the length of time the affected stakeholders - owners of properties along the route - had been given, they were told about the indicative plans.  If owners of properties along the metro route were informed of indicative plans, surely it is inconsistent that those who potentially will be affected on the Bus Connects routes are not.  Of course, the Minister is correct that, by their nature, indicative plans can be changed, particularly when 16 routes are being planned in parallel and I acknowledge that it is entirely possible that many, perhaps even all, of the routes will change somewhat as the public consultation process gathers steam.  However, I believe one critical component, regrettably, has been overlooked in the NTA's communication.  Significant numbers of people have been upset.  The No. 44 bus links the Minister's home area of Enniskerry with mine.  I wonder if I were to hop on the No. 44 bus to Enniskerry tomorrow morning to knock on 100 doors and tell 100 people that roughly 5% of them would lose their gardens, would they be concerned, upset, distressed and alarmed.  That is effectively what has happened.  There are 20,000 properties along the 16 routes and we were told a specific number of owners, 1,300, or between 5% and 7%. would lose a portion of their property.  The question is outstanding and one we will have to put to the NTA when its representatives are before the transport committee next week.  Nevertheless, I appreciate the level of engagement and the fact that the Minister has pointed out that it is a radical plan, which it is.  Dublin needs such a radical plan to deal with public transport issues.  I have full confidence that the Minster is aware of how cohesive that plan needs to be and hope that in coming years we will manage to deliver on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400044#UU00200","speaker":"1304"},{"type":"speech","time":1528992600,"counter":329,"content":"<p>Everything the Deputy has said is authentic and genuine and we should take what he is saying to heart.  The consultation process will be extremely extensive and I think the dialogue will be successful, but that does not meant that there will not be court cases.  There always are and there will be some, but I do not think we should lose sight of the big picture which is halving the time it takes people to get to work.  In fact, they will be more than halved because if we to continue on our current course, travelling times and traffic congestion will continue to increase.  Instead, we will have a speedy, reliable bus service which will moves at a pace we have not seen before.  People will get to work and arrive home earlier and buses will be able to keep to timetables, something they could not do before.  It is also part of climate change policy and the programme for the removal of carbon emissions which we have been pursuing with increasing vigour and on which we need to play catch-up.  Having 200 km of dedicated, segregated cycling lanes beside the new bus lanes is quite new and something we should all welcome.  We will also have pedestrian lanes beside them which will encourage people to walk to work.  It is all part of a very big picture.  The Deputy is talking about something that is important and very important to the individuals concerned.  If, in the future, he wishes to bring people to meet me to discuss the issue, I will be happy to transfer their views to the NTA rather than interfere directly.

On behalf of the Chairman, my colleague, Deputy Alan Farrell, I thank the members of the committee for the work they put into producing the report and their careful consideration throughout the extensive hearings on the matter.  I also thank every delegate who provided testimony for the committee and each individual and organisation that made a submission on the topic of cyber safety for children and young people.  It is important that the Government act on the recommendations made by the committee.  They will protect young people, while also acknowledging the benefits of the Internet and social media, particularly in the context of education and communicating with family and friends. <\/p><p>Reviewing the work of the committee on the topic, the contributions which really stood out were those of students from Newbridge College and representatives from Comhairle na n&Oacute;g in counties Clare and Wicklow.  That the committee used the opportunity to hear first-hand the concerns and experiences of young people was positive.  Of the challenges faced by young people, sexting, over-sharing online, cyberbullying and the danger of connecting with strangers online are of particular concern.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>As a society, we cannot put our heads in the sand and pretend these things are not happening.  As legislators we have a responsibility to lead by example, to acknowledge the reality our young people are facing online, to have an open and frank discussion about it and to work to ensure children and teenagers are fully aware of the dangers they may be exposed to and the supports available to them in this regard.  One student from Newbridge College discussed the sharing of intimate images online in her contribution.  She stated:<\/p><blockquote>It is very much a taboo subject, which people shy away from discussing, but it must be addressed.  Many of the teenagers engaging in these activities are not informed of the dangers or the legalities relating to the sharing of intimate images.<\/blockquote><p>This student went on to say: <\/p><blockquote>I believe this issue is getting out of control and becoming a popular trend due to the lack of education and information provided to young people.  We can help prevent and tackle this by raising awareness and being taught the dangers of sexting in school as part of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum or the relationships and sexuality education, RSE, module.<\/blockquote><p>This one contribution highlights the importance with which teenagers view the need the act on social media dangers.  It shows a level of understanding and awareness that may be somewhat lacking in those in our society who may be less <i>au fait<\/i>with social media and with new messaging apps, which are being used by children, teenagers and young people today.  It also shows the need to make sure every individual is aware of the right to be forgotten, which is referenced in the report before the House.  In tackling the concerns of our young people, we must first remove the taboo with which matters such as sexting are often treated and ensure social media companies strengthen their safety policies to protect their users, especially when they are minors.  It is for this reason the report of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs on cybersafety is so timely and important and must be acted upon by Government.<br\/><br\/>We cannot deny that our young people are, in many ways, leading when it comes to addressing concerns in the area of cybersafety.  At the same hearing of the committee, a representative of Clare Comhairle na n&Oacute;g outlined the action it had taken in terms of being proactive and working to provide its members' peers with the knowledge and education they deserve.  This young person outlined the work of Clare Comhairle na n&Oacute;g saying:<\/p><blockquote>Changes in technology, in particular the availability of broadband and cheaper smartphones with data bundles, have changed the cyber landscape in recent years.  In response to young people looking for some direction and education in this rapidly changing environment, we made links with McAfee which had developed a cybersafety programme as part of its corporate social responsibility, CSR, project.  The programme was piloted with 49 young people at the 2015 comhairle AGM and the results were fed back to McAfee.  Clare youth service decided to deliver this programme with funding from the Clare local development company, and during 2016 and 2017, 752 young people, mainly first years, took part in the programme in schools across Clare.  McAfee has adapted the programme according to the feedback from the young people involved.<\/blockquote><p>With regard to the committee&rsquo;s report itself, broadly speaking, the recommendations encompass a number of policy areas and have the potential to be particularly effective, not only in addressing the challenges posed by social media and the online world, but also in educating and encouraging our society in general regarding the responsible use of the internet.<br\/><br\/>Focusing on the area of education, with recommendations that include peer-to-peer workshops in schools, the inclusion of cybersafety programmes in the curriculum and in teacher training courses and the appointment of teachers as digital safety ambassadors, this report provides a guideline on how we can best build upon and complement existing initiatives in a number of our schools.  The initiative to involve young people in the delivery of education and awareness evenings for parents and guardians on this topic would also be worthwhile.  Gone are the days when adults could impose their views or impose restrictions on young people.  Instead we must fully include children, teenagers and young adults in all measures to ensure they are safe online.  I commend the committee on taking on board the importance of utilising such an approach. <br\/><br\/>As pointed out in the committee report, the implementation of the remaining recommendations as set out in the report of the Internet content governance advisory group of 2014, the establishment of the office of a digital safety commissioner and the introduction of a national strategy on children&rsquo;s cybersafety must be prioritised by Government.  The establishment of an advisory task force on the protection of children and young people online must also be progressed by Government.  I note that the recommendation on the digital age of consent has been addressed within the Data Protection Act 2018.  However, we await the legislative changes recommended in the report in line with the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report on harmful communication and digital safety; particularly that section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 should be repealed and replaced with a new offence of harassment. <br\/><br\/>A new provision of harassment must, in this context, expressly apply to harassment through all forms of communication including digital and online communications.  It is an unfortunate reality, as I am sure many members of this House will agree, that the majority of harassment now takes place online.  While we, as Members of the House, have become used to such harassment at times, the fact remains that people not in the public sphere, and young people in particular, may not be as prepared to deal with such harassment or abuse as we may be.  Therefore, the laws of this State must reflect this reality, and as such, this legislative change must be made.  <br\/><br\/>Separate to this offence, and also in line with the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s recommendations, a specific stalking offence should be introduced.  Furthermore, section 1 of the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951 must be repealed and replaced with provisions making the distribution of threatening, false, indecent or obscene messages an offence, whether they are to a person or about a person.  In addition, the distribution of intimate images without the consent of the person depicted in such images must be made an offence.  This also is a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s report.  The fact that the Law Reform Commission made these recommendations and that the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs has now highlighted the importance of these legislative changes must act as a catalyst for the Government to take action urgently.<br\/><br\/>As legislators, we have a responsibility to ensure every individual in this State, and particularly some of the more vulnerable members of our society, including our children and young adults, receive the levels of legal protection they need.  Unfortunately, at this time, we cannot say we have adequately done this with regard to cybersafety.  Our society is becoming increasingly dependent on technology in every aspect whether it is in education, in work, or in communicating with one another generally.  Our laws must now catch up.  Failure to adequately implement the recommendations of the committee&rsquo;s report on cybersafety for children and young people would be to fail our children, our young people and our society in general in terms of providing every citizen with the levels of online security and protection they require. <br\/><br\/>Again, I wish to thank all of the members of the committee and those who provided testimony and submission to the committee for their work and consideration of this topic.  I commend this report to the House and look forward to the detailed scrutiny of this report by Cabinet given the multidepartmental scope of the recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400044#UU00500","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528993200,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I very much welcome the opportunity to speak to the House today on the important subject of cybersafety.  At the outset, I welcome the excellent work done by the joint committee in preparing its report on cybersafety.  It was timely when it was done and it is timely now.  I appreciate and was aware of the great commitment, dynamism and passion of members of the committee and the ways in which it worked together and with other groups and those whom it brought in to speak and to provide evidence, especially the young people.<\/p><p>I know that members invested significant time and effort in studying this topic and in developing a series of recommended actions.  I am aware that the committee took into account the recommendations of the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group in producing its report.  Reference was made a couple of times to the Law Reform Commission.<br\/><br\/>The issue of safety for children engaging in online activity presents a very serious challenge.  Protecting children from online abuse, bullying, grooming and sites with harmful content requires a whole-of-Government approach.  Given the cross-departmental nature of this issue, the Department of the Taoiseach is currently developing an action plan on online safety involving all relevant Departments.  The Taoiseach, in addressing the open policy debate on online safety, held in March, committed to the preparation of such a plan by the end of June.  It will set out an integrated set of measures to ensure we support online safety at all levels.  That was taking up part of the character of the committee's report in terms of encouraging a sense of urgency in regard to the Government.<br\/><br\/>Preparation of the action plan is well advanced, with six Departments, all with responsibilities in this area, working on a collaborative basis to ensure a robust, whole-of-Government approach to the issue of online safety.  The objective is to ensure our collective actions are co-ordinated, complementary and robust.  The work of the committee will help to shape the Government's approach to dealing with this issue.  Deputies will appreciate that I do not have lead ministerial policy responsibility in this area and in the circumstances I do not propose to respond directly to the recommendations in the report.  I do, however, have significant responsibilities and an important contribution to make in ensuring that the Internet is a safer place for children.  In this context, Deputies will be aware that the Children First Act 2015 places a number of statutory obligations on organisations providing relevant services to children.  These obligations include a requirement to keep children safe from harm while they are availing of services, a requirement to carry out a risk assessment and a requirement to prepare a child safeguarding statement that sets out the policies and procedures in place to mitigate these risks.<br\/><br\/>If a relevant service is allowing children access to the Internet where they could become exposed to harm, including harm of assault or sexual abuse, as set out in section 2 of the Act, there is an obligation on the service provider to ensure the risk is identified and that the policies and procedures that are in place to manage the risk are set out in the child safeguarding statement.  Chapter 4 of the Children First guidance provides guidance for relevant service providers on preparing risk assessments and child safeguarding statements.  It defines a risk assessment as an exercise where an organisation examines all aspects of its service from a safeguarding perspective to establish whether there are any practices or features of the services that have the potential to put children at risk.<br\/><br\/>While this includes the risk of harm as a result of access to the Internet, this is not currently explicitly stated in the guidance.  In order to clarify the issue, my Department will be amending the Children First guidance to include a specific reference to the need to consider online safety when conducting risk assessments and preparing child safeguarding statements.  In addition, we will be consulting Tusla to ensure that the template for the completion of the child safeguarding statement also includes a specific reference to the need to consider online safety.  It is my responsibility to ensure that the voices of children and young people are heard and acted upon when we make decisions on Internet safety.<br\/><br\/>My Department undertakes and supports a wide range of consultation and participation processes with children and young people.  These include the development of structures to enable such participation in decision-making by children and young people.  Such structures include both D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g and Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  The joint Oireachtas committee met groups of young people from Comhairle na n&Oacute;g from counties Clare and Wicklow as part of its work.  Deputy Kate O'Connell, on behalf of Deputy Farrell, has already referred to the committee's work.  I was pleased and heartened to see colleagues take the time to listen to what young people have to say.  It is through such engagement that we can learn and find solutions that work.  I met some members after the meeting and realise how engaging and meaningful it was for them.  They were extraordinarily receptive to the young people.<br\/><br\/>Consultation work undertaken by Wicklow Comhairle na n&Oacute;g resulted in a charter on cyberbullying, as referred to by Deputy Kate O'Connell.  This charter makes requests of us all.  It asks that we have a plan for dealing with cyberbullying and that we protect young people, their rights and their well-being.  The charter also speaks to bullies, to those being bullied, to bystanders and to all young people.  While this initiative is local to County Wicklow, the message coming from young people has much wider application.  The learning is that technology, <i>per se<\/i>, is not the problem; rather, people's behaviour is the problem.<br\/><br\/>I know that the committee also met Clare Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and heard of the successful initiative with McAfee that has resulted in a cybersafety programme.  Reference was made to how the programme is being rolled out through Clare Youth Service and other Youth Work Ireland regions.  These initiatives, developed by young people, are real examples of a global and universal problem finding local solutions, generated and owned by young people themselves.  No doubt, they are looking for innovative ways to ensure that what they advocate will be followed by their friends and colleagues and others.<br\/><br\/>My Department also provides funding to three national youth organisations that provide online safety resources for the youth sector.  The National Youth Council of Ireland provides the web safety in youth work resource for young people; SpunOut, Ireland's youth information website, has developed an online safety hub that provides guidelines for young people on online safety; and Youth Work Ireland, in conjunction with McAfee Security, has developed a digital safety programme that highlights the risks associated with online activity.<br\/><br\/>As we know, the Internet is not age-bound.  The risks and dangers apply to people of all ages.  Children, however, are particularly vulnerable and need greater protection.  This is why I welcome the work of the committee and the report.  The challenges are not just for the Government; they are for all of society.  There is also a role for parents and for industry and each must play its part.  Parents are crucial actors in helping to ensure that children are safe online and particularly in establishing and maintaining ongoing open communication with their children so that where risks arise, children feel able to discuss them with their parents.  The Government recognises the importance of the provision of reliable information to parents to equip them in supporting children's safety online, and this will be reflected in the forthcoming action plan for online safety.<br\/><br\/>Strengthening and consolidating information, support and services will be a key focus for the Department in the coming years and I will be outlining steps in that regard in the forthcoming early years strategy.  The Internet operates across borders so the challenges we meet often arise from decisions taken outside our jurisdiction.  Some solutions are outside our control but we have the advantage that many of the world's leading technology companies have a significant corporate presence here in Ireland.  They can and must work with the Government in making the Internet a safer place.  We need a truly joined-up approach in addressing the issue of cybersafety.  The committee pointed this out.  Dealing with the criminal behaviour associated with the Internet is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality.  Facilitating technology is the responsibility of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The Department of Education and Skills plays a valuable role in regard to Internet safety in schools.  The Department of Health has a particular interest through mental health and well-being services, and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has responsibilities regarding industry and e-commerce.  I am fully committed to playing my part in a co-ordinated cross-Government approach to dealing with this issue, particularly as it relates to children.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge again the excellent work of the committee and can assure the House that the findings and recommendations in its report will be taken into account as part of the work being done by the Taoiseach's office in preparing a national action plan on online safety.  As I stated, that plan is at an advanced stage of preparation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400045#VV00200","speaker":"1358","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528993800,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that important overview.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400046#WW00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1528993800,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for her statement and I thank Deputy Kate O'Connell for contributing on behalf of the committee's Chairman, Deputy Alan Farrell.<\/p>  <p>  I attended every one of the sessions along with my colleagues.  They were most informative, enjoyable and enlightening.  It is a pity that they were on at 10 a.m.  If they were on at 10 p.m., parents would actually have got an awful lot more out of them.  As a parent, I got right into it.  Having a 16 year old, a 15 year old and a 13 year old, I was hearing it all from all angles, and I really enjoyed it.<\/p><p>I want to acknowledge the stakeholders who appeared before the committee because they played an invaluable role in giving up their time to inform us about the issue.  However, as the Minister said, they were not informing just one Department but a minimum of six Departments.  That is the wonderful aspect of the Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  We do not hold all the work to ourselves, unlike the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  We shared it on this issue with the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality but we also shared it with the committees on health, education, climate change, mental health and enterprise and innovation.  We had a broad section of people appear before us on this issue, including representatives of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children; Webwise; Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, Special Rapporteur on Child Protection; the Law Reform Commission; the special crime operations section and the national protective services bureau of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, to which I will refer shortly; and Facebook.  Regrettably, representatives of Snapchat refused to appear before us but in fairness to Niamh Sweeney and her colleague from Facebook, they appeared before us on the industry aspect.  We also had representatives from Newbridge College, Wicklow Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and Clare Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  At the end, we had Dr. Mary Aiken and Professor Barry O'Sullivan.  It is important to mention also the Internet Content Governance Advisory Group, which was led by Professor Brian O'Neill, as well as Ronan Lupton, &Aacute;ine Lynch and Professor Joe Carthy.<br\/><br\/>All the Ministers appeared before the committee for the final part of the sessions.  Apparently, it was the first time that happened.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and the Minister for<b><\/b>Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, appeared before us.  That showed a willingness to collaborate on the issue of cybersafety and protection of our children.<br\/><br\/>The momentum to deal with this issue started in February 2017 and we concluded our hearings in February 2018.  It was a year's solid work.  We would say we worked hard but the clerk to the committee and her team worked very hard also in writing to people and compiling the report.  We received many submissions.<br\/><br\/>The content in terms of what was put before the committee was amazing.  The media bought into our discussions and listened to them on a weekly basis, hence the Ministers came in behind us.  The one element that kept coming through from the discussions was the question of a digital safety commissioner.  Myself and the Minister had exchanges in the House during Question Time in recent days but a digital safety commissioner was an issue that continued to arise because there does not appear to be a proper level of governance or protection for our young people.  Parents do not believe they are sufficiently equipped or educated because technology is changing so quickly in this area.  They would appreciate having the short rule book on it because the children are ten steps ahead of us.<br\/><br\/>One lesson I learned last summer was to do with the Snapchat locations setting.  I had never heard of that.  In fairness, one of the radio stations carried the story on Snapchat locations.  Children were not allowed on Snapchat until they were 13 but the age has been increased to 16.  This time last year, a child could be on Snapchat but a new application, locations, appeared on it.  That means that if someone turned on the locations setting, people could identify their location.  If they were being followed, groomed or profiled, the person doing that would know where they lived.  My children came to visit in the D&aacute;il one day.  Ao&iacute;bhinn put on her Snapchat location setting so when she went out to Grafton Street, I could tell where she was and if I could trace her location, so could every one of her friends.  The radio programme carried the story about the Snapchat locations setting and advised parents to have the conversation about it with their children and that it should be turned off.<br\/><br\/>We also heard about another application that came out around last August, Sarahah, which was not the nicest one.  On Snapchat children can talk to their friends but only negative and nasty commentary is put up on Sarahah.  As a result of radio stations carrying the story, parents became aware of it.  Many of them had the conversation with their children and were able to take down the site.<br\/><br\/>While Instagram is great for posting beautiful pictures and so on, it might give young girls the wrong impression that they have to look a particular way or that their make-up should be perfect.  It is exposing children too much and sexualising them far too early.<br\/><br\/>Dr. Geoffrey Shannon made powerful statements to the committee.  I believe he appeared before the Law Reform Commission before he appeared before our good selves.  On the digital safety commissioner he stated:<\/p><blockquote>The proposed Office of the Digital Safety Commissioner of Ireland should oversee effective and efficient take down procedure in a timely manner, regulating for a system of take down orders in respect of harmful cybercommunication made in respect of both adults and children.  I would also add that in the terms of the role of the Digital Safety Commissioner and take down procedures there should be a requirement on the Digital Safety Commissioner to take down material within a specified period of time.  It is an issue that is not expressly referenced in the report of the Law Reform Commission...<\/blockquote><p>What we are talking about in that regard is children putting up inappropriate images on Instagram.  They could take photographs of themselves or their friends and if they put them on the likes of Snapchat, one friend might like them and all of a sudden they would go to others.  They could be then used as a form of bullying or for various other reasons.  Also, if they are left in that sphere and they subsequently want to apply for a job or something like that, Dr. Shannon advised that they should take them down.<br\/><br\/>Dr. Shannon also spoke about fights taking place that are put on YouTube.  Some of them show young children fighting or being paid to fight in particular areas, and he wanted those images to be taken down.  <br\/><br\/>The right to be forgotten was another of Dr. Shannon's key recommendations.  If a child is under an age when the brain might not have developed to a particular level, he or she should have that right of protection and the right to be forgotten.<br\/><br\/>Two groups of children appeared before the committee and while they were wonderful, I am glad we left them to the end of our discussions because if we had brought them to come in at the start, everything else would have been dull after their appearance.<br\/><br\/>Two staff members man the office for Internet safety in the Department of Justice and Equality.  They are tasked with Internet safety for the entire country but to be fair to the two ladies who appeared before the committee, they produced 40,000 booklets on Internet safety.  Unfortunately, they do not produce enough of them.  They should have one for every national and secondary school because the quality of the content is second to none.  The only complaint I have about that is that not enough booklets are produced.  They should be put into every national school and not in September but at Christmas time when Santy might bring the child a phone or at confirmation time.  In that way the conversation about Internet safety can be had.  The office for Internet safety has done a huge amount of work for which it deserves great credit.<br\/><br\/>Representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appeared before us also.  It has a team of 32 people working in the Phoenix Park headquarters.  They discussed the amount of work they have to put in to deal with cyberbullying, profiling, grooming, sexting, what takes place in the underworld of the Internet and how cruel it can be to very young children.  They explained that the most vulnerable are the most at risk.<\/p><p>They work with agencies such as Interpol, our European colleagues and others.  One of the concerns I have with Brexit moving forward is how our communications will continue in order to protect children.<\/p> <p> This report is amazing.  The Minister is just one among many others but she is an Independent Alliance Minister in the Cabinet.  I ask her to press for the action plan to come forward and also for the establishment of the digital safety commissioner.  It is a must for our children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400046#WW00300","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528995000,"counter":339,"content":"<p>The safety and security of young people online is one of the most pressing child protection issues we are facing at this time.  I welcome this report.  It presents a thorough analysis of the issues of concern to the wider public, along with 18 recommendations which we hope will address those concerns.<\/p>  <p>  The Internet offers huge benefits to society through the sharing of information and in terms of communications for business and education.  However, there are downsides.  These range from the protection of personal information online to cyberbullying and child exploitation.  A harsh light has been shone on some of the social media platforms, particularly Facebook, in recent months regarding the ability of third-party apps to harvest users' personal data.  One of reasons many parents are so concerned about cybersecurity is that young people and children often have far better skills and knowledge of various apps, social media platforms and online services than they do.  Parents often feel helpless and unable to keep up with the latest app or social media site.  In a few short years the Internet has moved from a desktop computer to smartphones.  This has increased parents' concerns because it is now more difficult to monitor children&rsquo;s online activity.<\/p>  <p>  One of the main recommendations in this report is the establishment of an office of digital safety commissioner.  I commend this.  This is something for which Sinn F&eacute;in, along with Deputy Rabbitte and Fianna F&aacute;il, has advocated for a long time.  It has also been called for by the Law Reform Commission.  In addition, the special rapporteur on child protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, has fully endorsed it.  I consider it a priority.  One of the major issues for legislators when dealing with online safety and cybersecurity is that responsibility falls across many Departments.  We need a one-stop shop.  We need an office which young people, parents, industry and legislators can rely on to advise on best practice when it comes to digital safety.<\/p>  <p>  We all know that digital technology will continue to play an increasing role in the lives of young people.  We must be sure that we have the tools to educate young people on how to use this technology in a respectful and safe way.  I mentioned earlier that parents are often less savvy than their children in this area, so the education cannot be solely aimed at children.  We must ensure that parents are educated and aware of the potential dangers children face when using these services.  That is the reason I welcome many of the recommendations which deal with the need for education.  The Internet, apps and social media play an increasing role in the lives of children and therefore it is vital that education on them is included in the school curriculum.  Students must learn life skills as well as academic studies in school.<\/p>  <p>  I also wish to mention the role of social media platforms in this.  The industry has to be aware of its obligations to safeguard users.  Indeed, the GDPR regulations go some way towards dealing with the use personal data.  While there is an onus on parents to monitor their children&rsquo;s use of the Internet, there is also an onus on Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram and others to ensure that those who use their services are able to report a problem, whether it is bullying, inappropriate content or a list of other concerns, and that it will be dealt with swiftly.  In the committee we have been very clear that it is not acceptable for these companies to wash their hands of such problems.  Various representatives told the committee that they will take this issue seriously.  We will keep an eye on them over the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the Data Protection Bill and the digital age of consent, I particularly welcome one of the amendments that was proposed by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, and passed.  The amendment in question will protect children from profiling and micro-marketing while online.  The amendment will restrict the profiling, harvesting and targeting of children and youths by companies that advertise on social media.  This is not just about the nuisance advertisements that appear in the news feeds.  Often advertisements targeted at young people are inappropriate and in some cases they are pushing certain agendas.  The advertisements can be quite harmful to young people by making them very conscious of issues such as their appearance or body shape.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, I welcome this report.  The proposals it contains are sensible.  They are built on those made by the Internet content governance advisory group in 2014.  It is a shame that some of those recommendations are still outstanding.  They should be implemented without delay.  This is a very complex issue, but it must be tackled.  The Internet is not going away.  It is something people grow up with and is part of life, so we must reflect that in how we approach it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400048#YY00200","speaker":"1362"},{"type":"speech","time":1528995000,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Eugene Murphy for the perspective from Roscommon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400048#YY00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1528995000,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I will not detain Members or officials for too long because I am sure people are anxious to get away.  It would be remiss of me not to start by paying a big tribute to the eight women and three men on the committee, including Deputies Rabbitte and Mitchell, who have done an enormous amount of work.  It is important that we get to work on implementing the 18 recommendations as quickly as possible, and I know the Minister will be very committed to that.<\/p>  <p>  Our children and teenagers are at risk from many unknowns in the digital era.  Cyberbullying is more often than not a silent predator.  Knowledge, communication and oversight are more important now than ever.  One thing is certain - what goes online stays online forever.  How many children and teenagers have been tormented, threatened, harassed, humiliated, embarrassed or otherwise targeted by another child or teenager using the Internet, interactive and digital technologies or mobile telephones?  I commented a few days ago that the telephone was invented for people to speak to each other, but it is no longer used for that.  As a politician, I must try to keep up with everything that is happening but every few months there is a new way of getting messages.  One finds that one cannot keep up with all the messages.  Somebody might say \"I sent you a message on WhatsApp and you did not reply\".  There are so many outlets for getting information, even for us, that it is absolutely impossible to keep up.<\/p>  <p>  Research shows that probably 15% of primary school children are the victims of cyberbullying.  It is probably almost the same for children in post-primary school.<\/p><p>Those figures are constantly growing.  We have to tackle the issue and be serious about it.  There is a general acceptance across the political arena that it is urgent.  The people who use technology to bully may say things online or by text that they would never say face to face.  They need to know they are responsible for their words in cyberspace as well as in the real world.  If it comes down to it, the source of the abuse, the computer or phone being used, can be identified by the Garda.<\/p> <p> I put together a newsletter with my staff and we circulated it.  Of all the issues I have dealt with in my constituency, the huge response I got to this made me feel that it is probably the most important issue.  In doing that research I found disturbing things.  Many parents are afraid to tackle this issue.  If their child is in the bedroom missing for half an hour, they know they are on the phone or some other device connected to the Internet.  They are trying to balance not having a row with their child with still being responsible and making sure they know what is going on.  They are afraid to set time limits or speak about it.  In some cases they are allowing their children to dictate the pace.  The one thing to come out of this is that parents must act strongly in this, be responsible and set the parameters.  They need to get into a sensible conversation.  It happens in our house.  If somebody goes missing, we know where they are.  It is important to say, \"Hey, you've been at that for half an hour now, get out and kick a football or do something else.\"  We need to engage them in a certain way.<\/p> <p> In restaurants, many people have social media items to entertain their children, which is shocking.  There is no conversation and they are playing away on some little device.  It may be safe enough because the parents are there to regulate or watch what is going on.  Is it not shocking, even at mealtime, even when people go out for an hour or an hour and a half, that they end up trying to keep the children quiet?  Sometimes when they are very young, of course, it might be hard to keep them quiet.  As a way of entertaining them I just do not like it.  We need to talk to parents about those types of things.  We need to engage with everybody.<\/p> <p> I compliment everybody involved.  I have no doubt that the Minister will do everything to get this matter sorted out as quickly as possible.  I encourage parents, teenagers and everybody to engage in this.<\/p> <p> Some of the stuff that appears on Facebook is horrific.  Even with comments about people in politics, business or communities, I cannot understand some of the appalling language and bitterness.  I appeal from the Oireachtas this evening for all people doing this to take stock and stop it.  It is bad for society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400048#YY00400","speaker":"1342","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1528995600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for those wise words.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400049#ZZ00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1528995600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I thank the three Deputies for their very powerful and eloquent contributions on this challenging issue.  It is appropriate and impressive that we have two members of the committee who put the report together and also a Deputy who is not a member of the committee.  They have all demonstrated in-depth knowledge of the issues, and a genuine on the ground engagement with their constituents and their families, which will influence and impact the way the Government and the Oireachtas move together as a whole on this issue.  They are very fine public representatives in this regard.  It is very impressive to listen to them.<\/p>  <p>  It is not always the case that when a committee produces a report, that topic is taken up by the Department of the Taoiseach and it comes back to us here as an action plan.  The committee's work was a catalyst to ensure that happened.  That is very significant.  Although the action plan that comes back may not contain a way of implementing all the recommendations the committee has suggested, I assure Members that I know it was used as a primary resource for that action plan.  That is also very significant.<\/p>  <p>  I listened to the Deputies referring to some of the recommendations in the report as well as augmenting those recommendations with their own reflections since that time.  I am sure the committee members will look at that plan using their expertise, taking a whole-of-Government approach, because that is what they did to produce the report.  We could well use the committee members' wisdom, experience and analysis to respond to that action plan.<\/p>  <p>  In my earlier exchange with Deputy Rabbitte on the issue, I indicated my view on the recommendations of having a digital safety commissioner.  I welcome that as a strong and good way forward.  I understand that the action plan that is coming forward will focus on bringing together what is done, finding ways across Departments to streamline that, but also to offer some real additionality.  The Government will work with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment on the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill introduced by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  Fianna F&aacute;il has also advocated strongly for that.  The Government did not oppose the Second Stage of that Bill.  The action plan commits us to working on the Bill.  There are many complexities in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  While that is going on with the Taoiseach's action plan, we will put in place some additional actions for which certain Departments will be responsible.  That will mean that while we look for significant legislative change, we can move towards the implementation of certain actions within the relevant Departments that will be guided by many of the policy recommendations outlined in the committee's report.<\/p>  <p>  I am deeply grateful for that.  I am very proud that this has come from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, although the committee does not report to me.  Rather, I report to it.  The committee took on board that whole-of-Government approach.  I well remember the day that I was there with my other Government colleagues.  It is not very often that four different Ministers appear before a committee to answer to the committee, say what we are doing and listen to the committee members' analysis in light of the evidence they collected in preparing the report.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to play its full part in working in a cross-Government way, especially working with the committee in moving this very significant issue forward and beginning to implement new actions relatively soon in light of the committee's influence in getting the Department of the Taoiseach to put in place an action plan on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018061400049#ZZ00300","speaker":"1358"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528995600,"counter":345,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1528995600,"counter":346,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 6.50 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 19 June 2018.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
