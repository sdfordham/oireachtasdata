All Members will have been written to by retired people in their 60s, 70s or 80s who will lose a minimum of six weeks pay, which is a more than a 10% cut, and will carry the burden of this Government's pension levy which, for them, equates to 2.53% per annum for the rest of the term because &euro;28 million was taken out of this under-funded scheme by the Government to pay for other things.  Now these retired members, who worked in Aer Lingus, Team Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority, will lose six weeks pay.<\/p><p>Many of the people who will have written to Members are long-standing members of the scheme who have 30 years to 35 years' service and who are called the deferred pensioners.  They paid into this pension scheme, on a compulsory basis, from the age of 20.  They worked tirelessly to return Aer Lingus to profitability and for Team Aer Lingus, SR Technics and the Dublin Airport Authority.  What has happened to them?  What the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, did last evening will mean up 58% cuts in their pension entitlements.  The average is 40% to 50%.  There are 5,000 retired members and 5,000 deferred members, some 10,000 people and families.  The 5,000 working members, who have been put into an inferior scheme, will also have their benefits cut.  <\/p><p>What is really annoying me about this, and what I am disgusted about, is that only last week, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection met some of the committees here to try to work towards a favourable solution which would not result in a 58% cut in some people's pensions and which would not take hundreds or thousands of euro from 70, 80 or 90 year old people.<\/p><p>What happened yesterday was that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, signed the commencement orders even though nothing had come back from the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.<\/p> <p>Why did he do it yesterday?  He did so because the debate on the Social Welfare Bill will take place in the D&aacute;il this week, to which amendments have been tabled that will effect cuts to the IAS scheme under the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act.  This was choreographed.  Aer Lingus today announced that an EGM will be held in early December to vote on this issue.  The Committee Stage debate here on the Social Welfare Bill will commence on 2 December.  All of the amendments we have prepared in relation to that Bill will be negated because the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has, in my view, subvented this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800004#C00400","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416321600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Is the Senator seeking a debate on the issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800005#D00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1416321600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I propose to seek an amendment to the Order of Business.

These were appalling acts, particularly when perpetrated by a particular elected representative, in terms of the detention of the T&aacute;naiste in her car and the barracking and harassment of the Taoiseach and ordinary members of the public, in particular, the unfortunate 60 people graduating from An Cosan, a project founded many years ago by Senator Zappone who is doing tremendous work in Tallaght.  It was unfair on those people who had worked so hard that their graduation ceremony was disrupted in such a way.  It was also unfair on the majority of people opposed to water tax who have protested peacefully in the past, as is their democratic right.  It is unfair to them when protests are disrupted and hijacked in this way by violent elements.  I hope all of those involved, particularly those who are members of parties that are in opposition to water tax, will condemn the violence.<\/p><p>I would also like to put on the record my regret that the secondary teacher unions have taken the decision to strike in relation to junior cycle reforms.  Last Thursday, I spoke at length in this House about the compromise offered by the Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan, to the teachers' unions.  Many of us hoped at that point that there would be further negotiations on this issue.  The Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan, has put forward reasonable proposals that have come more than half way to meeting the concerns of unions around external accreditation of examinations.  I hope we will see a resolution of this matter, particularly given parents and pupils have come out in support of the reform.<\/p><p>I call on the Leader to provide time for a debate for gender equality among staff at third level.  I do so in light of the ruling this week of the Equality Tribunal, which ruling I very much welcome, in a case taken by Dr. Micheline Sheehy-Skeffington against NUI Galway.  The equality officer, in a robust judgment, found in favour of Dr. Sheehy-Skeffington and ordered the university to promote her and to pay her redress of a year's salary.  The equality officer in her findings states: &quot;It is clear that male applicants have a one in two chance of being promoted to senior lecture in NUI Galway while women who apply have less than a one in three chance of the same promotion.&quot;  I spoke today to Dr. Sheehy-Skeffington.  As she says, this case raises wider issues about the treatment of women in academia, promotion prospects based on gender and the appalling position of women in all Irish universities, particularly in science.  A report from the European Commission in 2009 shows we are second only to Malta in terms of the glass ceiling index.<\/p> <p>A debate on this issue would be welcome and I hope we can have such a debate very shortly in light of this ruling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800005#D00800","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416322200,"counter":19,"content":"<p>The plot is thickening in the Irish Water fiasco as it appears from the latest reports that Irish Water staff will not be paid any bonuses for 2014 and that the entire pay structure is to be reviewed.  We have had the Minister, Deputy Kelly, expressing a personal view in the D&aacute;il that the charges for fitting a water meter are too high and we have had the T&aacute;naiste express what was subsequently called \"a personal view\" that the water allowances for families are too low.  I was not aware as a matter of law or otherwise that Ministers speaking on the record of the House on matters of public interest could give personal views as opposed to the views of the Government of the day.  Moreover, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, stated last night that the enforcement mechanism against those who refuse to pay water charges has yet to be determined.  It is time for the Government to admit that the confusion and public anger over the Irish Water fiasco is largely due to the fact that the Government has no clear idea what has gone on.  The Government is like a car skidding on ice, it does not know whether to press the brake or the accelerator or whether to turn left or right and that has contributed to public frustration and contempt among families.  It is time for the Government to clarify exactly what the average family can expect to pay, what the installation of water meters will cost and what enforcement mechanisms are proposed.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Bacik's comments in that it is utterly unacceptable for any groups in civil society or trade union leaders, the spokesperson of one of which I heard interviewed this morning, equivocating in any kind of way about unacceptable tactics when it comes to public protest.  We deserve much better leadership.  It is quite possible to show and demonstrate legitimate public anger without detaining other people, striking at their vehicles or using foul and unacceptable language.  I have no sympathy for this Government and its many bad decisions and unacceptable leadership in a number of different areas, but we should all unite in condemning unacceptable tactics of protest.  We should expect the best from trade union leaders and other convenors of public protests.<\/p><p>I wish to raise briefly an issue I have had to raise previously, that of the allocation of judicial resources.  A disgraceful situation occurred two weeks ago in Galway where Circuit Court civil hearings for November were cancelled because no Circuit Court judges were available to hear cases due, in the main, to the fact that judicial vacancies were not being filled promptly.  Apart from the obvious problems this causes litigants in terms of both their time and costs, the real story is that it could have been avoided.  Six specialist judges of the Circuit Court appointed to deal with insolvency applications under the 2012 Act are operating currently with very little to do, as the thousands of insolvency actions expected never materialised.  While the flaws in the 2012 Act are a matter for another day, the judges, each, earning salaries of more than &euro;140,000 a year, are reportedly frustrated because they have so little work to do.  It is unbelievable that court sittings are being cancelled in one area while judges costing the taxpayer close to &euro;1 million, when pension entitlements are included, are under-utilised.  I sympathise with the judges in question.  This situation is not of their making and it must be depressing for them to have so little work to do.  Will the Leader, for the sake of the judges in question as well as for the sake of the long-suffering court-using public and taxpayers, ask the Minister for Justice and Equality that these judges be redeployed as a matter of urgency, and if that is not possible, to explain why it is not?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800006#E00200","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1416322200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the matter of the newly released InterTradeIreland report, which notes that small and domestic firms throughout Ireland are reporting a recovery and, most important, these small firms are non-exporters and are reliant on the domestic market.

It is with regret that I say how disgusted I am with the type of heavy-handed thuggery that went on over the weekend <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the virtual kidnapping of the T&aacute;naiste and the abuse the Taoiseach had to put up with.  I do not care whether they are members of Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna F&aacute;il or any other party, they are the leaders of our country and members of the Cabinet.  All Oireachtas Members are entitled to be protected from that kind of behaviour.  It appals me to see what is happening.  It has become commonplace for Members of the Oireachtas to go among the crowds with megaphones.  In fact, they have the greatest megaphone of all; in that they have the immense privilege of being Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann where they are one of 166 people who can stand up and fight their corner, but instead they are resorting to street politics and inciting people.  It is very revealing that Sinn F&eacute;in is now trying to distance itself from that.  Its members were experienced <i>agents provocateurs <\/i>themselves at public rallies.  That illustrates how serious the situation has become, in the sense that the scene on the extreme left has become so crowded parties are trying to race each other to the bottom in terms of their behaviour.<br\/>To turn to a totally different subject, I wish to raise the problem of Japanese knotweed in the country.  This is an invidious plant which has begun to take over in many scenic areas.  It is highly aggressive and it is killing many native species, in particular in some of the most scenic tourism areas.  I ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to address the problem.  He must work with county councils and local community groups on how best to eradicate this insidious plant.  In some jurisdictions, for example, in the UK, they take the problem so seriously that when someone applies for a mortgage the approval includes a compliance clause on Japanese knotweed.  Senator Paul Coghlan is aware of the situation long ago with the dreaded rhododendron scourge in Killarney which threatened to take over a beautiful park there.  The situation there fades to nothing in comparison with what Japanese knotweed is capable of doing.  I urge the Leader to bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.  I second the amendment to the Order of Business by the leader of the Opposition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800006#E00400","speaker":"1142","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416322800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I too wish to raise the disturbing scenes that took place in Jobstown on Saturday.  I agree with the T&aacute;naiste's comments that the protest and antics surrounding it overshadowed the achievements and importance of the day for the graduates who had worked and studied long and hard to get to that point.  I was also particularly shocked when looking at the scenes on television on Saturday night by the amount of children that were dragged into the situation.  It was no place for children to be involved and I was very disappointed to see so many of them present.  As Senator Ned O'Sullivan said, many of the people involved in protests have gone on to become public representatives.  Last year when the Taoiseach came to visit Dundalk, my car was attacked and placards were placed on it.  The incident shook me up.  There was much pushing and abuse was hurled at public representatives as we went about our work.<\/p><p>I accept people have the right to protest and I support peaceful protests, but I am not in favour of people intimidating others or in my case having placards placed on the windscreen of the car, pushing the car and hammering on the roof of the car.  Such behaviour is very frightening.  On the day in question I was in the car on my own and I had to wait for what felt like an eternity before a garda came along to move the protesters on.  Such bullying is totally unacceptable.  It leads me to last week's debate in Leinster House on Ma&iacute;ria Cahill.  I had the good fortune to sit beside her for most of the debate in the Gallery, and it was fantastic to witness the strength and fortitude she displayed last Wednesday.  It was great to see so many public representatives and staff support her.  However, I found the questions were not answered.  People from political parties spoke about not getting answers.  We certainly did not get any answers during the debate last Wednesday even though it was five hours long.<\/p> <p>I call on the Leader to arrange a debate in the Seanad on the allegations regarding sexual abuse by members of the republican movement.

He went on to say that they had to pull the plug on what was happening in Ireland because the equivalent of 85% of our GDP was being given to enhance the liquidity of the Irish banking system.  That is why he should participate and give evidence because that was putting fuel on the fire, and the bills had to be collected by Irish taxpayers.  Why did the ECB give so much money to banks, which eventually brought down the country?  I hope he will reconsider that decision and that there will be support in the Oireachtas that he should appear before the inquiry.<\/p><p>I refer to the Garda Inspectorate report.  There has been an emphasis on statistics but there are problems with that.  I gather it is an issue with the New York Police Department that turning policemen into people gathering statistics tends to erode public faith, and it erodes community policing.  Some policing may require no statistics at all; it just works.  There are problems with public service morale also.  A former member of the NYPD, Professor John Eterno, has drawn attention to that.  More importantly, however, are the numbers that emerge from the report.  That a significant proportion of garda&iacute; are engaged in administrative and non-operational duties is noteworthy, according to the inspectorate.  Twelve per cent of members are engaged in detective duties but they perform much less than 12% of the investigation of crime.  The norm in other jurisdictions is that they should perform more than that percentage.  The amount of time spent on operational policing and criminal investigation in the Garda college is only a quarter, which is much less than the amount of time spent on language skills.  We have 700 untrained detectives.  Only about 31% of fingerprints, which are needed to solve cases, are actually taken.<\/p><p>I hope the Minister for Justice and Equality would come into the House to address the issues.

The ISPCA, which is involved in six to eight dog pounds in the country, is withdrawing from those.  I believe it has already withdrawn from Offaly and Roscommon, and is now withdrawing from Kilkenny.  That has serious implications.  I ask that the Leader would write to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to request it to ensure that the funding to run these pounds remains in place through the county councils.  We discussed the Animal Health and Welfare Bill in this House for numerous hours and one of the issues that arose was the neglect of dogs.  If dogs are being neglected and we do not have the ISPCA involved, we will have a serious problem.  Farmers will have a serious problem also because ewes are being put in lamb at this time of the year and if dog worrying occurs, the lamb crop will be affected.  It is important that the funding for these dog pounds continues to be made available.<\/p><p>The other matter concerns what we saw over the weekend.  I ask the Members opposite for their views.  I heard the views of Senator O'Sullivan but I would be interested to hear the views of Senator MacSharry.  He is not present but I presume Senator Wilson, as acting leader of the Opposition or Fianna F&aacute;il, will pass on the message.  I believe Senator MacSharry attended the protest last night in Sligo during which the Taoiseach's car was stopped entering a hotel.  When we came into Government we had to sort out this country and one of the jobs we did was to get rid of Garda drivers at a saving of &euro;6 million.  We saw at the weekend the T&aacute;naiste imprisoned in her car for three hours, the Taoiseach stopped from entering a hotel to attend a Fine Gael meeting, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, being intimidated in his own town of Limerick, and the Minister, Deputy Kelly, receiving a bomb threat to his office.<\/p> <p>Are we coming to a stage at which we must reintroduce Garda drivers for the safety of Ministers, because no Minister deserves what has happened to them over the weekend?

They are struggling to pay mounting bills ranging from debilitating child care costs to ever-increasing everyday expenditures, as well as water charges when they ultimately come down the line.  Moreover, one particularly important point is the proposed rule changes could create a market for cash buyers that is inaccessible for normal working people and which may foster greater inequities in Irish society.  As for the wider implications, Members regularly raise the issue of pensions here but how could young people invest sufficiently in their overall financial future, such as saving money for pensions or retirement, if they are struggling to meet hefty mortgage deposit requirements?  Is that outcome desirable?  I acknowledge that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has suggested the introduction of mortgage insurance in Ireland as a possible solution to the issue.  Such insurance would protect banks against default of mortgages that go beyond 80% of the value and I welcome his innovation in this area as in many others.  Consequently, I suggest to the Leader that he might perhaps invite the Minister, Deputy Noonan, or even perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, to the House to update Members on the Minister's progress with regard to mortgage insurance, which I am aware will be considered by the finance committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800009#H00400","speaker":"1176"},{"type":"speech","time":1416323700,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Senator Mullen may have left the House but he made a remark in which he likened the Government, in respect of Irish Water, to a car skidding on ice.

It was an orchestrated event that intimidated not only innocent bystanders, but put members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the public in danger, not to mention the effect it had on the T&aacute;naiste.

Some 480 days ago it was signed by President Higgins but has not come into operation yet.  It has been passed again to different Ministers to see how we can go about doing it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Nash, was given responsibility for it last week.  I urge the Leader to do something about this good legislation.  The subcontractors were delighted with it and are crying out for it.  The Government got considerable praise for allowing the Bill to pass - it does not always accept Bills from Independent Senators - yet nothing has happened since then.

The Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald is a very sensible person and a level-headed Minister who can intervene.  Working in a prison is not like doing any other job.  It is a very dangerous job.  People working in the Prison Service work in a confined, &quot;Love\/Hate&quot; environment on an ongoing basis.  They are family men and women.  Certain elements within the Prison Service management system are trying to goad and provoke them through the unilateral introduction of new work practices which are outside the scope and terms of the Croke Park and Haddington Road agreements.  I ask the management to withdraw these new work practices in the interest of safe and sensible management of our prison service because these new work practices which are being introduced are vindictive and tantamount to bullying of the prison officers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800012#L00100","speaker":"1143"},{"type":"speech","time":1416324900,"counter":40,"content":"<p>The Senator is well over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800012#L00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1416324900,"counter":41,"content":"<p>With respect, a number of other speakers spoke on four and five items.

I am sick and tired of champagne socialists taking people onto the streets and talking about the poverty in which they live, when they know sweet damn all about that poverty.  I ask that not only do we condemn it but that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should investigate what happened at the weekend to see if a crime was committed.<\/p><p>I wish to address Senator Zappone's issue with the Central Bank.  I, too, have concerns about the Central Bank and the limitations that will be set on mortgages.  I am very concerned that we may in some way soften what the Central Bank is trying to do.  What we do not want in this country again is another bubble appearing as a result of a lack of discipline in our lending system.  Most people in this Chamber had to raise a 20% deposit in order to secure a mortgage back in the good old days when we had some bit of sense of how to run our country.<\/p> <p>Ultimately, if there is a demand for the 20% deposit, pure economics will kick in.  As people will be unable to buy the houses, the prices will fall and the market will regulate itself.  I would be reluctant to soften anything.  We have seen what softening has done.  It has denied an entire generation the possibility of ever buying a house.

They have done it on several occasions, as we have seen.  Clearly, they do not believe in democracy.  As one newspaper put it today, they believe in class envy, venom and the mob.

I believe that Members who have been elected to the other House are intent on subverting democracy.  They believe in the Trotskyite and Marxist-Leninist ideology of agitprop - agitation, propaganda and continuous revolution.  They have tried and failed for the last number of years to get the people onto the streets.  How many Members recall comments made by those on the hard left questioning why the people were not adopting the same tactics as the people of Greece, Spain and elsewhere?  They have got the people onto the streets on this issue, however, and now that they have them there, they want to keep them there.  As has been said by Senator Coghlan and others, they want to use the good people who were genuinely protesting - and every Member has defended the right to lawful protest - to subvert democracy.<\/p><p>What will the Government do in response to this?  This is not just about the water issue.  This is about a very serious threat to the democratic institutions and structures of this country.  It is time for the Government to analyse what is taking place on the streets and to take the necessary action.  I am afraid it will be a problem to take that action because the most recent report on Garda resources indicates that, despite I and many others thinking it is a police force that uses state-of-the-art technology to combat crime, it is a police force that in many instances still has practices that date back to the early part of the 19th century, for example, in respect of fingerprinting.  There should be a debate in the House on that report and on what the Government plans to do to resource the Garda.<\/p><p>It is ironic and a little sad that the main party in the Government, Fine Gael, which has put itself forward since its foundation as the party of law and order, finds itself on the back foot with regard to this report on Garda resources.  Irrespective of whether we have the money, the overwhelming majority of people in this country see crime as a major issue, notwithstanding the other issues that have brought them onto the streets.  That is especially the case in rural Ireland.

Shannon Heritage employs more than 300 people at peak tourism times.  The Gathering was very positive and a tremendous tourism success in all parts of the country, including the south west, but the figures for the first ten months of this year have surpassed everything.  These figures are being attributed to rise in visitor numbers due to the increase in capacity through additional services provided at Shannon Airport and the Wild Atlantic Way initiative.  It should be noted that this year, for the first time, more than 1 million people visited the world-famous Cliffs of Moher.

I raised this issue in the Chamber with the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, last week and with the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, the previous week.

If so, the board should enter into proper and effective negotiations with the nurses' and midwives' representatives to explain it.  When I raised the matter with the Minister of State and Minister, it was drawn to my attention that every registration board must be responsible for its own finances, but that is hardly a sufficient reason to expect nurses and midwives to pay an increase of 88% in one year.

She echoed what I said here a fortnight ago to the Minister for Finance when we debated the universal social charge.  I raised the matter with him on the basis that I vividly recall, both the Government when introducing the USC and the Opposition in responding to its introduction, all saying that the tax would be a temporary measure.  Now it has been firmly put on record as a permanent part of our taxation system yet we wonder why people have lost faith in politics, in politicians and in the democratic process.  I also came in here because I heard many colleagues mention the threat to our democracy.  Once politicians do not live up to their words and deeds that is the beginning of the ruination of democracy.  Therefore, I support the call for a debate on taxation.<\/p><p>I join with my colleagues in condemning the excess shown at the protest at the weekend.  I agree very much with our learned colleague from County Louth, Senator Jim D'Arcy, and share his views on the champagne socialist who headed the march.  <\/p><p>Last week, I mentioned the fact that we were celebrating the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.  I am sure Deputy Paul Murphy and his colleagues in the Socialist Party and that ilk wish that the Berlin Wall and all it stood for was still standing.<\/p> <p>They, in their Trotsky, Marxist view of the world, have absolutely nothing in common with genuine, working class people on this island.<\/p><p>I hope everyone will learn lessons from the water bills crisis.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, has said that major mistakes have been made.  We will have an announcement tomorrow from the Government.  However, I hope that as part of that announcement - if we respect democracy and the democratic process - the mistakes the Minister is referring to and the people who made those mistakes will be identified.  We must learn from this disaster.  We all stand shoulder to shoulder with the T&aacute;naiste and, indeed, anyone who is being put under unfair pressure by mob rule.  We must never give in to mob rule in this country.

They commended the T&aacute;naiste and Senator Zappone on the dignity they displayed then and since.  What we have witnessed at the weekend and in several instances since was totally unacceptable.  Oireachtas Members have a responsibility to act responsibly at all times.  We did not witness that over the weekend.  It is the duty of the Garda to ensure that we have peace and that people respect public order.  The attacks, intimidation, bullying of garda&iacute;, the targeting of them on social media and the threatening of them is totally unacceptable in this or any state and should be condemned by all.  Every type of excuse should be thrown aside.  The garda&iacute; are the guardians of the peace and their actions must be given full support.  We cannot tolerate the hijacking of peaceful protest that we have seen in recent days.  No right-thinking people want to see these incidents repeated.  I commend the 100,000 people who walked and protested a couple of weeks ago in peaceful protest but that was in marked contrast to what we witnessed in recent days.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney mentioned Marxist and Trotskyite protesters.  They used to be called the Socialist Workers Party and Young Socialists and so on but many are now aligned to the Anti Austerity Alliance and other such alliances.  The type of conduct we have witnessed from people latching onto these protests cannot and will not be tolerated in this State.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik also expressed regret at the decision of the Teacher&rsquo;s Union of Ireland to strike.  Other Senators also raised that matter.  There is a need for all the industrial resolution mechanisms of the State to come into play with the teachers and with the prison service, on the issue that Senator Whelan raised.  This should be done before Ministers intervene and I am sure the Ministers will intervene if necessary. <\/p><p>Senator Mullen and others spoke about water charges.  The Government will clarify these tomorrow.<\/p> <p>I am sure the vast majority of the people will accept what the Government proposes tomorrow.  Senator Mullen also suggested that some judges have little or nothing to do and should be diverted elsewhere.  I will certainly bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>Senator Naughton referred to the InterTradeIreland report and the positive indictors for Irish business.  Senator O'Sullivan referred to peaceful protests being hijacked.  He also outlined the fact Japanese knotweed is causing major damage to native Irish species.  I will certainly bring that matter to the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Senator Moran referred to the abuse targeted at public representatives.  She also commended the strength and fortitude of Mair&iacute;a Cahill, spoke about the need for answers from Sinn F&eacute;in on that matter and called for a debate.  I will certainly try to organise a debate on that issue.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett spoke about the need for Mr. Draghi to answer many questions on the bailout.  He raised points about the Garda Inspectorate's report, which other Senators addressed also.  We will try to have a debate on that report in early course.  Senator O'Neill spoke about the ISPCA and the need for funding to keep its offices in several areas open.  Senators Zappone and Craughwell spoke about the Central Bank's proposed mortgage rules and mortgage insurance.  I have invited the Minister for Finance to come to the House to debate that matter but have not yet received a reply, so I do not have a date for it.<\/p><p>Senator O'Keeffe said the Government is certainly listening to people on water charges and we will see the proposals tomorrow.  She also called for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, to come to the House to debate this matter next week.  I have already been in contact with the offices of both the Minister and the Minister of State and I hope we can have a debate on the Government's proposals next week.  Senators Wilson and Gilroy spoke about the peaceful protest by 800 nurses and midwives against the increase in registration fees, a matter which has been raised in the House by a number of Senators over the past number of weeks.  They called for the Minister for Health to intervene and I will certainly bring the matter to his attention.  <\/p><p>Senator Mullins condemned the attack on a synagogue in Jerusalem and the deaths of four people and spoke of the need to redouble our efforts to reactivate the peace process in the Middle East.  He called for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, to come to the House to give us an update.  The Minister will be in the House next Thursday to report on the Middle East, which he indicated he would do when we were called back during the summer recess.  Senator Quinn referred to the question of PPS numbers and hopes he will be in a position to withdraw his Bill tomorrow.  We will see what the Government's proposals are in that regard.  I advise some Senators to take a leaf out of Senator Quinn's book.  There are a number of motions and Bills on the Order Paper which are out of date and perhaps they might consider withdrawing them.<\/p> <p>On the construction contracts Bill, the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, will be in the House tomorrow, at which time Senator Quinn can raise this issue.  <\/p><p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of incitement and the need for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate that crime.  He also called for time to reflect on the mortgage rules of the Central Bank.  <\/p><p>Senator Coghlan spoke of the threat to democracy and the hijacking of peaceful protests, which was also raised by Senator Mooney.  I agree with the Senators' sentiments in that regard.  Senator Mooney also called for a debate on the Garda Inspectorate's report and the provision of greater resources for the Garda.  I agree with him in that regard also.  <\/p><p>Senators Brennan and Jim D'Arcy spoke about the protests in Dundalk last evening.  Senator Brennan also spoke about the success of the Shannon Heritage Group which had a 12% increase in business this year, which augurs well for tourism figures into the future.  <\/p><p>Senator Kelly called for a debate on wind energy.  On the last occasion the Senator called for this debate, I raised the issue with the Minister, Deputy Alex White.  However, I have not as yet received a response from the Minister.  I will renew my efforts in that regard.  <\/p><p>Senator Healy-Eames spoke about incentives from the UK to Irish SMEs.  This is a matter which can be raised during the debate tomorrow with the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, on financing for SMEs.  <\/p><p>Senator Bradford called for a debate on tax reform.  I have asked the Minister for Finance to attend the House on that matter.  However, I have not yet received a date in that regard.<\/p><p>Senator Michael D'Arcy condemned the violent protests, in some instances, last week at the GPO during the 1916 commemorations which were attended by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and other Ministers.  Senator Keane spoke about the success and benefits of An Cosan for Jobstown and Tallaght.  It is a pity its graduation ceremony on Saturday was hijacked by people who had little interest in its work.<\/p><p>Senator Hayden called for a debate on second-chance education and on the private rented sector.  Senator Bradford also advised us that we should learn from our mistakes.  I am sure the Government and all other people will learn from their mistakes.  The Senator also spoke about the dangers of mob rule.  Senator Michael D'Arcy also condemned the unsavoury incidences witnessed in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800018#R00700","speaker":"1130","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416327900,"counter":89,"content":"<p>Senator Darragh O'Brien has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.

Horizon 2020 is a very important issue and I am glad we have a chance to discuss it here in the Seanad.  I have no doubt that over the couple of years of this programme we will have a chance to have further debates.<\/p><p>We are involved in Ireland's strategy for participation in the biggest ever European research and innovation programme, Horizon 2020.  With &euro;80 billion of funding available over seven years, Horizon 2020 is the main EU funding programme for research and development for the period 2014 to 2020.  Horizon 2020's objectives are to enable a world-class research system for Europe, support European leadership in industrial development and address grand challenges facing society.<\/p><p>The structure and objectives of Horizon 2020 are very much in line with our national objectives, which are raising the level of excellence in our science base, making Ireland a more attractive location to invest in research and innovation, and addressing major societal challenges by bringing together resources and knowledge across different fields, technologies and disciplines, including the social sciences and the humanities.<\/p><p>Research and innovation are widely recognised as the engines which will ultimately drive European economic recovery.  In Ireland's case it is having a big impact on our recovery over the past couple of years.  Investment in research and innovation is now increasingly advocated by European policy makers, and Governments are being urged to increase investment at national level.  <\/p><p>As Europe exits the crisis, it is increasingly clear that supporting growth enhancing policies such as investment in research and innovation has paid off.  The evidence shows that much of the recent productivity gains come from innovation and that, on average, countries that invested more in research and innovation, before and during the crisis, have been the most resilient during the economic downturn.<\/p><p>The Government fully supports this approach.  Investment in research and innovation in Ireland will ultimately lead to increased economic activity and the creation of sustainable jobs for the future.  That is why this Government has maintained strong State investment in research and innovation over the three-year period since taking office in 2011.  We are committed to continuing the process of economic reform and recovery, achieving sustainable growth, strong public finances and enduring job creation.<\/p><p>It is fair to say that when it comes to the science agenda and the science spend, we are building on the previous seven or eight years also.  We have tried to keep that going in the past three years because the correct decisions were made in this area to concentrate money on research and innovation.<\/p><p>As a means to drive economic growth and create jobs, Horizon 2020 has the political backing of Europe's leaders and the Members of the European Parliament.  They agreed that research is an investment in our future and so put it at the heart of the European Union's blueprint for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and jobs.<\/p><p>By coupling research and innovation, Horizon 2020 is helping to achieve this with its emphasis on excellent science, industrial leadership and tackling societal challenges.  The goal is to ensure Europe produces world-class science, removes barriers to innovation and makes it easier for the public and private sectors to work together in delivering innovation.<\/p><p>Horizon 2020 is open to everyone, with a simple structure that reduces red tape and time, so that participants can focus on what is really important.  This approach makes sure that new projects get off the ground quickly and achieve results faster.  That is very important if we are to get the multinational sector involved in this area because the timescale for them and the red tape can be off-putting.  Under Horizon 2020 we have tried to ensure, from an Irish point of view, that it is more streamlined and that decisions are made in a more speedy manner.<\/p><p>I am proud to say that Ireland played a very significant role by securing political agreement on Horizon 2020 during its Presidency of the Council of the European Union last year.<\/p> <p>I am accompanied here today by two key departmental officials, Mr. Aidan Hodson, and Mr. Pat Kelly, who both had an important role in trying to get that across the line and I thank them for their work in this regard.<\/p><p>It is generally accepted that international collaboration on research brings together resources and pooling of knowledge and enhances scientific excellence, thus achieving greater success in addressing research problems, as well as greater efficiencies.  Participating in international research programmes facilitates inward and outward mobility of researchers, access to transnational collaborative networks, access to research facilities not available in Ireland and commercialisation of ideas and know-how.  In recent days, I spent some time in India on an education mission but during that time, I stressed the societal benefits that can be achieved if we bring together our national researchers and our top brains in this area.  Horizon 2020 allows for this and I refer to the agenda through which Science Foundation Ireland is trying to focus and bring together talents to make joint applications.  This is the best way in which to maximise the return from taxpayers' money in this regard.  The European research framework programmes have always been an important element in providing international linkages and enhancing the excellence of the Irish research and development system.  They have enabled academic and industry research groups to work with peers across Europe and beyond and to derive the benefits associated with collaborative research, such as access to knowledge networks, sharing of costs and risks and, in particular for industry, the possibility of opening up commercial opportunities.<\/p><p>Ireland's participation in the seventh framework programme, known as FP7 and which ended last year, was highly successful with more than &euro;620 million secured by Irish researchers.  That was above the target set of &euro;600 million and was a great achievement.  However, success brings greater targets and raises the bar again and, consequently, a high bar has been set for what the Government seeks to achieve under Horizon 2020.  While Ireland has a solid track record on which to build further success, it cannot afford to be complacent.  Horizon 2020 is a new departure.  It is not business as usual and the Government must adapt its approach to it.  The competition from across the EU and beyond is intense.  The global economic situation has resulted in reduced national funding resources and, increasingly, researchers are looking to Europe to fill that funding gap.  However, Ireland is participating in the current framework programme from a far stronger position than ever before.  A critical mass of research activity has developed in both the public and private sectors and Ireland is well positioned to perform strongly under Horizon 2020.  The Government perceives Horizon 2020 as an opportunity to further deepen Ireland's engagement in collaborative European and international research.  This is of key importance and already, in the first year, there have been successes in this area.<\/p><p>As each country participating in Horizon 2020 will be targeting increased participation, only projects of excellent quality will win funding.  This requires that Ireland's national research and innovation system performs at the highest competitive level.  Ongoing national funding of research and innovation will be required.  As Horizon 2020 is a competitive funding process, it will not be possible to use Horizon 2020 funding as an opportunity to reduce national funding.  It is of key importance to maintain national funding levels, which will help to make better applications, which in turn should be more successful.  All available opportunities will be used to leverage national investment to maximise funding from Horizon 2020.  National funders are putting significant focus on funding nationally in areas likely to win further funding from Horizon 2020 and other sources.  It is about targeting resources and making sure that all Ireland's universities, colleges and research centres are not competing for the same part of the budget.  Instead, there must be a proper plan in place that attempts to target certain areas in which Ireland has a track record of being successful, where there can be major wins and where good results can be achieved.  A national strategy for Horizon 2020 is in place to direct engagement in Horizon 2020.  A Horizon 2020 high-level group, chaired by my Department and comprising those Departments and Government agencies whose remit includes research and innovation, is tasked with overseeing the implementation of the strategy and securing the maximum benefits for Ireland.  I recently met the aforementioned strategy group a few weeks ago and a very worthwhile round-table discussion was held to update the plans.  That group, under the aegis of my Department, meets every five or six weeks to make sure that the plan is in place and this is checked on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>The Government has set an ambitious target for Irish researchers to win funding of &euro;1.25 billion over the lifetime of Horizon 2020.  It has put in place a national support network, co-ordinated by a national director, Dr. Imelda Lambkin, based in Enterprise Ireland.  In fairness to Dr. Lambkin, she was highly successful with FP7 and her track record speaks for itself.  However, she is aware of the challenges in this regard and that this must be co-ordinated as well as possible to achieve these high results.  A target of &euro;1.25 billion constitutes more than a doubling of what Ireland achieved previously.  It is quite a large target and, as I noted earlier, other parts of Europe and other countries also have realised that they must double their aims and consequently, the pressure is on.  However, I believe the structures are in place to achieve this goal on which we must build.<\/p><p>The national support network, comprising national contact points who are experts in the various research domains of Horizon 2020, provides advice and assistance to researchers seeking to participate in the programme.<\/p> <p>The network also includes a team of national delegates for Horizon 2020 who represent Ireland's interests in Europe on the various programme committees that design the work programmes and priorities.  This national support network works in tandem with the high level group in co-ordinating the national effort to maximise our participation.  We set this ambitious target to go beyond what we have been doing over the past seven-year programme.  To get there will require special efforts designed to identify and create additional value over and above the strong results we traditionally achieve.  A more strategic approach is required aimed at participation in larger scale projects, as well as playing a larger role in projects generally.<\/p><p>Essentially, the objective is to get some big wins to boost our success rate.  Accordingly, I recently introduced an initiative to establish a strategic research proposal group to focus exclusively on large-scale strategic projects.  The purpose of this special advisory group will be to catalyse, develop and advise on the successful submission of Horizon 2020 proposals of a major scale, ones beyond the norm.  This will include proposals where Ireland can take a leading or major role, taking into account timing, likelihood of success and extent of the fit with national priority areas and strengths.  The group will recommend and prioritise any additional commitments, including funding from the State, that might be required to achieve success.  By harnessing the expertise across all relevant Departments and agencies we hope to identify and catalyse such winning bids.  This new group will be chaired by Professor Mark Ferguson, director general, Science Foundation Ireland, and chief scientific adviser to the Government.  The strategic group will be able to feed back into the various levels of the Department as to what resources or personnel are needed.  It is all about putting the teams together that can win big for this country in Horizon 2020.<\/p><p>While it is still early days with the results from the first calls under Horizon 2020, there are some encouraging signs that Ireland will continue to be successful in those areas where we have traditionally performed well in previous research framework programmes, such as health, information and communications technology, researcher career development and support for SMEs.  For example, research collaborations between Irish SMEs and higher education institutions have secured over &euro;9 million in the first outcomes in the researcher career development area of Horizon 2020 known as the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie actions, MSCA.  Irish research performers have achieved success rates above the EU average, outperforming organisations from France, Italy, Spain and the UK.  In one programme, 57% of Irish participants were selected for funding, with one project ranked top in all of Europe.  The funding will support research and innovation projects at 18 Irish research performers including nine SMEs, many of which are spin-outs from higher education institutes.  It is important to recognise the success and greater involvement of SMEs this time around.<\/p><p>Ireland had the highest success rate in Europe in the first results under the SME instrument with 20% of SMEs who applied being successful.  The ten successful SMEs will receive &euro;50,000 each to finance feasibility studies for their projects and may be considered for further financial support from the European Commission worth up to &euro;2.5 million per project.  This success is down to greater industry involvement at all levels.  We need to get this message out there.  Any Members talking to businesses should encourage them to tap into this source of funding.<\/p><p>Horizon 2020 is very different to what has gone before and our level of ambition is far greater.  Given the scale of Horizon 2020, the fact that our national research priorities are aligned so closely to it, as well as the calibre of our national research system, I believe we can meet our ambitious target under the programme.  The Government is determined to make this happen.  The recently announced &euro;245 million investment by the Department in five new, large-scale, world-class research centres is aimed at achieving a step-change in the reputation and performance of Ireland's research system.  This builds on the announcement of seven similar centres last year.  This involves industry matching &euro;90 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  We are constantly trying to get real bang for our buck.  If we are investing taxpayers&rsquo; moneys into research centres of excellence, it is key we get industry involvement and matching funding.  As we do not have an endless budget, we must target our funding at areas where we have been successful before and in which we have expertise.  Building centres of excellence which are internationally recognised as the best will prove successful in winning future funding from Horizon 2020, as well as other programmes.<\/p> <p>With these centres, together with the Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland technology centres, Ireland is now well placed to take the lead in developing cutting-edge research and new technologies.  These centres will also strongly position Irish-based scientists to win funding from Horizon 2020 and other projects.<br\/>Horizon 2020 also represents a significant opportunity for North-South co-operation.  Increasing the value of successful applications and funding awards from Horizon 2020 is an important objective not just of the Irish Government but also of the Northern Ireland Executive.  Members of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation were in Stormont recently to discuss this - Senators Mullins and Quinn might have been there.  It also followed on from a discussion we had last year when we were there.  Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly are really keen to learn from how well we have done with FP7 and to work with us so that they can gain.  The whole island can gain when we work together on some initiatives and target certain areas.  Enterprise Ireland also wants this to happen.  It is key that we build on this and make it a North-South opportunity wherever we can.<br\/>The international collaborative nature of Horizon 2020 makes it ideally suited for Ireland and Northern Ireland to work together to mutual benefit.  The importance of North-South collaboration is recognised by both Administrations and the alignment of our Horizon 2020 support structures, North and South, means there is now a strong basis on which to improve co-operation.  At our recent North-South Ministerial Council meeting, InterTradelreland informed the council that it had produced a strategy document to be signed shortly outlining how we can target coming together and working together on a North-South basis for Horizon 2020.<br\/>Ireland's national support network for Horizon 2020 operates on an all-Island basis.  The work of InterTradelreland, the North-South trade and business development body, has stimulated a move away from <i>ad hoc<\/i>North-South collaboration to a more focused, coherent approach to co-operation that will be mutually beneficial.  This work is paying dividends.  The number of North-South collaborations has been rising steadily.  These collaborations are generating economic value.  A total of 89 successful North-South projects mobilised funding valued at over &euro;80 million from the previous EU research programme, FP7.  InterTradelreland will build on this success to further increase the level of co-operation for the Horizon 2020 programme.  Mr. Patsy McGlone, MLA, and his team on the committee are very eager to make this happen.  I urge everybody involved in the various committees to keep that relationship going and work together.  As a Minister of State, I am certainly happy to facilitate any meetings when they are down here to keep the agenda going.<br\/>InterTradelreland has also developed a suite of supports dedicated to facilitating and supporting North-South co-operation and will continue its integration role with the national support network in Ireland and the newly-established Northern Ireland support structure.  In addition, Science Foundation Ireland will work in partnership with agencies in Northern Ireland to promote all-island collaboration with a view to strengthening future Horizon 2020 initiatives.<br\/>I assure the Seanad that the Government is very conscious of the significant opportunities under Horizon 2020 and of the challenges ahead to maximize our participation in the programme.  We have put in place a national strategy supported by a whole-of-Government approach and it is my priority to ensure that we deliver results.  In recent weeks I have had meetings involving all the universities to discuss their plans for Horizon 2020 and to ensure that everyone buys into the targets.  That is how important it is.  Hopefully in the coming months I will get to visit all the other institutes of education and research centres involved.  Our method is to encourage industry at all levels to get involved.<br\/>Excellence is rightly the standard by which applications for EU funding are judged.  We have shown we can meet this standard of excellence through winning awards of over &euro;620 million under the previous EU research programme.  As I have said we have had encouraging results already in 2014 under Horizon 2020, but a sustained effort will be required over the lifetime of the programme.  It lasts until 2020 and we have to aim high to win high.  We have the track record that demonstrates our ability to compete successfully and I am confident that we will continue our success under Horizon 2020.<br\/>This will have a very significant impact on increasing jobs and sustaining our economy for many years as well as finding solutions to problems in processes in health, climate change, energy and other areas affecting people here in Ireland as well as across the globe.<br\/>For us, Horizon 2020 is about being able to increase the number of researchers we have, build employment and equip our companies to compete in the future.  However, it is also to bring about solutions to societal problems across the board and certainly at a European level.  Ireland has a major role to play.  It will benefit us all in many ways.<br\/>I thank the Senators for facilitating this debate today.  I look forward to hearing their comments and responding to them afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800021#W00300","speaker":"1078","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416329400,"counter":102,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber to discuss Horizon 2020 which gives us all an opportunity to look at innovation policies across Europe that affect all European citizens, including those here in Ireland.<\/p> <p>It is important in the context of economic development and in the context of trying to rejuvenate European economies, including the Irish economy and in combatting the advance of new technologies in other jurisdictions such as in the US, China and India and other places.  It is major step in the right direction in technological innovation across Europe.<br\/>The increased funding to &euro;80 billion is very welcome.  We have come through an economic tsunami over the past five or six years.  Some &euro;620 million in funding has been given to Ireland in the last FP7, compared to the expected &euro;1.25 billion now.  However, this must be qualified by the difficulties well documented by the Irish universities sector, the difficulties in funding for third and fourth level education and also the difficulties being experienced by the SMEs.  The buy-in by the public and private sectors will, to a large extent, be contingent on the availability of funds from other sources.  There is a need for a debate on how universities are to be funded in the future.  On the private sector side, many SMEs are experiencing difficulties as a result of the banks not lending money.  This is a major issue because there is a need for co-funding from applicants.<br\/>While I welcome Horizon 2020 as a marvellous step in the right direction, it is important to qualify it - this is not a political point - in the context of our situation.  Ireland was successful under the last round.  I refer to some of the beneficiaries such as Trinity College, Dublin, which drew down &euro;84 million.  Our universities are doing well under Horizon 2020 objectives.  I read the Irish Universities Association document entitled, Horizon 2020 - Sustaining Excellence in University Research and Innovation, published in December 2013, which dealt with some of the issues the Minister has endeavoured to address today, in particular, the need for collaboration with the university sector, the centres of excellence, North-South co-operation, working with InterTrade Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland.  The all-Ireland dimension is important in that we are working closely with our counterparts in the North and the universities work closely with their counterparts in the North.  I live in Donegal and the north west does not have a university, the closest institution being the University of Ulster at Magee campus.  I cannot understate the importance of Irish universities based here in Dublin, Cork or elsewhere, working with the likes of the University of Ulster and Queen's University, Belfast, in order to develop innovative cross-Border projects that could benefit counties like Donegal.  There is a need for this co-operation in order to benefit all the Border counties and this should be considered.<br\/>The European economy and the world economy are at a crossroads.  I refer to the growth in population and the need for innovation and new technologies.  The Irish EU Commissioner, Phil Hogan, today doubled the research and development funding under Horizon 2020 for the agriculture and food sector.  I referred to some of the challenges.  I refer to a recent article in <i>The Guardian<\/i>which reported on the raid on European research funding by what it termed the Robin Hood scheme whereby the vast majority of the funding - 75% of European research council funding - was going to the larger researchers hosted in the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland.  This poses a challenge for smaller member states such as Ireland and we will need to box clever with regard to simplifying the application process and providing agency and government support for all applications.  <\/p> <p>Simplification of the application process is also important.  While universities will certainly have the expertise to assist the SME sector, we must also provide assistance to that sector to be able to help itself.  I will certainly take the Minister's advice to encourage SME companies to apply for the funding, but often it is the larger foreign direct investment, FDI, concerns or the larger research-based companies that are the focus of attention, be it of the State or of Europe, and perhaps the smaller company with the good idea does not get the chance to come through for many reasons, including funding from the banking sector.  There is a need to examine that as well.<\/p><p>Overall, however, I welcome the funding.  It will be challenging to draw it down.  I hope the &euro;1.25 billion will not be our upper ambition in terms of draw down and that we will go further than that if possible by trying to prepare and assist applications from within the State to be successful at European level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800024#Z00200","speaker":"1123","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416330300,"counter":105,"content":"<p>The president of the European Research Council was here yesterday and met with many researchers.

It has huge implications for both the Union and Ireland.  It combines all the previous work in the area into a single ring-fenced fund.  Approximately &euro;77 billion is the sum involved.  That is a considerable investment in Europe's future competitiveness.<br\/>It has three distinct elements - excellent science, competitive industries and better society.  By investing in science the fund will raise the standard and therefore the attractiveness of European research.  This, in turn, improves our competitiveness and, importantly, will ensure a steady stream of world class European researchers.  These researchers will be provided with world class infrastructure to enable their endeavours.  All of this will bolster the European position as a forerunner in science and innovation.  It will help attract the best brains to our shores and ensure a sharing of information and talent throughout the Union.  This will help to create jobs both here and throughout the EU.<br\/>One field of research to benefit from this will be frontier research.  This is research that might not have any direct industrial application and is an outlier in terms of functionality, pushing the envelope of our knowledge.  However, it is recognised as having huge implications in its application to other areas.  Given its somewhat indirect application to industry it is usually the first to be cut when retrenchment is the order of the day.  The 2020 project, through the European Research Council, will boost investment in this area.<br\/>As well as public investment, part of the project is to encourage private investment in the sciences.  The EU or its member states cannot do it themselves.  Innovative companies often find it difficult to raise finance for what might be cutting edge technology because it is not well recognised in the present day.  Horizon 2020 will try to bridge this gap by providing loans and guarantees as well as direct investment.  This will help to stimulate confidence in the private sector to invest and therefore boost overall private sector investment in areas such as nanotechnology and nanomedicine.  The general estimation is that for every &euro;1 publicly invested, &euro;5 of private financing is generated.  The idea is that the Union will provide the lead and private funds will follow.<br\/>Horizon 2020 takes a new approach to support SME innovation.  It will allow SMEs to collaborate on projects as part of a group and to receive support which will be delivered through a dedicated SME instrument.  The SME instrument will provide staged supports for innovative projects which have potential for high impact.  This is predicated on a sustainable business plan.  In tandem with the grants there will be a coaching facility and the availability of consultation to support innovation.  The process is designed to ensure a favourable environment in which SMEs can innovate and flourish.  Enterprise Ireland has already appointed two dedicated European advisers to deal with SME instrument applications, one in Dublin and one in Shannon.  This is very welcome and I hope the Minister will continue to review the adequacy of this number as these projects develop.  I also recommend the excellent Irish dedicated website created for the purposes of the project, <i>Horizon2020.ie<\/i>.<\/p> <p>The EU has quite rightly identified seven societal strands where innovation can have a beneficial impact for our citizens.<\/p><p>As we are living longer, there are huge challenges for health demographic change and well-being.  Horizon 2020 will particularly focus on research, tackling some of the biggest health issues which exist in our ageing society.  Alzheimer's disease and the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant superbugs which will receive particular attention.<\/p><p>Of particular interest in Ireland will be the concentration on food security, sustainable agriculture and forestry, marine, maritime and inland water research and the bio economy.  With a booming world population we need to find different ways to sustain life on the planet, be it recycling, waste disposal or our approach to consumption and production, all the while being mindful of our human impact on the environment.  With 22 million employed in the wider agricultural sector in Europe, the focus on this area in particular is to be very much welcomed.<\/p><p>Many Irish organisations support the initiative, including the Irish Research Council, InterTradeIreland and the National University of Ireland among many others.  All of these will hold briefings and will help demystify the process.<\/p><p>Time does not allow me to go into all of the details of the various programmes.  I note the Minister of State's comments on the success of the Irish in attracting funding in previous years and the absolute necessity of not being complacent.  The appointment of a high-level review group for the Irish strategy is welcome as we have set very ambitious targets for ourselves.  It is good to hear that, to date, Irish researchers have been successful in their applications at above the European norm, and long may this continue.  I am particularly pleased that Ireland has the highest success rate for funding under the SME instrument.  Now that the banks are starting to function again, this additional and alternative source of funding will go some way to alleviating the difficulties SMEs have been experiencing since the downturn.  After all, they are the lifeblood of our economy.<\/p><p>I am very supportive of Horizon 2020, which is an enormous opportunity to maintain and increase Ireland's standing in the field of research and innovation.  We have set ambitious targets.  The initial signs are good but we must not become complacent, as the Minister of State said.  I look forward to further developments.  Will the Minister of State commit to returning to the House to keep us updated on the progress made?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800026#BB00300","speaker":"1187","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416330600,"counter":108,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is very welcome.  We worked together on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  He will be pleased to know that last week we visited Belfast again and had a very fruitful trip.  We spoke about some of the issues mentioned by the Minister of State, such as InterTradeIreland working with us and seeing what can be achieved.  I congratulate the Minister of State and we are delighted to have him in the hot seat now.  We will ensure we will not make it too hot for him.<\/p><p>I welcome the debate on this topic.  The funding is very useful and potentially will go to very worthy causes.  It is notable that a call was made this month for proposals for the development of a vaccine to combat Ebola and for medical treatment to save lives.  This will be high on the list of targets of anybody in the area.  Will the Minister of State elaborate on how SMEs will be informed on how to apply for a Horizon 2020 funding?  Many SMEs are not aware of opportunities, and some of them may not have the time or resources to apply.  What measures does the Government aim to take to aid SMEs in this area?<\/p><p>I also welcome the fact the EU aims to reduce red tape to make it easier for companies to apply for research funding.  As the Minister of State knows, this is an old hobbyhorse of mine.  Will the Minister of State comment on whether there is too much overlap, or potential duplication, in funding streams?  We have various national funding schemes and various other schemes at EU level.  It is getting very confusing for businesses.  Surely there should be harmonisation or alignment of national and EU funding schemes, or a one stop shop where SMEs could see at a glance what schemes are available and which overlap.  Ideally, SMEs would not waste time and resources by applying for grants that are not right for them.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State's thoughts on this.<\/p> <p>There are great opportunities, but I fear that many smaller businesses are not aware of how to go about availing of them or ensuring that they are not overlapping.<br\/>Another major issue is the fact that co-operation between companies is often crucial for success, in that they use different resources to produce products.  It would be highly beneficial were the EU and the Government to invest resources in bringing companies together to make stronger products.  I have a little bit of experience in this regard.  Superquinn worked with Trinity College, which had developed IdentiGEN for the tracing of meat, to bring a successful product to the market.  We were the first to do it.  However, this would not have happened had a commercial company not worked with the university researching the product.  IdentiGEN is now being sold worldwide.  Co-operation between the research and business sides was vital.  I note that Trinity College has again been successful in getting Horizon 2020 grants.<br\/>On the topic of research, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill mentioned that there had been some criticism of Horizon 2020's funding, in that the amounts awarded were too large and, thus, only a limited number of researchers could be reached.  He cited a <i>Guardian<\/i>article dated 7 November, which stated: &quot;If [European Research Council] starting grants were up to &euro;400,000 instead of up to &euro;2m, five times more early-career researchers (ie 1500) could be funded yearly.&quot;  This makes a strong point that is worthy of consideration.  Does the Minister of State agree that smaller grants might be better suited to invigorating research?  It seems unusual to seek smaller grants but, given Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's figures on the few large countries that are able to avail of larger grants, this is understandable in a smaller country with smaller businesses.<br\/>What are we doing to get Irish researchers and academics to practise abroad?  Language skills present an obvious barrier to mobility.  Can we do anything to improve?  The Government has provided significant opportunities via Horizon 2020.  It would be a shame if we did not make use of them in every way we can.  The ability of businesses to co-operate with research departments in universities has been proven, but we must not limit ourselves to Ireland alone.  Let us see about co-operating abroad as well.<br\/>I congratulate the Minister of State.  He and his team have put together a strong case that is worthy of support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800027#CC00200","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416330900,"counter":110,"content":"<p>With a budget of just under &euro;80 billion and covering the 2014-20 period, Horizon 2020 is the EU's largest ever research and innovation programme.  Its objectives are to enable the creation of a world class research system for Europe, support European leadership in industrial development and address the grand challenges affecting society.<\/p><p>Under the 2007-13 seventh framework programme for research, technological development and innovation, Ireland secured almost &euro;600 million in funding and managed to achieve the national target set for participation.  The Government's aim for the next stage of the programme leading up to 2020 involved setting an ambitious target of &euro;1.25 billion in funding, which was approved in December 2013.<\/p><p>The programme set out by the Government covers a wide range of strategies that aim to maximise our participation in Horizon 2020 and achieve the targets.  Recently, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs received submissions from various organisations and stakeholders on Horizon 2020's mid-term review.  It must be recognised that the economic landscape in Europe bears little resemblance to that of the early years of the millennium and the economic context underpinning the framework has undergone complete transformation.  On the positive side, good progress has been made in education, climate change and energy.<\/p> <p>However, the issues of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, along with poverty and research and development have been much more challenging.<\/p><p>The Europe 2020 strategy sets a target employment for 20 to 64 year olds of 75% or 16 million additional people in employment.  In Ireland's case the number in employment was up 31,600 or 1.7% to the end of the second quarter in 2014, which is one of the strongest growth rates in Europe.<\/p><p>One of the flagship initiatives under Horizon 2020 is the underpinning of a single digital market for Europe.  However, the success of this initiative is under threat from the issues surrounding data protection.  While it is vital that data continue to be allowed to flow across borders if businesses are to achieve their full potential, there has to be a balance between privacy and enterprise and the proposed legislation will need to take this into account.  The target for research and development to reach 3% of GDP by 2020 will not be easy to achieve.<\/p><p>In the area of education, the Better Europe Alliance has put forward a good suggestion which would involve setting subtargets to highlight the different participation and outcome levels for specific groups of young people.  In Ireland that could include Traveller children, children with disabilities or special learning needs and children living in disadvantaged areas.  Setting subtargets for these groups could help to focus resources on the areas most in need.<\/p><p>Excellent science, competitive industry and better society are the three priorities of Horizon 2020.  It is a very ambitious undertaking with the promise of huge rewards in many facets of life.  Midway to 2020, it would certainly seem to be a case of refocusing and re-assessing in the context of the recent economic upheavals.  Devising strategies to deal with the continuing problems of poverty and youth unemployment would seem to pose the most daunting challenges.<\/p><p>As I should have said at the start of my contribution, I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  I wish to reiterate that he is doing a great job and I fully support Horizon 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800028#DD00200","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416331200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Some of my comments will be around the digital agenda for Europe as part of Horizon 2020.  The European Commission figures suggest that the app-economy workforce will rise by 4.8 million by 2018 with revenues more than tripling to &euro;63 billion.  We also know around 90% of jobs by 2020 will require workers to have skills in information and communication technologies.  Therefore, as Europe becomes an increasingly fertile ground for digital content and applications, this infrastructure will enable Europeans to distribute their creations globally.<\/p><p>When I was researching for this debate, I looked at the Horizon 2020 website and its section on the digital agenda which led me to different issues, one of them being cyber security.  While I do not know whether cyber security falls under the remit of the Minister of State, I will mention it briefly because it comes under the broad umbrella of Horizon 2020, and I wanted to raise the topic.  In the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, and as part of cyber security, there is a strategy for better Internet safety for children.  The strategy recommends that industry should be encouraged to take steps, including proactive measures, to remove child sex abuse material from the Internet, which is pertinent in the wake of the announcement by UPC the other week.  Some concerns have been raised about such systems because they would raise significant privacy and data protection issues that have not been addressed, particularly as what is envisaged is a self-regulatory system that does not have a legislative basis or judicial oversight.<\/p><p>While removing the paedo-pornographic content from the Internet is vital and needed to combat child abuse worldwide, the term &quot;preventing viewing&quot; could refer to filters installed and controlled by end users or a network-wide blocking of websites.  As has been pointed out by many experts, a network-wide blocking of websites raises serious concerns about fundamental rights and freedoms.  In 2010, the European Data Protection Supervisor, when discussing these issues, mentioned a need to have appropriate safeguards to ensure that monitoring or blocking would only be done in a targeted way under judicial control and that there would not be a misuse of the mechanism.  Given that the function of filtering or blocking is carried out by external actors, that raises issues of transparency, accountability and legitimacy and calls them into question.<\/p> <p>The particular relevance of that to this debate and the digital agenda is the issue of mission creep, in that other content could be brought within the scope of blocking or filtering and the objective could move beyond that of crime prevention to take on other roles.  As such, the need for categories of appropriate content should be clearly and precisely defined to prevent the excessive application of filtering and to ensure proportionality.  I raise this issue because it has been argued that filtering is not conducive to the positive developments that ICT can facilitate, such as innovation and stronger democracies.  The Minister of State also referred to how evidence showed that many of the recent productivity gains stemmed from innovation.  With this in mind, there is a concern that filtering could lead to mission creep, thereby inhibiting some of the innovations that we would like to see in the digital field.<\/p><p>A broadly based group of stakeholders meets every four to six weeks under the chairmanship of the Minister of State's Department to oversee the implementation and further development of the national strategy for Horizon 2020.  In terms of monitoring, are the outcomes of these meetings published on the Department's website or elsewhere?<\/p><p>The Government is encouraging small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, to engage in large collaborative projects or to seek support through the dedicated SME instrument for highly innovative smaller companies.  On what basis has this approach been agreed and do SMEs have a successful track record in collaborative projects in this setting?<\/p><p>I thank the Minister of State for all his work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800029#EE00200","speaker":"1155","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416331500,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him well in his new and challenging role.  I saw his dedication and commitment at first hand when he was Chairman of the Oireachtas jobs committee.  He is now in a position to deliver the goods.<\/p><p>This programme is one of the most exciting and best goods news stories that we have heard in a long time.  Running from 2014 to 2020, this fund of &euro;80 billion forms part of a drive to create new jobs growth in Europe.  Not only is it Europe's largest ever research and innovation programme, it is the world's largest.  It is designed to raise the level of excellence in our science base, to make Ireland a more attractive location in which to invest in research and innovation and to address many societal issues.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn referred to the main issue, namely, how to spread the message of this good news and ensure that SMEs throughout the country are aware that such a resource is available to them.  This investment could help drive our recovery.  Since the Government entered into office in 2011, there has been steady investment in research and development, but this is a major additional injection for the next six years.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister of State's comment on how this would make it easier for the public and private sectors to work together, in that there would be less red tape.  If there is one issue that small businesses keep raising with us, it is the amount of red tape they encounter and their difficulty in accessing information and grants.  I welcome the fact that a high-level group has been put in place, chaired by the Minister of State's Department and with a support network in Enterprise Ireland, to drive this programme with dedication and commitment.  I also welcome the fact that universities and colleges will be in a position to leverage much of the funding.  I am conscious that, under previous programmes, my university of University College Galway was a significant beneficiary of funding for research and development projects that had considerable impacts on society.<\/p><p>The Minister of State referred to the societal challenges facing us as a nation.  It is important that priority is being given to projects targeting some of the serious issues that will face our world in the years ahead.  Senator Naughton referred to the need for investment in projects to assess and help with people's major health issues, but we are also conscious of the fact that the world's population will reach 9 billion by 2050.  We need to change our approach to production, consumption, recycling and waste disposal radically while minimising the environmental impact.<\/p><p>Smart, green and integrated transport present significant research and investment opportunities.  Transport systems as we know them are probably unstable in the long term.  We rely heavily on reducing stocks of oil, which makes us less energy secure.  I hope that some of the projects that emerge from Horizon 2020's considerable investment will address issues of climate change, energy and raw materials.  The era of never-ending cheap resources is coming to an end and access to raw materials and clean water can no longer be taken for granted.  Biodiversity and ecosystems are also under pressure.  The solution is to invest now in innovation and to support a green economy, one that is in sync with the natural environment.  The Horizon 2020 investment will make a significant contribution to our society and the world.<\/p><p>I strongly support Senator Quinn's comments on North-South collaboration.  During our recent visit to Stormont, we received fine presentations from InterTradeIreland on the level of co-operation between businesses and small industry on both sides of the Border.  The fact that 89 North-South projects were mobilised under the previous programme and drew down &euro;80 million in funding augurs well for the potential of this model.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister of State success in driving this innovative and necessary programme.  Many companies have the potential to benefit from it and a significant number of SMEs have already drawn down up to &euro;50,000 each.  Like Senator Quinn, I am anxious to ensure that it is made easier for smaller companies to gain access to this funding.  I look forward to having the Minister of State appear in the House regularly to provide updates on how matters are progressing, but he should take on board our request that information on the roll-out of Horizon 2020 to small businesses be provided in a timely and professional manner so that everyone has an opportunity to benefit from the significant resources that will be made available during the next six years.<\/p> <p> I am also pleased to hear the Minister of State say that the money will be made available through the European Union and the programme will not reduce the Government's commitment to investing in research and development into the future.  We need to keep in mind that some of the things that will be manufactured and used in our world in five to ten years' time have not even been thought about yet.  All we need do is look at how information technology has changed in the past decade.  We can only dream and imagine what the scientists and innovators of tomorrow will create.  We live in exiting and challenging times for our world and environment and I hope Ireland will play a central role in solving some of the many difficult issues that confront the world today. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800030#FF00200","speaker":"1118","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416332100,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I hate to be the one to put a bit of a damper on things with my comments and hope I am wrong.  For the first two years of Horizon 2020 I understand that &euro;15 billion will be laid aside.  The Seventh Framework Programme had nearly &euro;11 billion in 2013 which did not include funding for a competitiveness and innovation framework but that is now included as part of Horizon 2020.  Why was a more aggressive approach not taken when it came to deriving funding for this programme?  What does that tell us about innovation as a driver of the economy in the European context?

One of the things that I have found about funding in this country is that there is a multiplicity of funding sources and sometimes it becomes so confusing that one loses track of where one is going.  Therefore, I support the call for a simple one-stop framework to access funding.<\/p><p>Higher education institutes will be the key drivers of economic activity but I wonder how much will be invested in the initiative.  The Minister of State's statement mentioned universities and the Higher Education Authority when he referred to Horizon 2020.  Is there funding for the institutes of technology and further education sectors?  Traditionally, the further education sector has not been involved in research.  It should be included, particularly when deriving and developing programmes for second chance learners and the like.  Has a specific body been named or mentioned to attract and match private sector funding for Horizon programmes?  The regional spread is something that I am sure will cause many debates at many meetings around the country.  What has been done about the matter?  <\/p><p>With respect to STEM subjects in schools, we have seen the development of Coder Dojo which is now an international and probably global driving force at national school level and beyond.  Computer programming is now just another language that children learn and the Minister of State will know the benefits of same.  Is there funding available for innovation in this area?  If we get children young and train them then the chances are the benefits will be felt right through the economy as those generations start to grow.<\/p><p>Those are just some of my concerns.  I congratulate the Minister of State and welcome him to the House.  I wish him well with the job that he has taken on. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800031#GG00400","speaker":"1196"},{"type":"speech","time":1416332100,"counter":119,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well.<\/p><p>Some of the warning signs that Senator Craughwell has referred to came out of group think herd instincts in property which was a disaster.  I see so little analysis of the research and innovation sector that I worry it could be the next herd instinct group think.  I am afraid that we will all gallop in one direction that is without substance.  <\/p><p>Over the years, and long before the Minister of State's time, this sector has shown a remarkable ability never to evaluate its performance, programme after programme.  Economists were never let near them because people were afraid of what we would say.  The insider guys gave themselves big grants and so on.  They felt very good about doing so but they must be answerable to a stronger Department of Finance.  We have spent an awful lot of money on this sector but I have seen remarkably little in the form of results.  I see remarkable resistance by all the bodies concerned to ever being evaluated.<\/p><p>There has never been a response, that I can recall, to an bord snip nua's criticism of the level of bureaucracy involved in universities in administering research grants.  I think 70 programmes, in both UCD and TCD, were paid far more than the lecturers and the people who carried out the research.  I have confirmed those numbers but I could not get anybody to take an interest in the matter.  This could be a kind of monster that the banking system proved to be in its time because nobody is asking questions.  Nobody is saying &quot;Where are the results?  These are all huge inputs but when can we see the outputs?&quot;<\/p><p>The report on innovation by the last Government was spectacularly short of any attempt to evaluate.  Parliament cannot have people coming in with one wishlist after another.  That is just bankers saying &quot;Give me another &euro;64 billion so I will feel richer and we will send the bill off later on.&quot;  The time for results is long over as far as these programmes are concerned.  I have mentioned an bord snip nua concerns about the matter.   One does not want to divert market activities into subsidy seeking.  Firms will be pretty skilful at transferring their research activities into some place that will be subsidised by the Minister of State which is great because the profits will look better.  Some guy will give an after dinner speech totally in favour of research on condition that the Minister of State pays for it.  <\/p><p>The success of the United States is due to a lot of the research being funded by firms that do not make after dinner speeches calling on the state to do so.  We are looking now at the base being eroded by profit shifting - the new corporate tax mechanism.  Part of the onus should be put on the members of the advocacy groups, including IBEC, to put in some money upfront and to stop saying we would like it all done for free.  We have learned the lesson that we cannot give everything to everybody without borrowing vast amounts of money.<\/p><p>The Minister of State claimed that the EU aims to reduce red tape but that will be the day.  The EU is built on red tape which has now been translated into 26 languages.  I wish the EU well but I will not hold my breath.<\/p><p>Firms should not offload their research programmes.  Mathematics is the basis of this issue.  I have tried, in my education career and wider policy career, to interest people in improving mathematics in primary schools in Ireland but only a handful of people responded.  The institutions are not interested and most mathematicians are not interested.  The Hickman research from Harvard shows that studying maths in the early years is crucial.  We have so many unqualified people teaching mathematics in Irish schools that it makes me wonder if this whole edifice is built on sand.  The Minister of State, along with the Minister for Education and Skills, should make it their priority to address the problem.  <\/p><p>When I was in primary school I was taught that &uacute;ll agus &uacute;ll eile equals dh&aacute; &uacute;ll.  A lot of primary teachers say they were not prepared during their teaching training even for that level of mathematics.  That is to our disadvantage and means many IDA firms have to import staff.  There is too much advocacy and too little analysis happening in this area which has occurred for a very long time.<\/p><p>In terms of research, I would go for flexible portfolio projects and maybe drop 20% of them ever year in order to keep the scheme moving.  People get nailed into subsidies for research.  They  think it is their career but it is not because this is meant to be a dynamic sector.  <\/p><p>One must also be concerned about the diversion of resources in universities away from lecturing which is what they are there to do.  <\/p> <p>The role of the universities is to produce the next crop of undergraduates.  I have heard it said that one could use the money to buy out one's teaching.  Why would I do that?  My job is to train the next crop of students between 18 and 22.  What I describe occurs a little too frequently.  One person with whom I was debating this said he had not been teaching-centric in his career.  The message has to go out to people like him that universities are teaching-centric.  That is their job.  This points to the hidden cost of the programme.<\/p><p>After what has happened to us, we really must be aware of the position of Europe, which led us into the currency.  As Mr. Draghi said this morning, the equivalent of 85% of Irish GDP had to be given to keep the banks liquid.  That policy came from Europe.  This time around, we do not want another example of herd instinct where we gallop over a cliff.<\/p><p>May I say a word about my own subject?  Economics departments in most Irish universities have been reduced in size.  They were never more important.  We need to evaluate policies, the single currency and every single item of public expenditure put to the Government for approval and appraisal.  We do not have the relevant expertise.  The Wright report showed that approximately 7% of the staff in the Department of Finance were qualified to Master's level, or above, in economics.  The equivalent figure in Canada was 60%.  We do not do project appraisal in banks either.  There is insufficient economic expertise.  Economists were used for PR purposes.  We know the damage they did to the country.<\/p><p>The networks problem is solved.  With the Internet, I can put a message through to San Francisco, to an individual on my campus or to the office next door in the same time.  Therefore, stimulating networks may not be necessary given the changes in technology.<\/p><p>The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech referred to a high-level group.  Senator Reilly referred to mission creep, as did Senator Craughwell.  The Minister of State referred to &ldquo;A ... high-level group, chaired by my Department and comprising those Departments and Government agencies whose remit includes research and innovation&rdquo;.  The country is weighed down with high-level groups; that is the problem.  We need the expertise to do the research and produce the results.  The PR on the results is heavy.  I recall the number of times, both North and South, that I have heard the cure for cancer announced on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  It is a regular event now.  When will the product be in the shops, Mr. Researcher?  The researcher would say he would need a bigger grant to tell me that.  There is an industry that is diverting itself from producing the products the rest of us need.<\/p><p>The other point that worried me was the emphasis on large-scale projects in the Minister of State's speech.  He said that if we do not get project appraisal right, we will have large-scale failures.  The concept of being too big to fail could apply to research in addition to the banks, which are supposed to be too big to fail.  The Minister said the strategic research proposals will focus exclusively on large-scale strategic projects.  This results in a bigger risk.<\/p><p>Another point I am concerned about relates to the five new, large-scale, world-class research centres.  My remarks are intended to be genuinely helpful and I would not want them to be made in a spirit that would undermine national purpose or morale.  We heard about research centres before.  There is hardly a plot of ground left on some university campuses as a result our having gone on a massive building campaign.  Is this the dominance of scientific research or the result of the builder lobby, which had so much influence in bringing the country to the brink?  What is the research?  Where is it published and what does it do?  Where is it commercialised?<\/p><p>One of my best students was the greatest innovator in European aviation.  The Minister of State will know who he is.  The individual in question, Mr. O&rsquo;Leary, addressed three simple matters: price, product and productivity.  He gave the lowest price by far of any of the airlines.  He changed the nature of the product and achieved productivity numbers way in excess of those of competitors.  He did so as part of a normal course.  If we had set up an institution of aviation studies, it would now be costing the State millions or billions of euro.  The Minister of State has to be wary of that.<\/p><p>We need evaluation in this area really badly.  If we keep adding to programmes, nothing will ever get dropped and the country will never solve its public finances problem.  We will just have incrementalism the whole time.  If each new project has its PR agency and the budget goes up, nothing will ever get dropped and we will not be able to get out of the bind we are in.  <\/p><p>The scientists and engineers have done remarkably well.  It is time for them to produce some results for the rest of us and not fall into the previous pitfalls of an economy built on banking and building.  There is a need for a more balanced portfolio.  The lack of economic expertise in this area, many areas in the public sector and in banks has to be addressed as part of research programmes because the lack of it is one of reasons the country went on the rocks a number of years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800031#GG00500","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416332700,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I thank the Seanad for the opportunity to discuss this subject.  Senator Barrett outlined the main reason we should be here.  We need to tease this out and discuss it a lot more.  It is important and that is why I am delighted everybody involved in decision-making, be it in the Seanad, the committee or D&aacute;il, can tease out the whole agenda pertaining to Horizon 2020.  I have been asked by a few Senators to come back on this.  I would have no problem coming back every week on it because it is of the utmost importance.  It concerns the one area we are actually getting right as a country.  I am not referring solely to activity of the current Government over the past three years as successive Governments over the past ten years have got this right.  I will be happy to consider how we are progressing in three or four months but it is important that those who want to contribute familiarise themselves with the exact details and get stuck in.  Then we can have a proper discussion on it.<\/p><p>I chaired the committee responsible for the enterprise, jobs and innovation agenda.  I have said on many occasions since that we did not spend enough time on the innovation agenda.  It is difficult to be fully informed about it.  It is the one area we will have to become informed about, however.  I, as Minister of State responsible for the agenda, am prepared to work, through the committee I chaired or a separate one, with those who are interested in this area.  It is important that we know what we are spending our money on and why it is worth spending.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett is correct that it is important that we evaluate this.  I am very impressed with the evaluation I have seen, and with the peer-to-peer evaluation.  I refer to the international perception of the Irish success and to Irish investment and what is emerging from that.  I will not revert to what happened in the past; I can only speak about what is happening now.  I would be very happy to sign off on the system to evaluate the benefits accruing from our taxpayers' money.  I am in this job for only three or four months but have spent a lot of time meeting the relevant players, particularly those in the business environment, who are best positioned to judge value for money and what they believe they are getting out of the system.  They say many companies are choosing to locate in this country because they realise the benefits of and value that accrues from our research, development and innovation agenda.  They say that is one of the main reasons they are locating here.  While they may be motivated by the tax regime, etc., they believe the real agenda is innovation.  The companies recognise the effort successive Irish Governments have made on the research agenda.  Coming here involves a big decision.<\/p><p>An important point, to be discussed by the committee, concerns whether we are getting value for money from the research and development grants and tax incentives.  The best way to judge is to examine the companies increasing the numbers they employ.  These are the companies that are investing in research and development, and they are working with all our research centres and institutes on the research agenda.  These are the companies that are expanding, innovating and increasing their employment.  To me, that is proof enough of the value of grants and tax incentives.<\/p><p>On the overall research agenda, are we getting value for money through universities and institutes of technology?  There will always be a question about this.  However, where we have focused our money in the research centres and targeted key areas, we have been getting value for money, and this will increase.  Our success with FP7 and Horizon 2020 has proven that.  The spin-off benefits and the commercialisation of which Senator Barrett spoke prove it also.<\/p><p>The targets are now being set.  Key performance indicators are being set in terms of what we want to achieve every year regarding the training of new researchers, spin-off effects and disclosures.  I attended an event in Trinity College, Dublin, a few weeks ago because the college reached its 500th disclosure.  That is proof that those concerned are getting the commercialisation agenda into their heads.  This is the one significant benefit that will help in the evaluation of our expenditure here and prove it is worth spending money here.<\/p><p>I assure the House that it is difficult arguing with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to get money in this area.  One does not get it for fun.  Unless one can prove that it will result in value and have an impact, one will not get the resources.  There has been an increased allocation from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, through my Department, for capital expenditure on research and development in the various centres.  That proves we have won the argument in this regard.  I would be happy at any stage to engage with concerned individuals and go through the figures.  I encourage Senators to talk to Mr. Mark Ferguson, chairman of Science Foundation Ireland, which is driving the impact agenda.  The impact must result in value for money.  On the question of whether we are getting a return on our expenditure in this area, I believe we are.  I ask Senators to engage with Mr. Ferguson on this and buy into the process.<\/p> <p>If Members are not happy then let us change the strategy but I think they will be when they see the results because there is proof there and there is a system so they can track the money being spent.  It may not have been there in the past - I will not speak for the past - but it is there now.  It is important because this country has invested heavily in this agenda over the last ten years.  It will serve us well, but we must keep it going and if there is any doubt in people's mind, I would urge them to get fully informed and check it out.  I will make available any information they want on this issue and I suggest that they take time out to go and visit some of the research centres.  This is not capital spend or building new buildings.  It is bringing together all the best brains of all our institutions, including our institutes of technology, in the research centres with SMEs and companies to drive the spend and put money together.  I am sorry if I gave the impression that it did not include institutes of technology.  It includes all our higher education institutions - universities and institutes of technology.<\/p><p>The only way to prove one is spending taxpayers' money wisely is to see industry adding money to it.  Most of these research centres have at least 30% matched funding from industry.  That would not happen if industry did not believe in it.  That is encouraging, but it is an area that we must all get more involved with and examine more, because it is not something that Deputies and Senators have enough time for.  We must make time for it because it is a major agenda for this country and our recovery has been built on it.<\/p><p>A couple of issues were raised.  If I miss any points because I run out of time I will provide answers in writing, but Senators should feel free to shout at me if I miss something as I am going along.  <\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the issue of our participation being contingent on universities and SMEs and their funding.  He is right, but we are very conscious of the need to maintain that level and we have increased the spend in this area to make sure of this.  There is no point in us setting a target of Horizon 2020 and then pulling the rug from under it, so we are not doing that.  We are putting the extra money in where it is needed.  The high-level working group is not a talking shop.  Its purpose is to ensure that we are on track every month with what we are doing here.  If we see a gap, for example, that we cannot expect Trinity or UCD to be successful in a project without extra resources or money at the right place and time, we will ensure that we are providing enough resources to encourage a multinational or an SME to work with institutes of technology.  Each area has been asked to coordinate plans.  There is one coordinating plan for all institutes of technology.  The universities generally have their own as well, but everyone has been asked to have their little plan in place so that we can monitor the situation and check on a regular basis that we are on track to achieve success.  The institutes of education were the reason we won over half the money the last time and we need them to do the same again this time.  They know that.  They know their role in this and they know they must step up and do that.  They are willing to do that and they all have plans in place for it, so we will monitor that too.<\/p><p>The Senator also referred to the fact that 75% of ERC money goes to larger countries.  That is correct.  Ireland has improved its position in relation to the drawdown of ERC money over the last couple of years and that is why the president of the European Research Council was here yesterday, complimenting Ireland's improvement in this area.  He was brought here to engage with all our research communities to see how we can improve on that, because it is an area we want to improve on.  I had a good chat with him yesterday and addressed the conference myself as well, but there is room for improvement in that respect.  We have had over &euro;51 million in funding from the ERC through 40 different research applications, so we must build on that and improve on it because it is not meant to be set aside for larger countries.  We are trying to target each part of the research budget to see how we can win bigger.  One must break it down and look at each one individually and we are doing that as well, so we are making progress.<\/p><p>Senator Naughton spoke about frontier research.  This is also important.  It goes back to the issue Senator Barrett mentioned about the money getting lost in the system.  Over the past three or four years, we have driven a prioritisation agenda.  The State, through taxpayers' money, is only funding major research in key areas.  The scattergun approach does not work for us anymore.  We cannot afford to spend money chasing every dream out there and supporting all blue skies research.  We would like to but we cannot, so we are trying to target the money through more focused research for priority areas, namely, applied research.  It is still important that we have some blue skies research and some basic research to keep the overall pot going and keep researchers developing that.  That is probably best achieved through the frontier research, which allows for the combination of basic and applied research.  In terms of value for money, as an economist will always look for, as I would coming from an accountancy background, applied research is where one will see the real impact, but we must have basic research to ensure we can have applied research in the future.  I agree with having great participation in the ERC.<\/p><p>It is important to maintain support for SMEs.  We want to have SME participation and we have had some good results in that area.  A few Senators, including Senator Quinn, have asked how this happens and who drives that agenda.  That is mainly done through Enterprise Ireland, the body that we have all decided is the best body to work with our SMEs and businesses for future growth and exports.  Through Imelda Lambkin and Gerry, whose second name I forget, it is doing great work as an agency to drive this agenda and is working with SMEs as well to ensure they are in a position to work as part of research teams who can make the drawdown here.  There are different opportunities for SMEs and larger companies to get into this system and to be part of the ecosystem as well.  There are also reviews on a regular basis, to ensure we are attracting SMEs in a strong enough way.<\/p><p>How does one picture the research ecosystem?  How does one see where one can fit in as a small company or a start-up?  We are developing a directory on this, which will be published in December, to enable people to tap into the system and see where is the best place to go with an idea or a concept.  We are trying to say that one must engage with the educational and research community through the research centres, through the universities and institutes of technology.  That is the best way of doing this and one develops that collaboration - businesses and institutes of education draw down money together, putting the brains together with the innovator or the driver of an initiative through a business.  That works quite well and that is how to develop that.<\/p><p>There are dedicated contact points for SMEs and regular information events for SMEs, North and South.  The directory will help show that.  On 2 December there will be a major showcase in the National Convention Centre which will set out the research ecosystems.  I encourage people, including Senators, to come to that to engage and meet with all those involved in the research community to see what they are doing.  It will be laid out in a good structure so one will be able to see the best area for a person with a particular background to engage.  It will be a good place to display what is going on, because I accept that even for me coming in here, it is difficult to see everything.  This is how one will see it - a showcase, with a directory following on from that as well.  People will have a chance to see it and to find out how to get more involved.  There are also grants to support travel for SMEs to get involved in this.  Chasing Horizon 2020 money and chasing various funding requires one to go out there and look for it.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn mentioned foreign languages.  One must go and win it and sell it and actually convince people, so international collaborations are necessary, but so are language competencies to enable one to argue a case and compete.  There is a serious drive, cross-Border and throughout Europe, to work together.  Most of our universities and institutes of technology are working on teams that include North-South collaboration, and collaboration with Scotland, the UK and further afield.  I attended an event in Trinity in August and they were involved with Norway, Sweden, Spain, the UK, Denmark and Ireland in a drawdown.  The research agenda is breaking down borders and bringing everyone together, which is what should happen at a European level if we are to get results for Europe, not just for Ireland.  That is the whole idea behind Horizon 2020.<\/p><p>There was talk about having smaller versus larger grants.  One needs both.  To be able to achieve success in important areas, of which energy would be one, one must have large-scale grant opportunities and drawdown, but the system is designed in such a way that to achieve a big win or a large-scale grant one must have major participation from a number of players.  It is not a case of one player stepping in and winning a big pot of money.  It is only a collaboration.  One does not get a big win unless one has a big number of people coming together across business and the academic community, working together to get that big win.  That is what we are trying to do to drive scale.  It is bringing a number of people together and it will also nearly always involve a number of countries to get that big win.  Then the question is how to divvy up the money.  It is apportioned in an agreed manner, so that one will know what each country won, but it will be a collaboration as well.  <\/p><p>On the simplification of red tape, we all agree that there is too much red tape in our own system and certainly in the European system as well.  The new Commission's agenda is to stop making new laws in Europe, but rather to start simplifying existing laws and cutting red tape.  This was also said to us last January when we were there as a committee - and Members here attended with me - and we had three or four days of meetings with the various players in Europe.  I hope that continues.  As Deputies and Senators, we will be part of that, and we must drive that agenda as well.  In the area of Horizon 2020, they have cut the red tape.  They have cut the timescale and they have cut other areas as well, to make it easier to draw down money and to coordinate an application, so that if one goes in and fails on the first attempt, one may come back on the next attempt, meaning that there is much more encouragement to get involved in the system.  It is probably still too cumbersome.  From talking to multinational companies to get them involved, it seems it is too long for their timescale, because a businessperson makes a decision much quicker.  They decide today what is going to happen and then move on the next day, but when one is applying for funding, that is taxpayers' money, co-ordinated at European level, and one will not be able to get the answer in a month.  It does not work that way.<\/p> <p>It will probably take about a year to put an application together and then win and draw down the funding and so on, but it is a lot quicker than it was before.  It is in case of building on that as well.  We have a lot of structures in place to facilitate that.  <\/p><p>Senator Moran raised the issue of the proposed data protection legislation.  We will need a balanced approach on that to protect privacy, which is also part of the agenda.  We are ensuring our MEPs raise that constantly at European level in order to get the message across.  <\/p><p>There was a reference to developing networks and a suggestion that we do not need networks as we are beside each other.  It should be borne in mind that a lot of the funding and the research tenders aim to develop new networks to be able to cater for the demands of the future.  In the Tyndall National Institute research centre they are working on the whole concept of the &quot;internet of things&quot;.  They have proven to me that we are only at about 10% capacity today compared to what is going to be going through the networks in years to come.  We are not even at the races.  We have to be constantly thinking of news ways to be able to avail of that and to be part of it.  New networks get the information to join thinking together and bring IT equipment together.  It is a big area, a whole big data agenda.  Ireland can be major player in it but we need to get in there and be well informed about what is going on.  It is not as simple as just developing a new network to be able to pass information to each other.  We will have be able to carry the information that is going to come down the line in the future.  We are only starting in this area.  What I see going on is surprising me every day.  The companies that are involved in innovation research, the projects they are developing and what they are doing with the future, is very interesting and we can get involved with it.  Horizon 2020 is part of that agenda as well.<\/p><p>Senator Reilly raised the issue of cybersecurity.  It falls slightly outside the remit of Horizon 2020 but there is some spin-off from the Horizon 2020 application.  It will be part of it, although it is not technically there.  We are working on it with a couple of colleagues.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Dara Murphy, will be part of this agenda with me.  It is a very important issue.  Cybersecurity and cyberbullying go back to the area of education.  We have consultations with students on a regular basis where we ask them what issues are affecting and bothering them.  Usually when I attend a  class or an event with students the first issue they bring up is cyberbullying.  They all put their hands up.  Nobody really has the answer to that.  I would advocate stretching the agenda to fit these issues.  It is certainly something we have to address at European level as it is of major concern to young people.  Some of the Senators are more involved in education than I am and they will know this.  It is a new area for me to get involved in but all of us have a duty to do a bit of work on it.  The question of what is going to happen in this area is the biggest fear I would have as a new parent.  We have to protect ourselves and our children.  <\/p><p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of funding for institutes of technology.  They are absolutely involved in this as well.  It is probably fair to say that the universities have built up a greater capacity for research and development over the years but the institutes of technology are right in there because they are at the heart of business.  They are at the front line within industry on a daily basis.  They are very much part of what we are trying to do here.  They have a co-ordinating unit among them to try to drive this agenda, and they have had a major role in drawing down the funding.  I will be working very closely with them as they are essential to what we are trying to do, which is to bring all the players together.  <\/p><p>The Senator also expressed a concern as to whether the funding had been cut.  He would have to look at the framework over the six or seven years.  When a new framework is started, there will not be a flood of applications in the first year.  It generally happens in years two, three and four.  In the overall budget and timeframe there is an increase of about 30% match for match, even allowing for the new area that we have taken in.  This is a major increase in funding and it was hard fought for.  The Department of Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation was a major player in that because it was sorted out during the Irish Presidency.  There was a lot of work involved and it was not easy to get the money allocated.  A lot of governments in Europe said we were under too much pressure in other areas and that we needed money spent elsewhere.  It is a hard-won increase and it will be spent very well, with the greatest of scrutiny, because we do not get money out of Europe that easily.  <\/p><p>This is one agenda we have to scrutinise and it will stand up to scrutiny.  It is about impact, making sure we are getting value for our money and getting results.  Impact is the word.  If impact cannot be proven in the science agenda these days, it is very hard to get money.  This goes back to the commercialisation agenda.  Are we getting the results out of that?  Are we going to get products and processes and new initiatives as well as jobs and solutions?  I think we are, but we need to make it happen faster. <\/p><p>At a national level we now have a knowledge transfer office.  Its job is to make it easier to turn the research into useful data and material that will be commercialised.  If a company wants to tap in to research, it can find a way.  In the past it was complicated; companies had to deal with each university, institute of technology or college differently.  The job of the transfer offices at local and national level is to make it easier to engage with that information and with the research community in order to extract the information and get it commercialised into a solution, a job, a process or an initiative.  Everyone now knows that in order to avail of taxpayers' money it is necessary to get into the agenda of commercialisation.  It is a priority agenda.  Not everyone likes it but we have to get value for money and with the competitive budgets in recent years we have had no choice but to focus our money in key areas.<\/p><p>Programme evaluation was also mentioned.  There are different methods of evaluating it.  Research funders are brought together from all over the world across the whole development to monitor and evaluate it.  Even when it comes to picking the projects for success at a national level outside of Horizon 2020, for example, when we announced the five new research centres a few weeks ago, they were not picked by Irish people or decision makers in this Government but by outside players looking at all the projects and picking the ones that offered the best value for money, that could get results and have an impact.  We are trying to put Ireland on the world map for certain areas, for example, the health agenda and software.  I will pass the information on all these key areas to the Senator if he would like it.  They are the areas in which we can make an impact on the world stage and drive and build on our reputation to win new funding, business and jobs.<\/p><p>I am sympathetic to the Senators' comments on red tape and impact.  That is all there and we will be achieving that.  I would ask everyone to get involved with this area because we have to be at the heart of innovation.  I have no doubt that it has been driving our recovery so far.  Companies are locating here and we have the health innovation centre as well.  The large multinationals are beginning to do more research and development here because they recognise the talent that we have.  Through our spend on these different research centres, colleges, universities and so on, we are growing the number of people in the research community.  The target is for about 700 or 800 researchers to be turned out every year.  If we do not keep producing these people we cannot keep on having a role in this agenda.  That has been quite well channelled by various players in the sector as well.<\/p><p>I am happy to come back to this House on a regular basis to work with the Senators, because it is an area of utmost importance.  Europe recognises that and so do we, although there are competing demands.  I attended my first European Council meeting recently, and the agenda was to discuss whether governments can afford to spend money on research and development.  Some countries want out of that.  I think they are mad but they are under competing demands.  We can see the benefits of it here so we can say that it is important to keep it going although reaching our target of 2.5% of GDP is not going to be easy.  People who are making decisions need to be convinced that it is right to spend taxpayers' money on this.  When I can see industry's money matching up with taxpayers' money I know we are on the right track.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800032#HH00200","speaker":"1078","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"EU Protocol 21: Motion","time":1416333900,"counter":124,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800034#KK00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1416333900,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote><br \/>That the proposal that Seanad &Eacute;ireann approves the exercise by the State of the option or discretion under Protocol No. 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to take part in the adoption and application of the following proposed measure: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Union agency for law enforcement training (CEPOL), repealing and replacing the Council Decision 2005\/681\/JHA, a copy of which was laid before Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 8 August 2014, be referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, in accordance with Standing Order 70A(3)(<i>j<\/i>), which, not later than 20 November 2014, shall send a message to the Seanad in the manner prescribed in Standing Order 73 and Standing Order 75(2) shall accordingly apply.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800034#KK00300","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416333900,"counter":126,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of Seanad","time":1416333900,"counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800034#KK00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1416333900,"counter":128,"content":"<p>It was agreed on the Order of Business that the statements on the Irish airlines superannuation pension scheme be taken at 6 p.m. to conclude no later than 6.30 p.m. The Minister's opening remarks will be five minutes and group spokespersons will have four minutes, with the Minister to reply no later than 6.27 p.m<i>.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800034#KK00400","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416333900,"counter":129,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 5.50 p.m. and resumed at 6 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Irish Airlines Superannuation Scheme: Statements","time":1416334500,"counter":130,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800035#LL00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1416334500,"counter":131,"content":"<p>We will now move on to item No.2a, statements on the Irish airlines superannuation scheme.

These sections allow the trustees to amend the provisions of the scheme and to provide also for the cessation of the revaluation of preserved benefits under that scheme where the trustee amends it.  Having considered the trustee's request and reflected on all of the issues relating to the IASS difficulties, I signed the commencement order last evening.  Had I not signed the order, this would have posed an unquantifiable risk to the entire scheme and could have had profoundly serious implications for all members of the scheme.<\/p><p>I would like to set out for the House the background to these difficulties.  First, let me make it clear that the administration of the IASS is a matter for the trustees of that scheme.  Resolution of its funding difficulties is primarily a matter for the trustees, the companies participating in the scheme, the scheme members and the Pensions Authority.  The process currently underway involves all of these stakeholders.<\/p><p>These difficulties have increased with the result that a significant funding deficit has arisen, up from &euro;344 million in 2011 to &euro;769 million in March 2013.  I understand that this was due not only to the unsustainable structure of the scheme but also to the global downturn which saw the value of investments fall sharply allied with interest rates falling to unprecedented levels and thereby significantly increasing the scheme's liabilities.  With the scale of this deficit, it was outlined in March 2013 that in the event of a wind up of the scheme, because priority is given to pensioners, the active and deferred members would receive only 5% of their benefit expectations based on pension legislation prior to the December 2013 amendment which permitted reductions to be made to pensions in payment.  Against the background of threatened industrial action, my Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, together with ICTU and IBEC, established an expert panel to investigate how a final resolution could be reached.  Their task included finding the fairest way to distribute the burden of resolving the current deficit in the scheme, while addressing a range of other impediments.<\/p><p>The expert panel recommended in its report that the IASS trustee engage with the employers on ways to alleviate as much of the impact of the trustee proposals as possible for the deferred members while also recognising the overall affordability to the employers of the proposals for active and deferred members.  The panel outlined a set of principles that it recommended should form the basis of such engagement.  As a result of that report, there was an uplift in the moneys to be provided by the employers outside of the IASS, a significant proportion of which is intended for the deferred members to make a contribution towards mitigating the benefit cuts proposed by the IASS trustee.  This is an essential consequence of the process proposed by the expert panel.  Specifically, almost &euro;20 million in extra funding is being proposed by the employers for deferred members in addition to the &euro;40 million already being made available for this group, bringing the full amount to &euro;60 million.  The total contribution proposed by the employers for all members now amounts to more than &euro;260 million.<\/p><p>The trustee advised me on 12 November 2014 that having given consideration to the observations it received pursuant to the consultation process and all relevant factors, it had decided to make an application to the Pensions Borard for a section 50 direction and to submit a funding proposal based on the measures outlined to address the deficit in the IASS.  This application is subject to Aer Lingus shareholder approval for the proposals and the commencement by ministerial order of the relevant provisions of the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014.  The trustee asked that I proceed with the immediate commencement of the provision in order to facilitate implementation of the funding proposal.<\/p><p>The trustee, who has the lead role in terms of responsibility for the pension scheme, believes that the measures proposed are in the overall best interests of the members of the IASS as a whole, are in compliance with the trustee's fiduciary duties and also in line with the trustee's obligations under the pensions Act and the requirements of the Pensions Authority.<\/p><p>The trustee also confirmed its compliance with section 34B(1) of the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014.  The three employers, Aer Lingus, DAA and SAA also wrote in support of the trustee's request that the commencement orders be made with immediate effect in order to facilitate implementation of the funding proposal.<\/p><p>On the basis of this, it is clear that the proposals to resolve the IASS difficulties are complicated, intricate and deeply challenging.  It is also clear that the funding proposed by the employers is the maximum that can be achieved in the circumstances.  It must be recognised that a figure more than &euro;260 million is a significant contribution from the employers, particularly in the context of the ongoing viability of these companies as major employers.  Any efforts to reduce the impact of the proposals on one group would adversely affect the other groups and would destabilise the entire initiative.<\/p><p>I agree with the expert panel's view and I believe that, in the circumstances, the proposed package of measures offers the best possible outcome for all concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800035#LL00300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416334800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Senator Darragh O'Brien has four minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800036#MM00200","speaker":"1164"},{"type":"speech","time":1416334800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.  I thank the Minister for coming into the House today, following my request on the Order of Business.  I appreciate the Minister is busy, but I am sure he appreciates the gravity of what signing the two commencement orders means to thousands of people, who were members of the scheme.<\/p><p>Unfortunately the time allocation of four minutes will not be sufficient to address the points I wish to raise.  I am very disappointed that the Minister signed the commencement orders in advance of the social welfare Bill being completed in the D&aacute;il and before it will come to the Seanad.  My colleagues and I in both the Fianna F&aacute;il and other parties had tabled amendments, which I am sure he and the Minister for Social Protection would have seen, which if accepted would actually negate some of the additional powers he gave to trustees in the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014.  From my viewpoint it feels that the legs have been taken from under us.<\/p><p>The Minister has referred on a number of occasions to the significant amount of &euro;260 million being put into the scheme by the employer.  However, there remains a &euro;500 million shortfall in the &euro;769 million deficit following the &euro;260 million the employers have apparently put into the scheme.  This means the employers have been able to wipe off &euro;500 million.<\/p><p>What the Minister and his predecessor did in conjunction with the then Minister for Social Protection, in the Shannon Airport scheme to give the trustee the unilateral power to reduce benefits in the scheme to active, deferred and retired members and this has now allowed the trustees and the companies effectively to write off  the under-funded amount of &euro;500 million.  The irony is that the long service deferred members in particular will be hit by reductions of almost 50% and some by reduction of more than 50%.  The retired members, people who have worked in the company for decades will lose six weeks pay, which is more than 10% of their income and on top of that they will carry the ongoing risk of that scheme.  They must also pay an additional levy of 2.53% on their benefit because the current Government took &euro;28 million from that under-funded scheme to pay the pension levy.<\/p> <p>They are now paying an additional levy of 2.53% on their benefits because the Government took &euro;28 million from that under-funded scheme to pay the pension levy.  Ironically, it took &euro;11 million very recently.<\/p><p>Four minutes is not enough to set out what is being done here.  As I said to the Minister when we debated the State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill 2014 in this House, this is the first time in the history of the State that a Minister and a Government have legislated to reduce benefits in a specific private pension scheme.  That is what they have done.  Why have they done it?  To add insult to further injury, who is going to vote on this?  The shareholders in Aer Lingus will vote on it at an extraordinary general meeting on 10 December next and the members of the scheme will not have a say.<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned that industrial action has been threatened.  There was a big divvy-up between the unions and the Government on this.  They knew that the retired members did not have the threat of industrial action at their fingertips and that those who had left the company were no longer employed.  That is why they have taken the brunt of the cuts.  I accept that active members have taken a hit and are going into an inferior scheme.  It is unfortunate that we are talking about this because it is being done now.  Shareholders will be able to vote but members will not.<\/p><p>I would like to refer to something I have noticed in a number of the Minister's speeches.  I do not mean to be personal when I mention that whoever is writing these speeches for the Minister keeps suggesting that the expert panel was engaging with the various groups.  The panel did not engage with the different groups.  It engaged with the employers and the unions, but it did not engage with the retired members through the Retired Aviation Staff Association and it did not engage in any meaningful way with the deferred members.  It is a lie to suggest that the panel engaged with those who have been left carrying the can for years of under-funding and mistakes by successive employers and Governments.  This scheme was used as a vehicle to get people out of the company.<\/p><p>As I have been given just four minutes, I do not even have enough time to go into the difference between the unco-ordinated members and the co-ordinated members.  People who have paid more money into this scheme are losing as much as those who have paid less.  Along with my colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy O'Dea, I intend to table amendments to the Social Welfare Bill to deal with this matter, which has been coming down the track for two and half years.<\/p><p>By doing what he did yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has given every single employer in this country a roadmap to wind down defined benefit schemes.  This started when the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, changed the priority order in the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2013.  We knew the Government was not going to put &euro;760 million into the scheme.  Of course that was not going to happen.  People want a fair breakdown and level of cuts across the different categories.  They do not think a solvent employer should be allowed to wind down an insolvent scheme.  The T&aacute;naiste brought in a single insolvency arrangement.  That is what was done.  Two years ago, profitable companies sitting on millions of euro in cash were given a roadmap showing them how to wipe off &euro;500 million.  This company's share price will go through the roof on 10 December when its shareholders vote to cut old people's pensions and to take the legs from under the deferred and existing members.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, for being here today.  It is nothing personal.  I am disgusted about what happened yesterday.  Right through this, no one has listened.  Is the Minister aware that the T&aacute;naiste sat down with members of this scheme last week and said that a way forward might be found?

It came to me very late.  It strikes me that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has faced something of a Hobson's choice in this regard.  Like Senator Darragh O'Brien, I have known the Minister for a long time.  If there had been another opportunity to go in a different direction, I do not doubt that the Minister would have been quite satisfied to have taken it.<br\/>We need to deal with the cold hard facts.  This pension scheme has a deficit of almost &euro;800 million.  In the past, the administration by the pensions industry of some pension funds in this State was a scandal.  The case of the Waterford Crystal workers eventually ended up in the European Court of Justice.  The court's decision, which I consider to have been fair, meant the State paid.  That was the outcome.  The State cannot keep paying for everything.  There are always competing rights.  In this case, there is competition between the rights of people who have retired and those of people who are working.  There were competing rights in the Waterford Crystal case.  I knew quite a few people involved.  In that circumstance, there was competition between the rights of people who had retired, who were fully paid, and those of people who were working, who practically got nothing.  That was not fair and that was not correct.<br\/>I do not know anything about the expert group.  I do not know whether the members of the group are experts.  I assume the people who have been employed to conduct this work have been doing it in a fair, open and impartial manner.  On that basis, I note that the existing members of the workforce have voted in favour of the position the expert group came up with.  I fully expect Aer Lingus to vote in favour of it at the extraordinary general meeting.  It would be colossal for a deficit of &euro;500 million to be wiped.  I hope and expect that everything associated with this occurrence has been done to the satisfaction of the Pensions Authority and the Minister.<br\/>It is sometimes helpful to come to a conversation like this cold.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say at the end of the debate.  Sometimes we cannot see the wood for the trees.  One can be sucked into a portion of a conversation that one is not capable of leaving behind.  The numbers in question are so large that it puts the whole Irish Water debate into the ha'penny place.  It is a multiple of the amount of money involved in Irish Water, albeit on a once-off occasion.  I look forward to the Minister's contribution at the end.  I know this is a difficult circumstance for some people.  Like many Senators - I assume this also applies to Deputies - I have been receiving multiple e-mails from people who are affected by this.  Nobody wants to be affected by it.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800037#NN00300","speaker":"1160"},{"type":"speech","time":1416335400,"counter":139,"content":"<p>We have a point of order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800037#NN00400","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1416335400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Given that not too many spokespeople are offering after Senator Barrett, I was going to request that another couple of Senators could be allowed to speak, with the indulgence of the Minister.

Too many financial organisations think they can call around to the office of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, to collect large amounts of money.<\/p> <p>The excuses previously given were that our pension funds have too many expenses, they were too liberal with the added years and early retirements and they failed to anticipate longevity.  In two minutes we could dispute all of those.  A pension fund appears to be, as in this case, almost hijacked when some of the organisation or its members need to reduce its labour force at a period when pension funds look to have more black ink than red.  This was being treated as a gift of the day by the trustees.  The conduct of trustees has to be examined arising from what has happened today.  It is part of a picture of a financial sector which was not adhering to what we would regard as proper standards in banking, insurance and pension funds.  This is where it ends up when trying to resolve it.  I sympathise very much with what Senator O'Brien said because it is hugely influential in his constituency.  However, how did this happen?

Like Senator O'Brien, I was horrified when I got an e-mail late last night from one of the pension groups concerned saying that the Minister had signed the commencement order.  We had heard last week that this issue was being examined again, that the deferred pensioners had met with the T&aacute;naiste and positive noises had been made and that they had been told the Government was finally listening to their case and accepted the fact that to cut anyone's pension entitlement by 60% just as they are about to retire is an outrage.  We had flagged that Senator O'Brien, myself and our D&aacute;il colleagues would be tabling an amendment to the Social Welfare bill.  We had hoped that the Government would finally listen and realise how unfair this is and change course on it.<\/p><p>I was so angry when I got that e-mail last night.  These people had been e-mailing members of this House and the other House for weeks.  They had been getting the same bland information that I and my colleagues in the House have been getting for months about the general situation in the pension fund.  No one came back to people and explained why it is right to cut the pensions of retired members by an unfair amount or how it could possibly be right to cut the pensions of people who had 34, 35, or 38 years service by 60%.  I still have not seen a reply from the Minister's office or from anyone else that answers that question directly.  People deserve that minimum amount of respect. They do not deserve to be getting general replies about the problem with the fund.<\/p><p>All of us accept that there are problems with the fund and there needs to be a fair and sensible solution to that.  However, what is being proposed is incredibly unfair.  There is no justification for it.  As stated earlier, first, it is unprecedented for the Government to rush through legislation to interfere in a private pension fund to this extent and, second, to cut payments and private pension entitlements by such a severe extent.  I am disappointed it has got to this and that the Minister signed the commencement order to give the trustees those powers.  We will keep pushing this issue prior to the passing of the Social Welfare Bill and hoping that people see sense.  Whatever about the Minister's party, I particularly do not understand how Labour Party members could possibly stand over cutting the pensions of workers who worked all their lives in tough jobs.  These are people who were bought out of the scheme, as previously stated, on early retirement.  How anybody in a party that calls itself the Labour Party could stand over doing that to people is beyond me and I hope they see sense before it is too late.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800038#OO00300","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1416336000,"counter":157,"content":"<p>I call Senator O'Keeffe.

I do not mean a long-winded investigation that goes on forever.

I was hugely impressed when I visited them with the Minister, following her recent visit to Muckross House for its 50th anniversary.  I think she was also very impressed by what we saw in Killarney House and the tremendous restoration work that has been undertaken there.<\/p><p>As we know, Killarney House is a stunning venue located in the town of Killarney and in the national park at the Golden Gates.  It has the potential to contain a most comprehensive introduction to Killarney national park.  The gardens are spread over 35 acres and will be a most attractive feature, being, if I may say so, Killarney's answer to St. Stephen's Green and a beautiful town park in our foremost national park.<\/p><p>The house has a rich, varied and interesting history, being as it was the home of the Earls of Kenmare and Lord Castlerosse.  Much of our history in that part of the world is bound up with that family.  It was also the home the John McShain, who was known as the man who built Washington, associated as he was with many of its outstanding buildings, including the White House and the Pentagon.  He was also the man who gifted Ross Castle and Inisfallen Island to the nation.  Inisfallen is where the annals were written and which are now located in the Bodleian Library in Oxford.  <\/p><p>For many years, I have campaigned to have this house restored to its former glory and I am, therefore, delighted, as is everybody in Killarney, Kerry and perhaps throughout the nation, that it is now on the verge of opening, following a huge &euro;7.1 million investment which was provided through F&aacute;ilte Ireland's tourism capital investment programme and the Minister's Department.  Our entire tourism industry is looking forward to the Minister opening the house and gardens for the 2015 tourism season.<\/p><p>Given the huge investment, adequate management and staffing will be necessary to complement both the house and gardens and to ensure they are displayed to their true potential.  The Minster might say a word as to what she has in mind in terms of how they will be managed and staffed.  Presumably, there will be a charge because maintenance, ongoing improvements and so on will be necessary from time to time, although given the huge initial investment, it will be a while before they arise.  I understand there will be an audiovisual or a multipurpose space at the back, which will need care and attention for exhibitions, talks, lectures and so on.  I look forward very much to the Minister's words of wisdom and her enlightening me further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800039#PP04100","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1416336600,"counter":207,"content":"<p>In 2011, my Department announced a major refurbishment programme for Killarney House and its ornamental grounds and gardens and it was a pleasure to visit Killarney House some weeks ago.  This is a major project for my Department and involves collaboration with the Office of Public Works as project managers and F&aacute;ilte Ireland which has committed funding of &euro;5.2 million under its tourism capital investment programme.<\/p><p>When I visited Killarney House on 29 September, following the Europark 2014 annual conference, which was held in Killarney and was a great success, I  saw for myself the work that is currently underway.  Work is underway on the final phase of restoration, refurbishment and new works for Killarney House.  The refurbished house, in its historic and very beautiful setting, will function as a national park visitor centre and will provide an added attraction for visitors to the town.<\/p> <p>The visitor centre project includes a newly built extension to house an interpretative centre for the national park, explaining its significance and importance to the town and region, including information on its major themes such as mountain, wood, water and the human impact on the environment.  Also, as part of the new build element, the provision of exhibition space will be included to cater for temporary exhibitions, displays and cultural events.  The original ornamental grounds and gardens immediately surrounding the house will also be restored, creating spectacular landscaped areas that will merge into the natural areas of the park and providing vistas linking the town to the scenery of mountain, wood and water.  <\/p><p>Having walked the grounds with Senator Coghlan, I must say the restoration of the garden is very impressive.  A phased approach to the restoration has been adopted and the first two phases were required to safeguard the structural integrity and to create the optimal layout of the house in preparation for the full restoration works.  Phase one was completed in February 2012 and consisted of essential repair works, mainly to the external fabric of the building, including repairs to the roof, chimney stacks, flues, gutters, down-pipes, windows and drains.  The external render was also removed to enable essential repairs to the stonework.  Phase two was completed in February 2013 and consisted of the further repair and stabilisation of the main building and repointing of internal courtyard walls.  The final phase of works to the house, which began in early January, is expected to be complete by early December 2014.  The new-build extension and hard landscaping works - paths, paving, stonework, etc. - are progressing apace, with the soft landscaping works due to commence shortly.  In addition, planning for the interpretation for both the house and its ornamental grounds and gardens is advancing with expressions of interest recently sought by way of competitive tender for the position of interpretative exhibition designer to the project.<\/p><p>As regards staffing arrangements for Killarney House, the Senator will be aware that my Department is currently subject to the moratorium on public service recruitment.  However, the staffing requirements for the house, as with all other areas of my Department, will remain the subject of ongoing consideration in light of the overall business needs and within the pay framework approved for 2015.  The restoration project will be substantially complete by end 2014 with a view to the site being fully operational and open to the public in 2015.  I look forward to attending the opening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800039#PP04200","speaker":"973","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416337200,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I look forward to the Minister opening the house and gardens as soon as possible.

Obviously, my preference would have been to have the Minister for Education and Skills respond to my query.  However, it is appropriate in one sense that the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, is here because issues such as good governance in terms of the spending of taxpayers money is at the core of this matter and, in particular, the regular flow of correspondence to the Department by a former member of County Cork VEC, on whose behalf I raise this issue.<br\/>I was a member of County Cork VEC for a brief time in 1990 and as such I am very much aware of the drive, commitment and enthusiasm of the staff there.  The former member of County Cork VEC on whose behalf I raise this issue, while as committed as any other member, past or current, of that VEC, has serious concerns about it.  By way of an aside, I was surprised to learn of the attempts of the management and membership of County Cork VEC to have this member struck off the committee.  I understand they even wrote to the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, requesting that he be dismissed from the board.  I found that quite disturbing, although that is not the subject of my query today.  Fortunately, the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, did not accede to the request.<br\/>The correspondence which issued to the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, and to the current Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, raises fundamental questions regarding the spending of taxpayers' money and the decision-making process.  We are all aware of the phrase &quot;the independent republic of Cork&quot;.  However, even within that independent republic of Cork normal rules and regulations, in terms of the management and governance of an entity such as the former VEC, must pertain.  Questions have been raised about leasing arrangements.  It is almost two decades since I was a member of the committee of that VEC and so I am not an expert on its internal structures.  However, I am advised that up to 20 unusual leases appear to have been entered into, which is the subject of some of the concerns raised by the gentleman who has been in contact with me.  He was so concerned that he brought this matter to the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am advised that a previous Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, Ms McManus, appeared before that committee and responded to some degree to the concerns raised.  The matter is now with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am advised that a report will be made available in the near future.  I understand the Department of Education and Skills has a certain timeframe to reflect on the matter.<br\/>It is not too often that a body such as the former VEC has its business examined in the first instance by the Committee of Public Accounts and second by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That this is happening shows the serious nature of the situation.  The <i>Irish Examine<\/i>r has been to the fore in highlighting many of the queries raised.  One of its reporters has carried out serious investigative work in this regard.  It is not in any of our interests to attack the officials, past or current, of the VEC.  However, we must ensure that governance is appropriate and that taxpayers' money is spent in a legal manner and that all is above board.  The evidence presented to me would seem to suggest that there are serious doubts about some of the decisions made by the former VEC, particularly in relation to the 20 plus leases mentioned.  <br\/>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, to ensure that the Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan, takes this matter seriously.  She is in the fortunate position of being Minister for Education and Skills for only a few months and cannot be held responsible for earlier decisions or omissions.<\/p> <p>Now that the file is on her desk she must take the matter very seriously and fully investigate the questions brought to her attention.<\/p><p>An interim reply and then a slightly more substantive reply issued from the Department in early November but it does not answer any of the questions raised by the complainant.  Reference is made to the vocational support services unit.  The Department advised that the terms of reference for sale have been agreed but I am advised that they have not been agreed.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.  There are significant issues which must be aired fully.  I look forward to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Our country has been littered with the politics of sweeping matters under the carpet, something we must bring to a conclusion.  It is in everybody's interest that this matter is fully examined under the full spotlight of all the appropriate State agencies to enable us to assure taxpayers that money is being spent in an appropriate fashion and that any inappropriate decisions are fully examined any a full response is given.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800040#QQ01100","speaker":"1189","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416337800,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to be in the Seanad this evening.

The correspondent referred to certain matters being investigated by the Comptroller and Auditor General, which will be the subject of a special report in due course.  The correspondent also asked the Minister for Education and Skills to initiate an investigation into the specific section of the Department which has been dealing with County Cork VEC and its management of those matters.<\/p><p>The Minister gave full and detailed consideration to the matters raised by this correspondent, including the request for an investigation into the specific section of the Department which has been dealing with County Cork VEC.

The Department of Education and Skills has co-operated fully with the Comptroller and Auditor General in regard to that investigation.  The Department was recently provided with a draft report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, on which Senator Bradford has sought an update, and the Department has provided its observations to this.  It is expected that the report will be finalised shortly by the Comptroller and Auditor General and published by that office at a time of its choosing.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Bradford for affording me the opportunity to respond to the House on this matter.

It is a town that is noted and renowned for its community spirit, for the manner in which it rallies around families and has great credentials in terms of volunteerism and being a community that puts it best foot forward at all times.  <\/p><p>A great reflection of that is that as far back as 1996 the Friends of the Elderly in the town pooled their resources in terms of materials, energy, efforts, skills and finances and established a day-care centre for the elderly in the town in the house of the former general practitioner on Drogheda Street.  It was an appropriate setting.  I knew the GP at that time, Dr. Kirby.  He was a well regarded and respected man.  As a young boy I had a newspaper round in the town and I delivered the newspaper to his house on Drogheda Street.  The House was put to very good use.  It was renovated, upgraded and has been used since 1996 as a very significant day-care centre for the elderly who go there on a daily basis to socialise, learn new skills and to congregate with people of their own age group.  <\/p><p>However, I am disappointed and dismayed about what has happened.  The HSE indicated some months ago that the property had fallen into some disrepair and that there were issues regarding the wiring and electrical works which had to be repaired.  That work was under way and being conducted by the local committee when the HSE intervened and said that it would take over the works and that the day care centre would have to be transferred temporarily.  Through the good co-operation of the local GAA club, Monasterevin GAA, they agreed to that and relocated the day-care centre activities to the GAA centre on a temporary basis.  However, to our horror and disappointment, in recent weeks the HSE put a stop to the works, turned a key in the door and last week it had the electricity disconnected to the original property.  I am alarmed by this.  What has happened is sharp practice.  It was an underhand way of doing business.  It certainly was not up-front.<\/p> <p>I am trying to be constructive, and I sincerely hope the Health Service Executive is not trying to balance its year-end books on the backs of the elderly people of this parish.<\/p><p>I am told it has informed the local committee that the cost of the works required now are of the magnitude of &euro;100,000.  If that is the case, that money must be found because the day care centre cannot operate on a long-term basis in the Monasterevin GAA club.  That would not be appropriate for anyone.  I implore the Minister of State to intervene, bring some clarity to the situation and help provide the necessary funding because it is unconscionable that the town that had a day care centre for this length of time would lose a service which is so important to the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800041#RR00600","speaker":"1143","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416338400,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Whelan for raising this very important matter.  It is clear from listening to his account the personal and deep feelings he has towards this day care centre and the important service it provides for the people of Monasterevin.  I know the Senator declared an interest but being able to bring personal experience to formulate policy is a strength in our political system and one I hope will continue.<\/p><p>The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and to support access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.  The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including home help, home care packages, meals on wheels, respite or day care and a range of other community-based supports.  The executive works continually to develop the services provided to ensure they match the needs of older people as much as possible.<\/p><p>New approaches to home support, increased use of technology and new residential models may all have a part to play.  Access to day centres can no doubt make an important contribution by providing invaluable support, advice and social interaction for older people who may, for any number of reasons, be experiencing isolation and loneliness.  One cannot underestimate the importance of being able to bring people together and the social importance of such a day care centre.<\/p><p>Since 1997, Monasterevin day care centre had been operating as a social outlet twice weekly from a large property owned by the HSE on Drogheda Street, Monasterevin.  I would emphasise, however, that the day centre has never provided medical or personal care, and Senator Whelan acknowledges that.  I understand that the building was also used by a number of groups locally for events and activities unrelated to the day care centre.  This included some events and activities of which the HSE was unaware.<\/p><p>In 2013, the executive became aware of safety issues relating to the electrical wiring on the premises. Following the completion of some remedial works the HSE employed a contractor to carry out a fire safety inspection of the building.  The building was assessed as being unsafe and, as the Senator rightly said, the estimated cost for the scope of the works required to bring the building to current health and safety standards is in excess of &euro;100,000.  The HSE made a decision that the investment required cannot be justified given the level of services provided by the HSE there, and a representative of the Monasterevin group was advised last October of this decision.<\/p><p>I do not need to tell the Senator about the current economic and budgetary pressures, and notwithstanding the better economic news recently, resources remain tight across a number of areas.  Many areas continue to face real challenges in meeting demands on their services.  I understand that Monasterevin day care currently operates its service from a local GAA centre two days per week.  The HSE provides the group with a grant aid of &euro;3,700 per year in support of those activities, and we will continue to support this service.<\/p><p>I am pleased to advise the Senator that the HSE has informed the Department of Health that it is willing to meet the group to ensure the continuation of the service and explore the use of any other facility that could accommodate it.  I hope through Senator Whelan's good offices that that meeting can take place and that the HSE will, with the group, explore the possibilities and discuss the provision of services and how best to go forward from here.  I thank the Senator for bringing the matter to my attention and I will convey his sentiments to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800042#SS00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416338400,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the reply.  It provides clarity but I am dismayed and disappointed.  I will not leave it at that.  The grant of &euro;3,700 per annum is paltry considering the scale and extent of services.  The HSE is downplaying the significance of the role of this day care centre because it goes well beyond the remit.  In terms of the well-being of the senior citizens who enjoy these facilities, it plays a central role in keeping them hale, hearty and out of hospital and other institutions that would cost considerably more.<\/p><p>If the HSE cannot come up with the &euro;100,000, it is incumbent upon it to upgrade the existing building, which is important and very accessible to all the people in the heart of the town, or assist in sourcing an alternative building as suitable premises.  It should have done that in advance of essentially hoodwinking the local community, getting the elderly citizens into a new premises and then closing the door behind their backs.  I am not happy with the way the HSE went about its business in this case, and I will not be leaving it so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800042#SS00300","speaker":"1143"},{"type":"speech","time":1416338400,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I have no doubt the Senator will continue to pursue this matter and fight for the people in that community, but let us try to look at the common ground here and find a way forward.

There is also a reality that the building is deemed unsafe and the HSE says it cannot foot the bill to make it safe.

He threatened at that stage that he would abolish Sligo County Council if within a two-week period it did not get on top of its own finances.  To do that at this stage would be like Jean-Claude Trichet and the people in the European Central Bank telling the people of Ireland that they will take the entire hit, and all of the pain, on behalf of the European bondholders.<\/p><p>It is wrong to treat Sligo County Council and other small local authorities in isolation because in effect they have performed in line with the directions of the Minister's Department in the context of targets set by it on performance with water services, the upgrading of wastewater treatment facilities and the targets laid down by the national spatial strategy, which was driven and supported by members of the Minister of State's party, members of the Labour Party, Independents, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and many vocational, civic and commercial groups.  That policy was being driven by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and towns like Sligo were told to prepare for an infrastructure to facilitate a population of 100,000 people.<\/p><p>Against that backdrop, local authorities, especially those selected as gateway centres, were told to be more ambitious and seek to engage in public private partnerships to ensure enough land was bought in order that local authorities would not be subservient to the developers of the future in the context of having enough land for the people for social housing, leisure space, industry and so on.<\/p><p>Sligo County Council did that in the context of water, an issue much to the fore in recent days.  The costs between 2008 and 2012 for wastewater treatment and water services in Sligo increased from &euro;5 million to &euro;10 million per annum.  In the same period, central Government subvention to that local authority decreased from &euro;18 million to &euro;9 million.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State can see, therefore, where the problem lies.  When that infrastructure is handed over to the super-quango that is Irish Water, there will be no recompense for the people of Sligo.  No funding has been made available to them to cover that outlay in which they engaged over that time.  Much of the debt in question has come along from the acquisition of land and the investment in wastewater treatment and water services.<\/p><p>For the Minister to finger Sligo local authority, telling it to get its act together, with no help from the Department, or it will be abolished, is ridiculous in the extreme.  The Minister&rsquo;s own county council has issues.  Donegal and many other local authorities have debt issues.  To treat them as independent republics, telling them to sort out their problems without any centralised subvention is ridiculous in the extreme, particularly when the Minister knows there are local authorities in Dublin city, as well as other wealthy ones, which have tens of millions of euro on deposit.  Fingal County Council, for example, which has Dublin Airport in one corner, has a rate base higher than Sligo and Leitrim county councils together.  Fingal County Council has &euro;100 million on deposit alone.  This is fundamentally wrong.<\/p><p>Last week, the Minister travelled to meet officials in Sligo County Council in secret, without consulting any councillors or the cathaoirleach, to deliver the ultimatum to close its second tax office in Teach Laighne in Tubbercurry and lay off another 50 staff, even though 188 staff have been laid off over the past three years.  It is a wonder the Government was not trumpeting the setting up of a task force on employment because so many staff have been let go by the local authority.  He also told council officials that more commercial rates needed to be collected.  The Government wants to shove it all onto struggling small businesses to pay this bill.  This is ridiculous in the extreme.<\/p><p>Donegal County Council has five tax offices.  Tipperary - the Minister&rsquo;s county- has five municipal offices.  To treat Sligo in this way is disgraceful.  Smaller local authorities are providing services for citizens.  Just because they are not in Fingal County Council, which is cash rich, does not mean they are not entitled to those services.  Picking Sligo as a bad example is the same as Jean-Claude Trichet, the Merkels and our European masters telling Ireland to take the pain of austerity.  The people of Sligo should not have to do the same.  Will the Minister make the funds available to assist the citizens of Sligo, assistance to which they are as entitled as every other citizen?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800042#SS00600","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416339000,"counter":232,"content":"<p>I thank Senator MacSharry for raising this matter.  I am responding on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government who thanks the Senator for providing the opportunity to outline the situation regarding the financial difficulties of Sligo County Council.<\/p><p>The continued deterioration of Sligo County Council's financial position is of serious concern to him, despite the achievement of savings in recent years.  On Thursday last, 13 November, the Minister met the chief executive of Sligo County Council and his senior management team to discuss these very issues and had a constructive and useful engagement with them.<\/p><p>The council has been incurring revenue deficits over recent years to the effect that the cumulative deficit now stands at &euro;19.67 million with long-term debt in excess of &euro;120 million.  It is a matter for each local authority, including Sligo County Council, to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to Government policy, locally identified needs and available resources.<\/p><p>The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which include adopting the annual budget and authorising borrowing.  Elected local authority members are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.<\/p><p>The financial difficulties of Sligo County Council have not been caused by the financial model used to fund local authorities.  While it is true that general purpose grant funding to Sligo County Council has reduced from a high of &euro;22.22 million in 2008 to &euro;15.58 million in 2013, the reduction, at 29%, has been less than the national average of 35%.  Local authorities are independent bodies with their members responsible for budgetary and borrowing policies.  Sligo County Council has the same requirements placed on it as all other local authorities in terms of implementing Government policy.<\/p><p>Other factors such as poor income collection have significantly contributed to Sligo's financial difficulties.  Commercial rates collection levels for the county and borough in 2012 were at 62%, compared with a national average of 75%.  Sligo's collection levels declined even further to 59% in 2013.  Sligo County Council has uncollected rates debt of &euro;6.8 million.  Its water collection levels have averaged 48% between 2008 and 2012, resulting in an estimated loss of income of in excess of &euro;1 million per year.  Collection levels for housing loans are also poor at 47%, showing arrears of &euro;1 million.  Housing rent income collection is 80%, which is below the level achieved by comparator local authorities.<\/p><p>While it is a matter for individual local authorities, including Sligo County Council, to manage their day-to\u00adday finances in a prudent and sustainable manner, the Department is in regular consultation with the council on its financial position.  The Minister has set aside an allocation of &euro;1 million in additional funding for 2014 for the council to assist it to take the steps necessary to move to a more sustainable financial position.  The payment of this is fully conditional on a realistic and achievable financial plan which charts a path to long-term financial sustainability being agreed between his Department and the council.<\/p><p>Financial stability must take precedence in all of Sligo County Council's planning in the coming years.  It is essential the 2015 budget addresses the gravity of the financial situation in the council, building on the savings achieved to date.  The Minister and his Department are committed to continuing to support the council in its efforts to restore financial stability.  As the Minister pointed out at his meeting with Sligo County Council, the next steps need to be taken by the council through a firm commitment reflected both in its budget for 2015 and through the agreement of a long-term financial plan with the Department.  By ensuring Sligo County Council is supported in making these difficult decisions that will, in the longer term, place it on a more realistic and sustainable path to growth and renewal, the Minister is certain Sligo can put its current difficulties behind it and focus on consolidating its position as a leading economic centre for the north west in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014111800043#TT00200","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416339000,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I appreciate the Minister of State was only reading out a reply provided to him.  It claims the debts have not been caused by the financial model used to fund local authorities.  Who wrote this ridiculous statement?  It takes no cognisance at all of the points I made regarding the legacy position which has caused much of the local authority's debt.  In some way, this reply treats Sligo County Council like some remote charity 40 million miles away for which the Government has no responsibility.  What do Senators Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe, Michael Comiskey and Imelda Henry, as well as Deputies John Perry and Tony McLoughlin, think of this?  Do they realise the Department told an entire section of the community to achieve set targets in providing a wastewater treatment infrastructure and acquiring land for the purpose, which Sligo did, outperforming other local authorities in the process, but now tells the council to sing for its support?  Is it some remote organisation on the other side of the world for which it has no responsibility?  This Government was elected by the people in Sligo and the north west.  It is their tax euro paying the Government&rsquo;s salaries.  Accordingly, the Minister has responsibilities and obligations to the people of Sligo to provide for them.<\/p><p>Last night in Sligo, the Taoiseach echoed the call to close a tax office in Tubbercurry and cut library services, as well as lay off a further 50 staff on top of 188 already laid off.
