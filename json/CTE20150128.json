We commence this morning with public hearings with Professor Edward Kane of Boston College on banking and banking regulation.  I welcome everyone to the sixth public hearing of the joint committee.  We will hear from Professor Kane on banking and bank regulation.  Professor Kane is very welcome before the committee this morning.<\/p><p>Professor Edward J. Kane is a professor of finance at Boston College and holds a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Professor Kane's specific research areas include financial crisis management, deposit insurance, causes and implications of financial change and the changing structure of financial services competition and regulation.  Currently, he consults with the World Bank and is a senior fellow in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Centre for Financial Research.  Previously, Professor Kane has consulted for the IMF, components of the Federal Reserve system and three foreign central banks.  As well as authoring three books, he has published widely in professional journals and currently serves on six editorial boards.  The expression &quot;zombie bank&quot; to describe a bank which is insolvent but is kept alive through government assistance, was first used by Professor Kane in an academic paper published in 1987.<\/p><p>Before we begin, I advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, he is protected by absolute privilege in respect of his evidence to this committee.  However, if he is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continues to so do, he will be entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and - as he has been informed previously - witnesses are asked to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>I again welcome Professor Kane and invite him to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015012800002#A00800","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422403200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman.  I appreciate being invited here today and I congratulate the committee for trying to get to the bottom of what made this financial crisis so severe, in Ireland in particular, but also in other countries.  It is an honour to have a chance to help the committee in this work.<\/p>  <p>  My testimony is built around the idea that financial markets resemble roads.  These roads are used simultaneously by individuals and businesses and their purpose is to allow ordinary citizens and corporations to create wealth and divide it up.  Banking is regulated for the same reason as road traffic, which is where the power of this metaphor comes from.  One issue is to co-ordinate potentially chaotic activity.  Members can imagine how hard it would be to cross a city like Dublin if we did not have street lights and stop signs.  There is also the need to make all drivers behave more safely.<\/p>  <p>  In banking supervision, norms that foster deception and abuse of the public trust have become embedded in banks' and regulators' organisational structures.  It might help if I take a minute to explain how people think about organisational culture in sociology.  The most widely cited model suggests that every organisation has a mission and set of goals and then has a set of visible procedures, buildings, staff and equipment that are presumably devoted to those goals.  However, the third thing an organisation has is a bunch of unobserved norms of behaviour regarding what one has to do to get ahead in the organisation and what is expected of those within it.  These norms often conflict seriously with the goals and mission.  I will try to develop that idea as I go along.<\/p>  <p>  The banking crisis occurred because bankers routinely abused the financial rules of the road without suffering meaningful personal penalties.  Why is that?  It is because of these norms.  The heart of the problem is professional ethics in banking and in regulatory agencies.  <\/p>  <p>         If systems for supervising traffic flows were as distorted and as elitist and slow to respond as those for supervising banks in Europe and the US, ordinary citizens would be afraid to venture out of their homes.<br\/><br\/>The central problem is straightforward.  Safety nets encourage unhealthy relationships between banks and their regulators and distort the incentives of both groups.  In good times and in bad, regulatory and banking cultures encourage their countries' largest banks to take on too high a risk of ruin.  We call this &quot;tail risk&quot;, thinking of the probability of the distribution of outcomes.  People take risks in banking all the time, but to risk the ruin of their firm is something one would think they would not ordinarily be eager to do.  The way the safety net subsidises risk-taking, it only pays off if we are taking tail risks.<br\/><br\/>Financial accounting systems fail to identify and record the economic value these incentives transfer from taxpayers to stockholders and banks.  I propose two straightforward solutions.  First, regulators must explicitly measure and manage the cost of safety net guarantees.  Currently, they do not calculate it and certainly do not manage it.  Second, regulators should impose a series of graduated penalties on individuals who violate important rules of the road.  In the United States and in Europe, most of the penalties have been focused on the corporations.  Fines have been charged, which penalise shareholders, but not much has been done about the individuals who put the bank at risk.  These two steps would help force too big to fail, TBTF, banks to internalise the costs of safety net guarantees and would negate the elitist norms that continue to corrupt the culture of regulation in the US and Europe.  These solutions come from a handful of propositions from lessons we have learned from the most recent crises around the world. <br\/><br\/>The first point is that safety nets can and often do cause financial instability.  To stop this, society needs to make the extraction of these subsidies to risk taking a source of disdain rather than pride. Currently, bankers pride themselves on this kind of abuse of the safety net.  However, this will not happen until regulators and supervisors strip out from reported profit flows the embedded value of the taxpayer credit support a too big to fail bank receives.  So, if one is a manager of a too big to fail bank and one increases the tail risk, when one takes that risk, the increasing value of the stock price will increase one's compensation and make one appear a wonderful manager.  However, when one takes long shot risks, the odds are that some of them will turn sour.<br\/><br\/>Although analysts agree that regulators should control systemic risk, most definitions of systemic risk leave out the role that regulators' propensity to assist troubled and insolvent firms rather than to resolve their insolvency plays in generating it.  One of the norms that conflict with the goal of financial stability is the norm of helpfulness.  It leads policy makers to act as cheerleaders for innovative forms of contracting.  There is also a norm of mercy, where if an institution gets in trouble, there is a presumption that it happened through bad luck, rather than through deliberate and aggressive risk taking.  Banks are given the benefit of the doubt about their solvency, until it is too amply demonstrated.  The deference these norms create encourages incentive conflict within the supervisory culture.That is to say, an examiner may find a lot of problems with a bank, but as this is reported up the line, the regulatory officials will often ask the examiners to use softer words and to find ways of painting the thing.  This ties to the norm of &quot;non-escalation&quot;.  Regulators are very afraid they will be accused of escalating a bad situation and instead try to cover it up.  This essentially leads to the idea that it is alright to deceive, as long as one's heart is in the right place.  This kind of deception allows more of this tail risk to be taken and increases the bill that ultimately must be paid. <br\/><br\/>Fragility is rooted in conflicted incentives.  Dangerous incentives could be reduced if safety net subsidies were measured conscientiously and compensation schemes paid managers and taxpayers in better ways.  Although officials claim otherwise, it is no accident that they repeatedly fail to foresee the emergence of crisis pressures and that they respond to them in elitist fashion, helping the banks at the expense of taxpayers.  These conflicts lead to regulatory capture and that expands implicit and explicit government guarantees that become part of the equity funding structure of any bank that is too big to fail.<br\/><br\/>It is important to rethink this point, and I will mention this again and again in my testimony.  It is wrong to think of bailout funds as loans or insurance payments.  I will say this again and again.  They are loss absorbing equity, but they are very badly structured.  The taxpayer cannot sell his position.  He cannot hedge it.  The taxpayer is coerced into this position.  It is not a voluntary action and his position has unlimited losses.  If the regulators never close these firms, there are unlimited losses, whereas ordinary stockholders have limited liability.  There are several other issues, but we do not need to go into them as the committee can already see how bad it is the way we have structured the incentives for government to protect.  What I think is that we should think of it as a trust fund for taxpayers that is invested in this barely structured equity contracts in banking organisations.  Contingent taxpayer support deserves to be recognised as an equity claim.  I am not saying it is recognised as an equity claim, but it deserves to be recognised as such.  Parliaments around Europe and Congress of the United States ought to address this so that in company law and in financial accounting, we recognise taxpayers as having an ongoing position in any firm that is <i>de facto<\/i>too big to fail.<br\/><br\/>The rest of my statement develops this point.  Financial safety nets coerce taxpayers into these positions and taxpayers should receive legal protections parallel to those that explicit shareholders enjoy, particularly minority shareholders.  Essentially, we as taxpayers are minority shareholders in too big to fail banking organisations in our country and we are being abused.  The formal establishment of this position, of owners' equity, leads to thinking of the too big to fail institutions as creating a portfolio of trust funds in which taxpayers are forced to invest.  This casts regulators as trustees and creates, automatically, a different view of what their goals should be.  The formal establishment of such trusteeships would lead officials to judge regulatory performance in terms of effects on the value of taxpayers' equity position.  These positions can be valued using what we call &quot;contingent claim analysis&quot;.  This would also require regulators in protected institutions to rework their norms, information systems and incentive frameworks to support this effort.  This is a big change in the duties of regulators and of top managers and officials of too big to fail firms.<br\/><br\/>The lesson is clear on these conflicts of interest.  Governments need to do two things.  They need to rethink the informational obligations that insured financial institutions and their regulators owe to taxpayers as <i>de facto<\/i>equity investors and change the way that information and industry balance sheets and risk exposures are reported, verified and used by supervisors.  Lots of information is collected on industry balance sheets, but not enough on risk exposures.  It is not reported publicly or verified, or it is only verified by periodic examination, and is not used by supervisors in the most effective way for taxpayers.  Without these reforms of the practical duties imposed on industry and government officials and the way these duties are enforced, financial safety nets will continue to expand and their expansion will undermine financial stability.  <\/p>  <p>         The last lesson I want to get across concerns the nature of guarantees.  Guarantees are misunderstood, even by some of the top economists in the world.  They have a two-part structure.  The main idea of a guarantee is to allow the guaranteed party to put responsibility for covering losses that exceed the value of the assets the bank owns to the government that guarantees it.  However, the put is not the whole contract.  No guarantor wants to voluntarily expose itself to unlimited losses, which happens if one writes only the put.  For this reason, all guaranteed contracts incorporate a stop loss provision that gives the guarantor a call on the assets of the firm.  When we talk about closing an insolvent bank, it is a call on the assets of the firm.  Ordinarily, the stop loss kicks in just as insolvency is approached or breached.  However in the US, efforts to exercise the Government's call are termed &quot;prompt corrective action&quot;.  In the US and Europe, we did not see much timely corrective action for &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo;, TBTF, institutions during the great financial crisis.  The policy actions we did see have helped the world's TBTF banks to become bigger and more politically powerful than before.  It is a perverse result.<br\/><br\/>With the helpfulness and mercy norms, the Government's call on the assets could not be exercised.  Guarantees then shift risk losses away from creditors and stockholders.  It is as if these TBTF banks have a flow of profits that goes through a pipeline with a Y junction in it.  Insolvency exists when the institution is unable to cover its debts from its own resources, but when a TBTF firm such as AIB becomes insolvent, a political switch is thrown that channels further losses to the taxpayers until and unless the firm manages to recover solvency.  Deeply insolvent institutions are zombie institutions.  They can operate only because they are backed by the black magic of implicit government guarantees.  A government does not need to come forward and announce that it guarantees the bank.  The fact that it leaves the bank open, that the bank has a safety net and political power, leads creditors in this and other countries to lend to the bank.  This passive policy of forbearance allows the institutions to roll over and even expand their debts, which the private markets without the guarantees would never allow.<br\/><br\/>In the US, the American Insurance Group, AIG, case closely parallels what has happened with AIB here, except that it was never nationalised.  In the lead up to the crisis moments, the company underwent a long-term decline on the stock market but bounced around depending on whether or not there was serious consideration being given to nationalising the institution.  A graph included in my presentation shows that the stock price never got to zero.  Much of the value of the firm during the crisis months of 2008 and 2009 came from the Government guarantee.  The equity claim from the taxpayers had very little upside but continued to have a great deal of downside.<br\/><br\/>Another figure from some work I have done with Armen Hovakimian and Luc Laeven shows the value of the quarterly dividend the US taxpayer ought to have been paid by large banking firms between 1974 and 2010.  While the value of this dividend shows a cyclical pattern, it is most instructive to look across cycles.  With each cycle from 1974 onwards the value of this unpaid dividend to taxpayers increased.  My fear is that this is still going on, that people are still figuring out how better to fleece taxpayers, unless we do something to reverse it.  I have already sketched my solutions and will sketch them further.  We should be able to see the same patterns in the Irish scene and I fear that greater and more dangerous subsidy flows will reveal themselves in the next crisis.  We will have crises, and while I hope we will have a few years of respite, a lot of clouds are gathering in Europe today.<br\/><br\/>It is important to understand the difference between guarantees, insurance and loan contracts because each of them imposes different ethical duties.  Insurance around the world does not protect so much the insurance company but the insured.  It allows the insured to take additional risks because they have insurance.  This is called moral hazard.  In a loan contract, one expects to be repaid and this is the difference between insurance and the bailout.  An insurance company does not redouble the coverage of drivers who have revealed themselves to act as recklessly as the TBTF firms did during the last economic boom, especially after they have had the losses.  Similarly, lifelines provided to an underwater firm cannot be thought of as low-interest loans because nobody will lend even a nickel to firms that are in zombie condition.<br\/><br\/>To solve this problem, something must be done to sanction the reckless pursuit of subsidies by TBTF firms.  Exhortations and promises are not enough.  The type of sanctions I would propose are outlined in the last part of my statement.  The key point is to recognise the deliberate exploitation of TBTF guarantees as a form of criminal theft and develop ways to punish individuals who engage in it directly and higher officials who encourage it without pulling the trigger.<br\/><br\/>The way we frame problems is critically important in policy making.  Although it is not true today, in the future legal systems must make it crystal clear that recklessly increasing a guaranteed firm's risk of ruin is a form of theft.  I am not saying it is a form of theft <i>de jure<\/i>but <i>de facto<\/i>.  Whether it is <i>de jure <\/i>theft depends on the laws of a country.  The theft is from what I call the taxpayer trust fund.  The taxpayer has stocks that should be managed by government officials as trustees.  Rules of the financial game must acknowledge that it is wrong for individual managers to adopt these ruinous risks and wilfully conceal and abuse taxpayers' equity stake.  Such behaviour deserves to be sanctioned explicitly by corporate and criminal law and not excused by insurance law as if it were inevitable moral hazard.<br\/><br\/>Banking supervisors have let society down in two ways.  First, they did not set up the equivalent of the most modern radar systems and helicopter surveillance to track excessive speed and aggressive driving.  Second, they did not develop a penalty structure to punish unruly behaviour in a meaningful and timely fashion.  Effective regulation and supervision must establish disincentives that can dissuade bankers who are tempted to drive at perilous speeds and undertake dangerous manoeuvres.  While we have incentives, we also need disincentives so they know they will be punished.  Today, they are very confident they will not be punished.  The analogy between regulating banks and regulating vehicular traffic suggests that, country by country, the penalty structure and burdens of proof in cases of safety net theft could be designed to parallel those used in traffic courts.  Here and in the US, we already have administrative procedures for enforcing regulatory findings whose jurisdictions resemble those of traffic courts.  <\/p>  <p>         Most of these schemes combine fines for minor violations, a points system which hikes the penalty for repeated and more serious violations and procedures for transferring particularly consequential cases such as vehicular homicide or extreme drunken driving to ordinary criminal and civil courts.  No matter what regulators finally do with their traditional tools, such as capital and liquidity requirements, if they do not set up sanctions which punish individuals for acts of wilful or complicit safety net theft, we are bound to get more wrongdoing in the future.  There is great value in prosecuting violators in open court.  The public needs to understand how much managers benefit when the burdens of the corporate fines and admissions they negotiate serve principally to punish shareholders instead of naming and sanctioning individual managers.<\/p> <p> I thank those present for listening and look forward to any questions.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015012800002#A00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Edward Kane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422403200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Kane for his opening comments.

Without raising additional money, it is there.  It is the owner stake.  The taxpayers have been made owners by the norms of the financial safety net management.<br\/><br\/>The Chairman's other question was about capital requirements.  Equity capital is <i>de facto<\/i>the amount of resources that owners have supplied, including or not including taxpayers, depending on how one wants to break it down.  Capital requirements are looking to stockholder capital.  This is capital that has been put up by stockholders.  These are measured by accounting principles and rules.  There are three sets of accounting rules that allow troubled banks to hide the losses that should go through to their capital.  One has to do with itemisation rules.  They might not itemise, for instance, loans that are going sour and that everyone in the bank knows are worth, say, 50 cent, 25 cent or 10 cent in the dollar.  They keep them at par by accounting manipulation.  As far as capital requirements are concerned, it looks fine, even though, from an economic point of view, it is a lot of losses.  Another has to do with when one realises losses - which is very closely related to this - or realises gains.  A troubled bank tends to bring its gains - its good results - forward and to push the recognition of the losses into the future.  Finally, the values they assign will also be biased, if they are troubled banks, to try to overstate the values of things, that is to use touchstones that overstate it.  The problem is that by the time the violation in what you want capital requirements to capture is identified and a firm is recognised by accountants as insolvent, it has been deeply insolvent for a long time.  The incentives to take these end-game gambles, to go for broke, just loads more losses, on average, on the taxpayer, even though some of these firms win their bets.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015012800002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Professor Edward Kane"},{"type":"speech","time":1422403200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>In his research paper, Professor Kane stressed how the amount of equity capital recorded on a bank's balance sheet is not necessarily a good indicator of its health.

One may know that the firm is in grave trouble but the auditors may not have sufficient information to allow them to determine that.  The basic problem pertains to the regulatory culture.  Banks that have trouble turning over their debt or raising new stock are always going to claim it is due to a problem of liquidity.  Somehow the markets are drying up and people are not ready to invest.  However, this is also a good indication of insolvency.  The culture has the attitude of giving the banks the benefit of the doubt.  If they say it is just a liquidity problem, supervisors will let them ride with that for a while even though the bankers know it is an insolvency problem.

I am accompanied by Mr. John Fitzsimons, CEO of Camara, and Ms Maureen O'Donnell, who is the Europe and Caribbean service manager.  I look after Camara's Irish programmes.  Camara is an international charity and social enterprise which uses technology to improve education and deliver 21st-century learning skills to disadvantaged communities around the world.  We work in Africa, the Caribbean and, obviously, Ireland.  Those who engage with Camara subscribe to three core beliefs, namely, that poverty in the 21st century is wrong, that education is a key tool for breaking down cycles of poverty and that technology has the power to transform the way education is delivered.<\/p> <p>  Our vision is for a technology-enabled world-class education system that is accessible to all.  In trying to deliver on that vision, we bring a package of information and communications technology, ICT, and education programmes to schools and youth centres around the world.  We deliver packages comprising educator training, hardware, support and software to schools, community centres and youth centres in the countries in which we work.  As we cannot deliver those packages on our own, we have been lucky over the last ten years to be partnered by a number of brilliant organisations, including Google, Facebook, PwC, ESB and Electric Ireland, to name but a few.  Over those ten years we have managed to make a significant global impact.  We have reached approximately 900,000 young people, trained more than 16,000 educators and supplied more than 62,000 computers.  We have also been delivering a programme in Ireland since 2010.  In the five years we have worked in Ireland, we have collaborated with more than 250 organisations, most of which are schools and youth centres, delivered more than 3,500 computers and trained more than 1,100 educators, including both teachers and youth workers.<\/p> <p>  Through our work on ICT education in Ireland, we have identified huge gaps in the integration of computers and technology into the education system.  These gaps are indicated most clearly in statistics that emerged from the 2012 European Schoolnet survey on the state of ICT in education in Ireland.  On average, 40% of students in Irish schools use computers less often than once per week, 45% of students attend schools in which support for ICT is classified as weak and 40% of students are taught by teachers with low confidence levels in using ICT.  Despite the negative nature of these statistics, it is important to point out they are not due to the lack of a plan.  In 2008, the Department of Education and Science released a fantastic five-year plan entitled Investing Effectively in ICT in Schools 2008-2013.  The plan identified seven key areas of investment which chime closely with Camara's experience.  Over the last ten years we have made many of the mistakes that can be made in integrating ICT into teaching and learning environments.  The seven areas identified are key to addressing many of these mistakes.  It is clear, therefore, that the issue pertains to implementation rather than planning or analysis.  Where we are failing is in the execution of our plans.<\/p><p>It is clear that the top-down approach is not working particularly well.  The reasons are myriad, from the country's financial position in recent years to difficulties in managing industrial relations.  During that period, it is interesting that there was a significant groundswell in demand from the bottom up of the education system, with education leaders, teachers and principals wanting to integrate ICT effectively into their schools.  This has been indicated by the success of the social enterprise model that Camara has been using in Ireland, a success that is mainly due to the fact that it is demand-driven.  Rather than being a top-down approach, it is a participatory one in which stakeholders from across the system demand products and services from us.  That we are a social enterprise means that we are not looking for a commercial market segment from which we can make money.  Instead, we are driven to design a solution or a set of products and services that address an entire aspect of a particular social problem.  In addition, the not-for-profit constitution of an organisation such as Camara Education means that the value for money and return on investment that we can offer to schools and youth centres are exponentially higher than those offered by the commercial sector, sometimes as much as ten times so.<\/p><p> I will conclude with a short example of how organisations in the third sector such as Camara Ireland can work with the Government to address the 40% of the system that is lagging behind.  If the Department of Education and Skills were to co-fund a third-sector organisation to the tune of approximately &euro;5 million, State IT assets were re-used in education and there were co-operation and joined-up thinking by a number of Departments, the third sector and organisations such as Camara could quickly put in place initiatives under which up to 1,600 of the schools most in need would be dealt with, up to 64,000 computers would be delivered into the education system, 20,000 teachers would be trained and, most importantly, up to 340,000 young people would receive an improved education.<\/p><p> My request is for the committee to work with the Departments of Education and Skills, Social Protection and Children and Youth Affairs and to push them to look towards the third sector and work with organisations such as Camara to address the issue of the final 40% of the system that is lagging behind.  Without the committee's support and drive, there is the potential for the seven areas to remain just as plans instead of being executed.  We have a duty to the young people in our education system to execute those plans and bring them to fruition.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for listening and we will be delighted to take members' questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Steven Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422450000,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Daly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#J00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1422450000,"counter":298,"content":"<p>That was a good, explanatory and readable presentation.

Going by my experience, while I am not opposed to ICT, as it has a role to play in education, it has provided the most benefit in the field of special needs education, particularly for children who suffer from dyslexia and dyscalculia.  Students are using many apps and programmes such as Reading Eggs at home.  These are being joined up with what is being done in class.  Reading Eggs is an online database.  One logs in and does the work at home, with the teacher monitoring it from the classroom.  <i>Vice versa<\/i>, what is being done in the classroom can be monitored by parents at home through an online platform.

I am delighted to say that a number of my former students have passed through their organisation on work experience.  I commend Camara on its work.  As the head of a large computer department, one of my problems every year was how to dispose of machines that were beyond their sell-by dates, so to speak, but still perfectly serviceable.  Many times, I tried to pass them on to national and secondary schools.<\/p><p>Until Camara Ireland came along there was nowhere to get rid of them.  We ended up dumping perfectly serviceable machines purely because they could not run the software we wished to run, particularly in the multimedia area.<\/p><p> What the organisation is doing is great.  I would support greater roll-out in Ireland and more of the assets used in Ireland.  The State has already paid for those assets.  While it is commendable to send them to Africa and various other parts of the world, there should be greater take-up in this country.  For that reason and considering the job Camara Ireland does, I would support some funding going to it.  However, it should be a double edged sword whereby we fund the organisation's capacity to recycle machines but the organisation should in turn take on students who are undertaking ICT maintenance programmes and, perhaps, programmers and people working in the area of operating systems and networking, to develop a service to schools which otherwise could not afford it.  I realise the competition people will jump in straight away and ask about the private sector, but it is more important that we have computers in classrooms available to students for the schools that cannot afford them.  Would the witness be interested in some type of partnership whereby the organisation would get some funding but, in return, it would train people?<\/p><p> With regard to literacy and numeracy, there are many applications to assist students with literacy and numeracy and many online free e-learning platforms that can be used.

When it comes to having enough computers to cater for all of the students and to have time to go on the computers, in practical terms the room, space and time are not available.<\/p> <p>  With regard to literacy, since the introduction of smart phones and other devices I have noticed that young people's spelling has become atrocious.  It is lazy.  There is also predictive text.  One sees \"4\" instead of \"for\" and \"u\" instead of \"you\".  That impacts on them with regard to the written word because with computers one can do a spell check and so forth.  Will that aspect make a person lazy in their written English?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#K00400","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422450000,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I thank the members for their questions.

I agree that ICT is not a silver bullet.  It never will be.  The delivery of a nice shiny set of laptops or desktops to a classroom will never solve any problems.  We have learned that and we are strong advocates of that opinion.  It is important to acknowledge that from the start.  However, ICT is a very effective tool that facilitates many extra programmes and more innovative and different methods of learning that otherwise would not be possible or as easily possible without that tool.  Again, it is a useless tool unless it is in the right hands, just as a blackboard is a useless tool if it is not in the right or correctly trained hands.  That is the reason the software, content, training, support and infrastructure around it are even more important than the tools themselves.  We have learned that lesson over the last ten years and that is the reason the Camara Ireland programme has developed the way it has, to include the supports, training, software and content to address those issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Steven Daly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422450000,"counter":315,"content":"<p>On literacy and numeracy, I have global responsibility for Camara.  Yesterday, I was in London to meet with three other commercial partners and together we are delivering a &pound;25 million project to 200 schools in Kenya.  One of the partners is a dedicated literacy and numeracy software provider.  They did a demonstration yesterday which was very enlightening for me.  It really highlighted the point that the traditional educational system is a one-size-fits-all system.  Typically, there is a teacher who delivers to 30 children.  There is no adaptiveness to that, so they can probably go at the speed of the slowest cohort of students in the classroom.  The children at the front or top cannot progress any faster, so it is one-size-fits-all.<\/p> <p>  However, with this software, and the software is just an example of the software that is available, it was one-to-one personalised tuition.  The technology would understand the areas of numeracy in which the child was slow, where the child was fast and it would adapt the content to that child to address the weak areas.  Not only that, it could track the progress of the child.  We were shown the dashboard.  There was a list of students and at the start they were at various levels of competence.  With this adaptive technology one could see the progression over a period of months and years.

One of the seven recommendations mentioned earlier was to ensure that teachers have the capabilities to make meaningful use of information and communications technology, ICT, in a classroom.  That recommendation was expanded upon to build a learning framework - essentially a training framework - for teachers to be able to do a certain amount of pretesting to figure out where they were on the framework and then to figure out what kind of training courses they needed to gain the confidence to be able to use the tools about which Mr. John Fitzsimons was talking.  While this has not really happened yet in Ireland, Camara Ireland is in the process of trying actively to develop a teacher training framework whereby we do not have a set course one does, but we have a number of courses and partnerships with a number of organisations such as CoderDojo, which Deputy Cannon knows so well or Bridge21, of which some members might have heard, and a myriad of other third sector organisations that we can bring together to collaborate on delivering a selection of training courses to teachers, as they identify the need to have that level of confidence and skills to be able to use the tools about which Mr. John Fitzsimons was talking.<\/p> <p>  The key point to realise is it is not a matter of training someone as to how to use a particular tool.  There is no particular piece of software in which one can train an educator, a youth worker or a teacher that is the piece of software.  What that teacher or educator needs are the skills to be able to find one of the hundreds of pieces of available software that are free or paid for, to figure out whether they are any good and if they suit the needs of their students - be they special-needs students or in mainstream education - and to figure out whether that piece of software is applicable, then to figure out how to use it and then to feel sufficiently confident to actually use it in the classroom.  That is the point at which we are aiming here.  We are not talking about simply giving people a set of skills whereby one ticks the box and says that is grand as every teacher now knows how to use X, Y and Z.  That is not the solution we need.  What we need, just like we need for our young people, is for people to have skills to teach themselves, to learn for themselves, to be able to figure out what is good and bad and then to figure out how to use it and deliver it in the appropriate context.  That is the key differential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#L00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Steven Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1422450000,"counter":321,"content":"<p>This is what the proposed junior cycle reform is trying to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#L00200","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422450000,"counter":322,"content":"<p>Exactly and that is exactly what the junior cycle reform is trying to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Steven Daly"},{"type":"speech","time":1422450000,"counter":323,"content":"<p>May I ask a question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#L00400","speaker":"1170"},{"type":"speech","time":1422450000,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I also need to ask one supplementary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#L00500","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1422450000,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I will bring in Deputy Cannon first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#L00600","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1422450000,"counter":326,"content":"<p>First, I welcome Mr. John Fitzsimons and Mr. Steven Daly to Leinster House.  I had the privilege of visiting Camara Ireland almost two years ago at its Chapelizod site.  I am a huge fan of social entrepreneurship and these guys epitomise the very best of that sector.  They are using resources that at times simply would be discarded and not used to anybody's great advantage.  They are employing people and certainly are empowering young people both in Ireland and across much of the world to avail of a whole new learning opportunity of which they may not have been able to avail in the past.  They also are tapping into and nurturing to an extent a wonderful learning revolution that is under way both here in Ireland and globally.  I would argue that Irish schools are at present more than capable not alone of playing a part in that revolution but in leading it.  We have an organisation in Ireland that has been in existence for more than 40 years called the Computers in Education Society of Ireland, CESI.  It is comprised of teachers who are experts in the use of technology in education, expert in digital learning and expert in sharing resources among themselves.  That society is attempting, as are other organisations such as CoderDojo, the Excited Digital Learning Movement, Camara Ireland and others working in that sector, to bring together all that expertise, to share the knowledge that has been accumulated by exceptionally talented, committed and trailblazing teachers and to use it to empower others and to eliminate the fear.<\/p> <p>  Ultimately, Mr. Daly's point is correct, in that much of it is about that first fear of engaging with the new learning opportunity.  For example, just last year the Government launched a competition called MATHletes, which uses the Khan Academy platform.  It is a free platform that does not cost the school, participant, student or parent anything to use.  It is an excellent global philanthropic learning resource and a significantly increased number of young people and teachers now can be seen using that resource here in Irish schools.  It is often that first venture or foray into a whole new world of learning and it is often more challenging for the teacher than it is for the young person involved.  Young people are now to be seen engaging in the learning process in a completely different way.  One can see a tearing down of the walls of the school because, for example, in Khan Academy, again like the system mentioned by Mr. Fitzsimons, each child's performance can be monitored, as can the amount of time spent on a particular subject matter and their attainment level in that subject matter.  A lot of exciting things are happening and Camara Ireland is an excellent example of what can be done when one puts together heads that have the expertise, passion and commitment to deliver on what is possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#L00700","speaker":"1042"},{"type":"speech","time":1422450000,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I will call on Deputy Jim Daly and then we will go back to Senators O'Donnell and Moran.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#L00800","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1422450000,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I will be brief.

To address the teacher training question first, we have seen an interesting change over the past five years since we have been working specifically in Ireland on the teacher training side.  To explain quickly how it works, the training we deliver normally is delivered either after school or rarely, on Saturdays.  However, it often is delivered in conjunction with, for example, a half-day whereby a staff meeting might take up a certain proportion of a half-day and then our trainers will deliver a training session.  At other times, the training is timetabled in throughout the day.  We might take a small group of teachers, perhaps four or five, and focus on a particular aspect and deliver the training that way.  What we have seen, especially in the past year and a half or two years, is a shift where delivering that training has become much more challenging.  This is due to the changing industrial relations environment and due to the Croke Park agreement hours with which teachers and school principals are working.  The main challenge with this is the Croke Park hours generally must be taken as a lump and consequently, the entire staff must be involved in an activity that is to be put down as the Croke Park hours.  A major challenge for us is that we cannot split up those hours, deliver training to, for example, five teachers on a Wednesday afternoon with the effect that those five teachers therefore have completed the Croke Park hours.  Instead, we must take the entire staff, which could be 30 or 40 teachers, and deliver a training session, which obviously loses its impact because one is not able to give each individual teacher as much individual attention.  In addition, the session is curtailed a little by the hours.  Consequently, we have seen the changing situation in the education system over the past few years affecting the training.<\/p><p>To combat that, we have also worked more closely with some of the education centres.  For example, we have delivered training in conjunction with Blackrock Education Centre on a pilot basis, which has worked very well.  One of the larger challenges we have is that our training is not recognised as official CDP days, something which we are working towards.  It is a difficult process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#L01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Steven Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422450000,"counter":337,"content":"<p>To address the question on whether we have documented our learning, the answer is \"Yes\".

We very much appreciate the committee's interest in this aspect of the work.<\/p> <p>  There is no doubt that the development of the Intreo service marked a significant change in the way that welfare and employment services are delivered to unemployed people.  The bringing together of the employment services, the payments processing and the community welfare service marked a very significant departure from the arrangements that applied heretofore.<\/p> <p>  The INOU, as the national organisation of the unemployed, is of the view that it was really important to hear from the people most affected - the unemployed people.  The aim of our project was to capture what individuals were finding useful or helpful in this new service, to identify those aspects that may not be working particularly well and to identify what changes are required to improve the overall Intreo process and service.<\/p> <p>  We visited two Intreo offices on 25 occasions, between April 2013 and April 2014, to talk to unemployed people entering and exiting what are known as the group engagement sessions, with a view to inviting people to attend a focus group meeting in order to talk to them about their experience.  In all, we spoke to 480 unemployed people at the two Intreo centres.  We ran six focus group meetings of unemployed people, including a national focus group meeting of unemployed individual members of the National Organisation of the Unemployed.  Fifty-six people participated in the groups and we also carried out 66 telephone interviews.<\/p> <p>  The focus groups set out to explore people's experience of signing on after losing their job.  Most people we met were short term or recently unemployed and would have been in employment, in some cases, for many years.  It was, therefore, a significant shock for them to lose their jobs.  People did not necessarily know what to do and what they needed to know about making a claim.  We decided to capture people's experience of signing on.  We also sought to capture information on the contact with the Intreo service in terms of accessing those payments; the group engagement sessions; meeting with case officers - which is vital; review and subsequent meetings and engagements; accessing education and training courses; and ultimately finding employment.<\/p> <p>  I will refer to some of the key recommendations.  Most of the people we met had, thankfully, been in work for very many years and in some cases were significantly still in shock when we met them, due to the experience of losing their jobs.  At a point in time when people are pretty vulnerable and are concerned for their future, it is important that a service is available to them to help them in finding out what are their entitlements and to know what type of service they might be able to access.<\/p> <p>  The key recommendations include that continual training and development and what constitutes a quality service for unemployed people should be a priority for the Intreo service.  We had a sense that staff who have good people and interpersonal skills should be allocated to what we call front-line roles in Intreo offices, where they would meet and deal with unemployed people face-to-face.  The use of text messaging and e-mail as a means of communication has been highlighted as being useful.  <\/p> <p>  It is very important that communication by the Intreo service should be in a clear and as positive a manner as possible and also that the group engagement invitation letters should promote the positive benefits of engaging with people in the Intreo process.  We got a sense that the way the Department communicates with unemployed people in the context of Intreo was that in some way the Department was not selling the service to people.  I think it was more that they were, in some respects, threatening people with the service in the way some of those letters were worded.  We are pleased to note that there have been some positive changes in that regard.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the group engagement session, in general, the people we spoke to had a sense that the group engagement sessions were probably overall not that useful and did not work particularly well for many of the people we met.  We recommend that additional information should be sent in advance of the meeting, for example, that the presentation should be sent in advance to the unemployed people who have been invited to attend.  In terms of the profile of participants at the group engagement session, it would be useful if those invited had broadly similar profiles.<\/p><p>It is important that the structure of the group engagement session be considered.  There should be an introduction, people should be taken through the process, and the Intreo service should be explained.  The purpose of the group engagement session should be explained and the next steps should be outlined.  It is important that the content be conveyed in a clear and easy-to-understand manner.<\/p><p> The group engagement sessions need to comprise a real engagement opportunity.  We propose that there be a 30-minute session followed by an optional 30 minutes for those who would like to discuss aspects of the presentation further.  It is important that those presenting the sessions highlight upcoming events, such as roadshows, job fairs and career zoos, and give the relevant information to clients at the group engagement sessions.  We felt a number of people were invited to the group engagement sessions who probably should not have been there.  I refer, for example, to people on the back-to-education allowance.  They were invited although it was known they were returning to their education programme later in the year.<\/p><p> With regard to meeting case officers, the group engagement sessions were certainly useful in terms of setting up a meeting.  The case officer role is critical.  Our research shows unemployed people generally felt particularly positive about their experience of meeting a case officer on a one-to-one basis.  They felt there was adequate time allocated for the meetings and welcomed the fact that there was a relatively quick appointment following on from the group engagement sessions.<\/p><p> Let me outline some of our recommendations.  Case officers should work with people until they find suitable and sustainable work.  They should contact unemployed people proactively to inform them of relevant upcoming events and work, training and education opportunities.  There should be an option of a second meeting to agree or finalise a progression plan.  The officers should utilise the expertise that exists externally, including in the adult education guidance service and NALA.  In the event of a breakdown in the relationship between the case officer and unemployed individual, there should be an option to transfer the latter to another officer.  One should prioritise continuous training and development for case officers.<\/p><p> On the progression outcomes and key recommendations, I must hammer home the point that the service should work with people until they find a job.  Links to employers should be prioritised.  It is important that Intreo do so and that proper job-matching arrangements be put in place.  With regard to the ultimate aim of our project, we are anxious to map the journey of the longer-term unemployed and work through two different Intreo offices.  We thank the departmental officials and regional and local managers for their support and assistance in facilitating this work. \u00a0I thank all the unemployed people who participated in the project and also the joint committee for its interest in this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Stewart","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422450000,"counter":371,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Stewart.

We circulated an opening statement prior to the meeting and, in the interest of time, I will not read through it slavishly.  I am joined by Mr. Barry Kennedy, who looks after activation operations for the Department, and Mr. Donal Spellman, who runs our eastern region, which includes counties Wicklow and Carlow.  They can answer specific questions, if necessary.<\/p> <p>  I will start with a quick labour market update because it has been of interest to the committee on other occasions on which I have been in attendance.  Members are aware that the employment rate has increased.  It has risen by approximately 4.5%, or nearly 5%, since the trough in 2012.  The overall figure stands, with seasonal adjustment, at approximately 1.9 million, representing an uplift of close to 80,000.<\/p> <p>  We were asked before about insecure employment.  If measured in terms of the share of workers on temporary contracts, one notes the rate grew during the recession from approximately 9.5% to 10.5%.  However, it has fallen back to the pre-recession level and remains below the EU average, which is approximately 13.5%.<\/p> <p>  As a proportion of the overall employment rate, the percentage of part-time employment, representing another form of insecure employment, rose quite significantly during the recession, from approximately 17% to approximately 24%, but it has actually fallen since because most of the employment growth has been in full-time jobs.  The share is now back to under 23%, which is broadly similar to the European average.  Overall, the unemployment rate rose from 5% to over 15%, but it has now fallen back to approximately 10.6%, according to the latest CSO estimate.  The number of unemployed people has fallen from over 327,000 to just about 230,000 in November 2014. <\/p> <p>  We have been asked before about regional variation.  Regional variation in unemployment is relatively low by European standards.  In fact, Denmark is the only country with a lower level.  That does not mean there is not any.  The highest unemployment rate, in the midlands, is over 14%.  The lowest, in Dublin, is 10.2%.  Around the country there is a variation of 4%, but it can be far wider in other European countries.<\/p> <p>  Youth unemployment has decreased quite significantly, from over 30% in 2012 to approximately 23%, according to the last QHS report.  The youth unemployment rate is high, at about twice the overall rate.  Generally, the youth unemployment rate tends to be twice the overall rate, even during boom periods, because of lower participation rates among young people.  Therefore, the rate is what one would expect given the overall rate of unemployment.  In absolute terms, the number of young people unemployed is estimated at 48,000, by comparison with 83,000 at the peak.  Therefore, there has been a very significant reduction.  Long-term unemployment has fallen sharply by comparison with the very sharp increase during the recession.  There was an increase from 31,000 to over 200,000 but the figure is now down to 139,000.  The total long-term rate has fallen from 9.5% to 6.4%.  That is the good news but there is still bad news and there are challenges.<\/p> <p>  A particular challenge concerns the very long-term unemployed.  Our submission contains a graph showing the share of long-term unemployment accounted for by people who are unemployed for three years or more.  They number approximately 100,000, which figure is relatively stagnant.  Therefore, the unemployment rate is falling among those who have been unemployed for shorter periods but not among those who have been unemployed for longer periods.  Males comprise a disproportionate share.  Some 72% of very long-term unemployed people are male.  Age is a consideration in this group.  Middle-aged and older age cohorts are disproportionately represented in respect of all durations of unemployment.  Figures show that the over-35s share of long-term unemployment has increased from 40% to over 80%.  That is particularly noteworthy and means that a case worker in the Department is much more likely to be sitting opposite a male who is over 35 than a young person under 25.  The challenge in reducing long-term unemployment is finding jobs for males over 35.  We should not forget that.<\/p> <p>  I will not elaborate on Pathways to Work.  We have discussed it fairly recently so I will skip it.<\/p> <p>  On the INOU survey, the Department has a very long and co-operative relationship with the INOU and was pleased to facilitate the survey.  Although it is a small survey, we believe it comprises valuable input.  It contains real stories from real people and real offices.  Overall, it gives a positive assessment of the client's journey.  It does outline some negative experiences, however, and we must acknowledge that.  In acknowledging it, we must bear in mind the sheer scale of the Department's operations.  For example, the approximately 6,500 staff in the Department process 2 million claims every year and answer over 8 million telephone calls.  They make over 85 million payments to over 1.4 million people.  The proportion of complaints and bad experiences is tiny relative to the scale of the operation.<\/p> <p>  Approximately 3,000 staff in our Intreo offices focus on jobseekers.  Last year, they processed over 500,000 claims.  They hosted over 186,000 people at group engagement sessions and conducted over 330,000 one-to-one case-officer&ndash;client interviews.  With the exception of new claims, there was a considerable increase in the activity level in this regard.  For example, the number of group engagement interactions increased by over 50% last year by comparison with the previous year.  It is important to note that all the performance improvements happened during a period of great change.  There were considerable changes to staff working conditions.  Not only were there public-service-wide reductions in pay but all our staff had to move into new roles, learn new skills and take on new duties.  Major building works were taking place around them while they worked, and there were men with Kango hammers in the offices.  It is fair to say the staff responded magnificently to the challenge.<\/p> <p>  Given that background, it is not surprising that there might have been instances when the delivery of service to customers was less than perfect.<\/p><p>However, we need to put it in that context.  Given the level of change taking place, it is not unexpected that staff will take time to get used to their new roles.  That is the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422450000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>We will now take questions from members.

I thank Mr. McKeon for his presentation and I thank the INOU for the survey - albeit based on a small sample - which it carried out.  Reference was made to the growth in employment, which I welcome, but there has not been a commensurate growth in the totality of the amount paid out in wages.  Despite the fact that there has been a 5% reduction in unemployment, there has only been a tiny fraction of an increase in wages.  Are our guests in a position to explain the reason for this?  Is it because some of those who have come off the live register are now employed in jobs that are quite low paid, or whatever?<\/p> <p>  It was stated that the number of complaints is tiny when compared to the overall picture.  However, the survey was quite small in nature.  I have received quite a few complaints and they all seem to centre on one thing, namely, attempts to fit square pegs into round holes.  I refer here to people being referred for either jobs or courses which are totally inappropriate to their skill sets.  If they do not take up such jobs or courses, they are under threat of being penalised.  In the past hour I received another complaint by text.  Another matter which has come to my attention is that certain case officers seem to be programmed in such a way that they are discouraging people from pursuing opportunities for further education.  They appear to be of the view that if there is a menial job available, then a person should not waste the State's time by returning to education.  I am not saying that all case officers have adopted this attitude but there is no doubt that a number have certainly have done so.<\/p> <p>  I note the intention to increase the number of places available on JobsPlus.  How many additional places will be allocated this year, and has the money necessary to facilitate this been provided?  Will our guests also provide an update on the position with regard to the youth guarantee scheme?  There is a very interesting proposal to issue performance statistics for each Intreo office.  When will such statistics be issued?  I am of the view that this would be a very useful exercise.<\/p> <p>  On the recommendations from the INOU, I am particularly interested in those which involve matching people to appropriate courses or job opportunities.  The restructuring of the group engagement mechanism is important, as is the idea that case officers should become involved in networking among themselves.

Like the previous speaker, I am aware of people who encountered difficulties when they have presented at Intreo offices.  However, the majority of those to whom I have spoken are of the view that the service is very good and that it helped point them in the right direction.  I am aware of three people who were obliged to change case officers.  Is there a particular reason why individuals may have to change case officers?  Does it just come down to a clash of personalities?  In general, I must say \"Well done,\" because I am of the view that the service is operating well.  A great deal of work remains to be done on the ground but the new offices are making an impact.  The majority of people I meet indicate that it is a very interesting experience, particularly as they believe they have been listened to.  The latter is very important when one is unemployed.<\/p> <p>  The number of older people who are unemployed stands at 72%.  I know many individuals who were self-employed but who, unfortunately, were obliged to close down their operations.  As a result, these people have been left without any form of income at all.  I know many others who are in their late 50s or early 60s, who were involved in construction and who lost their jobs.  There is nothing out there for these people.  All of the skills they obtained during their working lives are being lost.  It has been stated that because we are going to begin building houses again, there will be a need to bring back people who emigrated to facilitate this.  There are many people who never left and who have the necessary skills in this regard.  However, these individuals are being left in long-term unemployment.  I speak to many of them and the lack of self-esteem among them is dreadful.  It just drags them down on a daily basis.  Those to whom I refer are construction workers, electricians, plumbers and carpenters and they are being informed that they should do computer courses.  These men have worked with their hands all their lives and it is very difficult for them when they are advised in this way.<\/p> <p>  Will our guests outline what the mapping process involves?  Will they indicate why - this was the case even when there was full employment here - so many young people do not take up job opportunities?

It never ceases to amaze me that we cannot get matters right in that regard, particularly in view of the fact that communications courses are on offer at many colleges.  Will our guests indicate what aspects it was necessary to change most urgently?  Was the collaboration between Intreo offices and the ETBs ineffective?  It was stated that more must be done in this regard.  As Deputies O'Dea and Catherine Byrne stated, it is necessary to obtain the right fit.  Why can people not return to education?  I reiterate what I have stated on many occasions with regard to the development of apprenticeships.  There are people who learned skills when they were employed, and these are not being used at present.  There are 28 types of apprenticeship on offer in Ireland, whereas in Germany the number is 328.  The ETBs have a major role to play in the development of apprenticeships.

If I were employed within the Department of Social Protection, I would be examining it closely and trying to use it in some way.  The sample used was quite small and I suppose Intreo is relatively new.  Does the INOU intend to carry out further work in this area or will the survey stand alone?  I congratulate Mr. Stewart on his submission because he presented it in the form of suggestions rather than focusing on the negatives that emerged on foot of the INOU's work.  That aspect is to be admired.  He stated that staff who have good people or interpersonal skills should be allocated to front-line roles.  This suggests that feedback may have indicated that some of those who are dealing with the public may not possess the necessary interpersonal skills.  Will the representatives from the Department indicate the degree to which the performance of staff is monitored?

We gained a sense that Intreo office managers are aware of this matter.  The members of staff of any organisation will possess a range of skills and abilities.  It is often the case that an unemployed person attending at an Intreo office will be anxious, apprehensive and concerned about his or her entitlement to a payment, the period he or she will be unemployed, etc.<\/p><p>It is important that when people seek to access the service, the person they meet has the necessary skills to deal with them effectively.  He or she should be able to demonstrate empathy with people's situations and should be able to communicate clearly what the person needs to know and do and what his or her options are.  Some of the feedback we have got from unemployed people we have met is that this has not been the case in every situation.  There were some examples in which, unfortunately, officials did not demonstrate the level of interpersonal skills required.  It was also recognised within the report and by the people who applied for assistance that the staff in these organisations are under significant pressure and dealing with significant numbers of people.  Nonetheless, this does not excuse circumstances or situations in which people do not receive the type of service they expect to receive.  This, essentially, is what the particular recommendation sought to address.<\/p><p> In regard to the call for more effective collaboration, the ETBs were just being formulated at the time we were doing the research, from April 2013 to April 2014.  In a way, this was a call to ensure that when the new ETBs were up and running there would be collaboration between the Intreo service, the ETBs and other providers to ensure that opportunities for people to participate in education training programmes are maximised.<\/p><p> On the point made by Deputy O'Dea in regard to square pegs and round holes, this is a critical point.  As we have seen from research we have done, it is vital that work be done to ensure that when somebody is referred to an educational training programme or to a job, there is a fit between the person and the programme, the course or the job.  This is critical, particularly in the context of employer engagement.  Without that fit, we could quite quickly undermine the service through not ensuring the key element of job matching.  The Deputy made a good and relevant point on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#P01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Stewart","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422450000,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I will try to deal with the questions in order.  Deputy O'Dea raised the issue of pay.  First, the increase in employment is 4.5%.  The number is 80,000, which is 4.5%.  I do not have the figures for the national accounts on what the total increase in salaries is.  That is something that the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation looks after.  I would not expect a huge increase in pay as a consequence, particularly when most jobs created are at entry level.  Jobs might have been lost at one level, but as the economy recovers new jobs will typically be at entry level.  I am aware that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, as part of the jobs action plan, is establishing a low pay commission.  I understand this is in the process of being established.  Obviously the Government is looking at this and it is a question of policy in terms of how the Government responds on this.<\/p> <p>  In regard to square pegs in round holes, an important point that sometimes gets lost in discussion is that when job seekers come to the Department they have a range of competencies and abilities that would be suitable for certain types of jobs.  However, they may have aspirations to a different type of job.  Our first objective is to get them back into work.  All of the evidence shows that getting somebody back into work is the best option for their long-term interests.  In a situation where somebody says they are unemployed but would like to shift career, we make no apology for telling them there are currently jobs available that they could apply for and asking them to apply for them.  This sometimes causes friction.  We would not be looking to put a square peg in a round hole, but we are saying: \"You are a square peg; there is a square hole.\"  To make a crude analogy, we suggest that if the person wants to turn into a diamond-shaped peg, that is grand and we will work with them, but we will ask them to try the square hole first.  I believe it is important that we say this.<\/p> <p>  In regard to JobsPlus, the budget provision for this year has been increased to 6,000 jobs from the previous 3,000, and there is provision to review that during the year.  If the take-up exceeds the provision, we will consider whether it is appropriate to revise the cap.  I do not have the figures on the youth guarantee with me, so I ask forgiveness if I am wrong, but I am fairly sure what I am about to say is accurate.  In 2014, approximately 20,500 young people have availed of places which are part of the youth guarantee approach.  At the end of the year, we announced and will formally start a hard drive on the developmental internship, which will be called First Steps, and on the enhanced version of JobsPlus for young people.  Therefore, these numbers will increase in 2015.  We are working on compiling performance statistics currently and will run them for approximately six months in the Department to check their reliability and the variability from month to month.  We will probably start to publish them in the second half of the year.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about restructuring group engagement.  Although it was a small survey, the evidence from the INOU report is that the majority of people were happy with their case officer interactions, but perhaps less happy with the group engagement, probably because they had unrealistic expectations of the group engagement.  This is primarily an information session, to tell clients they will be moving to a one-to-one engagement process with a case officer, what they can expect to happen and that we will produce a personal progression plan.   We are now changing the letter that is sent to clients informing them of this, so that they are aware when they attend what they are coming to.  We are changing it from a \"group engagement\" to a \"group information session\", which will hopefully address the issue.  <\/p> <p>  On the selection of staff, I will ask Mr. Spellman to talk about that because he runs a region with a lot of staff involved.  By and large, we do our best to assign staff to appropriate roles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422450000,"counter":385,"content":"<p>In the offices in our own region, before we adopt the Intreo approach, we have pre-meetings with all the staff, because Intreo involves a totally new way of delivering all the services.

They put themselves forward for the role.  In my experience, we always try to put those people front of house, because integrated reception is the first point of contact and people can then be directed to the most appropriate place.

This is a modular curriculum in which all staff involved in the role must participate if they are to stay in the role or move into it.  This training includes client interaction and communications.  I accept the point made by the Senator that we all go on communication skills courses, but sometimes we fail in a difficult situation.<\/p> <p>  On the question of people with a construction sector background and the live register, if we look at a narrow definition of this sector - painters, plasterers, plumbers - there are approximately just over 30,000 people on the register with that background.  We in the Department are anxious that as the construction industry expands, these people will be the first to get the jobs.  We are working hard at building up our ability to work with employers, to try to place candidates from the live register in employment opportunities as they arise.  We have been working closely with the Construction Industry Federation in that regard also.<\/p><p>This is where schemes such as JobsPlus can be very useful.  There are currently over 4,000 people on the JobsPlus scheme.  Over 60%, about 61% or 62%, of those people were previously two years unemployed.  About two thirds of people who are long-term unemployed and moving into employment would be one to two years unemployed and one third would be more than two years unemployed.  JobsPlus is successfully turning this on its head.  We will be very aggressive in using these schemes to try to ensure employers take the very long-term unemployed into employment.  There is a social clause in all Government contracts, particularly in construction sector contracts, requiring construction firms with State contracts to take at least 10% of their employees from the long-term unemployed, by referral from the Department of Social Protection.  This is a foot in the door for us.  We can then have a proper conversation and we are very conscious of this. <\/p><p> The question on why young people would not work even in the good years is a question that is perhaps as old as time itself.  One can look at education, family circumstances, background and so on.  This is one of the reasons, in some of the Youth Guarantee initiatives, we have focused on things which will help young people who even in the good years would not have got employment.  We have things such as the youth developmental internship, as we are calling it, or First Steps, in which we hope to get employers to sponsor 1,500 jobs for people who normally would not get passed the screening process and, to put it crudely, normally would not be allowed past the reception desk.  We are working with employers to get them to sponsor job opportunities for young people who are particularly distant from the labour market.  We have also made changes to community employment schemes and so forth in order to encourage young people to take part.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EDJ2015012800002#Q00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422450000,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I am conscious of the time.

We would have to talk to the individual, but I would emphasise that overwhelmingly, including in this research, the feedback on staff members is generally very positive.

As the joint committee knows, I published the outcome of that review process at budget time in the form of the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2015-2017.  All the relevant committees of course will have occasion in the coming few weeks to discuss the outcome of that process in detail with each line Department as they consider the 2015 Revised Estimates.  However, it is important that I appear before members today to provide an overview of the process and of the overall outcomes.  I look forward to the broad and informative discussion and debate I know will take place on all these key expenditure policy issues.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past number of years, there has been a significant transformation of the budget cycle and of the overall approach to budget planning, on which I will touch.  While the comprehensive review process is one element of that, another important element, and perhaps one on which we need to focus further, is how the D&aacute;il, and in particular the committees of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, engage in and contribute to the budget process.  The committees of course scrutinise and approve the annual Estimates and during the course of the year they also investigate and challenge spending policies across each Department of the Government and its agencies.  However, in my experience, much of that engagement tends to centre around very short term, immediate issues.  Dealing with immediate issues and problems of course is important but frankly, the discussions too often get reduced to gamesmanship, points scoring and party politics.  I say that in no partisan way because Members from all sides of the House have engaged in it.  However, as someone who is genuinely interested in the business of Parliament, I hope this process can be reformed and that change can be brought about.  This is why the comprehensive expenditure report is important.  It provides an opportunity, particularly for this committee, to have a much broader and more strategic policy debate around overarching issues and challenges facing public expenditure and policy options into the future.  The report sets out an expenditure path for three years ahead.  Just as importantly, however, it also raises longer-term expenditure policy matters that extend far beyond any individual D&aacute;il term.  Issues such as climate change, demographics and population trends will have an impact on public policy and budget management for the next two decades or more.<\/p>  <p>  The comprehensive review process also included a number of short, targeted policy reviews by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service and I wish to underscore this point because not everyone will be familiar with that service, which is a relatively new institution.  It has been examining difficult issues on pension sustainability and a range of other issues.  These issues perhaps are controversial and certainly are politically difficult and sensitive.  However, such issues must be raised, examined and debated.  Consequently, together with the comprehensive expenditure report, there are published papers which take a long-term view on expenditure policy challenges.  These are available on the economic service's website and are presented as objective assessments, rooted in evidence and in the principles of policy analysis.  They are intended to challenge and probe existing policies and expenditure approaches but members should not confuse them with Government policy or my views, for that matter.  It is open to any of us, including myself, my departmental officials, all Members of the Oireachtas, politicians and the public, to agree or disagree with and challenge the analysis presented objectively by a team of economic experts.  What is important, however, is that one supports the principle of evidence-based policy analysis in the public service and that such analysis is produced without veto from Ministers.  I make this point because it was interesting to note that some papers we published were criticised as though they were Government policy.  It is necessary to allow such rigour and debate and the base analysis must be provided to do this objectively.  It is important that there is recognition and consensus that expenditure reviews are a key input into the budgetary debate about how resources should be best allocated.  One must accept that all areas should be subject to such review.<\/p>  <p>  A key priority for the Government when it came to power in 2011 was to instigate a broad-ranging and ambitious programme of reform right across the public service.  I believe a huge amount has been achieved and in particular and critically in the modernisation of how the public finances are planned and managed.  Among the first actions of the new Government in 2011 was one to put in place a new, multi-term budgetary framework to enhance the openness, transparency and structure to the overall budget process and, in particular, the management of public expenditure.  The comprehensive review of expenditure process, which the Government undertook for the first time in 2011, is a key component of the medium-term fiscal approach.  As a result, members have before them today - in the form of the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2015-2017 - a published three-year, forward-looking plan for public expenditure which sets out clearly the overall fiscal and budgetary context for the period ahead, the Government's priorities for public expenditure and, at an individual Vote level, what the more than &euro;50 billion in current Government spending will deliver for citizens in 2015.  It contains an unprecedented level of financial information and programme level detail about what will be delivered by the State over the course of the next few years.  This simply was not produced in this form nor made available in any form just a few years ago and the State's budgetary process and decision-making are better for it.<\/p>  <p>  A number of other reform initiatives are also worth mentioning at this stage, including performance budgeting, IrelandStat and the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, and I will deal briefly with each of them.  The performance budgeting initiative is an ongoing reform process aimed at aligning spending, that is, what our evaluators call \"inputs\", with achievements or \"outputs\".  The purpose is to bring clarity as to what Government spending is achieving for citizens and from there to allow for a more informed assessment and discussion of whether what is being delivered is good enough.  As part of this reform, for example, the Revised Estimates, which I understand the committees will be considering this week and next week, present both a financial breakdown of programme spending and performance information in the form of short statements about the targets associated with moneys allocated.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of IrelandStat, the Government has launched a new website that provides valuable public information on the performance of Departments across the areas that matter most to the people of Ireland.  While the Government is still building up this information, even now it has a lot of detailed and easily-accessible information on areas such as the economy, education, and infrastructure.  It is a good comparative website that will be populated fully over time.  This reform is being made possible by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, which the Government decided to establish in 2012 and into which it has been recruiting trained economists and evaluators each year since.  At present, more than 70 economists and evaluators are working on policy analysis and economic planning across almost all Civil Service Departments and the Government is still in the process of recruiting more.  There clearly was a skills deficit in the system, which the Government is addressing and the positive impact in this regard is becoming increasingly evident.  All of this ties in with the broader reform agenda launched recently for Civil Service renewal, which will introduce a much more robust accountability and performance management regime for civil servants, including Accounting Officers.<\/p>  <p>  Turning specifically to the 2014 review process, it is important to draw a distinction between the previous 2011 process, about which I have spoken to the joint committee previously, and this latest exercise.  The economic and fiscal backgrounds for each were very different and, therefore, the objectives changed from one process to the next, as did the outcomes.  The 2011 comprehensive review of expenditure was undertaken at the height of the economic storm as Ireland battled its way through the first phase of the EU-IMF programme.  It was dominated by an urgent need to reduced public expenditure in overall terms but in so doing, to protect key public services.  By contrast, the 2014 review was undertaken against the backdrop of the Government having exited successfully the troika programme and, at around mid\u00adpoint of the review process, a rapidly improving economic and fiscal environment.  This meant that by the end of the review - for the first time since the onset of the current economic crisis - the Government could make decisions on budget allocations without recourse, as members saw in the last budget presentation, to further reductions.  Consequently, the focus shifted from an emergency response to recovery planning, with the key challenge to build on the achievements of the previous few years and to put in place a spending plan that would secure full economic and social recovery.  <\/p>  <p>                 To that end, this comprehensive report, which looks ahead over the next three years, is clear on a number of points.  The efficiency and productivity improvements made by Government Departments since 2011 must be secured and expanded into other areas.  Public expenditure policy and management must continue to focus on how best to use limited public resources.  The space to provide additional spending of &euro;429 million this year, the first increase in public expenditure since the onslaught of the crisis, has been made possible by the very careful management of the public finances of recent years and, therefore, continuing on this path is key to providing more room for increased spending in the years ahead.<\/p> <p> What is most important to my mind about the comprehensive review process and the broader budget management reforms is that the Government now has in place a much more robust and evidence-based framework to help it to make budget and resource allocation decisions.  This facility is also available to the committee.  This does not necessarily make the decision-making process less difficult, particularly when very hard choices are to be made, but it does provide a more solid basis for making those decisions.  As important is the resulting publication of a report which sets out more clearly than ever the Government's three-year spending plan and commitments laid out for Parliament and the public to examine and scrutinise.<\/p> <p> Having given the committee an outline of the overarching reform context and the strategic objectives of the comprehensive review process, it might be useful for me to briefly describe the nuts and bolts of the process.  The Government agreed the 2014 comprehensive review of expenditure should provide it with a precise set of decision options which would help realign spending priorities with the priorities set in the programme for Government, meet the overall agreed fiscal objectives, and help explore new and innovative ways of delivering Government policy in a reformed public sector.<\/p> <p> Co-ordinated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the review involved all Government Departments, which were asked to examine existing expenditure in all of their main spending programmes, set out priority areas and future pressures, and identify opportunities for reform and efficiencies.  The Government was presented with an overarching assessment of these evaluations early last summer.  This formed the basis of the budget discussions which followed, and informed the final decisions made by the Government on the allocations of expenditure for 2015 to 2017, which were presented to the Oireachtas at budget time.<\/p> <p> This approach sought to ensure the resource allocation decisions attained the right balance of expenditure and that public resources were used effectively and efficiently to deliver public services in effective ways.  The public and other interested parties were invited to submit comments and suggestions on public expenditure and reform in the context of the review.  It is interesting that more than 60 submissions were received from a mixture of individuals and organisations.  These all fed into the process and were considered by relevant Government Departments as part of the analysis.  A selection of the proposals received are available on the Department's website.<\/p> <p> Economic conditions are improving.  There are reasons for optimism following the recent crisis we have endured, but in Ireland, as in other countries, there is a need to ensure the resources provided by taxpayers are managed carefully and it will always be thus.  In our post-economic crisis environment, spending reviews should not be regarded simply as a tool for reducing expenditure.  Instead they should be seen as a feature of the budget preparation process and a core instrument for ensuring good expenditure prioritisation and proper decision-making.  Spending reviews give the Government the opportunity to examine how public resources are used, to set out how public resources should be used, and to examine where new spending proposals can be accommodated in existing budgets.  I strongly advocate they should be here to stay because they are critical for informed and balanced fiscal management.  They are also a growing feature of how all progressive governments deal with budget planning.  I look forward to hearing the views of the committee and answering any questions that might arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015012800002#B00200","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422457200,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

We are dealing with what the Minister terms the comprehensive expenditure report for 2015 to 2017, which covers approximately &euro;150 billion expenditure over the three-year period.  If I ask questions to which we do not get answers, or for which we do not have time to have answered today, I am happy to come back next week or whenever the information comes.  I may ask a question on details which the Minister does not have today.<\/p>  <p>  I do not accept the credibility of the document or of the Minister's opening statement.  Some of what it is in the Minister's opening statement is not accurate or true.  It is a flawed document, in line with the flawed document published by the Minister on budget day, which was 14 October.  On that day the Minister stated gross current expenditure for 2015 would be just over &euro;50 billion and this figure represented an increase of &euro;429 million over the 2014 figure.  The Minister repeated this verbatim today.  He also stated this increase in targeted expenditure allows for expenditure in critical areas, such as social protection, health, justice and housing.  The figure we had in October had not taken into account the &euro;1.2 billion in Supplementary Estimates.  When the Minister takes into account that the 2014 expenditure figures to which he referred on budget day were supplemented by &euro;1.2 billion, it is clear the Revised Estimates for 2015, which are fundamental for this document, show a reduction in Government expenditure in 2015 compared to 2014 of approximately &euro;800 million.  <\/p>  <p>               The Minister stated that this would allow for an increase of &euro;429 million in 2015.  That is simply not true.  It ignores the additional &euro;1.2 billion that was approved for 2014 by the D&aacute;il during Christmas week.  Combined with that figure, the 2015 figure is &euro;800 million less than the 2014 outturn.  To come to this meeting four months after originally making the flawed statement in the Chamber just to repeat it questions the credibility of the information before me.  I understand that the process is a factor, but we must examine the figures.<\/p> <p> I question the figures before us because on page 33 of the comprehensive review document, one of its most important tables, No. 3, outlines the ministerial Vote group gross current expenditure ceilings, which are the maximum amounts spendable allowable by law.  They are not the Estimates, which might not reach the ceilings.  The Estimate for 2015 is &euro;49.612 million, leaving &euro;465 million in the ceiling.  If we happen to have anything remotely like the 2014 Supplementary Estimates in 2015, we will exceed those ceilings.  What is the point of them?  Expenditure will not be lower than them this year.  There is less than &euro;500 million in headroom, there was &euro;1.2 billion in Supplementary Estimates in 2014 and there was &euro;1.1 billion in Supplementary Estimates in 2012.  If even half of those amounts are required this year, the Government will be in breach of its ceilings.<\/p> <p> I would also test the credibility of this document by asking the Minister about the outturn of the previous comprehensive expenditure review.  The figures for 2012, 2013 and 2014 were &euro;51.8 billion, &euro;50.6 billion and &euro;48.7 billion, respectively.  I do not expect the Minister to have the information with him.  He is concentrating on something.  What were the outturns in those years and were those ceilings changed?  I believe they were.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015012800002#C01400","speaker":"1100","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422457200,"counter":423,"content":"<p>Could the Deputy put the question again, please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015012800002#D00200","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1422457200,"counter":424,"content":"<p>The expenditure ceilings in the previous comprehensive expenditure report-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015012800002#D00300","speaker":"1100"},{"type":"speech","time":1422457200,"counter":425,"content":"<p>For 2011.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015012800002#D00400","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1422457200,"counter":426,"content":"<p>Yes.

It excludes expenditure on public private partnerships and as well as agencies' off-balance sheet items.

That is not a basis to begin analysis.<\/p>  <p>  In the immediate aftermath of the budget Deputy Sean Fleming issued a statement along the lines of the presentation he made about the Supplementary Estimates.  The budget was in October and the Supplementary Estimates were determined in December.  Of course, there will be some changes.  As the economic situation improved, because of the work of the Government and the hard work of the Irish people during the course of 2014, I had more scope to address outstanding issues in December 2014 than I expected to have in October 2014 when the previous budget was published.  That is understandable to everybody present.  In October 2013, when we published the expected expenditure profiles of 2014, I was expecting to face into 2015 with demands for further budgetary reductions of &euro;1.3 billion.  Instead of that, we had no reductions and an increase in expenditure.  That was because of the really good progress the economy has made.  Of course, the projections improved and we were able to provide some amelioration of pressure points when the income stream into the State and the unemployment rate improved so remarkably.<\/p>  <p>  I will outline the specific details in response and rebuttal to the points made by Deputy Sean Fleming, which are just wrong.  In respect of the &euro;1.2 billion Supplementary Estimates he mentioned - they amounted to &euro;1.27 billion - many of those, as I explained in detail, were technical adjustments.  I will go through them according to each Department.  In the Department of the Taoiseach, there was a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;2 million but savings of &euro;3 million.  In the Department of Finance, there was no Supplementary Estimate but savings of &euro;23 million.  In the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, there was a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;22 million, which we discussed in this committee, but savings of &euro;17 million.  However, we had to vote on the gross figure.<\/p>  <p>  In the Department of Justice and Equality, there was a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;84 million, with a net increase of &euro;54 million.  Although the gross figure voted for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government was &euro;35 million, the net figure of required additional spending was &euro;19 million.  In the Department of Education and Skills, the additional Vote was &euro;103 million, although the net amount was &euro;95 million.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade made a saving of &euro;19 million.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources made a saving of &euro;3 million.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had a notional Supplementary Estimate of &euro;177 million but, as I explained, that was a profile difference because we did not get EU payments which we will receive in 2015.  We had to account for them.  We expected them last year but they will be received in this year's Estimates.  The Supplementary Estimate of &euro;162 million for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was money we allocated, and I explained that.  It was for buying the new buses that were required and for other transport needs.  We had the wherewithal to do it and spent it last year to meet a demand that presented.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation made savings of &euro;19 million and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht saved &euro;1 million.  The Department of Defence had a notional additionality of &euro;5 million but it made an actual saving of &euro;8 million.  The Department of Social Protection saved &euro;62 million.<\/p>  <p>  The vast bulk of the additionality was in the Department of Health, because we wished to provide it with relief from pressure.  That amounted to &euro;647 million.  There was a balance in contingencies of &euro;151 million savings as well.  In essence, of the &euro;1.27 billion in Supplementary Estimates the additionality was &euro;841 million, of which the Department of Health took &euro;647 million or 77%.  I explained that at the time.  I was criticised as being profligate in allocating &euro;1.27 billion.  In fact, we allocated &euro;841 million and 77% of that went to health to address concerns about which Deputy Fleming's party was banging drums each week.  It was right to do so because there were pressures that had to be addressed.  We had to do that.  However, that does not mean that we did not budget properly.  It is just that the improved circumstances allowed us to allocate resources at the end of last year that we did not envisage we would have in the budget of 2013.  I hope I have explained that to the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the ceilings, the figures are profiled on the ceilings we have outlined and we can deal with the last CRE separately, as I do not have it before me now.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the other point Deputy Sean Fleming made regarding voted expenditure and expenditure that comes from the Central Fund, that has always been the practice since the foundation of the State.  If there is a wish to change that, we can have that debate.  The Central Fund, as Deputy Sean Fleming knows, is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  I do not control it.  It pays our salaries, the national debt, the Judiciary and other functions, all of which are prescribed by law as passed by the Oireachtas.  It is not simply that we would determine that we will allocate something to the Central Fund and it would be voted expenditure.  Some of it, such as loan repayments, is required by the contracts we have with those who lend us money.  They have unconditional access to the repayment scheme, so it would not be conditional on an annual vote of the House.  If people are to loan us money, they must know that the money will be available and provided.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.<\/p>  <p>  Again, if we are reforming budgetary matters and if there should be a debate about how the Central Fund operates, let us have that debate.  However, it is the Department of Finance, not my Department, that controls the Central Fund.<\/p>  <p>  On the final point, Deputy Sean Fleming said the issues that arose in the D&aacute;il this morning would indicate the Government does not wish to have debate.  I assure him the Government was, and still is, most anxious to have that debate, but when the Chair makes a ruling it is as binding on the Government as it is on the Opposition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015012800002#E01000","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1422457200,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Deputy McDonald has ten minutes.

However, ultimately its value is only reflected in its accuracy and the extent to which it is grounded in not just the real figures, but also the real demands on the system.  I will refer to some concerns I have in that regard shortly.<\/p>  <p>  Referring to broader budgetary reform, the Minister mentioned a performance budgeting initiative.

One could add to that any number of other shortfalls and dilemmas within the system.  Is the Minister saying that, on the basis of performance budgeting and the other analytical tools that have been applied, he is convinced the figures set out here for 2015, 2016 and 2017 are not just ceilings to be adhered to, but represent a sufficient resource to deliver a sufficient service to the citizens of this State?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015012800002#F00300","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speech","time":1422457200,"counter":461,"content":"<p>That is fundamentally a question that should be posed to the Minister for Health, who is statutorily and constitutionally responsible for managing health expenditure.

Both Deputies talked about health expenditure.  It is funny that every public discussion I have on expenditure normally crystallises in the area of health.  That is completely usual in every developed country.  The issue will become more acute because we will have to make decisions on health care, particularly because there will be an increasing number of very expensive drugs becoming available.  This was evident recently in respect of hepatitis drugs.  Decisions will have to be made on their provision and the impact on the capacity of the State to pay for them.  We have an ageing population and will have to take decisions on providing for an ageing population in a way that we have not in the past.<\/p><p>As the Deputy knows, the EU Commission and IMF are constantly reviewing expenditure in Ireland and commenting on it.  In June 2014, the EU Commission made health recommendations for Ireland's national reform programme.  Its document states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tEven though Ireland has a relatively young population, public healthcare expenditure was among the highest in the EU in 2012 at 8.7% of GNI, significantly above the EU average of 7.3%.  Given the current difficulties in managing the health budget, expected demographic pressures due to an ageing population mean that current service levels can be maintained only if value-for-money gains are achieved over the medium to long term.&rdquo; <\/blockquote>  <p>This is where I come in as I must ensure that whatever we allocate &mdash; we are allocating as much as we can afford &mdash; is at least expended in an efficient way.

My question arises because there seems to be a controversy over, or difference of opinion as to whether, the expenditure benchmark is binding or provided by way of strong but non-binding guidance.  I have read strong opinions on both sides of that argument.  The Minister indicated when we spoke last that he regarded the arrangement as binding.

However, we will not be able to come to a conclusion on it domestically.  I refer to the question of what is now being called the fiscal space, namely, the space within the fiscal rules in which we can either increase expenditure or reduce taxation.  The first point I should make is that the rules are very complicated.  In a way, they have to be teased out.  I discussed this matter bilaterally with the German finance Minister, Mr. Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, when I met him in Dublin.  I discussed it in the past ten days with the Slovenian Minister, who has similar issues.  I discussed it also with the new EU Vice President and economics Commissioner.  A number of countries are already alerting the Commission to concerns over the availability of sufficient fiscal space for countries whose economic circumstances allow increased expenditure to engage in such expenditure.  They are coming at it from different angles.  Some countries in the east, for example, are concerned about the perceived growing threat from Russia and what is happening in Ukraine.  They want to increase military expenditure.  Other countries, such as Ireland and Italy, are very anxious to increase expenditure on necessary infrastructure.  Whether that should be captured in any calculation of allowable expenditure for fiscal ceiling purposes is open to debate.  There are technical issues on which we are engaging.  These concern the profiling of Ireland in terms of population trends, for example.  In reality, these might not be what were perceived to be the reality when people were leaving the country at the height of the depression.  We need to work out a technical agreement with the Commission that will give us sufficient capacity to allow our economy to continue to grow, meet critical infrastructural deficiencies, which the Deputies could name, and continue to ensure that social expenditure meets the social needs of our people.<\/p>  <p>  All these matters will be subject to an increasing amount of debate in the future.  Deputy McDonald has put her finger on an important issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015012800002#G02000","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1422457200,"counter":496,"content":"<p>The witnesses and Minister are all very welcome today.  It was a very interesting contribution.  It is important and very necessary to have a medium to long-term perspective.  Perhaps we lacked it in the past.  There certainly did not seem to be a co-ordinated approach to achieving economic stability, which is vital, in the longer term.<\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to climate change, demographics and infrastructural projects.  Bearing in mind that the prices of oil and other fuels are dropping and the medium-term objectives associated with projects such as district heating and housing, which involve major infrastructure, we now have a chance to do things properly.<\/p>  <p>  In 2011, I believe, I read a publication, a review document, that highlighted the lack of expertise in Departments.  It highlighted that many policies were sent out for evaluation and that, owing to that outsourcing, there was a real risk of policy capture.  This was quite worrying.  <\/p>  <p>               Does the Minister think he has rectified that situation now?  It was clearly not an approach with which one could continue.  It is welcome that the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service has 70 new economists and evaluators.  How many more does the Minister think will be needed to reach the full complement to do this work?  <\/p> <p> The Minister also mentioned performance budgeting, which was great to hear.  Would he consider sectors such as the agri-sector in which there were necessary cuts, as in all other Departments, and which are now returning strongly to economic growth to be a priority for additional funding down the line?  I welcome co-funding for projects to date.  The cuts in current and capital funding were I think 8% and 16%.  <\/p> <p> The Minister mentioned Civil Service renewal.  We have been through a long process as part of which people gave out about the Civil Service.  It has been constant background noise, but it is important that we start talking about Civil Service renewal.  Yes, robustness and accountability are important, but civil servants must have the skills required to deliver and must feel their contribution is of value, which I am not sure was the case previously.<\/p> <p> I presume the projections the Minister has made will be more accurate as time passes.  I run an SME and have done so for many years.  When we started a cashflow analysis, we found it incredibly difficult and got it wrong because we did not have the necessary skills.  When we started to do it year-on-year, our margin of error decreased.  Having the yearly spend and medium-term investment is critical.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister sees as an acceptable rate of error, 2%, 3%, or 5%?   One needs flexibility.  <\/p> <p> The issue of health spending has been brought up which I sometimes think is a very blunt instrument with which to attack the Government.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics evaluates clinically whether drugs work.  It is not widely known that many drugs do not work.  They work on 30% or 50% of the population, but as a country we are expected to pay for 100%.  Some companies want us to pay for everything, yet they will not accept that we should not pay for those drugs that do not work.  If they only work on 50% of the population, we should not have to pay full dollar.  There should be some accommodation in that regard.  Ireland was known as Treasure Island.  Thankfully, that is changing, but if we succumb to every request made, that is what we will still become.  I witnessed a conversation one night a number of years ago when a certain drugs company was trying to put on pressure to have its drug approved.  It even suggested it might consider pulling some jobs out of the country.  That behaviour is unacceptable, but that is the pressure Ministers and others are under.  At times we use health spending as a very easy stick with which to beat the Government.<\/p> <p> I welcome the extra spend of &euro;429 million.  IrelandStat is important and we have often been criticised for not communicating properly.  It is important that people can see in a straightforward fashion how the extra moneys are being spent and how they will, I hope, have a positive effect.  <\/p> <p> It is welcome that the spending reviews are, as the Minister says, not simply a tool for reductions in expenditure because that would be the wrong mindset to have.  We need to be prudent, but if we can see that a performance can be achieved in a certain area, we should be prepared to achieve it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015012800002#G02100","speaker":"980","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422457200,"counter":498,"content":"<p>The Deputy has covered a broad canvas.  I will pick up one or two of the points he made, starting with his last point.  <\/p>  <p>  I had what was perhaps a naive notion when I entered this position in 2011, when we started the comprehensive review of expenditure process, that we would have much more proactive engagement with the Oireachtas on budgetary analysis.  I naively thought that we would not have a big budget day announcement.  I thought we would have an open discussion over a protracted period when we published the first comprehensive review of expenditure, with all of the financial options, plus the ceilings agreed over a three-year horizon with the Commission and the troika, and that we would have a debate within the Houses on where expenditure reductions should be made if they had to be made.  That did not happen, for understandable reasons.  The Opposition parties were not going to offer themselves as partners in reducing expenditure.  If one takes the seal of office, one must make the decisions.  That is understandable, but I hope we can migrate from this position as we move into a period in which we will make rational decisions on small additions.<\/p>  <p>  We are never going to have boom times again.  For 15 or 20 years hence, we will be dealing with a deficit that we will have to get back into kilter.  At the end of this year we will be out of the excessive deficit procedure, but we will be within what it is called the \"protective arm\", a lovely phrase.  We will still have to reduce the deficit by 0.5% or more, as long as we have a deficit greater than 60% of GDP.  No matter who is in office in the future, there will be difficult decisions to be made and one will always be balancing choices.  For the Opposition, traditionally - we decry the way Parliament works - it has always been, \"Whatever you are proposing is wrong and whatever lobby group wants more to be spent is right.\"  That does not provide the public with the proper basis to say whether the policies proposed are right.  We decided to spend much more money on social housing, a subject very close to the Chairman's heart, at the end of last year.  That means that somewhere else will lose out.  Could we have a robust debate on whether that is the right priority?  If one has a finite source of money, one will be making decisions on that basis.<\/p>  <p>  We need to look beyond what is immediate.  We have been trapped because we have been working in a crisis.  In a very narrow timeframe we had to get the deficit below 3% of GDP by 2015 and, by God, that was hard work.  It was difficult and challenging political work and it was challenging for the people to endure it and work with us.  <\/p>  <p>  There are big issues with a broader horizon and I have mentioned two that I think are important.  The OPW, at the Government's request, is profiling the impact of climate change in terms of flooding.  Working in a realistic way on a flood abatement plan will be a ten or 15-year project and will not be cheap, but we will have to start thinking about and providing for it.  Thankfully, we have a very young demographic profile that will continue to put demands on education and so on, but there is also an ageing profile.  We see the question of how we should deal with this as a welcome challenge, not as a burden.  It means putting money in the basket not in the short term to gain political capital in the next general election but to safeguard the country from flooding in ten years time.  These are much more difficult political choices to make, but that is what the idea of comprehensive planning and strategic thinking is about.<\/p>  <p>  I have two other comments because I do not want to be too long-winded.  I mentioned the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service.  <\/p>  <p>               Two of its newest members are in the Gallery.  One of them is newly recruited and is here to observe, while the other is a civil servant from the French Department of the Interior, who is on secondment for one year to study how we manage budgeting.  We have considerable interaction with other governments because comprehensive reviews of expenditure have become a keen issue.  Some countries, such as Canada, have been carrying out such reviews since the 1990s but they do not all do it in the same way or to the same depth as Ireland.  Increasingly this will be a feature in a strategic way of thinking rather <i>ad hoc<\/i>budgeting which has sometimes characterised the way we approached the matter.<br\/><br\/>We might need a long discussion in a future meeting on the Civil Service renewal programme because it is a very important development in itself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015012800002#H00200","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422457200,"counter":500,"content":"<p>We will take note of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015012800002#J00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1422457200,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I refer to the renewal process and the Civil Service accountability process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015012800002#J00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1422457200,"counter":502,"content":"<p>Does the Minister think there are sufficient skills within the Department to address the criticisms previously made against it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015012800002#J00400","speaker":"980"},{"type":"speech","time":1422457200,"counter":503,"content":"<p>He certainly has the fortitude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015012800002#J00500","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1422457200,"counter":504,"content":"<p>Establishing the economic evaluation service was important.  We investigated particular deficiencies in terms of our skill set.  By and large - this is a compliment not a criticism - most public servants are generalists but skill sets are becoming more specific and I think we will see an increasing number being recruited on short-term contracts to carry out specific tasks.  For example, we have established a new Office of Government Procurement because the way in which we procured &euro;9 billion worth of goods and services across the public service was previously haphazard, without professional procurement inputs.  We have centralised human resources management and recruited a number of key professional human resources managers to carry out defined jobs.  We established the economic and evaluation service, with 70 economists already recruited to work across most Departments.  They are currently receiving training in my Department.  That will continue to expand.  I do not know what the optimal number will be.  I was trained as a trade unionist, and from that perspective the normal answer is \"more\".  However, we do need more than we currently have.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this will improve the capacity not only of the Government but also the Parliament to carry out the sort of evaluation it requires.  It will enhance the role of Parliament if people in scarce budgeting circumstances can identify the options available.

I am somewhat worried by the comments from the Department of Finance which suggested that because Ireland has been reasonably successful in terms of our economic recovery, we might not qualify for that type of funding.<\/p>  <p>  The more recent announcements by the European Central Bank may assist in a further iteration of the document before us in terms of allowing the Government to increase certain limits on expenditure.  By making the cost of money to government very cheap, is there potential for us to increase the expenditure ceilings under the various headings?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015012800002#J01600","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1422457200,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Again, it is a broad tapestry of issues.  There is an expectation that we will engage in strategic planning beyond the horizon of our mandate.  By definition, the planning of major infrastructural projects, whether it be the national children's hospital or the N17 road project, will require years of work.  There has to be an understanding that some projects will continue over time.  Of course, one cannot tie the hands of an incoming Government, as new priorities will be set, but neither can we look into a crystal ball and be sure there will not be another major jolt in the world that will turn everything on its head.  It is prudent, therefore, to have a reasonable horizon and make determinations that are not outrageous or outlandish.  As far as is practicable, the greater body politic should be included in that decision making process to have as much of a buy-in and continuity as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked somebody with more mental arithmetic ability to check the savings achieved.  It always sounds like a significant sum, but it is in the order of 0.25%.  Most businesses would like to be accurate to that level.  As many are demand-led public services, it is a very reasonable outturn and we provide for a carryover of capital.  <\/p>  <p>  I was asked about flood damage caused last year and people wanted to be able to undertake repairs.  As rectifying some of the flood damage caused in coastal areas required not only planning but also foreshore licences and all the rest, the funding required could not be expended in one year.  We have allowed for it to be carried over.<\/p>  <p>  I was asked if there was sufficient capital funding.  We made hard decisions in 2011 and substantially reduced the capital programme, for which we received much criticism.  It was either that or cut the current programme, which predominantly covered health, social welfare and education services.  We are between a rock and a hard place and it can be very difficult to justify it when people literally do not have enough on which to survive in social welfare payments or need fundamental treatment in the health service.  Can we say we will not provide it and that we will build better roads or have better broadband instead?  It is a difficult choice to make.<\/p>  <p>  In the next weeks we will be profiling for the coming five years slightly increased capital investment.  Perversely, if a motorway system is broadened, for example, there will be bigger maintenance bills.  As they age, roads also need to be maintained.  I have been asked a very pertinent question to which I do not have an easy answer: what we will get from the Juncker scheme?  I do not know the answer.  I know that we have submitted robust plans and, as the European Union phrase constantly puts it, we stand ready to expend anything we can get.  We will pay great attention to how this is rolled out over time.  That applies to me and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, as well as other Ministers involved in interacting with the Commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2015012800002#K00100","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1422457200,"counter":516,"content":"<p>On behalf of the committee, I thank the Minister and his officials for participating in the meeting.

I am pleased to be here today to present to the select committee the Revised Estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for 2015.  I trust that the committee will endorse the priorities and output targets we have set for ourselves for 2015.  It is my first time I have had the pleasure of meeting the select committee to present the Revised Estimates for the Department.  In my remarks, as the Vice Chairman said, I will focus on Vote 28 - Foreign Affairs and Trade, along with my colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, who will deal with specific issues such as the diaspora and his responsibilities therein, and the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, who will address Vote 27 - International Co-operation.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that, as the Vice Chairman said, a formal, lengthy introductory statement is not required, but I would like to confine myself to some initial comments outlining the situation facing the Department at this point, before introducing the various programmes as managed by my Department.  As the committee will be aware, the overall gross current Estimate for 2015 is &euro;681 million.  This compares with an Estimate of &euro;691 million in the previous year and represents a reduction of 1.45%.  The allocation for spending on administration has decreased from &euro;175 million to &euro;171 million and I am satisfied that, despite the continuing tight budgetary situation, we can deliver on our targets for 2015.  <\/p>  <p>  A significant proportion of Vote 28 Estimates, some 19.2%, is made up of mandatory contributions to international organisations, including the United Nations.  These figures are often very difficult to project for a number of reasons.  First, the budgetary process involved requires us to make the estimate of costs well in advance of when payments are ultimately finalised.  Second, in the case of UN peacekeeping missions, new and further missions can be added in response to emerging crises.  Third, and perhaps most relevant at this point in time, is the current dollar-euro exchange rate.  As the committee will appreciate, adverse currency movements have a dramatic impact on the final amount dispersed for large payments such as those made in dollars to the United Nations.  <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding those three points, my Department tracks all the relevant issues closely and I am fully focused on delivering the objectives for 2015 within the reduced budgetary allocation.  <\/p>  <p>               In the course of this year we will be continuing to build on Ireland's success in exiting the EU-IMF programme.  My Department has been centrally involved - particularly through the agency of our diplomatic and consular network - in this achievement.  The task of restoring our economic fortunes and recovering lost ground internationally is not yet complete and, as the committee will appreciate, there is no room for complacency in this regard.  Export-led growth will be key to generating employment and sustainable growth at home.  We readily accept the task of redoubling our efforts to support business internationally.  I will outline later the steps we propose to take in terms of achieving our goal of sustainable economic growth into the future.<\/p> <p> I am pleased to report that we achieved our priority targets for Vote 28 within budget and that savings will be returned to the Exchequer.  Savings mainly arose on the opening of new missions and on the lower than expected costs of United Nations contributions.<\/p> <p> In 2014 there was further conflict and division - which caused unprecedented humanitarian crises in the Middle East - but efforts to achieve progress in respect of the Middle East peace process and the deteriorating political situation in Ukraine are ongoing.  Each of these matters will be a significant focus of the attention of the Department in the coming year.  I intend to visit both the Middle East and Ukraine in the coming months.  While in Poland yesterday, I had a brief opportunity to engage with President Poroshenko of Ukraine.  A special meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council is due to take place in Brussels tomorrow.<\/p> <p> Members will be aware that my departmental officials and I were centrally involved in the recent negotiations which led to the Stormont House Agreement on a way forward for Northern Ireland.  As was noted when this matter was discussed in the House last week, the agreement represents a great opportunity to restore effective partnership government in Northern Ireland, advance genuine reconciliation between divided communities and progress economic prosperity for all.<\/p> <p> International development will remain central to our foreign policy in 2015.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, whose role is crucial in this regard, will outline his position later.  I wish to acknowledge the lead role the plays on behalf of Ireland in the context of the country's official development assistance.  I am proud that Ireland has taken up the role of co-chairing the vital global development negotiations currently under way at the United Nations in New York.  The challenge now will be to ensure we use this leadership role to enable the full membership of the United Nations to adopt a new set of global development goals in September, with the ambition of ending extreme poverty and hunger in the world by 2030.  On a previous occasion I referred to the Representing the Global Island conference and the launch of the foreign policy review which accompanied it.  The conference in question included a number of business round-table discussions in which Irish companies, State agencies and the heads of our diplomatic missions participated.  These discussions focused on emerging markets, Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, the Middle East and Africa.<\/p> <p> An underlying theme in the context of our contacts with the global Irish community is that if Ireland wishes to be successful, then we must continue to go out and engage with the world.  We cannot afford the luxury of waiting for the world to come to us.  In this regard, the very important work done by the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, in engaging with the diaspora across the globe ensures that we have an ongoing, positive and active engagement with Irish citizens abroad and the communities in which they currently live and play a key role.<\/p> <p> The review of foreign policy offers a progressive and forward-looking vision of Ireland's place in the world and sets out key areas of focus for the Government's global engagement to help secure a peaceful and prosperous future for the Irish people.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the input in respect of and valuable contribution of this committee to the review.  During the consultation exercise, we received detailed inputs from the Joint Committee on European Affairs and the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  The form and quality of the inputs received during the consultation process is testament to the depth of interest in Ireland's foreign policy.  In the coming months I intend to bring forward a series of initiatives to advance further the goals set out in the review, with an initial evaluation of progress at the end of the year.  Work on the review of the policy relating to the diaspora is ongoing.  We will be discussing that matter later this afternoon.<\/p> <p> In the context of the Revised Estimates for 2015 and the stated targets set out therein, the committee will note that in the coming 12 months the Department intends to sustain its efforts to promote Ireland's economic and trade interests, encourage the achievement of reconciliation and co-operation on this island, advance national priorities for international development, peace, security and human rights, provide passport and consular services to our citizens and continue engagement with and provide support for the Irish community abroad.  I now propose to introduce each of the programmes under Vote 28 and provide a brief overview of our priorities in respect of each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#A00500","speaker":"1055","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":529,"content":"<p>We will take the programmes in sequence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#B00200","speaker":"957"},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":530,"content":"<p>The commitment to advancing Ireland's trade and economic interests in Europe and internationally is set out in programme A.  The amount allocated for the programme in 2015 is &euro;48.6 million, a slight increase on the allocation for 2014.  Last year, 19 ministerial-led Enterprise Ireland trade missions took place to countries which have been identified as priority markets for Irish exporting companies.  This compares to 18 trade missions in 2013 and 16 in 2012.  These were additional to other non-ministerial led Enterprise Ireland trade missions and events.  The promotion of Irish trade and investment also featured significantly in the programme of high level visits throughout the year.  The latter included the State visits by the President to the UK and China in April and December, respectively, and visits abroad by the Taoiseach and Cabinet Ministers.  These trade missions are supported actively by our diplomatic missions on the ground.  In the event that a Minister from my Department leads a mission, our trade and promotion division at headquarters is actively involved.  The St. Patrick's Day period presents a very important opportunity for promotional activity on the part of our embassy network.  In 2014 the Taoiseach, 18 Government Ministers and I undertook 27 programmes across North America.  I was not there as a member of Government, but I had the opportunity to act as a substitute.  I assure all Ministers and Ministers of State that we will have a full and active programme of positive engagement this year.  We intend to maintain a similar level of promotional activity during the 2015 St. Patrick's Day period.

I refer to the proposal that the EU will participate in new trade agreements such as an EU-US agreement and an EU-Colombia-Peru agreement.

It is very important that the very best opportunity be taken over that period by a range of Ministers.  I cannot conceive of a similar type of opportunity available in any other country in the world.  St. Patrick's Day is a huge international celebration and is an annual event.  In recent times we have successfully turned it into an opportunity to showcase all that is best about Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Members will be aware that the day has long since gone when Ministers would avail of the opportunity merely to review a parade in a city that had a large Irish community.  We now have assurances, on the part of a wide range of Departments, that their Minister will engage in opportunities from the trade, economic and cultural point of view .  The one assurance I can give the committee is that each and every Minister and Minister of State who travels abroad will use the festival to the maximum.  We will ensure that we have new markets, that we maintain existing markets, and that it is a festival that showcases everything good and positive about Ireland and what it means to be Irish.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Smith referred to trade agreements.  He will be aware that the lead role in respect of trade agreement is taken at European Commission level.  <\/p>  <p>               The lead role in government is taken by my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, but members can rest assured that my Department works very closely with that Department.  The human rights considerations raised by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and others in the past are very much to the fore in discussions with the Commission and Ireland takes a very strong and active stance in this regard.  I will continue to keep the committee fully apprised of our engagement in that regard, but members will be aware that the lead role is taken by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p> <p> Deputy Brendan Smith mentioned Atlantic corridor.  Members will be aware that the Department has been funding this initiative since it was established 13 years ago.  Last year &euro;175,000 was given to the organisation and we believe the initiative is worthy of review at this stage.  The organisation does good work on a range of issues; however, it is fair to accept that the funding of organisations such as Atlantic corridor by the Department is something of an anomaly.  If Atlantic corridor is to remain in existence, it may well seek other forms of funding for its activities.  It is doing this with an element of success, but I intend to review its operation this year.  <\/p> <p> Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe mentioned human rights, an issue that comes up regularly at the committee.  I assure members that the promotion and protection of human rights throughout the world remain a priority for the Government.  Our primary but not exclusive focus is on using the established international human rights machinery to monitor implementation of universal human rights standards.  We avail of every opportunity to raise the issue of human rights at the relevant fora we attend, including the UN Human Rights Council, the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  Members will be aware that we currently hold a seat on the UN Human Rights Council for the period 2013 to 2015.  We will continue to maintain a lead role in that regard.<\/p> <p> A specific point was raised by Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn about the promotion of cultural activities.  Our embassies continue to work very closely with Culture Ireland.  We gave the issue prominence at the recent conference in Dublin Castle and will continue to do so in so far as we can because the budget in this regard is small and will remain so in 2015.  Deputy Eric Byrne raised the issue of diversity.  We wish to remain open to the promotion of culture in all its forms.  We will continue to promote Ireland as an open and diverse society at every opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#C02200","speaker":"1055","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1422455400,"counter":556,"content":"<p>Deputy Pat Breen took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":557,"content":"<p>On the question of trade missions, has the Minister identified certain areas?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#D00200","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":558,"content":"<p>In the context of our economic recovery, we have highlighted areas where we can increase our level of trade, particularly in the export market sector.

I hope the Minister will ensure that RTE continues to provide the longwave radio service, but not at the expense of the Department or through reducing the much-needed supports that certain emigrant groups are receiving.

I accept what Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn said and I am happy to carry out a comparative analysis across a range of countries of the cost of a passport.  Members will be aware of great improvements consequent on changes made in the Passport Office.  In 2014 the Department issued 629,000 passports, generating &euro;37 million in revenue.  Everyone will agree that the passport service strives at all times to provide a fast, secure and affordable service.

He presided over an office which provided a very fine service for citizens and the changes are ongoing.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputies Bernard J. Durkan and Eric Byrne mentioned the passport card.  I have an example with me.  It is similar in size to a credit card and fits easily into a wallet or purse.  It contains the precise, detailed information contained in the passport booklet and is very secure.  It will not, however, contain a visa for travel to countries where visas are required.  It will be introduced in July and available to adult holders of an Irish passport.  It will be accepted for travel throughout the European Union and the EEA travel area.  I have no doubt that there will be a big demand for it, particularly among young adults.  It represents a very positive and new departure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#F00300","speaker":"1055"},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":584,"content":"<p>How much will it cost?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#F00400","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":585,"content":"<p>It will cost &euro;35.  We are actively engaged with other jurisdictions to ensure its increased acceptance across Europe and beyond.<\/p>  <p>  The passport service continually looks towards reform, embraces new technologies and offers a service to the public in a way which ensures efficiency.  This year we intend to issue a number of contracts.  They will include contracts for facial recognition software, in an attempt to combat fraud, and new mailing machines to improve efficiency of service.  We will also look to improve our processes for sharing information with other Departments in a safe and secure way.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the words of Deputies Bernard J. Durkan and Ruair&iacute; Quinn about the consular service.  In response to Deputy Eric Byrne's question, this is an area which presents a great challenge to those involved in the provision of a high quality consular assistance service for Irish citizens at home and abroad, which they do to very good effect.  In 2014 the service assisted over 1,670 Irish citizens in cases of emergency, including deaths, illness, involvement with the criminal law, accidents, hospitalisations and abductions.  There was an increase in demand in the order of 3% on the figure for 2013.  With the opening of new missions, we expect to deal with a greater number of citizens requiring aid, assistance, support and help in 2015.  On behalf of those involved in the unit, I accept what has been said about the assistance provided and the manner in which cases are dealtj with.  I do not see a particular problem arising in any country.  However, it is fair to say a trend is to be seen in jurisdictions and countries which have seen an influx of Irish immigrants.  The more people who are working and living somewhere, the more likely it is that there will be a consequent requirement for consular services.<\/p>  <p>  As well as offering aid and assistance, the Department, through its consular services, has registered more than 5,500 people for Irish citizenship under the foreign births registration system.

As they will be aware, the position of Minister of State with special responsibility for the diaspora is a new, challenging and exciting role, which has been well received all over the world.  Everyone I have met on all levels during my visits to Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States has been very positive about it.  Those working in the various centres I visited, people on Capitol Hill and Washington, including the Friends of Ireland group and various other Representatives with Irish DNA are all very excited about the post.  I believe it will be an important role in the future and will connect Ireland and the broader diaspora.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted to be the first Minister of State with special responsibility for the diaspora.  It is very important that future Governments retain the position.  I intend to lay foundations for it through the diaspora strategy about which the Chairman and Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked.  The strategy will go to Cabinet next Tuesday week and I will publish it immediately thereafter.  I will be pleased to appear before the joint committee to discuss its various provisions.  While it does not provide for a single major new initiative, it contains many smaller initiatives.  I am convinced that, if implemented, it will make a major difference.  I have included in the report a clause providing for a review of the strategy after two years.  If members have any proposals to add to the strategy, we will try to implement them. <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan also asked about the emigrant support programme.  I was not familiar with the programme before my appointment.  The Irish abroad unit, which was established in the Department in 2004, has proved to be very successful.  It administers the emigrant support programme centrally, with a specific individual having responsibility for each of the major countries.  This approach works well because the individuals in question have continuous and direct contact with the various emigrant centres.  This is a very good way to administer funds.  An audit programme of the various recipients of funding is under way.  For example, audits are taking place in the United States this year and a number were completed in the United Kingdom last year.  This is important from the point of view of validation.<\/p>  <p>  Contact between the Irish abroad unit and all the emigrant centres is ongoing.  This year, for example, funding has been maintained at &euro;11.6 million and I will receive an additional &euro;1 million from the Department of the Taoiseach, which also has a role in this area.  Total funding will be &euro;12.6 million.  <\/p>  <p>  It is extraordinary that Ireland is the only country in the world that does this type of work.  Other countries use our services.  We should recognise the role played by previous Ministers and officials in the Department in this area.  We are unique in this area.  Other countries are examining the way in which the private and public sectors are working together on this very successful initiative. <\/p>  <p>  Reference was made to RTE's long wave 252 service, which is very important to Irish emigrants in the United Kingdom, especially the elderly.  As a result of excellent lobbying at home but especially abroad, the service will continue until 2017.  At the time, I noted the absence of research to determine exactly how many people listen to RTE's long wave service.  We are now in negotiations with RTE on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Brendan Smith referred to the funding required for the transmission of RTE's longwave service.  The Department will fund research to determine the number of people using the service and ensure we have a proper database.  <\/p>  <p>               Going back to what Deputy Smith said about funding transmission, we are going to fund research to determine the number of people using it in order that we have a proper database to determine its importance and, hopefully, decide on its continuity.  The research into listenership will take place shortly.<\/p> <p> Deputy Quinn mentioned St. Patrick's Day and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade mentioned that it is a major opportunity for our country.  No other country, apart from Ireland, gets access to the White House on its national day.  No other country gets the type of coverage we get all over the world.  When I was in my previous Department, I assembled a group looking to internationalise St. Patrick's Day.  There was a proposal to have two culture nights.  Culture night works very well and having a second one would only dilute the effect of culture night as we are used to it.  In its place, I suggested an initiative to internationalise St. Patrick's Day and to brand it as an international day for Irish culture.  We are working on the process and it is referred to as the diaspora strategy.  No country has this opportunity and so many iconic buildings all over the world have been greened.  It resonates with people all over the world.<\/p> <p> Deputy Eric Byrne referred to brand Ireland.  The people I have met all over the world are very conscious of their image and the fact that they are ambassadors for Ireland.  It is important that isolated incidents, such as those in Australia, do not recur.  The local population in San Francisco, which I will be visiting shortly, was embarrassed and annoyed about what happened last year with some J1 students.  The message is that everyone, including students leaving the country, is an Irish ambassador promoting brand Ireland and it is very important people behave responsibly.  They should always keep that at the back of their minds when they are representing Ireland.  Many of them meet more people than our diplomatic corps so they are important ambassadors for our country.  I am glad the matter was raised because we should be very aware of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#G01100","speaker":"1046","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":600,"content":"<p>Are there plans for a global economic forum?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#H00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":601,"content":"<p>The global economic forum will take place next November and plans are being put in place.

Six monthly updates on the progress of implementation will be published and, together with the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, I am looking forward to attending the first of these implementation meetings which takes place in Belfast on Friday.

With regard to shared spaces where it is safe for people to talk, I commend the Department on the work it is carrying out.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and we have done a lot of outreach work to Unionist, and republican and Nationalist areas.  However, there is no real structured element in regard to the House.  I feel a bit awkward that we deal with the North in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  There should be structures.  There is no structured group in the House meeting many of the communities we are funding.  Does the Minister have a view on that?

There is a lack of stability in knowing when it will have funding to continue certain programmes.

At that time it was very focused on providing facilities and supporting communities in the six Northern and six Southern Border counties to develop small enterprise units and so forth.  The emphasis of the fund has now moved to people programmes.  The programmes being introduced by the fund now, supported by the Irish and British Governments and other donors, have moved away from supporting communities and towards the development of facilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#H00700","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":607,"content":"<p>Has any cost-benefit analysis been undertaken by the Department in the context of the amount of money that is going into North-South development co-operation?

Since the fund was first established back in 1982, over &euro;44 million has been disbursed to approximately 2,000 projects.  It is important to stress that the International Fund for Ireland is focused on reconciliation rather than bricks and mortar.  The emphasis is on community relationships rather than community buildings.  That is very much evidenced by the improved climate in areas of polarisation in Belfast in particular but also throughout Northern Ireland.  I had the opportunity to visit a cross-community project in west Belfast a number of weeks ago.  I saw at first hand the type of work that is undertaken and the value for money therefrom.  Similarly, before the agreement was reached, I had the opportunity to visit a number of projects in east Belfast.  The level of funding to the reconciliation fund, at &euro;2.7 million for this year and last year, is in line with the letter of the Good Friday Agreement.  We cannot take for granted the huge amount of progress that has been made since the Good Friday Agreement, but obviously there is still important work to be done on the matter of reconciliation.  In that regard, as well as politicians and church leaders providing a lead role, there is also a really important role for civil society in shaping a more cohesive society in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that there are two funding rounds annually.  The closing date for the current round is 6 March 2015.  I often meet groups who would like to apply for funding but who do not have the information required to do so.  In that context, I repeat that the closing date for applications for the current round of funding is 6 March.  I would also like to make reference to the EU INTERREG IV programme, which should come on stream by mid-2015.  That will comprise a sum of &euro;300 million, which will ensure that many projects and programmes will be funded and will be in a position to make progress.  <\/p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Quinn's question about value for money, there is an ongoing process of ensuring accountability through auditing and making sure that moneys are being spent in a way that will bring communities together and that will involve the type of interaction that has proved impossible in the past.  We are satisfied, on the basis of the funding, that the programmes are inclusive and that progress is being made over a wide range of issues.  Often progress does not happen at the speed we would wish for, and some programmes do not produce the overnight dividends that are seen with certain other projects, but undoubtedly the funding that we provide plays a very important role in shaping a more reconciled society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#J00300","speaker":"1055"},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":609,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.

Most of the expenditure under this programme relates to Ireland's mandatory contributions to international organisations of which we are a member, including the United Nations, where the significant outturn relates to contributions to and support for peacekeeping operations.  As I mentioned earlier, making a prediction on the matter of payments for this programme, particularly with regard to UN peacekeeping operations, can be difficult.  Estimated costs are submitted, in some cases, 12 months in advance of when the payments might be finalised.  Oftentimes, new missions might arise in response to an emerging crisis, and, of course, there is also the uncertainty with regard to currency fluctuations and exchange rates.  All of the aforementioned factors can have an impact on the final outturn that will be due in any given year.<\/p>  <p>  A key pillar of our international engagement under programme D is our input into shaping the formulation of the European Union's common foreign, defence and security policy, most notably at the monthly meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, in which I participate.

We are giving &euro;4.6 million, a substantial sum of money, to the Palestinian Authority, which is notorious for its level of corruption.  That money comes mostly from Arab donors, for whom it is only a few barrels of oil.  I would like to hear what kind of sanctions the Minister has exercised.  I am familiar with what happened when money went missing in Uganda.  Has there been any follow-up on that?  Can we have a forensic scrutiny of that spend?<\/p>  <p>  It is not money that we have.  It is money that we are borrowing and that our children and our children's children may have to repay.  This is not cash that we are giving out through the generosity of our heart.

Is there any background to that?<\/p>  <p>  There has been mention of the Palestinian Authority.  Money has been set aside for Gaza.  I recently met people just back from there.  The place has been flattened.  There is very little activity going on there.  It is difficult for politicians to get in - one cannot get in through Egypt or through the Israeli checkpoints.  They are saying that there are issues with clean water, the price of gas, petrol, diesel, and electricity.  The place is just levelled.  They say they have never seen such frustration within the local population.  We have allocated funding for that particular area, but is there any idea where and when it will be spent and on what projects?  I presume one of the projects would relate to wells for water.  The people I was talking to said that when one has a shower it is salt water, but there is also a smell of sewage from it because they are pumping it directly from the sea.

As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I find everywhere I go that the contribution over a long number of years and the status of Ireland in this area are widely acknowledged and very much in evidence.  It is something of a clich&eacute; to say that we punch above our weight but the reality is that we enjoy a very high and widely acknowledged reputation over a range of issues.  I acknowledge everybody involved in the team and my predecessors over a number of years.<\/p>  <p>  I will deal briefly with the points at issue.  Deputy Crowe mentioned the reduction in funding for international organisations.  He is right but this is based on a prudent estimate of the needs this time last year which was not required to be met in the heel of the hunt.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Smith raised the very important issue of UN Security Council reform.  This is a difficult and challenging endeavour.  Negotiations on the reform of the UN Security Council and structures have been proceeding for the best part of two decades but, unfortunately, without a notable degree of success to date.  There are difficulties in the negotiating process and the bar to reaching agreement on reform of the Security Council is very high.  Any amendment to the UN charter would require a two thirds majority, and often times that is very difficult to achieve.  We will continue to play our part.  Ireland is a member of the recently established accountability, coherence and transparency group at the UN which was launched in New York in May 2013.  We will continue to make our contribution to aiming to improve the working methods of the Security Council.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Crowe mentioned business and human rights.  The consultation process is under way and public submissions have been invited.  We do not have a strict timeline as yet but I would be most anxious that positive progress would be made this year.  The plan will be developed through a process of consultation across a range of Departments and agencies.  It is important that we acknowledge the contribution of academics and civil society in general.  The human rights unit of the Department is acting as the co-ordinating body and responsibility for leading the consultation lies with that unit.  I am happy to say that there has already been an element of progress.  A very successful forum in early November focused solely on the theme of business and human rights.  The report of that meeting shows the very positive process in place.  I would be happy to keep the committee informed.  The forum served as an opportunity for business and civil society to set out their views as we formulate our plan.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Smith mentioned the very important issue of what Ireland is doing to promote the right to freedom of religion throughout the world.  This was a theme of the speech I had the opportunity, indeed the honour, of making to the UN General Assembly in September 2014.  The right to freedom of religion and belief remains a priority for Ireland as an active member of the Human Rights Council, and we will continue to have our voice heard in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#L00500","speaker":"1055"},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":621,"content":"<p>I apologise for coming and going and if the Minister has covered what I am going to raise.  In respect of business and human rights, those of us on the committee who have been abroad - I know Iran was mentioned - meet ambassadors and delegations from other countries.  There is never an issue with us bringing up human rights issues.  There seems to be a reluctance on the part of other Ministries.  It is almost a case of believing human rights are to do with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and do not involve any other Minister who is going abroad.  We are a voice on human rights and are well respected.  The Chairman played his part in getting us a role on the Human Rights Council.  Sometimes we are not aware of the extent of the respect felt for us and how much more we could do.  One of the points I made about the EU-Colombia agreement was that Irish companies must be to the fore when it comes to labour rights and relations.  They could lead by example.<\/p>  <p>  My other point concerns our commitment to overseas development aid.  We are at a certain level but have slipped down from what we had agreed.  Even though it is almost after the event, this meeting is a very good, open and transparent exercise.  I acknowledge the funding of the Irish section of AWEPA in respect of the joint monitoring teams, but this is about encouraging greater engagement with African parliaments on overseas development aid and development issues in order that it is transparent and they have the same opportunity we have here.  Would the Minister of State and Irish Aid consider allowing Irish Aid to make presentations at finance committees in our partner countries where a considerable amount of Irish aid goes in order that it is open and transparent and members of parliament and not just the government know where it is going?

The Constitution provides protection for the practice of all religions and respect for all religions whatever they may be, and respect for each other as well.  That is as it should be.  In the present turbulent climate a special effort should be made to encourage everybody not to ridicule each other's religion.  It is a very personal issue for many people and can be very emotive.  It is not necessary to in any way provoke a reaction from quarters where people might be sensitive to that.<\/p>  <p>  I have my religion and I respect other religions, and I know everybody in this Chamber does likewise.

There is an ongoing process and that is particularly acute in the matter of the Middle East.

It underlines our commitment to ensuring that we make our contribution towards a peaceful resolution to what is a very difficult circumstance.  I will have the opportunity to attend in coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has raised this issue in parliamentary questions and at this committee.  It is a very important issue in terms of business, trade, commerce and human rights.  I agree with her that it should not be left exclusively to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We make submissions to our ministerial colleagues across a range of Departments and we should continue to do so in a way that promotes human rights best practice throughout the world.  It should not be the exclusive role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Our national plan in terms of business and human rights will be important in that regard because we will have an opportunity of drawing from a number of stakeholders throughout society.  I believe this committee was represented at the forum.  If it was not represented in November, I am sure the forum would be very happy to hear the views of the committee as outlined by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and others.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that progress on the plan be formulated and agreed in early course.  Trade missions and human rights, as mentioned earlier by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, are important.  One of the most valuable assets any business, trading company or indeed country has is its reputation.  As I have said, we enjoy an enhanced reputation in the area of advancing human rights in jurisdictions where improvements in that area can and should be made.<\/p>  <p>  We know from our own economic experience that we have been working extremely hard to restore our own reputation in the context of our economic crisis.  However, we need to pursue actively and in a vigilant manner the human rights concerns we may have.  We need to take advantage of the most appropriate opportunities to make our case, in public on occasion and in private on occasion, occasionally through multilateral fora and occasionally on a bilateral level on a case-by-case basis.  I believe we do that to very god effect.  We discuss human rights on a regular basis with Ministers from other countries, including on trade missions.<\/p>  <p>  As I do not have a copy of the trade mission programme for this year with me, I am not in a position to give it to the Deputy, but I would be happy to do so afterwards.

Effectively, this is about promoting human rights and ensuring funding is focused on educational needs.

The Vote provides the funding necessary to deliver the Department's high-level goals to contribute to the reduction of global poverty and hunger, with a particular focus on sub-Saharan Africa.  We can be proud that against a background of great economic and budgetary challenge, the Government has largely managed to protect and stabilise the ODA budget over the past three years.  This is recognised as a significant achievement internationally.<\/p><p>This year, the Government has provided slightly in excess of &euro;600 million for official development assistance, a modest increase on the 2014 allocation.  Of that total, some &euro;476 million will be administered under Vote 27 and the remaining &euro;125 million is made up of contributions by other Departments and Ireland's share of the EU development co-operation budget.  The 2015 ODA allocation represents a significant contribution by Ireland to international development and is a clear demonstration of our commitment to the aid programme.<\/p><p>The Government remains firmly committed to building our aid programme and to the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP as ODA.  However, we can only make progress towards the target when economic circumstances allow.  Now that the economy has resumed a path to sustainable growth, I will set out the case for building further on our commitment during 2015.  Based on projected GNP figures for 2015, the expected ODA GNP percentage this year is likely to be approximately 0.4%.  This will ensure that Ireland remains one of the most significant donors internationally on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis.<\/p><p>On the policy and framework for action, our development co-operation programme, One World One Future, which is guided by our policy on international development, was approved and launched by the Government in 2013.  This policy clearly sets out our vision for a sustainable and just world and provides a solid basis for maximising the effectiveness and impact of Ireland's efforts.  Recently, we published a framework for action to guide the implementation of our policy, a copy of which I have here.  This framework will enable us to strengthen the effectiveness, accountability and impact of our work to measure performance and demonstrate accountability, and is the basis of our detailed operational plans for 2015.<\/p><p>As Deputies are aware, the OECD development assistance committee, DAC, published its positive peer review of Ireland's aid programme last month.  The review praises our aid programme, particularly its contribution to tackling hunger and poverty.  It highly commends Ireland on having a clear overall vision for development co-operation and on grounding policies in the needs and priorities of our partner countries, noting that partners &quot;value Ireland as an honest broker and a trusted and long-term partner&quot;.  <\/p>  <p>                 The review praised Ireland's commitment to delivering its development programme according to international best practices and principles for making aid more effective.  In particular, the review noted that Ireland consistently continues to punch above its weight - the committee will forgive me if the clich&eacute; is overused today - on humanitarian and resilience issues.  We are carefully reviewing the recommendations in the peer review report, which will assist us in continuing to improve the effectiveness of our development during 2015 and beyond.<\/p> <p> This year will be a critical year in the fight to end extreme poverty and hunger as we maximise progress under the millennium development goals and negotiate a new framework for international development post-2015.  The new framework will mark an important shift to sustainable development with clear and ambitious goals and targets universally applicable to all countries to end extreme poverty, hunger and malnutrition in a single generation.  Ireland is actively engaged at the United Nations in negotiating the new sustainable development goals.  Recently, the president of the UN General Assembly appointed Ireland and Kenya to co-facilitate the final international negotiations to agree the sustainable development goals at the United Nations over the coming year.  Universally, the challenge will be to build consensus among the member states on a broad and comprehensive agenda to be adopted at the major summit of world leaders in New York in September of this year.<\/p> <p> Other priority areas for 2015 include reviewing our engagement with the UN and other multilateral organisations to ensure their priorities are aligned with ours, and enhancing our economic links with African countries, particularly our key partner countries.  We will also continue to strengthen our systems across the programme to further improve management, accountability and transparency.<\/p> <p> Ireland's aid programme has often been praised internationally for its effectiveness, its sharp focus on poverty reduction and its commitment to tackling hunger.  Development co-operation is at the heart of our foreign policy.  Our key objective for 2015 is to continue to deliver a world-class programme aimed at some of the world's most vulnerable and marginalised people, helping to save lives and build livelihoods.  We appreciate the continued strong support and engagement of the committee, and I welcome any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#N00700","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":643,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, for his introductory remarks.  As he will be aware, we have ongoing engagement on a regular basis with non-governmental organisations.  I take the opportunity to compliment them on the excellent work they do, both from an advocacy point of view and through their personnel who are out at the coalface delivering services in difficult situations.  I read a commentary recently that stated that quite a number of member countries of the World Health Organization are concerned about the structure and workings of the WHO.  This arises particularly in the context of a much too slow and inadequate response to the Ebola outbreak.  I presume that Irish Aid is a donor to the World Health Organization.  Presumably, the Department of Health is the lead Department.  Perhaps the Minister of State would commend on the need to have a much more effective World Health Organization.<\/p>  <p>  I do not support tied aid.  However, one question that is continually put to us as public representatives is whether we could source at home more of the products that are needed in countries where we are generous contributors.  Some years ago, DIT Kevin Street was doing work on developing food products suitable for the dietary requirements of those in parts of Africa and conflict zones.  If we could source more Irish product, it would be a winner in getting across the message about the value of the Irish Aid programme from the point of view of both assisting the poorest in the world and creating employment at home.  Under no circumstances would I suggest the idea of tied aid.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State referred to the peer review of the development assistance committee of the OECD.  I recall that one of their recommendations was to strengthen mechanisms for identifying potential conflicts and resolving existing tensions.  In this respect, have the issues with regard to the first biennial report on Ireland's progress on policy coherence for development been agreed?  This is one of the matters that has been raised with me.  When is that likely to happen and when can we anticipate receipt of the first biennial report?<\/p>  <p>  The development assistance committee also recommended greater enabling of external stakeholders here in Ireland.  In particular, they recommended more regular dialogue with the interdepartmental committee on development, IDCD.  They recommended publishing the schedule of IDCD meetings, sharing advance notice of agendas for meetings and inviting submissions from external stakeholders on the work of that committee.<\/p>  <p>  I have two concluding questions.  How has the change in measurement by EUROSTAT of our gross domestic product, which was to our benefit in 2014, affected the calculation of the percentage of gross national income that we contribute in ODA, and has that generated a bigger gap between us and our desired 0.7% target than the earlier measurement?  The Minister of State mentioned that 2015 would be a landmark year in the global fight against poverty.  I believe that this would be an opportune time to signal to the international community the priority that we as a country will attach to trying to achieve the 0.7% target.  The third conference on financing for development is coming up in July.  Would Deputy Sherlock envisage the establishment or outlining of a roadmap for achieving the 0.7% target in advance of that conference?<\/p>  <p>  There is one other issue.  I do not know how the Minister of State interacts with other Departments on Ireland's proposals and legislative measures on climate change.  It is an area of significant importance in the part of the world we are trying to assist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#O00200","speaker":"970"},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":644,"content":"<p>Deputy Smith is a former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#O00300","speaker":"979"},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":645,"content":"<p>I am only asking.

It is amazing to think that, under the civil society and development education unit, a total of &euro;84 million will be going towards Irish and international NGOs.  The Irish will benefit from &euro;65.4 million allocated to predominately Irish NGOs.<\/p>  <p>  We pride ourselves as a committee in engaging in trade links, but we are conscious that human rights are always to the fore.  My question to the Minister of State is as follows.  In light of the vote today on the Colombia and Peru trade agreement, Ireland insisted in Europe on the incorporation of human rights labour clauses.  We were very much to the fore in having that accepted by Europe.  I note that in an American deal with Colombia, the Americans inserted a labour clause.  The only reason we are as familiar with Colombia today is not to do with the Colombia Three, but is to do with the fact that our NGOs on the ground could see societal activities that ran counter to their and our philosophy - in other words, the abuse of human rights.  How does the Department monitor cross-departmental activity?  Today's debate about Peru and Colombia was led by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, whose Minister is Deputy Richard Bruton.  <\/p>  <p>               Is there a disconnect between these international trade agreements, notwithstanding that built into them are substantial human rights conditions?  Is implementation of these European agreements in regard to human rights monitored?<\/p> <p> The lobbying by the NGOs today was to the effect that we should not sign the agreement.  We do not have any NGOs in Peru because nobody is telling us anything about it.  However, we are hearing about Colombia and the abuses that have occurred there in the past and about the peace talks currently taking place.  Given Ireland's role in the area of human rights how can we reassure the NGOs who ask us not to support the trade agreement that the situation is being monitored and that the Government is prepared to feedback information in this regard to the national parliament throughout whatever mechanism is available?  Is there available a mechanism through which feedback can be provided to this committee or the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation?<\/p> <p> We respect the NGOs and their opinions.  We know they witness human rights abuses.  While clauses on labour and human rights are built into the agreements how can we assure them that, for example, the dos Santos regime is implementing them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#O00600","speaker":"1030","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":649,"content":"<p>I ask Members to bear in mind that Colombia is not a programme country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#P00200","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":650,"content":"<p>I am asking about human rights issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#P00300","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":651,"content":"<p>That is a matter relevant to another Minister and not the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#P00400","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":652,"content":"<p>The big question arising in regard to Colombia is how the clauses built into an agreement are triggered when breaches occur.  The difficulty is that there is no mechanism within any of the agreements which render them null and void when breaches occur.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome that there has been no reduction in the gross allocation to overseas development aid, ODA.  I welcome also that only 6% of the total Vote is being allocated for administrative costs, which is relatively low by international standards.  I compliment the Department in that regard.  I note a slight increase in the provision for salaries.  There is supposed to be close monitoring of salaries and so on.  <\/p>  <p>  I note &euro;10.05 million is being allocated for bilateral assistance and spending, which is a 3% reduction, and an increase in multilateral spending to &euro;8.85 million, which is 31% increase.  Is there any significant reason for this large increase?  Many of us are of the view that bilateral assistance in the context of overseas development aid is the cornerstone of Irish Aid.  We are told partner countries like to work with Ireland because it is seen as a fair and critical partner with no colonial baggage and so on.  I am concerned that this is a policy shift.  The Minister of State might comment on that.<\/p>  <p>  Some &euro;600,000 is being provided to meet the cost of implementation of the Africa strategy.  Can the Minister of State confirm that Irish Aid will continue its work in this area?  I note &euro;1 million is provided for international emergency assistance.  I welcome the increase in that regard.  In regard to multilateral assistance, I am concerned that Ireland's anticipated contribution to the European Development Fund in 2015, when compared with the contribution for 2014, has significantly increased.  As stated earlier, it is easy to monitor bilateral aid.  However, when it comes to monitoring of multilateral aid money often goes astray, which a cause of concern.  Reference was made earlier to the Uganda situation.  The larger a programme the greater the likelihood of money going astray.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan referred earlier to the joint monitoring team in Tanzania.  The message from the MEPs with whom we have met is that they would like to know where the money is going.  That makes sense.  It also raises the profile in regard to the work we are doing.  It is important there is an awareness of Ireland's activities in terms of supporting particular countries and the sacrifices being made in this regard by the people in Ireland.  That makes sense all around.  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's response to the lack of oversight and transparency in regard to the European Development Fund, EDF.  The allocation for multilateral assistance includes spending of &euro;1.6 million in payments to support trade related capacity building initiatives within developing countries.  The concern in this regard is that again the focus is on trade.  <\/p>  <p>  Our job is to review expenditure.  We expect countries we are supporting to do this but, as a Parliament, we are not doing it.  However, that is a discussion for another day.  Perhaps it is the case that I am not familiar enough with the structures of the committee but would it be possible to hold additional private meetings during which the expenditure is outlined more fully to members such that we are confident enough to be able to go out and sell it.  That is important in the context of the support for ODA.   <\/p>  <p>  Despite current experiences in Ireland there is huge support for what we are doing internationally.  I commend the Department in that regard.  I have nothing but admiration for many of the programmes in this area.  The work done in the hospital in Tanzania was amazing.  We need to ensure there is in place a structure which enables us to feed ideas and concerns to those involved in foreign or European affairs or other groups travelling abroad.  That should be encouraged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#P00500","speaker":"1037"},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":653,"content":"<p>As stated, we provide &euro;10 million in aid to Palestine.

There were some projects that were being funded by Italy.  I was struck by the fact that we appear to be giving money to the same projects all of the time.  Is there any leeway in this regard for new groups and organisations?  Some of the people with whom I met were doing phenomenal work in the middle of very difficult situations, while getting on with their lives.  I have discussed this issue with the embassy in Ramallah but I wanted to take this opportunity to highlight it here today.<\/p>  <p>  While much of the focus in relation to Tanzania is on support for farming some of our partner countries have major coastlines.

In regard to the questions posed by Deputy Smith, as I understand it DAC praised Ireland for its work on policy coherence across Departments.  A wide range of Departments participated in the review.  Perhaps I missed something in the question articulated by the Deputy.  An interdepartmental committee on development, which I will chair, is to be established.  The task of that committee will be to build on the progress of the DAC review and to examine the new sustainable development goals.  <\/p>  <p>               We should examine the possibilities for further engagement between NGOs and the committee.  I have been at the Department for a relatively short time, and my experience so far has been that the relationship between Irish Aid, the Minister, Department officials and the NGO community is flexible and open.  There is very much an open door policy.<\/p> <p> A question was asked about the response to Ebola.  The Department of Health is the main funding Department to the WHO.  With regard to the Irish response to Ebola, given that Sierra Leone is one of our partner countries in which we have an embassy and embassy staff, we were able to influence, cajole, nudge and ensure the international response was robust.  There is a critique of whether the international response, through all of the international multilateral organisations, was quick enough, and the answer is patently \"No\", but if one kicked the tyres on the Irish response one would see it was robust and immediate.  The very weekend I was in Sierra Leone, after we had begun meetings with the President and various ministers in key departments, the UN mission was arriving, but we were already there on the ground.  This allowed us to state what needed to happen in the response by virtue of our experience of working with key partner organisations such as GOAL, Concern and Plan.  We knew exactly what needed to happen with regard to contact tracing and establishing phone banks so people could report in.  I would argue our abilities on the ground were without par.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#P00700","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":656,"content":"<p>As a significant player, would we not complain to the WHO about its totally inadequate response to the Ebola outbreak?

The danger of situations such as these is the mistakes are repeated.  I reassure the committee that not only were we very responsive and we influenced the international response, and great credit is due to our embassy staff, but we were also able to feed back into multilateral organisations, such as the EU, which is represented in Sierra Leone, the UN, WHO and other UN-affiliated organisations.  When I say Sierra Leone, I mean the three most affected countries in west Africa.  There is no doubt that we will use our experience to be able to influence future responses on issues such as Ebola should it arise again.<\/p><p>I wholeheartedly agree with the point made by Deputy Smith on tied aid, and I am in agreement with the Deputy on the idea of looking at potential procurement opportunities for Irish companies in order that they can build capacity, or at least they can be assisted.  The Department title includes the word &quot;trade&quot; and there is no contradiction in assisting Irish SMEs with their relationships to build capacity for procurement opportunities through multilateral organisations such as the UN World Food Programme, or seeking to open doors in order that they can bid competitively for services which might be provided internationally.  I hope this answers the question which has been posed.<\/p><p>The 0.7% target was set in 1973 - I was going to say as I recall but I was only a year old - and we should consider where Ireland was then.  We are talking about Ireland now and this programme.  The world has changed.  In monetary terms, we provided &euro;667 million in 2011, &euro;629 million in 2012, and &euro;637 million in 2013.  There has been a slight increase on the 2012 figure.  I take the point that one could contend that changes in GNP figures, which are the national accounting statistics, from the point of view of the EU or EUROSTAT, has probably made it look a little better than it is.  The Government is focused on stabilising it, which is what we did in the budget, and beginning to increase it, and staying focused on the 0.7% target.  Obviously this target is predicated on future economic growth and the economy growing sustainably.  We are still very mindful of this and we should not take our minds off the target.  We should very much keep the focus on it, particularly in light of the upcoming negotiations <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the sustainable development goals, in which Ireland will have a key part through the co-facilitation of talks.  I absolutely and utterly understand the point made, but we will try to increase the monetary value and create an impact.<\/p><p>On Deputy Crowe's point on bilateral and multilateral engagements, we have had to keep faith with our commitment to multilateral organisations, particularly the European Development Fund.  We have seen a monetary increase in total terms on the overall vote and package but with a slight decrease in Vote 27.  Overall the monetary terms have increased.  It speaks to the fact that while in percentage terms there has been a positive change of 0.3% between 2014 and 2015 and overall overseas development aid is increasing, Vote 27 has decreased slightly and we acknowledge this.  We still retain the commitment and we are increasing it in monetary terms.<\/p><p>There is no shift in policy.  I feel strongly that we are as good as the Irish Aid team we have, which I feel is excellent.  The Department has many experts in humanitarian development and development related specialists.  There is a strong sense of ensuring the relationship with the NGOs is strengthened.  If I had one thing to say, which is a personal viewpoint subject to a tyre-kicking exercise, we could foresee further collaboration between organisations and NGOs on key thematic areas in certain geographies.  It is an area I would like to examine further.  Concern, GOAL, Plan and Tr&oacute;caire are all excellent organisations, and there is no organisation which does not have excellence as part of its brief, but in certain geographical areas in which we are working, such as South Sudan or Ethiopia, with which we have a key partner country relationship, we could consider bedding down a greater degree of collaboration between organisations such as GOAL and Concern, which are already there giving humanitarian assistance and providing other programmes, to build a brand Ireland platform.  The Development Assistance Committee's report states the impact is very strong with regard to taxpayer funding and how the agencies work and deliver.  There is no shift in policy.  We need to have a good mix of multilateral and bilateral engagement.  Our bilateral engagement has become more successful because we have very strong ambassadorial teams in the key partner countries.  We also have very strong NGOs, and there is a seamless relationship between the two.  All of the members of the committee and I have seen this at first hand through various visits to the key partner countries.<\/p><p>I am not concerned about transparency.  <\/p>  <p>               The Ugandan example and the systems that have been put in place since then allow us to ensure that there is an effective approach and a clear managerial line in relation to how we look at the programmes and the impact that they are delivering.  If one looks at the key partner countries, because we have embassies there, we have embassy teams.  The teams interact with government officials if the programme is being delivered at a governmental level, and they interact with NGOs if the programme is being delivered at NGO level.  I am confident that there is a robust mechanism to ensure transparency in how the funding is delivered, but sometimes it is very hard to put a metric on it.  When I was Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation, I saw how metrics could be used.  One could put a euro in at one end and one would know the impact in terms of intellectual property or if a job was created.  However, it is very difficult to measure the number of lives one assists in a process such as we are discussing because aid is more nebulous, but one can see the effect when on is on the ground.  When one meets workers from GOAL or Concern, one can see the number of people they feed every day.  That is sustaining life, but with development programmes, for example, sustainable agriculture programmes in places such as Tigray, one can see farmers and know that because of programmes supported by Irish Aid through the NGOs, not alone are they sustaining life and limb but they are also layering education and other benefits.<\/p> <p> Deputy Crowe referred to the example of fistula and the work we are doing through the fistula hospital.  There are further opportunities in terms of using the research infrastructure or knowledge we have to assist in garnering greater information in geographies such as Tigray which is part of a country with in excess of 90 million people.  We must examine how we can work with people on the ground to get better statistics or to provide good maternal health programmes for women and to encourage them to go to community centres to deliver babies in a healthy space.  Such an approach will ensure that we help Ethiopia to wipe out this problem once and for all.  That is a key area on which we support action.<\/p> <p> In response to Deputy Eric Byrne&rsquo;s question, one has international agreements through multilateral organisations such as the UN.  He should forgive me if I have missed the point he made or the question he asked.  The Government, through our ambassadorial teams in Geneva and New York, has a monitoring system of the human rights elements and the labour clauses and we are a constituent part of the UN organisations themselves.  I refer to the UN High Commission for Refugees, for example.  There is a monitoring element in that regard.<\/p> <p> I will speak from my experience of dealing with the key partner countries we fund in sub-Saharan Africa and Vietnam.  The framework for action is an excellent document, if I do say so myself, in terms of the work the people within the Department have done.  There are high level outcomes.  Three goals have been set out.  The first is reduced hunger and stronger resilience.  The second is sustainable development and inclusive economic growth and then one has better government, human rights and accountability.  Ten outcomes are listed which I will not go into now.  Underpinning that are key results areas that one expects.  Everything we do has a monitoring effect.  Our staff and people in the key partner countries are clued into the policy.  If I am representing the Government in an engagement with the president of the Tigrayan region and, for example, we are supporting a programme in Tigray, it means that we must ensure that any programme we support measures up to the goals we have set ourselves on issues such as human rights.  There is a mechanism in place.<\/p> <p> One could take an approach to human rights to the effect that we are pulling the plug on the money if a country does not do X.  Our foreign policy must be predicated on the idea that one deepens relationships and builds capacity, for example, from the point of view of education in order that an educated population grows up and has a better chance.  We take a long-term view of what we do.  There is no better example of engagement at bilateral level than when on a recent visit to China the President had to deliver a very nuanced message about what needs to be done from a human rights point of view.  One takes opportunities like that while building up and deepening the relationships.  There is a diplomacy to it, if one likes.  I hope I have answered the questions adequately.  Please let me know if I have not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOS2015012800002#Q00500","speaker":"979","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":661,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution and for being so direct with us.

I have a short opening statement, after which I will be happy to take questions from the members.<\/p><p>The combined Estimates for defence and Army pensions for 2015 provides for gross expenditure of &euro;898 million, of which &euro;677 million will be spent on defence and &euro;221 million on Army pensions.  Over 73% of the defence Vote goes towards providing pay and allowances, while the remaining allocation provides mainly for the replacement and maintenance of essential equipment and operational costs.<\/p><p>To allow the Defence Forces to deliver effectively on their outputs and undertake the tasks laid down by Government at home and overseas, an adequately resourced Permanent Defence Force, PDF, is required.  In this regard, the 2015 defence pay and allowances allocation of some &euro;496 million will provide for a PDF strength of up to 9,500.  In addition, it will provide for the pay and allowances of some 625 civilian employees, 350 civil servants, 18 chaplains and 14 Army nurses.  Targeted recruitment was undertaken in 2014 and will continue in 2015.  In total, there was an overall intake of 416 PDF personnel in 2014.  This represented a substantial employment opportunity for people interested in a military career.  On the equipment front, the main investment this year will be on the naval vessel replacement programme, together with the necessary acquisition of a range of defensive equipment.<\/p><p>Last summer, as part of the naval vessel replacement programme, an order was placed with Babcock Marine for the third offshore patrol vessel for the Naval Service.  By taking up this option under the existing contract, the Department ensured that the third ship will be bought at 2012 prices and will not be index linked.  The first of the two ships, the <i>LE Samuel Beckett<\/i>, was handed over at the end of April 2014.  <\/p>  <p>               The second ship, <i>LE James Joyce,<\/i>is scheduled for delivery in March 2015 and will replace the <i>LE Aoife,<\/i>which is being decommissioned.  The acquisition of three new and modern vessels not only adds efficiency, operational value and durability to the Naval Service, but also represents excellent value for money, as all purchases were made from within existing allocations without recourse to any additional funding.  The 2015 provision will also allow for the continued modernisation and improvement of defensive equipment, which will maintain and enhance the capacity of the Defence Forces to deliver effective services across all of the roles assigned by government.<br\/><br\/>The year 2015 will see Ireland continue its long standing commitment to overseas missions.  At the end of 2014, Ireland had 427 personnel serving in 11 different missions throughout the world.  These missions embrace a range of activities, including conflict resolution, peacekeeping, humanitarian missions, crisis management and strengthening international security.  Currently, the two largest contingents are serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL,  with 199 personnel and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, in the Golan Heights, with 138 personnel.  I will give the committee a briefing shortly on what is happening with UNIFIL currently.  Unfortunately, there have been some unwelcome developments there this morning.Last December on my visit to the Middle East, I met with troops serving with UNIFIL in Lebanon, with UNDOF in Syria and with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation, UNTSO, in Israel and I observed at first hand the invaluable role all these troops play within very challenging environments.<br\/><br\/>The 2015 Estimates allocation will facilitate the continued provision of a military operational response to both the civilian power and civil authorities, as required.  This is a broad, multifaceted role which is of vital importance to national security.  Examples of the type of duties undertaken include, explosive ordnance disposal duties, air ambulance duties, naval boardings and prisoner escorts.<br\/><br\/>The Reserve Defence Force has also experienced significant organisational reform in recent years.  One of the key outcomes emerging from the value for money review of the reserve is the introduction of the new single force concept, an initiative which means we now have Army units with permanent and reserve components rather than having a separate stand alone reserve.  In addition, a campaign is underway to recruit further members to the Army reserve and Naval Service reserve in order to reach target strength levels.  In that context, some 26,000 training man days are provided for in the Estimates for 2015.<br\/><br\/>The Defence Vote also makes provision for certain costs related to the Civil Defence.  Civil Defence continues to develop its role of providing supports to the front-line emergency services and in 2014 was actively involved in supporting hundreds of community events across the country.  Civil Defence volunteers throughout the country continue to provide support to both front-line services and local communities in responding to emergencies.  In that regard, I am delighted to say that Dublin Civil Defence, assisted by Civil Defence units from other counties, is supporting the efforts of Dublin City Council in helping to deal with the homelessness and street-sleeping issue.  Working alongside professional carers contracted by the city council, a 20-bed temporary hostel was opened at Dublin Civil Defence headquarters at its premises on Wolfe Tone Quay, which will operate each day throughout the winter months.<br\/><br\/>In conjunction with the Civil Defence response to homelessness, accommodation in St Bricin's military base has been made available to Dublin City Council for use as part of its homeless service strategy.  Homelessness is a complex topic and there is no quick-fix or easy solution.  However, I am delighted that the Defence sector has been in a position to provide some level of meaningful security, support and service to the individuals affected.<br\/><br\/>The 2015 Estimate makes provision for expenditure of &euro;18.5 million on new building works and maintenance of existing buildings and also includes funding for work on the military archives building at Cathal Brugha Barracks.  The Government is supportive of the decade of centenaries commemoration projects and has made funds available, over the period 2014 to 2016, to improve access to the facilities at the military archives building.  The first two tranches of material from the Military Service Pensions Collection were made available online last year and further material from this historic collection will be released over the coming years.<br\/><br\/>I would now like to turn to the Army pensions Vote.  This Vote funds the payment of military pension benefits of all categories, including retirement pensions and gratuities, disability pensions, spouses' and children's pensions and other miscellaneous expenditure related to the processing of entitlements under the Defence Forces pensions code.  The gross allocation for 2015 is some &euro;221 million, over 95% of which relates to the superannuation benefits of former members of the Defence Forces and their dependants.  Expenditure under this Vote is primarily non-discretionary and demand-driven.  There are currently some 12,000 pensioners paid by my Department from this Vote, a net increase of 1,000 since 2007.<br\/><br\/>Finally, I would like to refer to the forthcoming White Paper on Defence.  The White Paper will provide the defence policy framework for the next decade and beyond.  Defence policy is a critical aspect of Government policy and I am determined to ensure that the new White Paper addresses in full the defence response to future security challenges and related resource requirements in a comprehensive way.  The preparation of the new White Paper must take into account an assessment of the future security environment and the roles and tasks that we wish the Defence Forces to undertake.  The economic environment and the level of resourcing available must also be factored into consideration.  This is a fundamental requirement in order to ensure a sustainable defence policy.<br\/><br\/>Working groups, comprising civil and military representatives, are considering future operational demands and the defence capabilities required to meet projected future operational requirements.  This work will inform recommendations regarding defence provision.  I have received an initial draft outline of the White Paper and this will be further developed and refined over the coming months.  The final draft of the White Paper will be submitted to the Government in due course.  I expect I will be looking for Government approval mid summer.I now commend both Estimates to the committee and look forward to dealing with any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015012800002#A00500","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015012800002#B00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I wish to add some comments for the benefit of the few members present, who I am sure are concerned about media reports they have been receiving this morning regarding what is happening in southern Lebanon.  There has been no official UNIFIL statement yet, but I understand that starting at about 11 a.m. Irish time this morning, there was quite significant activity in an area called the Shaaba Farms, on the eastern side of southern Lebanon, quite close to the Golan Heights.  Six rockets were fired from the eastern sector of southern Lebanon, from a town called Ghajar.  Subsequently, a rocket was fired at an Israeli Defence Force convoy and afterwards, a further five rockets were fired into Israel from the Shaaba Farms area.  I am told Israel has retaliated and responded to that by firing 123 rounds of heavy artillery into the area.  There is no official information in regard to casualties or injuries, but all we know is that it looks as if one peacekeeper has lost his life.<\/p>  <p>  It has not been officially confirmed by UNIFIL that it was a Spanish soldier, but this is the area the Spanish control, so in all likelihood it is a Spanish soldier.  As a country that is contributing significant troops to that UNIFIL mission, I wish to express my condolences to the Spanish troops in the area and to the Spanish Government.  <\/p>  <p>               This is not what we want to see happening in southern Lebanon.  The suspicion is that it was in retaliation for a targeted strike last week on the Golan Heights when a Hezbollah commander was killed, but we do not know this for sure.  This is a reminder of the dangerous, difficult and unstable environment in which our troops are operating, both on the Golan Heights and in southern Lebanon, where we have a significant presence in both UN missions.  I am happy to report that our troops are about 30 km away from where this incident happened.  In military speak, they were \"in ground hog\" this morning when this was happening, in other words, they were taking cover.  Nobody was injured and everybody has been accounted for.  There has not been any activity in the area where our troops are, but 30 km is not a great distance and, unfortunately, it looks as if there has been a fatality in the Spanish unit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015012800002#B00300","speaker":"991","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":676,"content":"<p>We are discussing the Estimates, but I will allow a brief comment on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015012800002#C00200","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":677,"content":"<p>To give a further update, I received a telephone call about half an hour ago.

As there are now 350, the number has almost halved.  This figure can be compared to that for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in which there were 4,500 staff, but that number is now down to about 3,300.  Defence and Agriculture, Food and the Marine are two of the Departments in which staff numbers have been reduced significantly.  Overall, numbers across the public sector are down by more than 10% in the past four years, resulting in an expenditure saving of well over &euro;3 billion.  There has been significant change in terms of a reduction in numbers and expenditure, but if a certain line is crossed, the capacity of a Department to do its job is fundamentally undermined.  In having 350 staff, I do not regard the Department of Defence to be overstaffed.  We have a significant job to do, not least on the White Paper in the next few months, but there are multiple other tasks the Department must perform to ensure it is run smoothly in terms of the Defence Forces and policy and legislation.  I understand the committee will soon deal with legislation from the Department.

Many countries have different approaches in getting Ministers and Prime Ministers - in our case the Taoiseach - to where they need to be.  We have changed the approach to the use of the Government jet.  No Minister can use it without getting the permission of the Taoiseach.  Ministers travel on commercial airlines for most of the travel they need to undertake.  It is only in exceptional circumstances that the jet is used.  There are certain times when it is necessary, but most of the time Ministers use commercial airlines.  Since last summer we have been operating with one shorter range jet which does not have the capacity to engage in transatlantic travel.  We will work away on that basis for the foreseeable future.

It would have happened the odd time such as for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations when there would have been Ministers all over the world.

In particular, she is conscious of the advantages that flow from a three-person body.<\/p>  <p>  In that context, the underlying rationale for the establishment of the three-person model was to facilitate expertise and experiences across a range of sectors.  It was also considered to be of practical advantage that at least one commissioner would always be available to direct staff operations.  The Minister is aware that at an operational level, GSOC views this as a significant advantage given its unpredictable working environment.  Some of its most serious and sensitive cases have arisen at weekends or during holiday periods.  Moreover, a three-person commission with a legally required gender balance and range of expertise conveys a strong public assurance that fairness and sensitivity are at the core of GSOC's approach at the highest level.  It also helps that potential differences between an individual commissioner and key interlocutors do not impinge on the smooth and effective running of the organisation.  It is accepted that until recently, the interactions between GSOC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have not functioned as effectively as they should but substantial work is currently ongoing in this area by both organisations.  Finally, additional powers are in the process of being conferred on GSOC under the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  In these circumstances, the Minister is reluctant to alter the current GSOC structure unless it can be shown that significant advantage would accrue from doing so.  Deputy O'Brien will appreciate that serious consideration has been given to the amendment and the recommendations of the joint committee but I hope the Deputy will be in a position to withdraw his amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2015012800002#K00800","speaker":"985"},{"type":"speech","time":1422455400,"counter":799,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

It is fair to say that GSOC's independence and ability to operate are hindered when it cannot hold to account the head of the organisation which it is charged with overseeing to the same extent of other members.  If GSOC is to be seen to be totally independent, the Garda Commissioner, as head of the Garda, should be subject to the same level of scrutiny as every other member of the force.  The amendment excludes national security issues from such oversight, which I think people would accept.  The legislation gives powers to the Minister to direct GSOC to investigate certain activities of the Garda Commissioner, which raises the prospect of political interference by a Minister or Government.

He is correct in the first instance that the core function of GSOC is to investigate complaints made against the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As things stand, however, GSOC cannot investigate a complaint made against the Garda Commissioner.  Section 7 of this Bill changes the position by inserting a new section into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to bring for the first time - it is important, Chairman, to emphasise this very significant change - that for the first time the Garda Commissioner will be brought within the remit of GSOC.  In addition, section 10 of the Bill amends section 106 of the 2005 Act to allow GSOC to examine, of its own volition, any practice, policy or procedure of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purpose of preventing any complaints arising in respect of those practices, policies or procedures.  The Minister believes the changes provided for in sections 7 and 10 are important and will significantly enhance the capacity of GSOC to carry out its functions.<\/p>  <p>  The effect of the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment is to include among the functions of GSOC a requirement to hold the Garda Commissioner responsible, in her capacity as the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but not in her capacity as head of national security, for the operations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Minister is not sure if this was intended on the part of Deputy Collins, but one of the consequences of his amendment would be to make the Commissioner generally responsible to GSOC for policing matters even though such matters fall outside the functional and operational remit of GSOC.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, Deputies will be aware that the Minister has published the general scheme for the establishment of the proposed independent policing authority, which, among other things, will be charged with providing oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of the provision of policing services.  The Minister believes that this is the approach that should be adopted, and the establishment of the policing authority is a major element of the Government programme of criminal justice reform.  The scheme has been the subject of scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and the Bill is being prepared on a priority basis.

This contrasts with the amendment, which allows for up to 30 days for material to be provided.  I believe all agree on the requirement for things to happen as quickly as possible, but the formulation in the Bill, rather than a specific timeframe, is preferable because it recognises that from time to time, there will be instances in which the information cannot be obtained - within 30 days in this instance - or whatever the specific timeframe.  The Minister is aware there have been situations in which the amount of time taken to supply information or material to GSOC has been unacceptable.  There have perhaps been too many times when this has happened, but she has considered the position carefully and is satisfied that the new provision as drafted is sufficient to ensure that GSOC will be able to obtain any necessary information in a timeframe that is appropriate to the individual complexities and specifications of whatever case might arise.

The LCDP provided significant, and in many circumstances core, funding for projects funded through the community co-operative.  It was announced by the Department at the beginning of 2014 that SICAP would be put out for competitive tender as part of public procurement under EU law.  This is the first time a social inclusion programme has been subject to a public procurement process rather than the traditional grant approach in Ireland.  The tender process has taken place over two stages.  Expressions of interest were sought in July 2014 and successful applicants were invited to tender.  The deadline for that tender was 19 December 2014 with a decision expected on or around 18 February 2015.<\/p>  <p>  I will refer to some of our experiences as part of this process but only in general terms as it is still ongoing and I do not want to be seen to be trying to influence the outcome in any way.  Ultimately, It is our contention that the competitive tendering of SICAP and other programmes with a social benefit is not in the best interests of citizens for three main reasons.  It will undermine and potentially eradicate community development and local community projects; it will result in a deterioration of services, particularly to the disadvantaged; and it does not adhere to the spirit of the EU directives and the European debate.  We are concerned that the best placed organisations for developing and delivering social inclusion work may not be best placed at winning tenders.  Our expertise lies in the delivery of relevant and responsive services and we may not be as adept as some private companies in commercial tendering.  Some of these companies have entire units dedicated to developing contracts of this kind.  There is also an assumption that using competitive tendering will automatically deliver the best value for money.  This is not necessarily the case.  When assessing value for money on programmes like this, it is necessary to look at a range of non-financial and social capital benefits that community-led organisations can offer.  Community-led groups do not make a profit for shareholders.  Our aim is to provide services and supports to the communities where we work. <\/p>  <p>  Tendering processes are complex, often benefit larger organisations and potentially advantage private sector operators.  This is due to the often large-scale nature of contracts awarded and the fact that tenders may be required to fund cashflow to a much greater extent than under grant-based services.  Some organisations are unable to make applications due to the restrictions and complexities that apply.  Community-led organisations often cannot meet those criteria and can therefore be excluded from even participating in the competitive tender before it starts.  For example, in stage one of SICAP, applicants must meet certain financial and resource requirements which exclude many groups.  For the purposes of SICAP, the country was divided into lots according to local authority areas.  In the Dublin lot, it was necessary to have a turnover of between &euro;1.25 million and &euro;1.5 million which automatically excluded a vast number of groups.  The groups in the co-operative would not have been able to apply for SICAP individually.  The short timeframe for applying to stage one also hindered the development of partnerships and consortium bids that smaller organisations need.  We had an advantage in the inner city because we have a long history of working together and we were able to come together quite quickly to form the co-operative and therefore tender.  However, this was not the case with other groups such as Travellers' groups, women's groups and projects in the islands.  They were not able to fit into the structure being presented to them.  The process was administratively heavy and time-consuming.  We were trying to submit a tender for SICAP but at the same time in respect of these smaller organisations, some of which have only two or three staff, we are trying to meet our obligations to deliver the services and meet our obligations to our funders.  All of this is happening at a time when we are being asked to cut back on administrative budgets and resources.<\/p>  <p>  We utilise a range of approaches to meet the needs of the most disadvantaged.  These are methods that generally do not exist in the private or public sector, namely, the ability to provide responsive and tailored services that use a person-centred approach.  We are innovative in service design and delivery, flexible in our approach and able to respond to new and emerging needs.  An example of this relates to head shops.  It was the community that first identified the danger around head shops and that was able to organise and bring the issue to our public representatives.  There is a strong value for money focus in what we do as we continue to strive to deliver services, despite the vast reduction in funding we have received.  We involve our users and beneficiaries in service design and control of services.  Underpinning all of this are an ethos and a commitment to social justice, equality, tackling exclusion and empowerment.  If disadvantaged communities do not receive services that are delivered in this way, they will ultimately lose out.<\/p>  <p>  Inevitably in completing a tender, work is tailored to meet the criteria of the tender, but these criteria are not necessarily developed with the community's needs in mind as it was not involved in developing them.  SICAP contains no reference to homelessness despite it being a significant issue in our communities and an issue of which members of the committee are aware.  Further down the road, in conjunction with the local community development committees, we could add the homeless as a target group.  We are looking at the end of this year and the beginning of 2016, so in the interim, our hands are tied and there is nothing we can do on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  The Department will argue that we were consulted about SICAP.  In respect of that consultation, we were invited to a two-hour meeting in the Department where somebody actually read the programme to us.  We then had about 20 minutes in smaller discussion groups and a brief question and answer session.  Following that, we were invited to complete a questionnaire with questions on the programme.  I need to point out that we were being asked to comment on a programme that was already written.  At no point were we engaged in the actual development of that programme.<\/p>  <p>  It is our contention that it is not good public policy to put social inclusion programmes out to public tender as these services are for the public benefit and not for private profit.  Ms McCarthy will talk about the new EU directives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015012800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sian Muldowney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422460800,"counter":958,"content":"<p>I am not a legal expert.  If anyone has had a look at an EU directive, they can see that it is 200 pages of fairly complex documentation.  We have done a bit of research on it and, at times, we feel that you are bamboozled by this information and are almost afraid to challenge it because you do not know exactly what you are talking about.  At the same time, we are aware that there has been an extensive debate at European level which has argued that social services that benefit the public good such as social inclusion programmes were not to be put through tender processes.  This has been the tenor of the debate at European level over recent years.  The free market economy they are aiming for is not inclusive of that type of social service provision.  The Council of Ministers of the European Union adopted three new directives on procurement in February 2014 which must come into Irish law by April 2016.  The directives provide for a range of clauses and features relating to how public tendering for services like social inclusion programmes is to be handled.<\/p>  <p>  I know the committee received a response from the Department on some of the issues we raised in our petition.  The Department said that it had got legal advice from the Attorney General and it had to do this in respect of the directive which is currently the law.  The Department is right in that this directive is law.  However, that directive applies when the choice to go to public tender has been made.  It does not make you go to public tender.  The fact that the Department chose to go to tender means that those directive rules apply, but the Department did not have to go to tender.<\/p>  <p>  Our argument is that the point is twofold - to tender or not to tender.  We would argue that social inclusion programmes should not be put out to public tender.  If it is felt that they must be put out to tender, they should go on the basis of the new directives which allow for particular clauses to be put in place to ensure the protection of good quality social inclusion programmes for citizens.  Although those directives are not currently law, there is no reason they cannot be transposed into law earlier than the deadline of April 2016.  There is an argument that this current programme was put out to tender when the Department knew the new directives were there because they were published in February 2014.  The first call came later.  Is it really good practice to operate on the basis of a legal situation that is going to change in 14 months time?  I would argue that this is not the case.  <\/p>  <p>         The current directive has existed since 2004.  During that time there has been a range of social inclusion programmes, none of which has gone out to public tender, including the one we are currently operating, the local community development programme.  It seems an unusual decision that this one was chosen.  As I am sure everyone is aware, the Leader programme is not being put out to public tender, and there are a lot of similarities between it and the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.<\/p> <p> Now that we have managed to get the committee to listen to us, we are asking it to support the principle that social inclusion programmes remain funded through a grant-based system and not put out to tender, as allowed for in the new directives.  We ask that it be allowed to exclude these programmes.  That would be adhering both to the spirit of the EU debate and to the law.  We are also asking that the committee seek for the tendering of SICAP to be halted until such a time as the new directives can be transposed into Irish law, and for the committee to recommend that they be transposed as soon as possible.  We are asking the committee to ask the Department to explain its decision on putting SICAP out to tender.  When we ask about this we keep being told it was the Attorney General's advice and the Department cannot give us that advice.  We are concerned that the advice relates to the specifics of tendering as opposed to the decision to go to tendering.<\/p> <p> There have been examples throughout Europe of social inclusion projects, or projects aimed at dealing with those most disadvantaged in the labour market, that have gone to public tender.  Overall, the results have been disastrous and more expensive.  In the UK, there has been a lot of research and reports - we provided documentation on one of them - about how work-related programmes had the least benefit for those furthest away from the labour market, and how it was no cheaper for the State to provide them in that way.<\/p> <p> I thank the committee members for their time and for listening to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015012800002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Deirdre McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422460800,"counter":960,"content":"<p>I am aware of some of the groups in my own area of the south inner city.

I am curious about the rationale behind this because it is just bizarre, absurd and shocking as far as I can see.  It is bad enough wanting to privatise water and housing let alone privatise community and voluntary services that provide services to approximately 2 million people a year, according to one of the reports.  Community and voluntary groups that get a pittance provide services to 2 million of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people in the country and now they want to privatise it.  That is just beyond any sort of belief.  I am trying to get my head around it because I am not easily shocked about the privatisation agenda but I was pretty shocked when I heard that.  <\/p>  <p>               My reaction was to ask how they were planning to make money out of it.  I can see how they might try to make money out of it and whatever else they want to sell off and privatise, but who is going to benefit?  <\/p> <p> I agree with the argument that communities and services will suffer.  The entire idea of community and voluntary work will suffer, if it is not eliminated completely.  I still do not fully understand the agenda behind it.  On the face of it, it strikes me as privatisation and neoliberalism gone completely bonkers.  The only commercial interests that I can think of that will benefit are private companies linked with an agenda of dragooning people into labour activation schemes.  The mindset is that all of these schemes are a waste of time and run by hippy left-wingers who should be replaced by people who can get tough with disadvantaged communities by dragging them into labour activation schemes.  There is no understanding that the schemes support people with serious problems who need the support of caring human beings.  Do the delegates think there is a deeper logic to these proposals?  Perhaps they might speak about the experience in the United Kingdom where this has already happened to some extent.  If I fully understand what they said, we are even more gung-ho in this bizarre neoliberal privatisation experiment than the European Union.  Normally the Union pushes us in that direction, but in this case it is pulling back from privatising these services, whereas the Government is pushing forward.

That is one of the strongest points for me.  I must declare an interest in that I was elected as a community director to the Inishowen partnership in Donegal in 1996.  From the get go, the model involved directly elected people from the community and a bottom-up approach.  The model across Ireland is something we have been very proud of and it was held up as a template but it is now being destroyed using the very people who held it up as a template.  It is the words of the witnesses, who are on the front line, that the work they have done could potentially be destroyed.

It is up to &euro;2 million in total and, in Dublin, up to &euro;700,000 across all of the partnership groups.  Perhaps the witnesses can elaborate on whether this is true.  Local Deputies attended the Cherry Orchard Equine Centre in Ballyfermot to train young people in horseriding skills, looking after horses and stabling skills.  Different groups have different sources of funding and this has come out of the blue.  They say they will lose all of their current funding from one stream because, in the past, they used the money for administration purposes. Under the rules of SICAP they cannot submit an application if they are using more than 25% of the morning money for funding administration.  They cannot apply for money for this year.  They will have to negotiate with all of the other funders, juggle money around and move the administration costs.  It was easy to decide that certain money would cover the administration costs and other money would cover the rest of the programme.  If people get money from the HSE, they cannot decide to change it and put it in somewhere else because of the evaluation and monitoring.  In the recent past, every grant must be spent exactly as it is described.  Ten or 15 years ago, there was more constructive moving of funds within projects to help develop programmes.  Once people did that, they then applied for interim funding and mainstream funding.  This seems to be more rigid.  When I had discussions with this group, some of it went over my head even though I am on the Local Community and Development Programme, LCDP, and I have been involved in taskforces.  There were a lot of acronyms but there was no logic behind it.<\/p>  <p>  Is the cut I mentioned viewed as a cost saving measure?  Do some people view it as such?  Then it will come on top of a whole range of cuts that Brian Harvey showed, in his detailed report, that the community sectors had been cut to the bone above all sectors in society.  Even if funding for the group was standing still without SICAP, would it substantially cut the community programmes?<\/p>  <p>  Representatives of the Canal Communities Partnership, who will hopefully meet local Deputies on Friday, were concerned about the loss of expertise.  In the Bluebell area, the witnesses probably know Mr. Tommy Coombes, who is a dynamo.  Every community should have someone like him - a person who runs around organising everything.  Ms Rita Fagan is also well known by many.  Their concern is that they may not get their jobs under the new arrangement but they are also concerned that, even if they get the jobs, it will be substantially different.  For example, Tommy will work in Bluebell one day and will be sent to the other end of the partnership area the next day.  Some of the tenders in Dublin can apply to two partnership areas.<\/p>  <p>  The witnesses mentioned that they do not have a partnership area at the moment but in my constituency the Rathmines Pembroke partnership area covers Crumlin, Drimnagh and Walkinstown.  The original partnership collapsed.  If that area was amalgamated with the witnesses' partnership area or with Ballyfermot, it would be a huge area, with almost half the city covered by one structure.  There will be a loss of identity if it proceeds like that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015012800002#H00200","speaker":"1028"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422460800,"counter":1044,"content":"<p>With regard to funding, I cannot think of the figures off the top of my head but the SICAP budget took a cut within the budget.  Dublin has received a disproportionate cut compared to the rest of the country and the inner city has received a disproportionate cut compared to Dublin.  We took a 38% cut in funding from March to December.  In addition, in December we were informed that our first-quarter funding was cut by an additional 6.5%.  It comes back to smaller organisations.  If we win the tender and the funding remains at 38%, the vast majority of projects in the co-operative will have to close their doors.  We will not be able to keep going.  It is a catch-22 situation about how to proceed.<\/p>  <p>  The administrative issue is a massive problem.  It comes back to why tendering is bad for small groups.  There used to be some leeway within the LCDP to allow people to spend a certain percentage of funding on administrative work.  The way the new programme works, one is either in administration or not.  I am a co-ordinator of a local community project and I do a lot of development work but I am also responsible for the administration.  Under the new programme, I can no longer do both but must be either one or the other.  That will have a massive consequence on small programmes because we do everything.  That is how we keep the doors open.  We wash, we clean, we paint, we run development work and we do administration.  Within the co-operative, we are nowhere near 25% for most organisations.  We did not receive enough in funding to be able to have a major administrative budget.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to a loss of expertise.  I know Mr. Tommy Coombes and Ms Rita Fagan, who are excellent voices for their communities.  It refers to the non-financial value we referred to earlier.  Decades of experience and knowledge has built up within communities and all of that will be lost.  It is a unique way of being able to work and to know what works within communities.  The approach that one size fits all does not work.  What works in inner-city Dublin will not work in west Cork.  There are different ways of doing things and private companies will not care about adapting their work in that way.  That is not what they are about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015012800002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Sian Muldowney"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422460800,"counter":1045,"content":"<p>With regard to the administrative point, we are crucified by the way they wanted us to do it previously.

I am delighted and indeed honoured to have been asked by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, and the Government to become chairperson of RTE.<\/p> <p>  One of the reasons I was attracted to the role was the way in which my experience as a former chair and a member of a range of boards, as a creative producer, as a business director and entrepreneur, as a developer of new work across all media, and, most of all, as an avid RTE consumer now reflects the range of skills necessary to be useful in the broadcast space.<\/p><p>It is no longer sufficient to think of the various aspects of the media industries - radio, television and digital - as separate, because now each piece of the media jigsaw is closely connected to the others in a kind of ecology where changes to one will have an immediate impact on the others.  This is the media landscape that the rise of digital technology has brought us and all media must now consider how they are to filter and be filtered through the online space.  This also means that, more than ever, RTE must remain central to Irish life and public discourse.  Precisely because it holds such a unique position, what it does, how it does it and the framing of its future are important to all of us.<\/p><p> As per the committee's invitation, I am happy to discuss how I plan to approach my role and to set out my initial thoughts on the key challenges facing RTE.  I will also outline some thoughts on the broader creative and cultural sector of which RTE is a key part, both as one of its largest employers of creative talent and as an important commissioner and producer of creative output.<\/p><p> The Broadcasting Act 2009 sets out across a number of articles the role of the RTE Board.  As one would expect, the board has a key oversight role in approving strategy and budgets.  It has a role in respect of the quality of output, performance commitments and ensuring efficiency and effectiveness.  The board must safeguard the independence of the organisation from State, political and commercial interests.  Perhaps most crucially of all, its role is to represent the interests of the audience.  Possibly more than any other organisation, RTE plays a key role in helping to shape the Irish public's perception of their place in the world.  As the national broadcaster, RTE must first and foremost aim to connect with, be relevant to and be trusted by the Irish people.<\/p><p> As the committee knows, the new board is not yet complete.  The committee's nominees have not yet joined, but will do so in February.  Overall, we have the mix and range of exceptional experience and skill sets among the new board members - those already appointed and those who will join shortly - to be highly effective.  I am conscious that RTE engages in a broad range of activities in pursuit of its public service objects.  The board must and will consider the whole of what RTE does and its overarching responsibilities as it considers changes, strategies and initiatives from management.  I am convinced that the role of the board is at all times to provide guidance and support to management where possible and to challenge when appropriate.<\/p><p> Central to all of our deliberations and engagements will be audiences.  Representing the interests of viewers and listeners is our first responsibility.  In the committee's work, members will have seen that audiences and audience behaviour are changing rapidly.  Enabled by new technology and much faster connectivity, people can access programming and content from anywhere in the world on their telephones, tablets, computers and televisions.<\/p><p> Audiences are not uniform, though.  People of different ages and in different locations are doing different things.  Some are adapting to new technologies quickly whereas others are moving at a much slower pace.  Audience habits also vary significantly by genre, with live consumption of radio and television programming such as news, sport and major entertainment shows remaining the dominant trend.  The role of the board is to represent the interests of all of these audience types.  The board already has an example of how we are doing this with the decision before Christmas to slow down the speed of the transition of RTE Radio 1 from long wave radio transmission to digital services.<\/p><p> Understanding changes in audience behaviour and making use of a variety of data sources on how audiences are changing are essential for any media organisation today.  It is perhaps even more important for public service media, which is obliged to meet the needs of all audiences across the range of its services.  This does not mean programming being driven solely by statistical numbers and audience ratings.  RTE's mission is much broader than that.  However, it does mean making decisions informed by an analysis of the patterns in audience and industry trends.  The sophisticated use of data in this way allows a body like RTE to illustrate clearly the impact it is having on economic and social capital.<\/p><p> Just as new digital technology is changing audience habits, so too is it challenging the business models and strategies of traditional media companies.  My initial observation is that RTE, through the launch of numerous digital services in recent years, has largely managed to keep pace with changing technology.  In some regards, such as the recently launched GAAGO product or RTE News Now, RTE has been a real innovator in the market.<\/p><p> I am conscious that, regarding news in particular, changing technology is having the greatest impact of all.  While television bulletins continue to retain large audiences, particularly in the evening, people are increasingly getting their news on mobile devices from digital news services.  News is one of the key pillars in the creation of a national identity and the board must ensure that a full overview of the events central to Irish life, locally and globally, is freely available to all at key moments in the day.  The drive to an online presence has two key components, namely, the provision of anywhere, anytime access for the audience and the creation of high-quality, platform-neutral content that can be adapted to suit the relevant broadcast medium.<\/p><p> Given the explosion in services and providers in the past ten years and the apparent dominance of externally produced content, particularly from the USA, the role of RTE in framing and representing the culture of Ireland becomes even more important.  This does not mean developing a representation of Irish culture that is essentialist or monolithic.  The cultural framing offered by RTE should reflect the diversity of our national identity and strive to place Ireland in a global context.  It does not involve seeing externally created programmes as some form of cultural imperialism, but viewing the best of it as a marker for the creation of RTE programming and content that can compete and represent Ireland on external platforms across the globe.<\/p><p> This is a field in which I have some experience.  All good cultural content comes through a process of appropriation of the best.  This will involve collaboration with willing partners in other states.  If RTE does not do this, no one else will.  \"Love\/Hate\" illustrates what is possible, as indeed does Radio 1's \"Documentary on One\", which is recognised as one the best radio documentary strands anywhere in the world.<\/p><p> Although I worked inside RTE for a period, for the past 20 years or so I have been a producer in the cultural and media area.  In that time, I have had the opportunity to observe RTE from the outside.  Like many people in the creative sector, I have had my frustrations with RTE, but more than anything I came to understand the importance of the relationship between it and the wider creative industries.  While much public debate often revolves around RTE's news and current affairs programming, within the creative sector RTE's role is essential.  In the global economy's most difficult years, the creative industries have comprised one of the few growth areas, showing at 10% three times the growth of any other industry and, in the UK context, creating &pound;8.8 million per hour for the economy.  In the Irish context, the growth rate has been averaging at approximately 3% each year since 2003.<\/p><p> RTE is the sector's largest direct employer as well as commissioner of independent television productions.  It provides crucial opportunities for actors, writers and other creative professionals to supplement their work in theatre and film.  It is also the country's largest employer of musicians.  When RTE focuses on and supports cultural events, for example, culture night, the national ploughing championships or the BT Young Scientist &amp;amp; Technology Exhibition, it helps to drive audiences, enthusiasm and energy to those events.<\/p><p> The creative sector in Ireland has critical co-dependencies.  For example, RTE needs a thriving independent production sector if it is to produce creative, challenging and high-quality programming.  The independent sector needs RTE as the key commissioner, funder and broadcaster of Irish-made programming.<\/p><p> One way into this debate is through a report produced for the UK Government by Mr. Will Hutton of the Work Foundation, entitled \"Staying Ahead: The economic performance of the UK's creative industries\".  Even though this was produced in 2007, it is still relevant.<\/p><p>This seminal document outlines the importance of the creative industries to the economy while examining the most successful creative industries and companies.  It illustrates the stages by which creative expression becomes economic product, a process at which RTE must be the centre.<\/p><p> As with many other sectors, the recession has been hugely damaging to the whole creative sector in Ireland.  Public funding and commercial income in the cultural sector has fallen substantially over the past five years.  RTE's funding position, and subsequent capacity to invest in the broader creative sector, has been hugely diminished.  While RTE has reduced its costs to adjust for huge falls in commercial income and public funding, these cost reductions have rippled through the entire creative sector.  RTE's investment in the independent television sector, for example, has reduced from over &euro;75 million in 2008 to under &euro;40 million in 2013, mirroring similar large reductions in inhouse production.  In television drama, a key area of employment in the sector, RTE's total spend has halved over the same period.<\/p><p> RTE has the capacity to be a key engine for growth in the Irish creative sector.  To achieve this potential RTE needs much more certainty on its funding, public funding in particular.  By way of starting a dialogue there are questions we both need to ask, such as what is happening with the public service media charge?  Why has Ireland one of the most inefficient and ineffective licence fee systems of anywhere in western Europe?  Why is it acceptable that over &euro;30 million is lost every year to licence fee evasion when the sector as a whole is crying out for investment, and our culture is increasingly being diluted with more and more UK and US programming? <\/p><p> I hope that over the course of my time as chair of RTE some of these questions can be addressed.  I thank the Chairman for the time and I am more than happy to answer any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012800002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Moya Doherty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422437400,"counter":1098,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Doherty for a full overview of her role.

Before discussing issues I always start by asking chairpersons designate a standard question.  Is or has Ms Doherty ever been a member of a political party?   <\/p> <p>   RTE is faced with a number of issues.  Ms Doherty has mentioned licence fees and that 83% goes to RTE and 17% goes elsewhere.  The first question independent broadcasters will ask in any discussion of licence fees is whether RTE gives value for money in terms of the methods and costs involved in producing programmes.  Any major RTE programme always has a raft of producers, sub-producers and researchers but independent broadcasters do not seem to use the same amount of people.  Is Ms Doherty satisfied, as chairperson, that everything has been looked at in terms of the cost base for programme production in RTE?<\/p> <p>  In terms of recent controversies, a huge question hangs over some of the current affairs programmes.  In particular, allegations were made against innocent people in the programmes.  Also, during the presidential election, RTE could not source a tweet.  RTE sat in front of this committee and told us it could not source the tweet but every five or six-year old child can do it within seconds.  It is incredible that the State broadcaster could not do the same.  <\/p> <p>  I wish to discuss a number of other issues.  I come from a rural constituency.  Some people say that a weather crisis in Dublin always makes headlines on RTE.  Ms Doherty spoke about creative arts and the talent in the country.  Is she satisfied that RTE looks at the nation as a whole in regard to broadcasting, media coverage and what is out there?  There is a perception, rightly, that it is a matter of Dublin versus the rest of the country in terms of RTE.  One must challenge that situation.  There is a huge amount of talent that needs to be harnessed.  We must ensure that the State broadcaster represents all of the country.  That is one of things that I ask her to look at and to challenge.  <\/p> <p>  Another issue that constantly arises is the major salaries paid by RTE.  How is that justified?  The figures are mentioned on a daily and weekly basis.  Are they justifiable at this stage?  Over the years it has been constantly said that RTE had to pay the  salaries because if it did not individuals would go to another media outlet or whatever.  I am certain there is plenty of talent available to replace them.  One of my criticisms of RTE is that it did not bring in new people at all levels in order to make sure it did not have an over-reliance on one or two individuals.  That being said, there is a pile of positives within RTE.  Over the years it has done a massive service to the State.<\/p> <p>  There is an issue about licence fees for the State broadcaster.  Ms Doherty spoke about evasion and so forth.  Recently there have been reports on the evasion issue.  In terms of the new broadcasting charge and everything else, is the chairperson of the board prepared to satisfy the Irish people's request that RTE provides value for money?  I may mention a few more of these issues later.<\/p> <p>  I wish Ms Doherty well as chairperson and the committee looks forward to discussions with her over the years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012800002#H00500","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422437400,"counter":1102,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Moynihan.  I can easily answer the Deputy's first question.  I am not nor have I ever been a member of a political party.<\/p> <p>  Sometimes it is easy to overlook what RTE does.<\/p><p>The Deputy asked about value for money.  There are always ways to generate new efficiencies.  RTE has had a number of independent reports done and the most recent one, the NewERA report, will be published soon.  RTE has had to cut its costs dramatically over the past four or five years.  It has reduced its costs by 30% and has reduced its staff levels by 500 and it is now down to 1,800 staff.  Its operating costs have been reduced by &euro;130 million.<\/p><p> As an independent broadcaster, I have experience of making programmes on tight budgets.  I also have experience of being within RTE and making programmes, albeit at a very different time.  The money being spent on content now in RTE is being very tightly spent.  It is managing it well from what I have seen and from what has been delivered to me, to date, since I went in there.<\/p><p> The rural constituent comes up regularly.  I asked the management if it had any numbers on hours of broadcast for rural programming.  It is quite difficult to get those statistics because within any news bulletin, one could have 30% or 40% from the regions or one might have 10%.  However, RTE has a very high regional profile and we must not forget that RTE, through its licence fee and the Irish people, funds Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta which delivers enormously to rural communities.  What RTE has done with the ploughing championships has been enormous as has what it has done with the Rose of Tralee, the young scientist competition and the all-Ireland school choir competition.<\/p><p> There is always room for improvement in everything.  I hope that every day I, in my role as chair, and the RTE board will ask those questions and that we will, I hope, get the answers that satisfy us.  On the current situation, RTE has had a very painful history, both for it and the Irish people.  It has put an entire system in place.  When my new board is in place, we will see the head of news and current affairs and we will, as a board, ask the questions the Deputy asked but from the answers I have received already from management in RTE, there are strong editorial markers and pillars in place to ensure those mistakes do not occur again.<\/p><p> If one looks at the programming RTE delivered prior to Christmas, \"Inside Bungalow 3\" made probably the most harrowing viewing I have ever seen as a viewer.  That programme, on behalf of RTE and the Irish people, secured a huge audience of 690,000 people, so there is much that is good within RTE.  It does very good work across news and current affairs.  \"The Late Late Toy Show\" had an audience of more than 1 million.  That audience spread is a national spread.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012800002#H00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Moya Doherty","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422437400,"counter":1104,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Doherty for her presentation and wish her the very best.

RTE is independent but there is much public discourse currently in regard to media monopolies or an over-dominance by key players within the broader media.  I am not just talking about broadcasting.

In regard to his first question on media monopolies, RTE is very heavily regulated.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland - some of my colleagues from the authority are in this room today - regulates RTE along with the Department, so I think we are well covered to ensure we remain independent.<\/p> <p>  In regard to development of new talent, I have worked in this sector all my life and I know how precarious it is.  I admire those who exist in an area of the creative industries where there is no pension and no security of employment, where they must travel to where the work is and where the contracts are short.  The role of the board will be to ensure training.  Training is hugely important and perhaps when the economy was so poor, there was no funding for training.  I hope that now, RTE will be able to put training systems in place for new talent to come through the system, because it takes time.  One must learn the skills of presenting, of making television programmes and of editing.  If one can work alongside the experienced, then one will learn more quickly.  I hope training will be part of what I will look at as chair of the board of RTE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012800002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Moya Doherty"},{"type":"speech","time":1422437400,"counter":1108,"content":"<p>I congratulate Ms Doherty and wish her well in her role.  I concur with a much of what she said about RTE, including the many positive aspects of public service broadcasting.<\/p> <p>  The concept of accountability has entered the public arena recently.  Members of the Oireachtas have rightly to be accountable for the public's money, including our salaries and expenses.  Yet, RTE seems to work in an environment where it is okay to take somebody on and provide their salary details in three years' time.  Does Ms Doherty think that is acceptable in the current economic climate?  As chairperson of the board, will she do anything to redress it?  I may be wrong but some recent media commentary concerned one individual who said - to paraphrase him - that he would leave the country if Deputy Enda Kenny ever became Taoiseach.  He is due back on the airwaves in RTE soon, yet his salary will not be disclosed for three years.  I wonder if Ms Doherty is comfortable with that, in her role as chairperson.<\/p> <p>  Previous speakers mentioned the independence of the broadcaster free of commercial interests.  Is Ms Doherty satisfied that this is the case?  For instance, if a bank were to sponsor a current affairs programme, does she think there could be a suggestion of a lack of independence in that context, where a programme is being sponsored by somebody who might be perceived to have a vested interest?  Given that RTE receives over 80% of the licence fee, which accounts for over &euro;170 million, is there a need for commercial enterprises to sponsor current affairs programmes where opinion is being formulated?<\/p> <p>  Deputy Moynihan alluded to serious gaffes that occurred in RTE, particularly in the run-up to the presidential election.  How satisfied is Ms Doherty that this has been fixed?  Recently I have been listening more attentively to current affairs programmes, particularly at the weekend, and balance is something that I am always conscious of.  In her role as chairperson, would Ms Doherty find two Opposition spokespersons and one Government spokesperson on a major prime time Saturday afternoon current affairs radio programme as being balanced?  Or would she find two Government spokespersons and one Opposition spokesperson balanced?  <\/p> <p>  There has been a tendency, certainly in the recent past, whereby balance has been thrown out the window.  How does Ms Doherty feel that marries with the concept of RTE being a public service broadcaster while drawing down 80% of the licence fee?  <\/p> <p>  It is important not to fix something that is not broken.  At one stage, I asked the RTE director general about the old concept of \"Questions and Answers\" in current affairs programming.  Since John Bowman left RTE television, there has not been a \"Questions and Answers\" type of programme.  He was able to weed out the political plants in the audience.  Sometimes when one turns on programmes such as \"The Frontline\", \"Prime Time\" with an audience, there are as many plants in the audience as one would see in a garden centre.  They are anything but fair and balanced, whether to the Government or Opposition.  I wonder why the old format of \"Questions and Answers\" had to be done away with.  Why can it not be brought back?  If it is not broken, do not fix it.<\/p> <p>  Many of our constituents are asking why \"Winning Streak\" has been ditched.  The audience for that slot went from a little over 400,000 down to 200,000 in one week.  In terms of the licence fee and public service broadcasting, how does Ms Doherty react to that collapse of viewing figures in the space of seven days?<\/p> <p>  RTE's 2FM is in competition with commercial radio stations across the country.  We have seen the JNLR figures time and again, which show that the commercial stations are certainly struggling.  Is there a plan to do anything differently there or will it continue as it is?  With 80% of the television licence going into a protected environment that is also able to carry commercial advertisements, local radio stations feel they are in competition with 2FM which is protected and insulated, but nothing seems to be happening to correct that situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012800002#K00100","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1422437400,"counter":1109,"content":"<p>There is a long list of questions there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012800002#K00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422437400,"counter":1110,"content":"<p>It is a long list.

It deals with some news issues.<\/p> <p>  With regard to accountability, as a board we would want to ensure absolute independence.  As I said earlier in my address, our first and foremost responsibility is to the audience.  As a former producer or editor of any programming, it is difficult to pick out individual programmes and decide why RTE as an editor would have dropped them, or not.  There has to be an element of calculated risk when one is making television programming.<\/p> <p>  As regards retaining formats that work, it is RTE's and the editorial staff's right to change.  There are arguments about keeping what works and changing.  Certainly, if something is failing desperately, the RTE management will look closely at it.  The board, and I as chairperson, will be asking questions as to why that is happening. <\/p> <p>  The Deputy referred to \"Questions and Answers\" and \"Winning Streak\".  Every time RTE changes or closes something there is an outcry because sometimes the audience does not like change; they like familiarity.  That probably shows the relationship RTE has with its audience nationally - it is that familiarity of being the heritage broadcaster.<\/p> <p>  I would like to think that we have strong current affairs editors in place where balance is hugely important.  One may listen to a programme across two hours, but the view has to be taken across 24 hours or a week.

She is an outstanding choice who has developed phenomenal experience and displayed fantastic skills over her career.  I can only believe these will be of immense benefit to the national broadcaster.  She is taking over the helm of a wonderful organisation with a wonderful history and a very strong reputation.  It does outstanding work, but it will be faced with significant challenges and issues in the future, particularly around competition for the private sector.  As a very strong advocate of public service broadcasting, I have my own concerns about that.  With the changing nature of broadcasting and how people source content, the challenges are great.  Ms Doherty's skills and experience will be required to guide the organisation through that time.  Given that Ms Doherty is still chairperson designate, I intend only to flag some issues and do not expect her to comment in any great detail.  I would suggest she will need to be mindful of these issues as she takes on the role.  <\/p> <p>  RTE has come through a difficult patch in recent years and has handled the situation very well in spite of what had happened.  We do not need to get into the idiosyncrasies of how that came about.  The management team is very strong and both Noel Curran and Kevin Bakhurst have shown great dynamism in leading the change that was necessary.  That is not to take from any of the people who were already there.  We have a wonderful pool of talented, highly-committed people who work very hard to deliver on public service broadcasting because clearly they believe in it.<\/p> <p>  There are some issues I would flag at this time.  I do not intend to get caught up in the salaries issue.  There is a media issue I would prefer to raise.  The media have got to hold us to account, that is their job.  There is the media and journalistic aspect of RTE and then there is the back-end management, which has to be done separately.  It is very clear that we are on an election footing.  I have no doubt that RTE believes absolutely in balance and will attempt in so far as is humanly possible to deliver on that.  However, issues do arise.  I am sure they can arise for all political parties, but the different parties will raise their own concerns.  The concern I would raise is balance.<\/p> <p>  There seem to be some magazine or feature-style programmes which stray on occasion - perhaps on more occasions than one might want - into the area of politics because politics is part of rural and urban life, regardless.  I often think that balance does not exist there or that people are less acutely aware of it, because those programmes fall outside the typical news and current affairs area.  I would flag that as something for Ms Doherty to keep an eye on.  I find RTE's news output to be exceptionally well balanced, but I have questions about some of its current affairs coverage.  In that regard \"Prime Time\" has improved greatly although it has a way to go.  <\/p> <p>  The first week of the new Claire Byrne show was excellent and I would have said last Monday night's programme was also excellent, only that I happen to be aware there was nothing pre-arranged to balance out the programme.  There was a head-to-head debate between the leaders of two of the main political parties but it seems no series has been organised involving Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael.  That is fine - things like that will happen in the course of events, but the Taoiseach tends not to engage in debate, so that leaves one party out of the mix.  Care has to be taken as we enter this phase of the electoral cycle that there is a robust platform in place to ensure there is absolute balance, and that RTE does not move ahead with one part until it is sure it can do the entire series.  That is a comment, not something I want to get hung up on because I respect and recognise the difficulties in trying to ensure that everybody is looked after. <\/p> <p>  I wish Ms Doherty well.  She has some considerable challenges in dealing with the outside world.  I know she has the capacity to do it and that it is well within her grasp and that of her management team to drive RTE into the next century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012800002#L00300","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speech","time":1422437400,"counter":1123,"content":"<p>I wish Ms Doherty well in her new role and do not doubt she has the capability, competence and experience to fulfil it in a very meaningful way.  Along with a number of other people in different positions, I have a bee in my bonnet which, hopefully, will be addressed with a new broom and a new board.  Something I think Ms Doherty and the RTE board should seriously examine is the failure to give an opportunity to Irish musicians across the airwaves.<\/p> <p>  I am very strongly supportive of the concept of public service broadcasting and am a strong advocate of it, but I have to say there has been a huge failure in this regard.  Notwithstanding the great PR replies that come from RTE - it sent me a reply with four pages, it was a model of PR - musicians do not complain unless there is a legitimate reason.  There would be thousands of jobs in the morning if they got proper advocacy, opportunity and fair play.  There are 8,000 jobs.  Ms Doherty knows this as well as anybody.  This is coming from people like Johnny Duhan, Steven Travers and all those people at the coal-face.  It is a huge industry and RTE is not playing its role.  It is easier for the camel to get through the eye of a needle than for certain acts to get on RTE.  I have evidence of that.  <\/p> <p>  I know six brothers, the Willoughby brothers in County Wicklow.  It is so unusual to get six brothers talking, let alone singing and all of them well-trained singers.  They happen to be all-Ireland handballers as well and they reflect everything that is in the culture.  They have made numerous efforts to get on RTE but it is the same old faces that come out.  <\/p> <p>  Ireland exists outside of the Pale, outside of the outer rim of Dublin.  There is a heartland there, which most of us in this room represent.  There are people like Mike Denver, Jason Travers, Nathan Carter, Derek Ryan, Michael English, Robert Mizzell and Johnny Brady, who are all doing very well.  They are bringing the people back into the ballrooms, despite not getting decent air-play on RTE, not because of it.  People are paying for their albums and paying for the music and employing people.  These musicians are a major employer.  <\/p> <p>  The BBC gives opportunities for new acts to get on the scene.  France has a quota system.  I know the broadcasting authority and will be putting this question to it.  I want to know if Ms Doherty will support the idea of a quota system.  Our music is part of our culture.  I am not talking about any particular genre - it stretches from U2, The Coronas, The Script, right through to Mary Black, Christy Moore and then to Carter and the country and western scene.  I believe it has been denied exposure.  When we were growing up we listened to programmes in the evenings that reflected all that.  Now that has been wiped.  I know Ronan Collins and John Credon play a bit and Kieran Hanrahan is good for the traditional music on a Saturday night but that is all.  <\/p> <p>  Does Ms Doherty realise that over a quarter of a million people attend the Fleadh?  U2 would not get that in the Phoenix Park, and it is part of what we are.  Will RTE grab the ball here and start changing its outlook?  It should give those people a fair chance.  Further, will it meet representatives of the music industry rather than saying it provides a small slot in its scheduling to address this issue.  As I said before in the D&aacute;il, even if there was a quota system, could it work here?  There is no use in having Kylie Minogue coming over to the Windmill Lane studios recording something and then declaring that what she has done is Irish.  Kylie Minogue is then played and the output comes from Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  The people who are on the coal face, tramping the highways and byways of Ireland, are the people I want to see given an opportunity in RTE.  It is our biggest broadcaster.  I support paying the licence fee but I want to see everybody given a level playing field.  It is no use playing somebody who is just coming in, recording here and then saying it is Irish.  It is only a bit of an Irish production, which will satisfy output requirements but no more than that.<\/p><p> The approach I advocate works in France.  Everybody has this idea that it does not work.  I know that when the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland introduces licences that target specific audiences, there is a condition that a certain percentage of the output must be Irish.  There is no use in trotting out the same old excuse.  I have researched this matter.  Would Ms Doherty support the introduction of a quota system that would ensure Irish artists get an opportunity?  I have been given an assurance that if RTE played such a role, it would generate 8,000 jobs, not just in large urban centres but right across the rural areas that most of us represent.  We can imagine the excitement that would result from those jobs.<\/p><p> I would like to make a final point before I conclude.  The Chairman is more familiar than anyone here with the activities of people like Paul Claffey and Gerry Glennon at Ireland West Music Television because its studios are located in his local area.  It broadcasts five hours of Irish music on channel 266 every night.  An hour of Irish music is also available on channel 191 every night.  Why can RTE not do that?  Why is it just left to these channels?  People like Paul Claffey and Gerry Glennon have done a great job of getting out all these artists, who will confirm that such publicity gets people to follow them and pay through the door, which creates employment for doormen, salesmen, recording artists, studios and transport companies, etc.  I ask officials from RTE to meet representatives of these organisations to hear at first hand what they have to say, rather than dismissing them with a cursory wave of the hand.  I have been subject to such treatment in recent months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012800002#L00400","speaker":"1063","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422437400,"counter":1125,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Penrose for his contribution, which was well put.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012800002#M00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422437400,"counter":1126,"content":"<p>I am singing from the same hymn sheet as Deputy Penrose.

As a founding director and vice-chair of the Centre for Cross-Border Studies in Armagh, I played an active role in promoting North-South co-operation for more than a decade.  I was also a founding member and chairman of the North-South standing committee on teacher education, which was established under the Good Friday Agreement.<br\/><br\/>As a historian, I have taught, researched and published on modern Irish history, emigration and the Irish diaspora.  I have lectured widely in Ireland, Britain, the United States and Australia.  My publications include works on Parnell, de Valera, emigration, Irish culture and nationalism.  I was a founding director of the Parnell summer school and am currently the chair of the Parnell Society.  I am a member of the Irish universities historians committee on the decade of commemoration.  I have been editor and chair of the editorial board of <i>Studia Hibernica<\/i>, the Irish studies journal, and have served on the board of a number of other journals.  As an educationalist, I have been involved in the promotion of blended learning and digital technologies in teaching.  I played a leading role in the establishment of TeachNet, the online community for teachers, and served as its chair for many years.  As an honorary life member of the Irish Association of Teachers in Special Education, I have an ongoing interest in access and disability issues.  I have had experience of industrial relations and trade union affairs in a number of capacities.  As the Chairman mentioned, in recent months I have been acting as mediator in the dispute on junior certificate reform, at the request of the secondary teacher unions and the Minister for Education and Skills.<br\/><br\/>I am honoured to have been nominated to chair the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  The authority has an able chief executive officer and experienced staff who have responsibility for operational matters.  I look forward to working constructively with them.  I also look forward to working with the new board, which will have an appropriate balance of skills and experience for the fulfilment of its mandate.<\/p><p>The duties of the chair and of the board are clearly outlined in Part 2 of the Broadcasting Act 2009.  The role of the board is focused on governance, policy and strategy; the role of the chair is to manage the board.  I would like to acknowledge the work of Bob Collins and the outgoing board in establishing new structures, introducing key policies and regulating and promoting the sector<br\/><br\/>I have a deep commitment to public service and a long-standing interest in the educational and historical dimensions of broadcasting.  In October 1958, Edward R. Morrow, the doyen of broadcast journalists said in regard to television, &quot;This instrument can teach, it can illuminate; yes, and it can even inspire.  But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends.  Otherwise it is only wires and lights in a box&quot;.  Morrow was speaking to radio and TV directors.  His speech was a challenge to broadcasters to fulfil the potential of t<b>h<\/b>e broadcasting medium.  That challenge remains as relevant today as it was 60 years ago.  If anything, with dramatic social change in Ireland and the impact of globalisation and new technology, it is even more so.  A healthy, vibrant democratic Republic is in part dependant on a healthy, vibrant and diverse broadcasting sector.<br\/><br\/>The BAI has an important strategic as well as a regulatory function.  The outgoing board has adopted a strategic plan for the years 2014-16, which I enthusiastically endorse.  My role is to ensure that this strategic plan is implemented. <b><\/b>That strategy focuses on serving the needs of Irish society and ensuring that viewers and listeners have access to a diverse range of broadcasting voices and services.  The underlying core values include protection of the public interest; fairness and proportionality; independence and impartiality; professionalism and commitment to learning; accountability, transparency and cost-effectiveness; and cultural and linguistic diversity.  The overall vision is that the BAI should be trusted by the public, by broadcasters and by legislators to service the viewing and listening needs of Irish society.<br\/><br\/>Inevitably there will be significant challenges in implementing this strategy.  Internally the authority contains two statutory committees &ndash; contract awards committee and compliance committee &ndash; each with its own remit prescribed by the Act.  Mindful of the independence of these committees, it is my responsibility to ensure that the board as a whole works together as a strong, cohesive organisation.<br\/><br\/>If the authority is to be a trusted and informed voice on broadcasting and other media matters, it will need to engage more with the public and with other stakeholders.  In fulfilling its regulatory brief, it will need to be adaptable and reduce unnecessary bureaucratic and administrative burdens, both on those who make programmes and on those who view or listen to them.  Following extensive consultation the authority has developed a series of codes for the guidance of programme-makers, including the code of fairness and impartiality and, most recently, the code of programme standards and the BAI access rules which were launched yesterday.  I welcome the access rules, in particular, as they address in an incremental way, with a view to enhancing their enjoyment of programmes, the needs of those who are deaf or who have a hearing impairment or those who are blind or partially sighted.  The code of programme standards to be observed by programme-makers is also an important and timely landmark.  In ensuring that such rules and codes are fair and appropriate, the authority will need to ensure a balance between viewer and listener expectation and the wider global media market where lesser regulation may exist.<br\/><br\/>The authority&rsquo;s overall strategy is predicated on ensuring the strength of public, commercial and community broadcasting sectors in the face of a challenging financial environment and significant external competition.  The BAI is committed to maintaining a strong, public service broadcaster while at the same time vindicating the requirement for accountability and transparency in the use of public funds.<br\/><br\/>The authority will continue to encourage and support high quality programmes through the Sound and Vision scheme which is having a significant cumulative impact.  More than &euro;70 million has been allocated under this scheme over the past five years.  Notable recent examples of programmes supported under the scheme are, &quot;One Million Dubliners&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Red Rock&quot;, &quot;The Guarantee&quot;, &quot;Corp agus Anam&quot; and &quot;Song of the Sea&quot;.  The latter, which has recently been nominated for an Oscar, received &euro;500,000 support from the Sound and Vision scheme.  The authority will continue to support learning and development initiatives which build expertise locally and enhance the quality and diversity of programming.<br\/><br\/>The broadcasting environment is changing and challenging.  The difficult economic context, diminishing advertising revenue, increased competition, particularly from abroad, new technology and media, all inhibit initiative and development.  However, the paradoxical pattern of ever-increasing choice and diminishing quality, is not inevitable.  Ed Morrow threw down the gauntlet to broadcasters and regulators in his day.  He challenged them to ensure that TV and radio educated, illuminated and inspired because otherwise, it was just wires and lights in a box.  We should not hesitate to embrace Morrow&rsquo;s challenge while reshaping it for an Irish context.  To that end, I look forward to working with the board, the broadcasters, the Minister, the Department and the members of this committee.

Before we deal with the subject matter of the meeting I wish him well in finding a resolution to the important issue of the general certificate.<\/p> <p>  I also wish Dr. Tavers well in his position as chairperson designate of the BAI.  He will be facing challenges in that role when one considers the changes in the broadcasting sector such as new platforms and his role will be to ensure that there is a fair and equitable broadcasting system for the country.  The committee has just spoken to the chairperson designate of RTE.  There is a concern that some of the broadcasters do not give a fair and due recognition to people outside the Pale or to their concerns and issues.  In my view it takes significant effort or the emergence of a big issue before any recognition is provided.  There is a need to adjust the balance between the Pale and the rest of Ireland.  We need a balance in broadcasting to reflect all of society and every issue in society.  In so far as possible, Dr. Travers should ensure that there is value for money for public funding being provided to all sectors of the media.<\/p> <p>  I refer to independent broadcasters, many of whom are under serious financial pressure.  I ask him to comment on the provisions of the Broadcasting Act.  The independent broadcasters are providing a community or a social form of media - that may not be the correct term - but what I am trying to say is that they are providing a very valid resource for communities all over the country and it may be time that we looked at the possibility of funding them as well because they are providing a massive public service without the funding behind it.  I ask Dr. Travers to comment on those points.  I wish him well in his role.  I note the various roles he has held.  I am particularly interested in his work on Irish culture and nationalism.<\/p><p>I would love to get stuck into some of them.  Some day when I have time.

On the issue of the Pale, I agree absolutely, the concern that sometimes arises about narrow vision in the Dublin media needs to be borne in mind and addressed.  RTE is a national broadcaster with a national remit.  Local provision comes from local and regional outlets but if there is a perception that there is a &ldquo;within the Pale&rdquo; mentality it must be fought against.  I have been out of Donegal since 1971 but I retain those roots and that loyalty.  Most people, even those who have lived in Dublin or within the Pale for a very long time, tend to have that outlook.  In so far as narrowness might creep into the vision of a Dublin-based media it must be fought in various ways.<\/p> <p>  I accept the difficulties independent broadcasters have encountered, particularly during a time of financial difficulty, with reduction in advertising revenue and so on.  That has been improving somewhat.  The sound and vision scheme I mentioned has benefitted independent broadcasters very significantly.  Some of the work of independent producers finds its way back to RTE.  The authority has been very conscious of trying to support and nurture local and community radio and has used the sound and vision scheme to do that.  The significant improvement in the funding under sound and vision has gone to independent radio.  One of the welcome developments is that radio drama, which used to be the sole preserve of RTE radio, has emerged from local radio stations with the support of the sound and vision scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012800002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pauric Travers"},{"type":"speech","time":1422437400,"counter":1143,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Travers.

It is good to have the strategy for 2014-16.  It will have to be a rolling strategy because as the market and technology change, it will have to be continually updated.  I am sure Dr. Travers accepts that.  The earlier speaker referred to a reduction of 500 staff and an expenditure reduction of &euro;130 million over the past few years in RTE.  I am sure that was not solely because of BAI but because of reduced revenue from advertising and Government.  What role, if any, does the BAI have?  How is its responsibility for value for money exercised?  There is a lot of discussion about media monopolies or dominance by key individuals in the market.  What is the BAI&rsquo;s responsibility for that and how is it discharged?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012800002#O00500","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422437400,"counter":1146,"content":"<p>I fully agree with Deputy Colreavy that the public is more aware of the regulatory role of the BAI than of its significant role in the overall strategic development of this sector.  In some respects that strategic area is particularly important.  One of the tasks I and the incoming board will have is to ensure there is a wider understanding because we are at a significant point in the development of broadcasting, nationally and internationally.  It is very important that we have a clear vision of that.<br\/><br\/>The BAI has a direct role in routinely reviewing the funding going to RTE, which it does annually.  There have been significant reviews, including one fairly recent external review of the overall funding for public broadcasting out of which several recommendations emerged.  The authority considered the report and made recommendations to the Government.  RTE's revenue has been diminishing and it would like increased funding.  It is the role of the BAI to advise the Minister on that.  The previous authority took the attitude that it would support increased funding to RTE, even for its public service role, but only on specific conditions partly related to increased domestic programme production, but also as part of a strategy to begin to re-balance advertising revenue because RTE is competing for advertising with the commercial sector.  If RTE is to get increased funding for its public service role it will, as a <i>quid<\/i><i>pro quo<\/i>, begin to re-balance the limits on revenues that might come from advertising.  The answer to the overall question is yes, the BAI has a very direct role in respect of the funding and direction of public service broadcasting.<br\/><br\/>It also has a role in advising the Minister on media monopolies and the Broadcasting Act 2009 refers to ownership.  Arising from that, and particularly from the aspiration within the Act to ensure diversity and a range of voices, the BAI developed a code on media ownership.  The most recent code was issued in 2012.  After that code was adopted it had something to say about a particular situation that arose in one sector.  The situation for ownership and mergers and so on has changed as a result of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 and the guidelines now issued under the Act.  The guidelines and the Act contain a section about protection of the public interest.  They also contain a provision that the Minister may ask for the view of the authority about any proposed acquisition or merger.  I would expect if the situation arose the authority would advise on its view.<\/p><p>Finally, the authority intends to review its code on media ownership in light of more recent developments.  This will be part of its 2015 work programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012800002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pauric Travers","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1422437400,"counter":1148,"content":"<p>Will that be confined to the broadcast media or the wider media?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012800002#P00200","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1422437400,"counter":1149,"content":"<p>It will be broadcast media although the Act does include the possibility of the authority having something to say about press ownership.

I welcome Dr. Travers and wish him well in his new role as chairman of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.<\/p> <p>  We all value the independence of the BAI's role, its fairness, proportionality and encouragement of broadcasting to reflect cultural and linguistic diversity.  Dr. Travers stated he embraces the principles of the broadcaster Edward R. Murrow and wants to reshape them to assist Irish broadcasting.  The BAI, RTE, as well as the Department, always claim it is not possible to have a quota system for the broadcasting of all genres of Irish music, including country.  Coming from Donegal, Dr. Travers will be familiar with that genre and its great singers from Donegal, such as Daniel O&rsquo;Donnell, Margo and everybody else.  France was faced with the same problem but it defined its music as a cultural asset and imposed airtime quotas for Francophone music on its broadcasters.  It felt its music culture was being Americanised and falling foul of internationalism, resulting in its culture and language being wiped out and overcome.  It is extraordinary the way our major radio stations play international pop music rather than Irish music.  The introduction of a similar quota system to that in France could be important in helping Irish music.  We must acknowledge that Irish music, across all the genres and at a cultural level, has been growing organically out of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Will Dr. Travers give consideration to such a quota system to ensure the national radio broadcasters give a fair crack of the whip to Irish and country musicians?  Local radio stations dedicate good airtime to country music while they are in a very competitive listenership environment.  For example, Midlands 103 FM has the &ldquo;Country Roads with Joe Cooney&rdquo; programme every night, giving ten to 11 hours every week, while Shannonside FM has Joe Finnegan and Frank Kilbride broadcasting country programmes.  These stations are in a very competitive listenership environment, getting no licence fee but they are giving an opportunity to those musicians, as well as young musicians.  This helps grow the industry.  Is there any way Dr. Travers will get rid of these platitudinous excuses that emanate out of various authorities, including the BAI, and make a genuine effort to give these musicians a chance?  There should be no more lip-service.  We pay lots of lip-service to various matters but forget about them.  I am like a dog with a bone about this.  I must state I do not have any interests in the music industry.  I am not a band manager or a musician.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012800002#P00400","speaker":"1063"},{"type":"speech","time":1422437400,"counter":1151,"content":"<p>There is no conflict of interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012800002#P00500","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1422437400,"counter":1152,"content":"<p>There is no conflict of interest.

If the French can get over it, we should be able to develop a level of ingenuity to ensure we get over it and that our musicians get appropriate airplay.<\/p> <p>  Recently, when the BAI issued a radio licence, it stated 20% of airplay was to be for country music.  There is no reason that cannot apply to RTE.

I too have no vested interest in music other than having a strong interest in listening to all kinds of Irish music.  How impressive Irish music is across the board in its range and quality is acknowledged internationally.  That should be reflected on the national airwaves and locally.  I compliment local radio stations on what they do in this area.  I listen to Ocean FM rather than Highland Radio because I am from south Donegal.  I note its listenership figures for Irish music airtime are very impressive.  The commercial radio sector does not have any specific requirements.  However, when they apply for a licence, as part of their submissions, they are asked about the commitments to Irish music.  Part of the role of the authority is to monitor that.  By and large, they are doing a an outstanding job because there is a listenership market for this music.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy may well ask why that should not apply nationally.  Clearly, a broader range of interests have to be served nationally.  I could point to very significant programmes on RTE, TG4 and Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta that contain a significant amount of Irish music.  It is appropriate to monitor and promote this.<\/p> <p>  On having a French system of airplay quotas, the French have a long tradition of that both in film and music.  They argue this on cultural grounds but there is a specific linguistic issue in France which makes the French analogy not quite identical to the Irish one.  Rather than going down the French route, it would be more preferable to persuade people of the quality of Irish music, both traditional and in other genres.  The proof of the pudding is in the high listenership figures for those local radio programmes.  I agree that, in so far as there is a perception that this market is not well served by the national broadcaster, we should encourage it to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015012800002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Pauric Travers"},{"type":"speech","time":1422437400,"counter":1154,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Travers for attending the committee this morning and engaging with us in a frank and forthright way.
