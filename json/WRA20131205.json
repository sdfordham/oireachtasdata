To this end, a key focus of the EU position going into these negotiations was to agree a clear process of work and analysis, including key milestones, for 2014 and 2015. This process is necessary to ensure that all Parties begin their domestic preparations in order to be in a position to bring meaningful emission reduction commitments to the table far enough in advance of the Paris COP to allow for peer review and discussion in terms of both their proposed ambition and fairness.

Together with the Minister for Housing and Planning, I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is optimise d in terms of resources and focus to maximise the response to social housing need. This must of course be achieved in a context in which public expenditure necessarily continues to be constrained. Nonetheless, in July 2012 the nister for Housing and Planning announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing.<\/p><p>  In addition to the &euro;525.8m in housing programme expenditure provided for in my Department&rsquo;s Abridged Estimate for 2014, Budget 2014 provides a further &euro;50 million to fund infrastructural investment primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million for   the State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and an additional &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants. When this is taken into account, funding for housing for next year is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.<\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing continues to be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. In addition, my Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes. Approved Housing Bodies will also play a key role in 2014 in the delivery of social housing and in particular in its capacity to attract external financial investment.<\/p><p>  In spite of our challenging economic circumstances, I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2013 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units, and it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will also be provided for social housing in 2014. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500056#WRA01200","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":18,"content":"<p>Question No. 11 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Guidelines","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500056#WRA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[51807\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500056#WRA01400","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to revise the planning regulations covering wind turbines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1177","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>The existing Wind Energy Development Guidelines were published in June 2006.

My Department issued a press notice in January 2013 inviting submissions from the public on this targeted review.<\/p><p>  Earlier this year, my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources commissioned the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland to invite proposals from suitably qualified organisations for the completion of a desk study of peer reviewed studies and other documents that examine the significance of noise related to onshore wind farms. The objective of the study is to obtain evidence upon which to evaluate the appropriateness of the existing guidelines in relation to noise impacts and, if considered necessary, suggest changes. The study takes account of the following key contextual issues:<\/p><p>  - the evolution of wind turbine technologies since the current Guidelines were published in 2006;<\/p><p>  - experience to date in the application of the current Guidelines;<\/p><p>  - research relating to wind turbine noise issues since the current Guidelines were adopted. <\/p><p>  This study will form a key input into the review of the statutory guidelines.

In allocating resources, I was particularly conscious of the need to support funding levels for the LCDP and to make the maximum contribution to job creation and economic recovery. The funding provided in 2014 will be invested to increase access to formal and informal educational activities and resources, and to increase people&rsquo;s work readiness and employment prospects.

Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, commencing in 2014, the Minister for Finance will pay into the Local Government Fund an amount equivalent to the Local Property Tax paid into the Central Fund during that year; this revenue will be allocated to local authorities from the Fund. In addition, the establishment of Irish Water and its financial relationship with the local government sector will have a considerable impact on local authority financing. The Local Government Fund will continue to receive motor tax receipts in 2014.<\/p><p>  It should be noted that t he funding to be provided to local authorities for the provision of water services in 2014 will be governed by Service Level Agreements between Irish Water and individual authorities.<\/p><p>  The Government has indicated an intention to move to 80% retention of all Local Property Tax receipts within the local authority area where the Tax is raised. The establishment of Irish Water presents local government with significant organisational and financial challenges in 2014. Service provision responsibilities will shift from the local authorities to Irish Water, infrastructure will be transferred, financing arrangements will alter and local authorities will operate on behalf of Irish Water under Service Level Agreements. These changes must be managed. In this context, it has been necessary to defer defining a certain proportion of the proceeds of the Local Property Tax to be retained in each local authority until 2015. This approach allows maximum flexibility in allocating Local Property Tax in 2014 in the form of General Purpose Grants, with the priority to support those local authorities with weaker funding bases. This decision has been taken in the context of Budget 2014. The 2014 Local Government Fund General Purpose Grants will be announced shortly. It will be a matter for each local authority to determine how best to us e General Purpose Grant revenue in line with local priorities and circumstances; I have no plans to issue new guidelines or to make new regulations in that regard.<\/p><p>  I expect the Local Property Tax to have multiple benefits, including a more sustainable and resilient system of funding for local authorities and therefore a sounder financial footing for the provision of essential local services; greater local scope for financial decision-making concerning service provision - in particular, the inclusion of the local variation mechanism from 2015 will further increase the autonomy of local authorities; and a strengthening of democracy at local level with a more active relationship between local authorities and local electorates. A stronger democratic relationship and clearer lines of accountability can only have a beneficial impact on service provision from the perspective of the service user.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500056#WRA04500","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":65,"content":"<p>Question No. 29 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Philanthropy Initiatives","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500056#WRA04650"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[50122\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500056#WRA04700","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his policy on philanthropy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":68,"content":"<p>The Government established the Forum on Philanthropy in May 2006 in order to promote a culture of philanthropy in Ireland. The Forum initially comprised the Departments of An Taoiseach (in the Chair), Finance and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, as well as five private philanthropic organisations.<\/p><p>  On 1 May 2011, responsibility for the Forum was transferred to my Department. I broadened its focus to support the development of both philanthropy and fundraising. During 2012, the Forum set out ambitious plans to increase philanthropic giving from its current estimated level of approximately &euro;500 million per annum to &euro;800 million by 2016. The drivers for this increase in giving fall under four overarching themes: a national giving campaign, fiscal and infrastructure recommendations, fundraising capacity improvements and a social innovation fund.   <\/p><p>Very significant progress has been made on the implementation of the Forum&rsquo;s plans. A National Giving Campaign, the one percent difference, has been launched &ndash; details of the campaign are on the website . The tax treatment of donations to charities has been simplified and decoupled from business tax incentives, a road map has been set out for the implementation of the Charities Act and the setting up of a Charities Regulator and the Social Innovation Fund are in the early stages of development. <\/p><p>  My Department continues to support the Forum. Funding of approximately &euro;1.9 million over a three-year period is being allocated to Philanthropy Ireland on the basis that it is matched with funding from philanthropic sources. This funding is being used to support the Giving Campaign and initial set-up costs of the social innovation fund.<\/p><p>  A further allocation of approximately &euro;400,000 over a three-year period is also being provided by my Department to Fundraising Ireland, once again on the basis that it is matched by funding from philanthropic sources. This funding will contribute to the professionalisation of fundraising within the sector.   <\/p><p>  I share the Forum&rsquo;s view that, even in these difficult times, we have the opportunity to substantially increase the level of private investment in the philanthropic and fundraising sectors. It is not intended to substitute for Government investment, but to supplement it. As well as unlocking significant private funding to address fundamental social and economic challenges, increased private giving to good causes will also support the Government&rsquo;s strategy to increase employment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500056#WRA04800","answer":true,"speaker":"967"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":69,"content":"<p>Question No. 31 answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":70,"content":"<p>Question No. 32 answered with Question No. 28.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local and Community Development Programme Planning","counter":71,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500056#WRA05050"},{"type":"question","counter":72,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[51957\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500056#WRA05100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans for Dublin north inner city under the local government Bill due to the fact that there is no partnership in the area; if he intends to establish a local development company for the area.

As the number of fatalities rises towards 120,000, including 12,  000 children under five, there are now approximately nine million people who are in need of immediate life-saving support. In addition to more than 6.5 million people who are displaced within Syria, there are currently 2.2 million Syrians who have fled to neighbouring countries. <\/p><p>  Ireland has been to the fore in the international efforts to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis. We have provided more than &euro;14 million in assistance since the crisis began, of which almost &euro;11.4 million was provided in 2013. In addition,   Ireland is an important donor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) which this year has allocated US$82 million to Syria and neighbouring countries. A second pledging conference for Syria and region is due to take place in Kuwait in January 2014 and we are examining the possibility of future Irish assistance.<\/p><p>  Irish Aid has channelled our humanitarian aid through key UN and NGO partners, as well as through the Red Cross\/Red Crescent movement. These agencies are selected on the basis of their capacity to deliver impartial assistance to large numbers of people, both within Syria and to refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries. Our funding to international organisations remains un-earmarked so that assistance can be targeted where it is most needed, ensuring that it reaches the most vulnerable and marginalised regardless of ethnicity or political affiliation. Irish humanitarian aid is being distributed across Syria.  We are in close contact with our humanitarian partners in the field and they have not reported any specific issue related to the interference of neighbouring countries in the delivery of supplies to Kurdish areas in Syria. <\/p><p>  We have worked closely with our humanitarian partners to ensure that the necessary systems are in place to monitor and evaluate the use and impact of Ireland&rsquo;s assistance. We insist that our partners fully adhere to the principles of &lsquo;Good Humanitarian Donorship&rsquo;, promoting accountability, efficiency and effectiveness in implementing humanitarian action. <\/p><p>  It is a particularly regrettable feature of this conflict that, while millions of people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, indiscriminate attacks on civilians and humanitarian personnel continue unabated, and armed groups on both sides continue to disregard their obligations under International Humanitarian Law. The Government of Ireland has matched its material humanitarian contribution with concrete support to international efforts to find a sustainable political solution to the crisis.  We have called clearly for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access. We have called for all parties to the conflict to fully respect international humanitarian law and to refrain from the targeting of civilians.<\/p><p>  Ireland has been consistent in its efforts at EU level to ensure the necessary attention is given by the international community to this crisis. Throughout our EU Presidency in the first half of this year, Ireland repeatedly underlined the gravity of the humanitarian situation, including in regular discussion at the EU Foreign Affairs Council.  The Council Conclusions on Syria issued following the most recent meeting of the Council, last month, condemned the continuing widespread and systematic violations of international humanitarian law and human rights in Syria, including increasing attacks on religious and ethnic communities.   The Council further called for the facilitation by all parties of safe, unhindered and immediate access to populations in need of assistance in the entirety of the Syrian territory, including across conflict lines and across borders from neighbouring countries. The Conclusions reaffirmed that only a political solution that results in a united, inclusive and democratic Syria can end the crisis.<\/p><p>  The humanitarian crisis in Syria is likely to be on the agenda for this month&rsquo;s Development Ministers Council and I will be strongly supporting the continuation of the EU&rsquo;s role as the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people.  In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, Ireland will continue to call for increased support to the humanitarian relief effort, both within the EU and more broadly internationally.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500057#WRB00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":94,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500057#WRB00900"},{"type":"question","counter":95,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[52273\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500057#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his Department's Annual Report for 2012 has been published yet.

I saw how the ongoing political turmoil and insecurity in the Middle East is resulting in a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Gaza. I share the concerns expressed recently by the UN Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. James Rawley. Indeed I had the opportunity to discuss these issues with him during my visit. <\/p><p>  While Israeli restrictions have eased marginally in recent times, the overall situation in Gaza has worsened in recent months as Egypt has taken action against smuggling into Gaza, in response to its own security concerns.  The existing fuel shortfall and shortage of supply of building materials, accentuated by the closure of tunnels, is affecting the daily lives of residents, their electricity supply and water and sewage facilities.<\/p><p>  High youth unemployment, low wages and high food prices remain serious concerns. The food security situation, however, is the principal cause for alarm. More than 800,000 of the over 1.2 million Palestine refugees in Gaza receive food assistance from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which is providing basic education, health, relief and social services for some 5 million registered Palestinian refugees across the region.<\/p><p>  Ireland has responded to the current crisis by providing additional funding of &euro;500,000 to UNRWA to support the food assistance element of their Gaza Emergency Appeal.  This brings Ireland&rsquo;s total contribution to UNRWA&rsquo;s appeals for Gaza to &euro;4.64 million since 2006. UNRWA&rsquo;s food assistance provides a lifeline for thousands of refugee families in Gaza and helps to prevent a potentially large scale crisis in a context where an estimated 57% of households are classified as food insecure.<\/p><p>  This funding support is in addition to Ireland&rsquo;s broader programme of assistance to the Palestinian people and brings our total funding support to date in 2013 to &euro;8.3 million. This includes support to UNRWA&rsquo;s general fund, the Palestinian Authority, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and civil society organisations working to promote human rights and democratisation.<\/p><p>  In addition to our humanitarian support, the Government raises the problems facing Gaza and its people both directly with Israel and through EU engagement with Israel. This includes regular contacts between the Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv and the Israeli authorities, and between officials and the Israeli Embassy in Dublin. In addition to my own visit, the T&aacute;naiste travelled to Gaza last year to highlight the desperate living conditions being experienced by people as a result of the blockade of the territory. Ireland also raised the situation in Gaza in the universal review of Israel at the UN Human Rights Council in October. In these contacts, we consistently call on Israel to end the restrictions on Gaza, and call on other states to do more to exert pressure in this regard.<\/p><p>  Ireland will continue to support actively the search for a lasting and peaceful political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,  as well as the wider region.  In the meantime we will continue to offer the humanitarian support which is essential in addressing the ongoing basic needs of the Palestinian people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500057#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Syrian Conflict","counter":101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500057#WRB01600"},{"type":"question","counter":102,"qnumday":42,"qnumall":"[52415\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500057#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he proposes to raise at the next EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting the ongoing crisis in Syria; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":103,"content":"<p>The Syrian crisis is due to be discussed at the December Foreign Affairs Council.

I would again plan to raise this topic and support urgent consideration by the UN Security Council of a binding resolution on the humanitarian situation, to follow up on the Council&rsquo;s Presidential statement of 2 October on this subject.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500057#WRB01800","answer":true,"speaker":"951"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":104,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 43 and 44 answered with Question No. 39.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Humanitarian Aid","counter":105,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500057#WRB02500"},{"type":"question","counter":106,"qnumday":45,"qnumall":"[52418\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500057#WRB02600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the total assistance provided by Irish Aid to date to assist the relief efforts following Typhoon Haiyan; if there are proposals to provide further assistance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":107,"qnumday":46,"qnumall":"[52419\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500057#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he proposes to raise at the next EU Foreign Affairs meeting the urgent need for the European Union and indeed the international community in general to provide much needed further humanitarian assistance for the Philippines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":108,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 46 together. <\/p><p>  Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest storms ever recorded, hit the Philippines on 8 November with devastating effect. It is estimated at present that the typhoon affected 14.4 million people, with over 3.6 million remaining displaced, including approximately 1.5 million children. The full human toll of this disaster remains unclear but over 5,600 deaths have been confirmed to date.<\/p><p>  Ireland was among the first to respond to this disaster, providing immediate, life-saving assistance.  To date, the Government has provided over &euro;3.6 million in humanitarian assistance, making Ireland one of the most generous contributors to the relief effort on a per capita basis.  Of this assistance, over &euro;2.6million in funding has been provided through our key NGO partners for the provision of emergency food and non-food items; water, sanitation and hygiene; emergency health care and protection of vulnerable women and children.  Ireland&rsquo;s support will benefit up to 50,000 households.<\/p><p>  To date, Irish Aid has authorised four airlifts of essential relief items, the most recent of which arrived in the Philippines on Monday, 2 December. This brings the total amount of essential relief items provided by Ireland to 166 tonnes, valued at &euro;967,000 in total. According to the latest figures, Ireland is the second largest contributor of emergency stocks through the UN World Food Programme Humanitarian Response Depot system, second only to the World Food Programme itself.  We have also deployed five members of the Rapid Response Corps to the Philippines to assist UN relief.<\/p><p>  An Irish Government's technical mission arrived in the Philippines on 28 November and travelled to the worst affected area, Tacloban City. The purpose of this mission is to prepare a detailed analysis of the longer-term needs of the worst affected regions and to explore ways in which Ireland can most effectively contribute to the recovery process.  The team will return to Dublin later this week and report to the T&aacute;naiste and me, with recommendations on how Ireland can assist the Philippines in the medium to long term.<\/p><p>  The international community has so far contributed a total of US $394 million in response to this disaster.   Of this, $167 million has been provided to the UN appeal which is at present 48% funded. This includes $25 million from the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), to which Ireland is an important contributor.<\/p><p>  While the situation in the Philippines was not on the formal agenda for November&rsquo;s EU Foreign Affairs Council, the T&aacute;naiste took the opportunity to discuss with his EU colleagues the wider EU response to the crisis.  Department officials are in regular contact with the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO) and, in particular, the EU Emergency Response Centre. As of the end of November, the EU and its Member States had provided over &euro;130 million in support to the relief effort. Just last week, in Brussels, I also discussed the EU response with the European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection, Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, who recently returned from the region. <\/p><p>  While the agenda has not yet been finalised, I would expect that I will have the opportunity to discuss the evolving situation in the Philippines and the role the EU should play in the recovery process at the Development segment of the Foreign Affairs Council, which I will attend, in Brussels, on 12 December. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500057#WRB02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1006"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":110,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500058#WRC00150"},{"type":"question","counter":111,"qnumday":47,"qnumall":"[52443\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500058#WRC00200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will raise the escalating crisis in the Central African Republic at the next meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[52444\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500058#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the activities carried out by Irish Aid in the Central African Republic; if these activities have been affected by the current hostilities there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"951"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 48 together.<\/p><p>  The Government shares the concern about the deteriorating situation in the Central African Republic, in particular the reports of an alarming increase in inter-communal violence and gross violations of human rights.  As highlighted by the UN Secretary General in his report to the Security Council on 15 November, this conflict has the potential to escalate, with untold consequences for the people of the Central African Republic and of the wider region. <\/p><p>  I am also concerned at the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country, where with at least a quarter of the population is currently in need of humanitarian assistance.   The worsening security situation is increasingly limiting humanitarian access to vulnerable populations in need of assistance.

We are long-standing funders of the UN-administered Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF) for the Central African Republic. For a number of years, Ireland and Sweden, have been the two EU Member States to support this Fund, with Ireland providing an average annual contribution of over &euro;2 million since 2009. In view of the recent deterioration of the situation in the Central African Republic and the related increase in acute humanitarian need, we welcome the recent decision by the Netherlands also to contribute to this Fund.  This year, we have provided &euro;2 million to the Common Humanitarian Fund, allowing the UN and NGOs present in the Central African Republic to undertake life-saving work with the most vulnerable communities. <\/p><p>  I welcome the African Union peacekeeping Mission (MISCA), which is in the process of deployment in the Central African Republic.

The Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit will be of the same value, i.e. &euro;1,650, as the existing OPFTC and will also carry the same entitlement to the extended standard rate tax band of &euro;36,800 per annum.  The new credit will be targeted such that it is available in the first instance, to the primary carer of the child. A maximum of one credit will be available per single carer\/claimant, regardless of whether he or she cares for more than one child. This is the same condition that applies to the current OPFTC.     There is no specific tax credit for children in the tax code and married or cohabiting couples are unable to avail of any additional credit to assist them in maintaining their children. This is despite the fact that in certain cases such couples may also have to maintain two households due to the location of employment.<\/p><p>  Given the difficult fiscal environment it is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they can achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them.  A system that allows multiple claims in respect of the same child, as can happen with the OPFTC, is unsustainable.  <\/p><p>  In the first instance, it is the responsibility of the parents to look after a child including financially.  The new credit is targeted to assist principal child carers to take up, or remain in employment. It should not be considered merely as a supplementary source of income, or an alternative to the financial support of a parent. <\/p><p>  Maintenance payments are a matter for parents and if necessary, the courts to decide. It is not possible, and indeed would not be appropriate, for the tax code to take account of every possible variable.  <\/p><p>  The Commission on Taxation acknowledged that the One-Parent Family Tax Credit plays a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.  However, in its recommendations it concluded that the credit should be retained but that it should be allocated to the principal carer only. The restructuring of the credit will achieve such an outcome.  <\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, after listening carefully to the views expressed by my colleagues and many Deputies in this matter, I bought forward an amendment to the section at Committee Stage of the Finance (No 2) Bill 2013, which will allow the credit to be used by a non-primary carer in situations, for example, where the primary carer has no tax liability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500058#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Property Taxation Administration","counter":118,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500058#WRC00750"},{"type":"question","counter":119,"qnumday":51,"qnumall":"[52256\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500058#WRC00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason householders who chose to pay their local property tax by credit card or debit tax must make their 2014 LPT payments by 27 November 2013, a full 31 days before the due date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In accordance with the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), the tax for 2014 is payable on or before 1 January 2014.  Consequently, there is no requirement on property owners to pay their 2014 LPT before 1 January 2014.  The range of payment options provided by the Revenue Commissioners ensures that nobody needs pay LPT before that date (except in a case where a property is changing hands) and also provide the flexibility for a property owner to select a payment option that best suits their particular circumstances.<\/p><p>  I understand that the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners dealt with this issue comprehensively when she attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 7 November 2013.  The Chairman informed the Committee that in order to provide for a delayed payment of LPT by way of credit\/debit card, Revenue would be required to retain taxpayer&rsquo;s credit\/debit card data.  The Commissioners would be very concerned about retaining such data from a data protection perspective, as it is not best practice, and other issues, including costs, also arise.  Recent well-publicised data breaches arising from the retention of such data underline those concerns.  The Chairman agreed that the Commissioners would review the payment patterns for 2014 to establish the proportion of owners who choose to pay the tax by credit\/debit card and that they would also carefully review the issues around retaining debit\/credit card data and its potential impact on systems, costs, security and data protection.  <\/p><p>  The Deputy should also be aware that for those with a debit card, payment by way of single debit authority is a simple, safe, secure alternative, which also provides property owners with an extended payment date of 21 March 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500058#WRC00900","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Expenditure","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500058#WRC00950"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[52259\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500058#WRC01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 194 of 26 November 2013, if the figures he provided included payments to the named firms by companies to which the National Asset Management Agency has had receivers appointed; and if not, if he will provide a separate table of such payments for 2010, 2011, and 2012.

The application of the carbon tax to solid fuels was further postponed in 2012 given the overall tax increases in Budget 2012 including in the standard rate of VAT.<\/p><p>  The introduction of Carbon Tax was about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment.  It should also be noted that solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels.  As a result they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important that they are taxed.<\/p><p>  The carbon tax was applied to solid fuels on a phased basis in Budget 2013 but its implementation was delayed until after the last winter period i.e. from 1 May 2013 at a rate of &euro;10 per tonne with a further &euro;10 per tonne to be applied from 1 May 2014 to bring the rate of carbon tax in line with that of all other fuels.<\/p><p>  While tax increases are unpopular, where Member States are under fiscal pressure, it makes senses to increase taxes in areas where some benefits can arise, in this instance a carbon tax promotes energy efficiency, reduces emissions and reduces our dependence on imported fossil fuels.<\/p><p>  The application of the carbon tax to solid fuels i.e. coal and commercial peat (mainly peat briquettes and some turf), from 1 May 2013 has meant an increase in price of &euro;1.20 in the case of coal (40kg bag) and 26 cents in the case of a bale of briquettes, based on current prices.  This represents an 8.2% and 6.7% percentage increase in the price of coal and peat briquettes respectively.  This relatively high percentage increase is due in part to those products having little or no excise applied to them prior to the carbon tax.  It should also be noted that solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels and therefore attract a higher carbon tax. <\/p><p>  Accordingly I do not intend to defer the further increase of &euro;10 per tonne of CO2 emissions from 1 May 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500059#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Banking Sector Issues","counter":141,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500059#WRD00550"},{"type":"question","counter":142,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[52331\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500059#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is concerned regarding recent reports on Ulster Bank; if he will have an investigation conducted regarding a matter (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":143,"content":"<p>I am aware of the content of the report to which the Deputy refers.

Whatever date is prescribed, the question of liability when there is a change of ownership has to be managed, and I would expect that the LPT liability involved is likely to be factored in during negotiations between the parties on the sale price and the closing date of a particular contract.  <\/p><p>As there are a number of LPT issues to be considered when buying or selling a house, I am advised that detailed guidance on LPT issues arising in the context of the sale or transfer of a residential property was prepared by the Revenue Commissioners in consultation with the Law Society and is available since last August on the Revenue website at <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"><\/font><\/i>   and on the Law Society&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>  The liability date for 2014 of 1 November 2013 is settled, has been approved by the Oireachtas in passing the LPT legislation and I have no plans to change the law in question.  Since the 2014 liability date of 1 November 2013 is provided for in the legislation, any owner selling their residential property between 2 November and 31 December 2013 cannot therefore appeal their liability for LPT on the property for 2014. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500060#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":179,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[52413\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500060#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in Dublin 9 received a local property tax letter addressed to their deceased spouse for a property their spouse did not own; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1178","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":180,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that a key aspect of the work it has undertaken in connection with the administration of Local Property Tax (LPT) has been the development of a register of residential properties in the State.

The home tuition continues from their 3rd birthday if no placement in a school based autism early intervention class is available for them.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a national network of Special Educational Needs Advisors who can assist parents in identifying school placements for their children, if required.<\/p><p>  As home tuition takes place outside the usual school structure it is important that home tutors are qualified to provide an educational programme.

When it is not possible to recruit a fully qualified teacher then alternative appropriate third level qualifications may be acceptable.  However, from this year my Department has also required that, in addition to being qualified teachers, tutors must be registered or have applied for registration with the Teaching Council of Ireland.

There are approximately 80,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million for 2013.<\/p><p>  Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme have come into force with effect from Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014.  The new rent limits have been determined following an extensive review of the private rental market based on the most up-to-date data available.  The Department currently funds up to 30% of the private rented sector so it is essential that the rent limits are kept under review.  The new rent limits have been set using the 35th percentile ensuring that sufficient housing is available for recipients of the scheme.<\/p><p>  Under the revised rent limits, there have been increases in the maximum rent limits in Dublin while there have been some reductions across a number of rural counties reflecting the conditions in the rental markets in those counties.  Rent limits in County Kilkenny were maintained with the exception of the family with two children rate which reduced by &euro;10 per month.  In County Carlow there were reductions in some rent limit categories with the exception of the single person rate which increased.<\/p><p>  As existing claims come up for review, or when an existing lease expires, they will be reassessed using the new limits.  Where a claim is under review and the rent is above the new maximum limit the customer is being asked to contact the landlord to renegotiate the rent.  Where a landlord does not agree to reduce the rent to the new rates departmental officials will discuss the options open to the tenant up to and including seeking alternative accommodation.  Departmental guidance to the officers administering rent supplement states that where negotiation with the landlord fails then rent supplement may continue to be paid for a period of up to thirteen weeks at the higher rate. However, once the lease has expired the tenant will be expected to find suitable accommodation at below the new limits in force.<\/p><p>  Analysis of the County Carlow and County Kilkenny rental market shows that there are a number of rental properties available within the prescribed limits.  Department officials dealing with rent supplement tenants will continue to ensure that their accommodation needs are met   and that the residence is reasonably suited to their residential and other needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500065#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Farm Assist Scheme Data","counter":314,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500066#WRL00150"},{"type":"question","counter":315,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[52320\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500066#WRL00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons in receipt of farm assist during each month since January 2012 to date in 2013; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":316,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy regarding the number of persons in receipt of farm assist at the end of each month since January 2012 to date in 2013 is detailed in the attached tabular statement.<\/p><p>  Number of Recipients of Farm Assist, 2012 and 2013 to date.<\/p><p>2012<table><tr><th><div>Month<\/div><\/th><th><div>Number of Recipients<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>January<\/td><td><div>11,351<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>February<\/td><td><div>11,364<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>March<\/td><td><div>11,346<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>April<\/td><td><div>11,158<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>May<\/td><td><div>11,154<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>June<\/td><td><div>11,137<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>July<\/td><td><div>11,137<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>August<\/td><td><div>11,138<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>September<\/td><td><div>11,092<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>October<\/td><td><div>11,134<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>November<\/td><td><div>11,137<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>December<\/td><td><div>11,162<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table>  2013<table><tr><th>Month<\/th><th><div>Number of Recipients<\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td>January<\/td><td><div>11,207<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>February<\/td><td><div>11,177<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>March<\/td><td><div>11,100<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>April<\/td><td><div>10,867<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>May<\/td><td><div>10,785<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>June<\/td><td><div>10,726<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>July<\/td><td><div>10,655<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>August<\/td><td><div>10,601<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>September<\/td><td><div>10,316<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>October<\/td><td><div>10,260<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>November<\/td><td><div>10,247<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500066#WRL00300","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Aids and Appliances Applications","counter":317,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500066#WRL00350"},{"type":"question","counter":318,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[52341\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500066#WRL00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath has had his medical appliance benefit claim refused on the basis he does not have the necessary contribution record; if same will be reviewed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

This will begin in 2014 with the standardising of State pension age for all at 66 years and the cessation of State pension transition.

State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension.  It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Over time, the age for State pension contributory was reduced to 66 years.  The retirement condition associated with State pension transition has been criticised as a barrier to working.<\/p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that a significant number of people coming on to State pension (transition) in 2012 did not come from work as many were already on other social welfare schemes.  In December 2012, there were approximately 14,400 State pension (transition) claims in payment and of those, just 12.5 per cent came from work with over 50 per cent coming from other social welfare schemes such as illness benefit, jobseekers benefit and assistance, invalidity and carers, indicating that significant numbers of people are leaving the workforce for a variety of reasons well in advance of State pension age.  In terms of social welfare supports available to those at age 65, all short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500067#WRM00800","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":353,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500067#WRM00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects","counter":352,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500067#WRM00850"},{"type":"question","counter":353,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[52318\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500067#WRM00900","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the details of discussions between his Department officials in the office of the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Galway County Council in relation to the replacement of a bridge in Sean a Ph&eacute;ist&iacute;n, Conamara, in respect of which there is a 1.5 tonne restriction at present; the requirements that have been laid down by his Department to the city council in respect of this replacement; the delay that these requirements will cause to this necessary work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Statement also made clear that public acceptability requires public confidence that proposals adhere to the highest international standards of safety, health and environmental and visual impact, and technology choice. The Government affirmed that EirGrid and the other State energy companies are obliged to adhere to all relevant guidelines and standards and they act in the national interest, and on behalf of all electricity consumers.<\/p><p>  In this regard, the expectation is that those companies in making their choices, of project specific technologies and routing as well as mitigation measures, will take account of all relevant national and international standards, to follow best practice and ensure value for money and be informed by detailed consultation at local level.

EirGrid has stated that it will take full account of all the submissions received during the course of the consultation process.<\/p><p>  Finally, it is important that the Government can give a strong consistent message to Irish business and multinationals, and our citizens, that Ireland&rsquo;s electricity networks are robust, modern and safe.

I can also confirm that the areas referred to by the Deputy are included in the National Broadband Scheme (NBS). The objective of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which was launched in 2008, following a competitive tendering process, was to provide access to affordable, scalable broadband services to rural areas, where operators had been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  Under the terms of the contract which my Department has in place with &quot;3&quot;, the NBS service provider, the NBS mobile wireless service is required to offer minimum download and upload speeds of 2.3Mbps and 1.4Mbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 18:1. The NBS satellite service, which is utilised in a small number of cases for technical reasons associated with the location of the premises, offers minimum download and upload speeds of 3.6Mbps and 384 kbps respectively, subject to a maximum contention ratio of 48:1.<\/p><p>  All persons located within the NBS Coverage Area can avail of the NBS service by contacting &quot;3&quot;, the NBS Service Provider on 1800 944 791, online at  or by calling into one of 3&rsquo;s authorised retail outlets.<\/p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing:<\/p><p>  - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<\/p><p>  - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, there is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which they committed in the Plan. eircom has extended its plans for the rollout of high speed services, with speeds of up to 100Mbps to 1.4m premises, UPC has increased its minimum and top speed products to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively, and mobile operators are rolling out enhanced product offerings, including 4G mobile. Other operators continue to invest and ESB is currently considering the prospect of utilising its distribution network to rollout fibre broadband services.<\/p><p>  These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators.<\/p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.<\/p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.<\/p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500068#WRN02300","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bord G&aacute;is Privatisation","counter":390,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500068#WRN02400"},{"type":"question","counter":391,"qnumday":144,"qnumall":"[52363\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500068#WRN02500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the position regarding the sale of Bord G&aacute;is; the number of bids received; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Under Statutory Instrument No. 445 of 2000 Eirgrid, the Transmission System Operator (TSO), is obliged to operate and ensure the maintenance and development of a safe, secure, reliable, economical and efficient electricity transmission system. As the TSO, EirGrid is responsible for managing electricity supply and demand in real time and controlling flows of power on the transmission system. Wind is afforded priority dispatch by the system operator in line with the Renewable Energy Directive 2009\/28\/EC. Thus, when wind is available, it is dispatched first onto the transmission system. When wind is low, other generation sources are used. These are gas, coal, hydroelectricity, peat, oil, diesel distillate and other smaller sources such as Combined Heat and Power (CHP); in addition, there are potential imports of up to 500 MW over the East West Interconnector. To ensure that this is done in an economic and efficient manner, EirGrid employs a unit commitment schedule to determine the dispatch order of other generation. The unit commitment schedule is determined based on the commercial and technical parameters submitted by generators on a daily basis. The commercial parameters submitted by generators must be cost reflective as per the bidding code of practice rules, which form part of the Single Electricity Market (SEM) rules. The unit commitment schedule establishes the most economic order for dispatching the generation needed to meet electricity demand. The cheapest generation type is dispatched first, then the next cheapest and so on until the system operator has enough generation to meet demand.In general, when wind is high and available to the power system, the production costs in the market are lower.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500069#WRO00500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","counter":402,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500069#WRO00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Land Issues","counter":401,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500069#WRO00550"},{"type":"question","counter":402,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[52354\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500069#WRO00600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the tax penalities for developers hoarding up land banks around Dublin; his plans to introduce a new policy to ensure land is made available for residential housing in Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":403,"content":"<p>The only penalty of this nature applicable to the hoarding and non-development of sites is the derelict sites levy provided for under section 23 of the Derelict Sites Act 1990.

These specify requirements in relation to a range of matters such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their properties comply with the regulations; however, responsibility for the enforcement of the minimum standards regulations rests with the local authorities supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB). <\/p><p>  It is a matter for each individual local authority to decide the specific details of its enforcement strategy and inspection arrangements. However, in discharging their responsibilities in relation to the rental sector, authorities have been asked to have regard to the <i>Good Practice Guidelines for Local Authorities on Standards in the Private Rented Sector: Strategic Planning, Effective Enforcement<\/i>   published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007, which make recommendations on relevant issues, including the targeting of inspection activities. <\/p><p>  Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, local authorities have a strengthened, updated regulatory framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices where landlords are in breach of their obligations. Fines for continuing non-compliance with the regulations were also increased significantly.

On 1 February 2013, regulations 6, 7 and 8 of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 came into effect for all residential rented accommodation. This means that all rental accommodation must have its own separate sanitary facilities leading to the phasing-out of the traditional &lsquo;bed-sit&rsquo;, where sanitary facilities are shared between different rental units. The Regulations allowed a four year phasing-in period to facilitate any improvement works that needed to be carried out.\u00a0 <\/p><p>  The revised standards do not specifically target bed-sits but were based on a review of minimum standards dating back to 1993 which allowed external toilets, cold water only and having an open fireplace as the only heating source.

I am determined to ensure that the social housing programme is optimised in terms of resources and focus to maximise the response to social housing need.  This must be achieved in a context in which public expenditure necessarily continues to be constrained.  Nonetheless, in July 2012 I announced details of a three-year funding programme of &euro;100 million to deliver some 800 new units of voluntary and local authority owned social housing.<\/p><p>  In addition to the &euro;525.8 million in housing programme expenditure provided for in my Department&rsquo;s Abridged Estimate for 2014, Budget 2014 provides a further &euro;50 million to fund infrastructural investment primarily in the housing area, including &euro;30 million for the State house building programme; &euro;10 million for an unfinished housing estate resolution project; and an additional &euro;10 million for housing adaptation grants.  When this is taken into account, funding for housing for next year is effectively maintained at 2013 levels.<\/p><p>  Delivery of social housing continues to be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  In addition, my Department and the Housing Agency are engaged with NAMA to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes.  Approved Housing Bodies will also play a key role in 2014 in the delivery of social housing and in particular in their capacity to attract external financial investment.<\/p><p>  In spite of our challenging economic circumstances, I expect the final output across all social housing programmes for 2013 to be in the region of 5,000 new housing units, and it is provisionally estimated that in the region of 5,000 units will also be provided for social housing in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500070#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greenhouse Gas Emissions","counter":435,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500070#WRP01050"},{"type":"question","counter":436,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[52393\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500070#WRP01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the extent if any of fines or penalties imposed on this country to date arising from failure to meet carbon emission reduction targets; the extent of any such potential penalties in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"967"},{"type":"speech","counter":437,"content":"<p>No fines or penalties have ever been imposed on Ireland in respect of greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, as non-compliance has never arisen.<\/p><p>  In this regard, Ireland is on course to confirm compliance with its target for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in the commitment period 2008 to 2012.<\/p><p>  In respect of the ambitious greenhouse gas emission reduction target for the period 2013 to 2020, while this target will prove challenging to achieve , I am satisfied that Ireland is on course to comply with the mitigation trajectory in the first half of this compliance period.

In both 2012 and 2013, these resources were supplemented by seven temporary clerical officers working in the Navan offices for up to three months to deal with the now annual issuance and renewal of licences in the sectors regulated by the Authority.  I understand my Department and the Authority will be looking to provide a similar seasonal increase to the PSRA's resources in 2014. <\/p><p>  My Department, the Authority and the Property Registration Authority of Ireland (PRAI) agreed in 2012, to allow for the operation of the first year of registration and licencing, that resources of the PRAI based in Roscommon were made available to the PSRA on a loan basis so that the once-off surge in activity associated with this phase of the PSRA's activities could be managed effectively within the constraints on public service numbers. <\/p><p>  My Department is in receipt of a detailed business case from the PSRA setting out its long term resource requirements and I understand my Department has indicated its commitment to providing the appropriate and necessary resources either directly or on a contracted basis having regard, in particular, to pressures on public service staff numbers and competing demands.  I am advised that in the current quarter, a Dublin based office has been established through the redeployment of staff from elsewhere in the Department and by year end this office will have over five full time equivalents.  In addition to this, I am further advised that through redeployments and transfers from within the Department and Justice Group, it is expected that the Navan office will receive a further three staff members.  Therefore, including the assignments proposed, the PSRA staff allocation is expected to grow from just over ten full-time equivalents earlier this year to almost nineteen full time equivalents by early next year. <\/p><p>  A key role of the Authority is to set and enforce standards in the provision of property services by auctioneers, letting agents and property management agents and to provide redress mechanisms for consumers of those services.  Under the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, the Authority is empowered to investigate complaints made against property service providers and to initiate investigations for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the law.  Any person may make a complaint, in writing, to the Authority against a property service provider in relation to the provision of a property service provider in the course of providing a property service. <\/p><p>  Having regard to the staffing resources available, there has been for some time a backlog in the handling of complaints by the Authority and I am advised that to date the Authority has received of the order of 330 complaints.  With the introduction of additional staff resources to the Authority during November, I understand that there has been a specific focus on addressing complaints.  With further staff resources to be allocated to the Authority shortly, this should allow for further work in this regard.

","asker":"1015","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":555,"content":"<p>The &ldquo;Plants for the Future&rdquo; discussion document was produced in 2006 by Professor Charles Spillane, National University of Galway with the primary objective of providing Irish input into the development of a strategic research agenda for Plant research in Europe. It was based on an e-survey consultation that was sent to over 800 stakeholders in Ireland, including officials in my Department, from which he received detailed responses from 100 respondents. Following the compilation of this document, it was then disseminated to the stakeholders contacted initially. Further information is available at .<\/p><p>  Since then, my Department established the industry based Agri Research Expert Advisory Group (AREA), chaired by Matt Dempsey. The AREA group developed a national strategic research agenda for agri- production research entitled &lsquo;Stimulating Sustainable Agricultural Production through Research and Innovation&rsquo; in 2011. This agenda has guided my Department&rsquo;s last two research calls and contains a chapter dedicated to Crops research.<\/p><p>  The question of the continued operation of Teagasc activities in particular locations is an operational matter for Teagasc. They have decided that Kinsealy is no longer a strategic centre for the organisation given that they also operate from sites in Ashtown and the Botanic Gardens. The move from Kinsealy to Ashtown will allow Teagasc optimize the usage of this Centre where excellent facilities have been developed in recent years. Teagasc believe that they can adequately support the horticultural industry from Ashtown and the Botanic Gardens and through closer co-operation with producer clients to undertake specific research at their facilities.<\/p><p>  I believe that the horticulture sector benefited from the merger of Bord Glas with Bord Bia in 2004. It provided Irish horticulture producers access to the wide network of skilled and professional marketing expertise available in Bord Bia offices. The success of this approach is very evident in the range of marketing, promotion and development activities that Bord Bia carry out in support of and in conjunction with the Horticultural Industry on the domestic and export market. An example of this activity is Bord Bia&rsquo;s annual organisation of Bloom in the Phoenix Park which attracts over 100,000 people and is an event that provides an important platform for the horticultural industry to exhibit and promote its products and services.<\/p><p>  The College of Horticulture in Warrenstown, County Meath was a private college, owned and managed by the Salesians of Don Bosco. The decision to close the college in 2009 was taken by the College owners following lengthy discussions and consultation between the Trustees and Teagasc. A process was then successfully put in place to transfer Teagasc supported staff and education programmes in Warrenstown to the College of Amenity Horticulture in the Botanic Gardens. This College is currently being upgraded with new classrooms and student accommodation facilities.<\/p><p>  New facilities were also opened in Kildalton College in 2009 following a &euro;4m capital investment. The allocation of staff resources to Kildalton is an operational matter for Teagasc. I understand that staffing levels have been static at the College for a number of years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500075#WRU00500","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Areas of Conservation Designation","counter":556,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500075#WRU00525"},{"type":"question","counter":557,"qnumday":202,"qnumall":"[52309\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500075#WRU00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will clarify the regulations from the EU and or from his Department regarding the fencing of non-commonage land in special areas of conservation and in special protection areas.","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":558,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[52310\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500075#WRU00700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the criteria applied to retention of single farm payment for lack of fencing on non-commonage land in special areas of conservation and special protection areas.","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"question","counter":559,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[52311\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500075#WRU00800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will clarify the regulations of the National Parks and Wildlife Service regarding the fencing of non-commonage land in special areas of conservation and special protection areas.","asker":"1047","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":560,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202 to 204, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  My Department, in the context of delivering the Single Payment Scheme, Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and other area-related schemes, is required to carry out a comprehensive set of administrative and on the ground checks to ensure that all scheme requirements are fulfilled before any payment issues.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, in the case of exclusively owned land, a permanent fence will normally define the area to be measured.

Following two devastating collapses of the Celtic Sea Herring Fishery, the recovery plan identified the special area known as the &ldquo;Dunmore Box&rdquo; as an important area for herring reproduction. The Sentinel fishery was established in order to have a small fishery which would act as a sentinel or  indicator of the state of the overall herring stock in the area.<\/p><p>  In 2011, I asked the fishing industry and other interested parties to make proposals on the future management arrangements for all Irish herring fisheries, the Celtic Sea stock, the stocks off the North West coast and the Atlanto Scandian stock. The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure an economically and biologically sustainable fishery. I received over 20 sets of proposals and comments in relation to herring stocks management. It was very clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how the future herring fishing opportunities should be managed.  I asked my Department to examine the proposals received and to prepare for me a number of options, which as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.<\/p><p>  On 22 December 2011, I published a draft policy document on the matter which I believe met the objectives to the greatest extent possible. I consulted and met industry regarding the draft policy and again there was no consensus.<\/p><p>  Having considered all views and having regard to the sustainability of the fisheries, I came to a decision which I believe provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of the herring stocks.  The review increased the proportion of the overall  proportion of fish which could be caught in the sentinel fishery from 8% to 11%. The outcome of the rebuilding plan has meant that the overall Celtic Sea herring quota has increased from a low of 6,000 tonnes in 2009 to a possible quota of over 19,000t for 2014. In real terms this means that between the review and rebuilding plan there will be an increase in quota for the Sentinel fishery from 480t in 2009 to a possible 2090t in 2014.<\/p><p>  The decisions I made during the review were based on a clear, detailed and objective assessment of the fisheries in recent years and is intended to ensure the long term sustainability of the herring fisheries, which I believe it is delivering and I do not intend to revisit this policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500075#WRU01100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disadvantaged Areas Scheme Payments","counter":564,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500075#WRU01150"},{"type":"question","counter":565,"qnumday":206,"qnumall":"[52453\/13]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2013120500075#WRU01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the position regarding disadvantaged areas money in respect of a person (details supplied) in County Kerry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
