It is important that we take steps to ensure that a sustainable supply of medicines. This Government is committed to reducing the cost of medicines for Irish patients and a number of actions are currently reducing medicine costs.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to new medicines, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 sets out the conditions under which new medicines can be reimbursed in the community drugs schemes. Before approving reimbursement of a new medicine, the HSE is required to consider a number of criteria, including the potential or actual impact of a medicine, its cost-effectiveness, the health needs of the public and the resources available to the HSE. The HSE therefore undertakes a robust analysis of the pricing points of new medicines and this is factored into negotiations with manufacturers. In the negotiation process, the HSE will often seek significant price reductions so that medicines reimbursed are both cost-effective and affordable.<\/p>  <p>  The pricing arrangement agreed with IPHA last year is providing ongoing and increasing savings, both for the taxpayer and for patients in pharmacies. Under the 2016 Framework Agreement,  medicines are now subject to an annual downward only price realignment. In addition, the price will ensure that the State achieves better value for money on the cost of medicines as prices in the reference countries are adjusted downwards over time. It also ensures that the prices paid by Ireland remain in line with other member states. The agreement, which also includes a rebate of 5.25% is estimated to reduce expenditure on medicines by up to &euro;750 million over 4 years.<\/p>  <p>  Reference pricing for generics is also an important pricing mechanism. Medicines which are off patent are subject to generic substitution and reference pricing. The list of medicines approved for substitution, which allows pharmacies to dispense the most cost effective version of a drug to patients continues to expand.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of biosimilars, the equivalent of generics for very expensive and complex biologic products, will free up significant resources to allow more people to be treated across the health system. The estimated expenditure in Ireland on six biologic medicines that are due to lose exclusivity over the next 3 years was approximately &euro;170 million in 2015. My department is developing a biosimilars policy in order to maximise the benefit of these products throughout clinical decision making and supply. Recognising the importance of biosimilar medicines, the 2016 framework agreement included a 30% reduction on the price of a biologic medicine when a biosimilar is launched in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  International cooperation on pricing and reimbursement of new medicines is also an opportunity to secure better value for individual medicines. In June 2016, the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council adopted conclusions on strengthening the balance in the pharmaceutical systems in the EU and its member states.  Those conclusions invited member states to explore opportunities for cooperation on pricing and reimbursement of medicines and to identify areas for cooperation which could contribute to affordability and better access to medicines.  I have indicated my support for these measures and I welcome the opportunity for member states to cooperate by sharing information, so that we can achieve affordable and sustainable access to medicines. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I used the opportunity at the second Round Table meeting for European Health Ministers and heads of Europe-based pharmaceutical companies in Portugal last December, and the recent OECD meeting in January, to engage with Ministers from other countries on how to address the challenge of securing access to new medicines for citizens at an affordable price.<\/p>  <p>  The commitment to reduce the cost of medicines includes reducing prescription charges for medical card holders.  I have begun this process by reducing the prescription charge and monthly cap for medical card holders over 70, and their dependants, on an administrative basis, pending the enactment of the required legislation.<\/p>  <p>  My department continues to examine new ways to achieve efficiencies in the cost of medicines. The HSE keeps the price of medicines under ongoing review, and works continuously to achieve greater efficiencies in the areas of drug pricing, supply and distribution. The Executive has a number of initiatives already underway or in development, particularly under the National Drug Cost Management Programme and the Medicines Management Programme, which provides national leadership relating to issues such as the quality of the medicines management process, access to medicines and overall expenditure on medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800073#WRB01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Maternity Services Provision","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800073#WRB01400"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":58,"qnumall":"[11898\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800073#WRB01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to implement the 20 week anomaly scan on site at Cavan General Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":111,"content":"<p>I am advised that foetal anomaly scans are available in all Hospital Groups.

Therefore, the implications of ceasing primary PCI services at UHW will be addressed by undertaking a national review of all primary PCI services with the aim to ensure that as many patients as possible have access on a 24\/7 basis to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack.  <\/p>  <p>  I should also mention that while Dr Herity found that the needs of the effective catchment population of UHW can be accommodated in a single cath lab, he recommended increased investment in cardiology services at the hospital.  I am therefore pleased to confirm that an additional &euro;.5m funding has been provided to UHW in 2017 which will enable the hospital to provide 2 additional cath lab sessions (8 hours) per week.

It is also noteworthy that the Oireachtas Committee on Future Health in its 2nd Interim Report in January 2017 noted that all stake holders that came before the Committee highlighted the need to develop electronic healthcare records in the healthcare system.  In 2013 my Department published an eHealth strategy which outlined a way forward to improve the use of information technology including electronic healthcare records to support health care efficiency and importantly patient safety. <\/p>  <p>  In order to improve the penetration of ICT across the health services and to provide an integration capability to support new models of care, significant new systems deployments, that can provide the necessary patient information across the continuum of care, particularly between Primary\/Community and the Acute sector, are now required.  This is what the National Electronic Health Record Programme business case is designed to do by providing, a structured, prioritised approach to the deployment of core technology to allow information to flow between the various care settings and also within those settings.  It is a programme of work to make patient information available through technology to support improved patient care, safety and efficiency. It is not a single system or technology but a structured coherent programme to improve the quality and the availability of information across the system, facilitated by the Individual Health Identifier to provide the necessary integration.  It is worth noting that the National EHR programme has been designed to specifically build on the investments to date in the current suite of systems such the patient administration systems, radiology and other ICT projects and to avoid a big bang approach and unnecessary disruption to current key systems.  The EHR business case looks at 5 year and 9 year scenarios.<\/p>  <p>  The scale and the scope of this investment programme is significantly larger than any other information technology programmes to date in Irish health care and the linkage with the provision of an electronic health record in the context of the New Children's Hospital is also being examined.  Technology projects in the public sector using voted funds require a peer review process with the Office of Chief Government Information Officer (OGCIO) in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  My Department is working closely with the OGCIO and other stakeholders to develop a robust independent review mechanism appropriate to the scale and complexity of the investment required and its is also being considered in the context of the Mid Year Capital Review currently underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800074#WRC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disabilities Assessments","counter":136,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800074#WRC00800"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[12089\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800074#WRC00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the action being taken by the HSE to ensure that children requiring assessments for services under the Disability Act 2005 receive them within the statutory timeframe.","asker":"1262","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":138,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

I am pleased that initial engagement with GP representative bodies to progress this process has commenced and I look forward to constructive and positive further engagements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800075#WRD00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Services","counter":174,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800075#WRD00950"},{"type":"question","counter":175,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[12088\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800075#WRD01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans in place to expand services at Bantry hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1262","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":176,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800075#WRD01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Departments","counter":177,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800075#WRD01150"},{"type":"question","counter":178,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[11839\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800075#WRD01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to refurbish the emergency department at Cavan General Hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":179,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[11820\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800075#WRD01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will ensure that a project (details supplied) is included in the 2017 HSE capital programme due to the inadequate facilities at the health facility at present; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":180,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 110 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Emergency Department in Cavan has been performing well this winter and is not currently a site of concern.  <\/p>  <p>  The RCSI Hospital Group has identified the need for development of the resuscitation area in Cavan Emergency Department.

This declined to 68  in 2016, despite a background of increasing demands overall on Child and Adolescent Mental Health services.  It is important to note, that the number of admissions does not necessarily equate to the actual number of children admitted, as an individual child may be admitted on more than one occasion in any given year.  In 2016, there were a total of 380 Child and Adolescent Mental Health admissions, of which 312 (82%) were to age-appropriate units and  68 (18%) were to Adult Units.  In terms of bed days used, in 2016, based on the most recent figures available, 97.4% of bed days used were in Child and Adolescent Inpatient Units.  Performance generally continues to be above the HSE Service Plan target figure of 95%, and indications are that where a child has been admitted to an adult acute in-patient unit, the length of stay has been kept to a minimum. <\/p>  <p>  The current HSE Service Plan allows for some operational flexibility surrounding emergency placements in Adult Units, particularly where very short-term placements take place.  Full account is taken of all relevant factors such as the preferences of all those involved, and geographical factors relating to access or visiting.  In this context, the HSE continues to closely monitor on a weekly basis all child admissions to adult units, with a view to minimising such admissions as much as possible. <\/p>  <p>  I, and my Department officials, regularly meet with the HSE to review various mental health issues, including the potential for further improvement on age appropriate CAMHS admissions.  In addition, relevant data is published as part of the monthly Performance Reports, available on the HSE website, and this is subject to regular monitoring by the Department of Health.  I will continue to engage with the Executive over coming months, on possible additional Child and Adolescent Mental Health acute beds, and also further enhancing community based care for young people nationally, as additional mental health staffing comes on-stream.  Bearing in mind all the circumstances, I am satisfied that, where children have to be placed short-term in adult mental health units, the Executive makes any special arrangements necessary, such as one-to-one care, to protect and monitor these young people.  The Mental Health Commission is also notified of such admissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800075#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Primary Care Centres Data","counter":184,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800075#WRD01650"},{"type":"question","counter":185,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[12081\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800075#WRD01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of centres with regard to the primary care centre projects announced on 17 July 2012 that are now open; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":186,"content":"<p>Delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation.

It is important that we take steps to ensure a sustainable supply of medicines.  This Government is committed to reducing the cost of medicines for Irish patients and a number of actions are currently reducing medicine costs.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to new medicines, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 sets out the conditions under which new medicines can be reimbursed in the community drugs schemes.  Before approving reimbursement of a new medicine, the HSE is required to consider a number of criteria, including the potential or actual impact of a medicine, its cost-effectiveness, the health needs of the public and the resources available to the HSE.  The HSE therefore undertakes a robust analysis of the pricing points of new medicines and this is factored into negotiations with manufacturers.  In the negotiation process, the HSE will often seek significant price reductions so that medicines reimbursed are both cost-effective and affordable.<\/p>  <p>  The pricing arrangement agreed with IPHA last year is providing ongoing and increasing savings, both for the taxpayer and for patients in pharmacies.  Under the 2016 Framework Agreement, medicines are now subject to an annual downward only price realignment.  In addition, the price will ensure that the State achieves better value for money on the cost of medicines as prices in the reference countries are adjusted downwards over time.  It also ensures that the prices paid by Ireland remain in line with other member states.  The agreement, which also includes a rebate of 5.25% is estimated to reduce expenditure on medicines by up to &euro;750 million over 4 years.<\/p>  <p>  Reference pricing for generics is also an important pricing mechanism.  Medicines which are off patent are subject to generic substitution and reference pricing.  The list of medicines approved for substitution, which allows pharmacies to dispense the most cost effective version of a drug to patients continues to expand.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of biosimilars, the equivalent of generics for very expensive and complex biologic products, will free up significant resources to allow more people to be treated across the health system.  The estimated expenditure in Ireland on six biologic medicines that are due to lose exclusivity over the next 3 years was approximately &euro;170 million in 2015.  My department is developing a biosimilars policy in order to maximise the benefit of these products throughout clinical decision making and supply.  Recognising the importance of biosimilar medicines, the 2016 framework agreement included a 30% reduction on the price of a biologic medicine when a biosimilar is launched in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  International cooperation on pricing and reimbursement of new medicines is also an opportunity to secure better value for individual medicines.  In June 2016, the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council adopted conclusions on strengthening the balance in the pharmaceutical systems in the EU and its member states.  Those conclusions invited member states to explore opportunities for cooperation on pricing and reimbursement of medicines and to identify areas for cooperation which could contribute to affordability and better access to medicines.  I have indicated my support for these measures and I welcome the opportunity for member states to cooperate by sharing information, so that we can achieve affordable and sustainable access to medicines.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I used the opportunity at the second Round Table meeting for European Health Ministers and heads of Europe-based pharmaceutical companies in Portugal last December, and the recent OECD meeting in January, to engage with Ministers from other countries on how to address the challenge of securing access to new medicines for citizens at an affordable price.<\/p>  <p>  The commitment to reduce the cost of medicines includes reducing prescription charges for medical card holders.  I have begun this process by reducing the prescription charge and monthly cap for medical card holders over 70, and their dependants, on an administrative basis, pending the enactment of the required legislation.<\/p>  <p>  My department continues to examine new ways to achieve efficiencies in the cost of medicines.  The HSE keeps the price of medicines under ongoing review, and works continuously to achieve greater efficiencies in the areas of drug pricing, supply and distribution.  The Executive has a number of initiatives already underway or in development, particularly under the National Drug Cost Management Programme and the Medicines Management Programme, which provides national leadership relating to issues such as the quality of the medicines management process, access to medicines and overall expenditure on medicines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800076#WRE01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Investigations","counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800076#WRE01200"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[11899\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800076#WRE01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of investigations ongoing into the care of vulnerable adults in foster care, residential settings or any other State care setting; the number of investigations into the care of vulnerable adults in foster care, residential settings or any other State care setting in each of the years 2013 to 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":209,"content":"<p>The safety and protection of vulnerable people in the care of the State is paramount.

Since 2012, the actual capital and revenue expenditure (excluding salaries) on healthcare ICT has risen from &euro;110.0m to &euro;167.3m in 2016. While significant improvements have taken place it is recognised that Ireland's expenditure in this area is below the amount needed to provide the optimum contribution that eHealth and ICT can make and that is why there is now a strategic approach underpinning these investments. The estimated current HSE ICT expenditure for 2017 is around 1.2% (inclusive of capital and revenue but excluding salaries) of all HSE health expenditure. International experience would indicate that a figure between 2% and 3% of total health expenditure would be required, in this strategic area, to provide the requisite investment for modern health environments. Based on 2017 gross vote figures a 2% spend on ICT would amount to a figure &euro;292.0m and 3% of around &euro;438.0m p.a.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of planning the future deployment of ICT the HSE has developed a strategic programme for the rollout of a national electronic health care record that outlines how an improved investment profile could build on the current investments made to date and provide the necessary systems environment to improve patient care and efficiency and also support new models of care.  The key areas of focus for these additional systems would be in the acute, primary and community sectors where there is a need to have a shared care record so that GP's and Community Care can see what is happening with patients in a timely way for scheduling and care planning and to maximise improved information sharing across the continuum of the patient journey. In the acute care setting, systems are needed to improve safety and efficiency such as Order Communications and Results Reporting on wards, clinical note taking, closed loop medication and other critical departmental systems for specialist areas such as oncology, nephrology and surgical care. These are the core components that comprise an electronic health care environment and are not currently available in most Irish hospitals. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the ICT supports for managing waiting list challenges, the Office of the Chief Information Officer of the HSE outlined a number of possible technology solutions that might assist in improving the efficiency of the current arrangements.

It recognises that the implementation of its recommendations will have significant resource implications, including staffing.<\/p>  <p>  The Report identifies that the number of substitute teachers necessary to cover for teacher absences is an important variable in any teacher supply model. The Action Plan for Education for 2017 contains commitments to progress the recommendations this year.<\/p>  <p>  The specific information sought by the Deputy is not readily available. However, an analysis of the data for one recent school day indicated that 3,661 primary substitute teachers were paid for that day.

LPT is collected and administered by the Revenue Commissioners and is remitted to the Central Fund.  The Minister for Finance pays an equivalent to the amount collected in LPT into the Local Government Fund.  The Revenue Commissioners publish LPT information including details of LPT collected in all local authority areas on their website at the following link: . <\/p><p>In 2015 and 2016, &euro;548,029,200 and &euro;588,636,453, respectively, were provided to local authorities from the Local Government Fund (LGF). The following tables outline the amount of funding provided to each local authority from the LGF in 2015 and 2016. <\/p><p>The audited accounts of the LGF are available on my department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font><\/p><p>. The 2016 accounts are currently being prepared. <\/p><p>Local retention of LPT commenced in 2015. The Government decided that no local authority would receive less income from LPT in 2015 and 2016 than they received as General Purpose Grants (GPGs) from the Local Government Fund in 2014.  Given that local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and income sources, the Government decided that 80% of LPT is retained locally to fund public services.  The remaining 20% is re-distributed to provide equalisation funding to certain local authorities that have lower property tax bases due to the variance in property values and density across the State.  In accordance with the decisions taken by Government, no local authority received less discretionary income from LPT in 2015 or 2016 than they received as General Purpose Grants (GPGs) from the Local Government Fund in 2014, unless of course, the authority itself decided to reduce its LPT rate and forfeit the income in line with the power available to local authorities to vary the basic rate of LPT in their respective areas by up to 15%. <\/p><p>The LPT allocations to individual local authorities, amounting to &euro;459m for 2015 and &euro;453m for 2016, along with details of the amounts retained locally in each local authority area, local variation decisions, equalisation amounts etc., are published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links: Local Authority 2015 LPT Allocations:<font color=\"#0000FF\">  <\/font><\/p><p>.<\/p><p>Local Authority 2016 LPT Allocations:<font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font>. <\/p><p>Sixteen local authorities were net contributors and 15 local authorities were net recipients of equalisation funding in 2015. In 2016, 15 local authorities were net contributors and 16 local authorities were net recipients of equalisation funding.  Details of the 20% contribution from all local authorities and the distribution of equalisation funding for both years are set out in the 2015 and 2016 LPT allocations web links referred to above.  The shortfall between the total amounts required for equalisation funding purposes and the 20% contribution from local authorities is met by the Exchequer.  This approach ensures that every local authority has a basic minimum level of funding available to it.  This is a significant investment by the State in the future of local government in a challenging national fiscal situation. <\/p><p>The same formula has been applied to all local authorities who needed to receive equalisation top-up funding from the Local Government Fund.  The minimum LPT funding baseline in 2015 and 2016 is linked to previous General Purpose Grant amounts provided to authorities in 2014.  The needs of local authorities vary significantly across the State, depending on a very complex range of factors.  While there is undoubtedly an infinite suite of options that could be utilised to manage the distribution of LPT between these competing demands, the Government has decided that the current methodology is appropriate as an equitable, comparable, consistent and balanced approach, taking all the relevant factors into account.  It should also be noted that LPT is just one source of income for local authorities, with commercial rates and other local charges, for example, providing significant funding for the sector along with grants from Government Departments, such as my Department, and other bodies. My Department keeps the allocation mechanism under review to ensure equitable treatment for all local authorities.  Matters relating to equalisation levels and allocation methods for future years will be reviewed as necessary and appropriate. <\/p><p>Section 20 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 provides local authority members with the power to vary the rates of LPT in their areas from 2015 onwards by up to 15%.  Any changes to this legislation are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance. If an authority decides to vary the LPT basic rate upwards (by up to 15%) it retains 100% of the resultant additional income collected in that area.  Likewise, if the rate is reduced, the authority forgoes the full amount of the reduced income collected. <\/p><p>The elected members of 14 local authorities decided to reduce the LPT rates by between 1.5% and 15% for 2015 while 17 left the rates unchanged.  11 local authorities voted to reduce the LPT rates for 2016 by between 1.5% and 15%, with the remaining 20 leaving the rates unchanged.  Details of the varied rates in individual local authorities for both years are set out in the 2015 and 2016 LPT allocations web links referred to above.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800082#WRL01550","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":403,"content":"<p>Table 1 &ndash; Funding to local authorities from Local Government Fund in 2015 Local AuthorityDescriptionPayments from LGF - 2015Carlow County CouncilLocal Property Tax Allocations5,352,469.02Public Participation Networks50,000.00Rural Water Programme Liaison Officer Salary15,236.86Rural Water Programme - Group Water Schemes Subsidy Payments189,211.54Recoupment of Lost Income from Rates on Water Infrastructure48,862.00Flood Relief21,886.00Total: 5,677,665.42Cavan County CouncilLocal Property Tax Allocations8,458,414.98Public Participation Networks24,975.00Rural Water Programme - Group Water Schemes Subsidy Payments3,485,881.65Local Authority Water Services Capital Loans Recoupment184,596.11Recoupment of Lost Income from Rates on Water Infrastructure27,614.34Pilot Social Inclusion Units50,969.09Flood Relief41,526.00Total: 12,273,977.17Clare County CouncilLocal Property Tax Allocations6,763,901.58Public Participation Networks50,000.00Rural Water Programme Liaison Officer Salary35,552.67Rural Water Programme - Group Water Schemes Subsidy Payments1,012,045.00Local Authority Water Services Capital Loans Recoupment732,785.90Recoupment of Lost Income from Rates on Water Infrastructure165,023.00Flood Relief900,000.00Total: 9,659,308.15Cork City CouncilLocal Property Tax Allocations8,013,088.56Public Participation Networks100,000.00Local Authority Water Services Capital Loans Recoupment1,822,773.39Recoupment of Lost Income from Rates on Water Infrastructure711,651.00Pilot Social Inclusion Units39,711.70Temporary Mortuary16,987.48Total: 10,704,212.13Cork County CouncilLocal Property Tax Allocations29,282,224.62Rural Water Programme Liaison Officer Salary15,236.86Rural Water Programme - Group Water Schemes Subsidy Payments102,084.48Local Authority Water Services Capital Loans Recoupment1,005,375.31Recoupment of Lost Income from Rates on Water Infrastructure1,544,069.00Flood Relief135,226.00Local Government Boundary Costs47,499.01Total: 32,131,715.28D.

The first bundle, comprising six PPP sites providing for over 500 units in the greater Dublin area, is being developed in co-operation with the local authorities concerned. Two of the sites are located in Dublin City, with one each in South Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Louth.  Dublin City Council has been appointed to act as the lead local authority for the delivery of the social housing PPP Programme in respect of this first bundle.  It is expected that the process of seeking planning approval for the first bundle will commence within the coming month.<\/p>  <p>  The winning tender for the project will be selected via an advertised tender competition in accordance with EU and national procurement regulations. The procurement process is being led by the National Development Finance Agency. Tenders will be evaluated against pre-defined award criteria which will be a combination of price and qualitative factors such as the quality of design, construction and facilities management services. The criteria will be published with the tender documents. These documents are currently being finalised and are expected to be published in the coming months.<\/p>  <p>  The programme will use what is termed an 'availability-based' PPP model, in which a private sector company designs, builds, finances and maintains the social housing units over a 25 year period in return for a monthly 'unitary payment'.  The 'availability based' model being applied has been used successfully in Ireland to deliver roads, schools and courthouses. The housing units are handed back to the local authority after 25 years in a predefined, good quality condition. The sites remain in State ownership for the entire period.<\/p>  <p>  The relevant local authorities will retain responsibility for tenant nomination and allocation of units during the contract period.  Tenants allocated to PPP units will be drawn from the local authority social housing waiting list in accordance with that local authority's allocation scheme. The tenants will be subject to standard arrangements as apply to other social housing allocations, including in respect of the charging of differential rent.<\/p>  <p>  The amount of the unitary payment is a bid item in the selection of the preferred tender. This means that when a bidder tenders for the PPP project, the level of monthly payment is considered in assessing the competing tenders. This is to ensure that the State receives value for money. The unitary payments commence once construction is complete and the units are ready to house tenants. <\/p>  <p>  The Central PPP Unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform provides guidance in relation to PPP projects. It sets out four specific value for money, or VFM, tests that are applied in the case of PPPs over the course of the planning and procurement process.  These tests focus on assessing whether or not the PPP approach compares favourably with the alternative cost of using traditional procurement to achieve the same result.  The purpose, sequence and format of the four VFM tests in the PPP approval process are set out clearly in the central PPP guidance. <\/p>  <p>  The National Development Finance Agency prepared a Provisional PPP Assessment Report in 2014 on behalf of the Department of Finance, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department.  This report constituted a qualitative PPP assessment as the first of the four VFM tests that are required for all PPP projects. The other VFM tests are being undertaken as part of the process of assessment and planning involved in the further development of the bundles of sites identified for the programme.<\/p>  <p>  The next VFM test involves preparation of the Public Sector Benchmark. This presents the calculated costs of undertaking the project through the traditional model of delivering social housing, and is currently being prepared. This cost will then be compared against the successful tender in the PPP competition. If the PPP tender cost is less than the cost of undertaking the project through traditional means, then it is considered that the project is 'Value for Money' and the contract may be awarded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800082#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Sharing Arrangements","counter":418,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800083#WRM00150"},{"type":"question","counter":419,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[12399\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800083#WRM00200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will release all datasets from his Department in open format as defined under the open data technical framework and re-use of public sector information regulations 2015; if he will release a dataset (details supplied) in an open format as defined in the framework and regulations; if not, the reasons for refusing to do this; and the reason his Department is of the view that this dataset should not be published in open format in the initial instance.

Famine was declared in parts of South Sudan in recent weeks and the UN is now calling for urgent action to avoid famine in Yemen. Conflict is having a severe impact on the populations in both countries, leading to acute hunger and increased displacement.  We use every opportunity we have internationally to focus on the unprecedented level of humanitarian need globally, including at the Foreign Affairs Council.<\/p>  <p>  South Sudan, where 7.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, was last discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in December 2016.  The Council issued a strong political statement calling on all parties to end the violence, and to allow unhindered humanitarian access to those in need.  <\/p>  <p>  The EU is providing very significant humanitarian assistance to South Sudan.  Since the outbreak of the conflict in December 2013, the Commission has provided over &euro;420 million in humanitarian funding, including an emergency aid package of &euro;82 million announced last month.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has provided over &euro;31 million in humanitarian assistance to the South Sudan crisis since December 2013, including over &euro;11 million in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The conflict and humanitarian crisis in Yemen was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels this week.  It is estimated that 70% of the Yemeni population of 27 million is now in need of assistance, with 2 million people on the brink of famine. <\/p>  <p>  The EU Commission provided more than &euro;70 million in humanitarian assistance to Yemen during 2016, focused on emergency programmes targeting 4 million people with nutrition and food assistance.

In a community rated market this helps to spread the costs of older and less healthy people across all insured persons.

It also includes an integration capability to support new models of care - significant new systems deployments that can provide the necessary patient information across the continuum of care, particularly between Primary\/Community and the Acute sector. <\/p><p>The business case sets out a number of investment scenarios including timescales for implementation and roll out. In the business case, a 5 year and a 9 year technology investment programme is developed but there is flexibility within its scope to stretch out timescales further.  The total of all estimated costs including business change elements for a 5 year implementation are in the range of &euro;647m to &euro;875m respectively and the 9 year figure is between &euro;609m-&euro;824m.  The five year scenario could be considered a &lsquo;fast track&rsquo; approach.  These costs would only arise if full implementation in all sites were to take place.  The costs have been estimated based on market engagements in 2015\/16. <\/p><p>A technology and business change project of this scale and scope has a number of inherent risks.  Realistic timescales are important to ensure that the adoption of both the technology and the business change required by front line staff can be absorbed and managed in a coherent way.  In addition to resourcing the EHR project with substantial manpower and financial resources, experience from other countries demonstrates that the vendor markets supplying many of these services needs to be carefully managed in terms of capacity and capability to deliver working tailored solutions in a satisfactory manner.<\/p><p>Cross country comparisons on ICT and eHealth spending are difficult to make due to the variety of health system arrangements.

In accordance with the Act, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependents.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines but where they may face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.<\/p><p>Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.  As at week ending 3rd February 2017, 99% of medical card applications received by the Primary Care Reimbursement Services were processed within a 15 day timeframe.<\/p><p>All applications or reviews concerning medical and GP visit cards must be supported with a range of documentation, as outlined on the application forms.  Where such supporting documentation is not supplied or is incomplete, to enable the assessment of the application, in accordance with the National Assessment Guidelines, the HSE will issue correspondence to the applicant specifying the additional information required to progress the assessment of their application.  Clearly the processing time for incomplete applications is dependent on the furnishing of the required documentation by the applicant.<\/p><p>It is important that people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.  It is clear greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 117,854 as of 1st February this year.  This followed the measures announced by my predecessor Minister Varadkar, when the &quot;Keane&quot; <i>Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility<\/i>was published.  The &quot;Keane&quot; Report found that it is not feasible, desirable or ethically justifiable to list medical conditions for medical card eligibility.  On foot of the publication of the report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  Its establishment followed the completion of the work of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility and demonstrates the HSE's commitment to the development of a medical system which is responsive and considerate  of an applicant's particular circumstances.<\/p><p>The HSE has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to an emergency situation for persons with a serious medical condition in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and persons in palliative care, who are terminally ill.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are issued on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the medical card eligibility.  These cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant.  For terminally ill persons, no means test applies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800090#WRT03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":670,"content":"<p>Question No. 251 answered with Question No. 204.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Accommodation Provision","counter":672,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800091#WRU00200"},{"type":"question","counter":673,"qnumday":252,"qnumall":"[12414\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800091#WRU00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which he can provide or avail of step-down bed accommodation in all areas throughout the country as a means of alleviating overcrowding in public hospitals in general; if he has examined the potential use of decommissioned beds or wards in or adjacent to the public hospitals thereby providing an available solution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Ultimately, the rate the RHI\u00a0tariff is set at will be\u00a0a factor of the renewable heat \u00a0technology in question, the size of the boiler or unit\u00a0and the sustainability and air qualify criteria that form part of the new scheme.<\/p><p>Before a new RHI scheme is introduced, the scheme will be subject to Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission.

This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and for those areas that will not be covered by commercial operators the State has committed to intervene and subsidise a network build, so that nobody is left behind.<\/p>  <p>  A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.<\/p>  <p>  There is\u00a0no universal service obligation (USO) for high speed broadband provision or mobile voice services in Ireland.  The current EU and national regulatory framework for telecommunications relates solely to voice telephony and Functional Internet Access (28.8 kilobits per second) and is provided for under the current EU regulatory framework governing telecoms.  In September 2016, the European Commission published an ambitious proposal for the regulation of the European telecoms sector, which aims to incentivise and encourage increased investment in high speed broadband networks.  Negotiations on the review of the EU regulatory framework give Ireland an opportunity to seek inclusion of a USO in respect of high speed broadband connectivity.<\/p>  <p>  In that regard, I have raised the issue of a USO for high speed broadband at EU level.  I am seeking inclusion of a specific provision in the new framework that would allow Member States to apply a USO for high speed broadband, where such networks are available.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also in discussion with the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) as to whether a USO may be a viable instrument in instances\u00a0where a high speed network is available, but individual premises cannot access such services at an affordable price.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800093#WRW02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mobile Telephony Services","counter":765,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800093#WRW02900"},{"type":"question","counter":766,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[12421\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800093#WRW03000","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to introduce a universal service obligation for mobile phone service providers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":767,"content":"<p>The current EU and national regulatory framework for telecommunications allows for the application of a Universal Service Obligation (USO) in respect of fixed voice services.  This framework has, in my view served consumers well over several decades and ensured that householders can get an affordable fixed voice service, regardless of where they are located.<\/p>  <p>  There are no provisions in European or national regulation for a USO in relation to mobile voice services.  Mobile operators are however rolling out 3G and 4G networks across Ireland following ComReg&rsquo;s 2012 Multiband Spectrum auction, with at least one operator now having over 90% population coverage of 4G services.  The rate of demand for data services has, however, increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally.<\/p>  <p>  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task force.  In July 2016, I established the Task Force together with Minister Humphreys to identify immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigate how better services could be provided to consumers prior to the full build and roll-out of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention.  The report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is available on both Departments' websites.<\/p>  <p>  In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities, ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p>  <p>  The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I have signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.<\/p>  <p>  In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band. ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.<\/p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>In parallel, the National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high-speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland, through private investment and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment plans have not been fully demonstrated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800093#WRW03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":769,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800093#WRW03300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Coverage","counter":768,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800093#WRW03200"},{"type":"question","counter":769,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[12317\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017030800093#WRW03300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans to regulate for insurance for hobby drone users; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the two insurance companies here underwritten by UK companies that offer insurance cover for drones will not cover drones used by amateurs and hobbyists; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that there have been a number of accidents and damage to property caused by drones operated by amateurs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1332","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":770,"content":"<p>\u200bThe issues raised are primarily\u00a0operational matters for the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA).
