I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources.<\/p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of the 30 April 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 314 members and 18 Garda Reserves assigned to the Cavan\/Monaghan Division.  A detailed breakdown of these members is in the table.  All Divisional resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit (GNDU), the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) and other specialised units.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, when the financial crisis hit, the Government of the time introduced a moratorium on recruitment and the four year National Recovery Plan, published in 2010, envisaged a steady reduction in Garda numbers.  Thankfully, in a recovering economy, we were able to reopen the Garda College in September 2014, and a total of 700 Garda trainees have been recruited with a further 450 planned to be recruited during the remainder of this year.  So far 463 of the new Garda trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream uniform duties nationwide.  Another 76 will attest on the 7 July with 150 more to attest in November.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; and 11 newly attested Garda&iacute; have been assigned to the Cavan\/Monaghan Garda Division to date.<\/p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme for Government, &quot;<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to<\/font>continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, the current rate of recruitment will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year.  We must, I believe, endeavour to make more rapid progress than this to reach our target of 15,000 and I am engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in relation to increasing the planned annual intake this year and in coming years<font color=\"#000080\">.<\/font><\/p><p><b>CAVAN\/MONAGHAN Garda Division 30 April 2016<\/b><table><tr><th>District<\/th><th>Station<\/th><th>GD<\/th><th>SG<\/th><th>IN<\/th><th>SU<\/th><th>CS<\/th><th>AC<\/th><th>Total<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BAILIEBORO<\/td><td>29<\/td><td>8<\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>38<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BALLYJAMESDUFF<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>COOTEHILL<\/td><td>6<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>KINGSCOURT<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>MULLAGH<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>SHERCOCK<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>VIRGINIA<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BAILIEBORO<\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><td>50<\/td><td>11<\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>62<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BALLYBAY<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CARRICKMACROSS<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>41<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CASTLEBLANEY<\/td><td>23<\/td><td>5<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>28<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>ROCKCORRY<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CARRICKMACROSS<\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><td>57<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>75<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>ARVA<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BALLINAGH<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BALLYCONNELL<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>2<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>16<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BELTURBET<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>6<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>BLACKLION<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CAVAN<\/td><td>52<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>60<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>DOWRA<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>KILLESHANDRA<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>KILNALECK<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>SWANLINBAR<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>CAVAN<\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><td>81<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>95<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>CLONES<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>EMYVALE<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>3<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>MONAGHAN<\/td><td>56<\/td><td>13<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>73<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>SCOTSTOWN<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN<\/td><td>TOTAL<\/td><td>62<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>2<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>82<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><\/td><td>DIVISIONAL TOTAL<\/td><td>250<\/td><td>55<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>5<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>314<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600053#WRC00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600053#WRC00450"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[16448\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600053#WRC00500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"when she will normalise the residency status of a person (details supplied); and if she will put temporary arrangements in place to facilitate the person in resuming employment while she is processing the application.

This ensures that relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, Code of Conduct for Business Lending to Small and Medium Enterprises and the Minimum Competency Code) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which\u00a0comes into operation on 1 July 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Act, if the firm who bought the loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm then the firm must either become regulated themselves or the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank is now the competent authority for the authorisation and supervision of credit servicing firms.

As part of this exercise a full review of all fiscal developments, including tax revenues, will be conducted.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600056#WRF00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fiscal Policy","counter":220,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600056#WRF00450"},{"type":"question","counter":221,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[16440\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600056#WRF00500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the components of the methodology of the medium-term forecasts that were produced using the European Union commonly agreed methodology; how the forecasts are calculated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":222,"qnumday":84,"qnumall":"[16441\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600056#WRF00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the details of the complementary medium-term baseline estimates and why they are better suited to the Irish economy, given the medium-term forecasts that were produced using the European Union commonly agreed methodology and work already commenced to develop a complementary set of medium-term baseline estimates for the supply-side based on methodologies better suited to the characteristics of the Irish economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":223,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[16442\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600056#WRF00700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the work undertaken or plans to develop a complementary set of medium-term baseline estimates for the supply-side, based on methodologies better suited to the characteristics of the Irish economy regarding the medium-term forecasts which are currently produced using the European Union commonly agreed methodology, which is only required for fiscal surveillance and which his Department has long recognised is not appropriate for Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":224,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[16443\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600056#WRF00800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the assertion by the Fiscal Advisory Council that there are risks that signs of overheating may again be missed if he exclusively relies on the commonly agreed methodology; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":225,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 to 86, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's macroeconomic forecasts, as published in the 2016 Stability Programme (SPU) in April, include a number of elements, principally estimates of demand in the economy, and also of the productive capacity, or supply side.  The EU fiscal rules essentially seek to ensure sensible and sustainable\u00a0budgetary policies, taking into account the impact of the economic cycle.  For the purpose of assessing compliance with the fiscal rules, a Commonly Agreed Methodology (CAM) has been developed, which in essence seeks to assess the cyclical position of the economy, and on that basis, the appropriate fiscal policy stance for Member States, including Ireland.  My Department's forecasts\u00a0are prepared in a way which is consistent with the CAM, as required in the context of the European Semester.<\/p>  <p>  As noted in the 2016 SPU, the CAM is subject to limitations particularly when applied to Ireland.  Efforts continue at European level to improve the applicability of the CAM.  As I have outlined in a recent parliamentary question reply (Ref 15737\/16), my Department is in the process of developing alternative models for estimating potential output.  Considerable work has been done on this front and is now nearing completion.  An outline of this work is set out in Box 1, page 24, of the 2016 SPU, published in April.  The intention is to publish the technical work in the short-term.  However, I would stress that for the purposes of assessing the cyclical position of the economy in the context of the fiscal rules, the CAM is still the relevant metric. <\/p>  <p>  I would also emphasise that both myself and my Department remain vigilant to signs of overheating.  Consideration is given to a wide range of indicators, which include, but are not limited to, estimates of the cyclical position of the economy.  My Department has not currently detected signs of\u00a0overheating over the forecast horizon.  Moreover, there are indications of spare capacity in the economy, particularly in the context of the labour market.  Having said that, it is clear that with continued strong growth in the economy, the amount of spare capacity is declining and we must be conscious of this.<\/p>  <p>  The Government, for its part, will not pursue budgetary policies to overheat the economy.  Our emphasis is on continuing to\u00a0implement sensible policies, including budgetary policies, aimed at ensuring sustainable growth and public finances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600056#WRF00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Corporation Tax","counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600056#WRF00950"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[16471\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600056#WRF01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of registered companies; the number that were liable for corporation tax; the number that paid it and the amount they paid; the number that did not pay it, in each case by payment bands (details supplied) in each of the years 2008 to 2015, in tabular form.","asker":"1258","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":228,"content":"<p>I am informed by Revenue that the number of registered companies is available at <i><i><\/i><\/i>.

However, Section 7 (3)(c) of the Equal Status Act 2000 provides that an educational establishment does not discriminate where the establishment is a school providing primary or post-primary education to students and the objective of the school is to provide education in an environment which promotes certain religious values, it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit as a student a person who is not of that denomination and, in the case of a refusal, it is proved that the refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school.  Schools that comply with the requirements of the equality legislation do not therefore discriminate on religious grounds.<\/p>  <p>  It is my view that the desire of parents for diversity in education choice can be provided effectively by focussing on the delivery of the ambition to treble the number of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools as set out in the Programme for Government.  This commitment is to deliver a total of 400 non-denominational and multi-denominational schools by 2030.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also contains a commitment to publish new School Admissions legislation taking account of current draft proposals and addressing issues including publication of school enrolment policies, an end to waiting lists, introduction of annual enrolment structures, and transparency and fairness in admissions for pupils and their parents.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of any advices sought on repealing the provision of the Equal Status Act referred to by the Deputy, the Deputy will be aware that the previously published draft legislative framework for school admissions did not propose any such change to the Equal Status Act.<\/p>  <p>  The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill which was published in April 2015 did not progress through the Houses of the Oireachtas and was not reinstated for the current D&aacute;il session.

Some &euro;8.2 million is being provided in 2016 for the retention by local authorities of 155 specialised waste enforcement officers, critical to tackling issues such as illegal dumping in local communities and in providing an enhanced response on the ground to infractions of the waste code.<\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, under the new pay-by-weight regulatory regime, local authorities will be establishing a register which records the details of households which are using the services of an authorised waste operator (whether a kerbside collector, pay to use compactor or civic amenity facility).  In gathering these details from service providers, local authorities may use this information to target households which appear not to be managing their waste correctly or using the services of an authorised operator and these data will support a number of awareness, education and enforcement programmes already initiated by individual local authorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600061#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Adaptation Grant","counter":379,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600061#WRM00725"},{"type":"question","counter":380,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[16544\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600061#WRM00800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will review the rules of the housing adaption grants for persons with a disability, as administered by local authorities (details supplied), to extend their application to persons with disabilities which are not physical, but which require alterations to homes, to make them safer and more suitable for the disabled person; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Panel&rsquo;s recommendations will now inform the development over the coming weeks of an Executive Strategy aimed at putting an end to the scourge of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland.  In addition, the drafting of the necessary international agreement between the two Governments to establish a four person body to monitor progress on ending paramilitarism is also underway.<\/p><p>The Government is also meeting its financial commitments under the Fresh Start Agreement.  Discussions at senior official level are underway with the Northern Ireland Executive regarding co-operation on infrastructure projects, including the A5 motorway, the Narrow Water Bridge and the Ulster Canal.  The Government&rsquo;s committed funding of &euro;2.5 million to the North West Development Fund has been provided and will be matched by the Executive.<\/p><p>The Executive and the British Government are also proceeding with implementation of their respective commitments under the Fresh Start Agreement.  The Executive signed off on the 2016-17 Budget last December and the Welfare Bill implementing the relevant provisions in the Agreement passed into UK law on 25 November 2015.  The UK Treasury also recently approved the release of monies from the Stormont House Agreement funding to support integrated education.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>The institutional reforms provided for under the Fresh Start Agreement have also been implemented, including the reduction in the number of Executive Ministries from 12 to 9 and the option for parties entitled to a place in the Executive to instead designate as part of the formal opposition in the Assembly.  This option was taken up by both the UUP and the SDLP following last month&rsquo;s election.<\/p><p>With regards to the establishment of a framework for dealing with the legacy of the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement but on which final agreement could not be reached during last year&rsquo;s Fresh Start talks, the Government remains committed to the full implementation of these commitments. <\/p><p>Over the last number of months, officials from my Department have met with a range of victims&rsquo; groups from across the affected communities, to hear their perspectives on how best to establish the legacy institutions and to listen to their views on possible solutions to outstanding issues.  These consultations proved very valuable and will inform my approach to seeking an agreement on the outstanding crucial issues, including finding the appropriate balance between information disclosure and safeguarding national security.  <\/p><p>Since my reappointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I have already had conversations with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and some party leaders on the urgency of now re-engaging on these outstanding issues.  The recent developments in regard to the Kingsmill and Loughinisland massacres, as well as the new policing investigation being launched on the &ldquo;Stakeknife&rdquo; allegations, demonstrate once again how imperative it is to secure agreement on the establishment of dedicated institutions for dealing with the toxic legacy of the past.<\/p><p>In the weeks and months ahead, I will therefore be continuing my active engagement with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties with a view to securing an overall agreement on dealing with the legacy of the past which is vital both for individual victims and survivors and for society as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600064#WRO02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":496,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600064#WRO02050"},{"type":"question","counter":497,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[16467\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600064#WRO02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will consider issuing a text and e-mail providing six months advance notice of a passport's expiry date to passport holders, given the huge backlog that occurs each summer and the problems persons have when they notice their passports are out of date.","asker":"1305","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":498,"content":"<p>As advised in the briefing on the passport applications process that I circulated to Members on 26 May, I am pleased to confirm that the Passport Service already offers a passport reminder service to customers.

All employees including medical staff are required to disclose and report incidents in line with the HSE's Safety Incident Management Policy. Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from the things that go wrong is the bedrock of making systems safer. Open Disclosure is defined as 'an open consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in healthcare. This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event'.<\/p>  <p>  Last November the Government gave its approval to the drafting of provisions to support open disclosure of patient safety incidents. This will be included in the Department of Justice and Equality&rsquo;s Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill which is well advanced. The legislation is part of a broader package of reforms aimed at improving the experience of those who are affected by adverse events. <\/p>  <p>  This legislation builds on the joint development by the HSE and State Claims Agency of the National Policy on Open Disclosure (2013).  The HSE is progressing the implementation of the Policy across all health and social care services.  We all know that when error or harm is experienced by a patient, the trust and confidence of that patient and their family are compromised.  That is why honest, open disclosure and communication, which demonstrate empathy and sensitivity, are so essential. The intent of this legislation is to provide certain legal protections for healthcare staff for open disclosure. This will give further support to those staff in their communications with patients and family members if an adverse event occurs. The Ethical Code of Practice set out by the Medical Council also makes clear the responsibilities of doctors in relation to open disclosure.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600067#WRR02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":601,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600067#WRR02900"},{"type":"question","counter":602,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[16456\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600067#WRR03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the status of a hospital appointment for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":603,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State.  Pricing contracts are purely a matter for agreement between the NTPF and the nursing home in question.  The Department of Health has no role in such individual negotiations.<\/p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;<\/p><p>- Bed and board;<\/p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of everyday living; and<\/p><p>- Laundry service.<\/p><p>Additional charges may not be levied in respect of the above components of care.  A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home.  This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged.  Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in this contract.  The Department of Health are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.<\/p><p>Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes.  The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through  the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600068#WRS01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prescriptions Charges","counter":617,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600068#WRS01100"},{"type":"question","counter":618,"qnumday":216,"qnumall":"[16513\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600068#WRS01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the proportions of the projected cost of prescribed drugs which relate to payment to manufacturers; to wholesale distributors and to retail pharmacists under the general medical scheme and community drug scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

This conclusion was supported by 27 out of 28 Member State toxicology experts, and is in line with the conclusions of other regulatory agencies around the world, including those in Australia, Canada, Japan and the United States.<\/p>  <p>  My Department considers that the EU peer review process for glyphosate has clearly identified safe uses and that the regulatory proposal presented contained appropriate measures for implementation by Member States to address concerns that have been raised.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the legal basis for the appropriate chemical hazard classification of glyphosate in Europe, including its carcinogenic potential, will be provided by an assessment overseen by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), which is due to begin later in 2016 and run for 18 months.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has supported Commission proposals for renewal of approval for Glyphosate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600069#WRT01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Basic Payment Scheme Applications","counter":658,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600069#WRT01800"},{"type":"question","counter":659,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[16490\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600069#WRT01900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 1036 of 17 May 2016, when he will issue a decision and notify a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Ultimately the volume and value of trade depends on relative commodity prices, global supply, currency exchange rates trade and other factors.  US consumption of beef is estimated at 11 million tonnes, approximately 1 million of which is imported.  The potential prize for Irish operators is therefore, subject to the variables already outlined, very significant, particularly in circumstances where grass fed hormone free beef is gaining traction in the market place.  Ireland received a major reputational boost in 2015 as the first EU Member State to gain access to the US market for beef.  This was opened to Irish exports in January 2015 and six plants are approved to export. As with any new market, it takes time to build reputational brand and a customer base, and the real time to assess its value is when these are bedded down. <\/p>  <p>  In volume terms, by the end of December 2015 the figures for exports of beef from Ireland to the US had risen to an estimated 1,800 tonnes which would have an approximate value of &euro;11.5 million.  This represents an exceptionally strong start to this trade considering that the first exports only went in March 2015 and some of the plants were only approved for export in September.     <\/p>  <p>  In Quarter 1 of 2016 approximately 700 tonnes with a value of &euro;6 million are estimated to have been exported to the USA, continuing the positive trends from last year.

My Department is engaging with the US authorities on a regular basis to extend the approval for beef in this way. <\/p>  <p>  US beef prices have fallen back from the peaks recorded in the early part of 2015, and the relatively high prices available for beef in Europe in 2015 meant that US buyers may have been priced out of the market as Irish exporters chose to send product to more valuable markets in the UK and on the continent. <\/p>  <p>  There has also been significant progress in facilitating trade in other international markets for Irish beef. My Department continues to push strongly for market access to other Third Countries and we are currently in the process of trying to secure beef access to other third countries including, inter alia, China, Korea, Israel, Ukraine and   Vietnam.

This &euro;5m allocation will support &lsquo;bottom up&rsquo; projects where:<\/p>  <p>  -  The Local Enterprise Offices will group together to create collaborative projects in their region (&euro;2m) and<\/p>  <p>  - Community organisations will partner with other regional organisations to deliver new job creation projects (&euro;3m).<\/p>  <p>  Further competitive regional funding calls will be rolled out on a phased basis.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of all competitive funding calls, a collaborative approach, tangible jobs impact, enterprise start-up and scaling are amongst the criteria against which applications will be measured.  Accordingly, it is not intended to ringfence funding at county level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600074#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Low Pay Commission Expenditure","counter":814,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600074#WRY00800"},{"type":"question","counter":815,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[16542\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600074#WRY00900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the annual budget she has allocated to the Low Pay Commission; the number of staff directly working for it; if it is sufficiently resourced to carry out its independent evidence-based work; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":816,"content":"<p>The budget for the Low Pay Commission is &euro;474,000 for 2016.

In all cases, the maximum fee payable by parents is &euro;15 per week per child.<\/p><p>-  The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme, which is targeted specifically at participants in the Community Employment (CE) schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.

It should be noted that HIQA was satisfied with the approach taken by the Child and Family Agency, Tusla and the area management to address the issues at the time of the inspection.  Tusla's commitment to addressing the issues in Louth\/Meath was also evidenced in the implementation of a rapid improvement programme in the area, in addition to the normal action plan that follows an inspection.  Many of the actions listed in the action plan associated with the inspection had been completed before HIQA's report was published in June 2015.  I have requested a further update on the ongoing improvements in the area from Tusla, and I will revert to the Deputy when this is to hand.  <\/p>  <p>  My officials have regular meetings on a monthly and quarterly basis with Tusla management to review the overall level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement.  The effect of the rapid improvement programme in the Louth\/Meath area is being monitored and I am pleased to note that the figures reported from the area on the numbers of open cases allocated to a dedicated social worker show an increase from 58% in May 2015 to over 90% of cases allocated in March 2016.  <\/p>  <p>  Both Tusla and my Department are committed to the ongoing improvement of child protection services, including areas where specific issues have been identified.  HIQA, as an independent body, makes its decisions on the timing of inspections using a risk based approach, and it may carry out any further inspections as it considers appropriate.  Between May 2013 and May 2016 HIQA has published inspections of the child protection services in 15 of the 17 Tusla administrative areas.  Inspection reports on the remaining 2 areas are expected to be published later this year. <\/p>  <p>  For the information of the Deputy, I can advise that HIQA is undertaking a thematic review of the service to children and families through Child Welfare &amp;amp; Protection Services, and that the field work for this thematic review is underway.  This process will see the completion of inspections of child welfare and protection service in the remaining two administrative areas during 2016, and a review of the implementation of action taken to address HIQA's inspection findings.  This review will also examine the governance arrangements for the provision of Child Welfare &amp;amp; Protection services.  <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that Tusla is receiving significant additional resources in 2016.  Tusla has been provided with additional funding of &euro;38m in Budget 2016, including funding of over &euro;6 million to reduce the number of cases awaiting allocation of a social worker.  A significant recruitment programme for additional social workers is underway.  As part of its Business Plan for this year, Tusla has committed to a number of key targets to be achieved by the end of 2016.  Tusla has made progress in its targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600074#WRY02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":834,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600074#WRY02800"},{"type":"question","counter":835,"qnumday":288,"qnumall":"[16595\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061600074#WRY02900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the properties her Department and agencies under its remit leased; the number they leased on upward-only rents and the number of the lessors who were involved with the National Asset Management Agency or with any of the State banks; and the details of each lease.","asker":"1235","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":836,"content":"<p>The Appropriation Account for my Department includes no direct payments in respect of rent\/leases.
