While the question remains for now a matter of speculation, pending a decision by a British Government to pursue negotiations with EU partners in advance of holding a referendum on UK membership of the Union, we want the UK to remain a full and integral member of the EU.  We firmly believe this is good for Ireland and our economy and plays a key role in helping to maintain the excellent state of British-Irish relations. It is also our view that the EU is stronger for having the UK amongst its twenty-eight Member States.  The Taoiseach has confirmed this approach, most recently in a speech he made on 13 January to my Department&rsquo;s Conference in Dublin Castle.<\/p>  <p>  By the same logic, the Government&rsquo;s view is that a British departure from the EU would have negative implications for Ireland. Assessing the likely full impact of such a complex scenario is impossible, not least given that much would depend on the terms and conditions of a future UK relationship with the EU.  However, initial analysis co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach and with the involvement of all Government Departments confirms that there is a very wide range of issues which could arise. For a start, the UK&rsquo;s exit would deprive Ireland of a very important ally within the Union on such issues as trade and the deepening of the single market. It would also mean that by far our largest trading partner &ndash; with which we trade almost &euro;1 billion worth of goods and services ever week &ndash; would be outside the EU. It could also have implications for Northern Ireland and for North-South cooperation.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to deepen its analysis and to monitor the situation extremely carefully in the time ahead.  My Department will continue to co-operate very closely with the Department of the Taoiseach and other Departments. The reporting we receive from our Embassy in London and from Embassies elsewhere in the EU will continue to be a vital source of information and analysis.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is determined to play a constructive role in seeking to keep the UK within the EU. That is a priority for the Government.  We will continue to work closely with the UK and other like-minded partners on those policy issues where we share the same interests and approach. We will also support any reasonable proposals for reform of the functioning of the Union, while at the same time making clear where we believe that specific proposals are undesirable or unachievable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200046#WRB01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights Issues","counter":64,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200046#WRB01700"},{"type":"question","counter":65,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[2665\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200046#WRB01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the continued detention of Ibrahim Halawa, in particular the further postponement of his trial, and if he will report on the work of his Department on the case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1197","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":66,"content":"<p>I remain deeply concerned at this individual&rsquo;s continued detention as well as the recent further postponement of his trial.<\/p>  <p>  Previous PQs, including my response to question 19 today (2657\/15),  have set out my approach to this case in some details and the steps taken.<\/p>  <p>  Most recently I discussed the case with EU High Representative Mogherini in Dublin on 12 January.

Ireland is deeply concerned by the persecution of Christians, including in those countries identified in Open Doors International&rsquo;s World Watch List 2015.<br\/><br\/>Where possible, Ireland raises the issue of the safety of Christians through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect all citizens and minorities. Irish diplomats work with governments and civil society organisations across the globe to protect fundamental rights, and engage with Christian communities in their regions, working with the leaders of these communities to discuss problems they experience and assist in bringing their concerns to the attention of national authorities.  We consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including the EU and UN.  I highlighted the issue when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on 29 September 2014.  I also raised it during my meeting with UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon.<br\/><br\/>Ireland works within and alongside the EU to address the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013. These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected.<br\/><br\/>Ireland seeks protection for religious minorities, including Christians, through resolutions on freedom of religion or belief tabled at both the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, and the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva, of which Ireland is currently a member. Ireland is an active participant in the negotiation of these resolutions. The EU-led resolutions on freedom of religion or belief were most recently successfully adopted without a vote by the Human Rights Council in March 2014, and by the UN General Assembly during its 69th session in December 2014.  Ireland also raised concerns in relation to persecution on the basis of religion or belief in interactive dialogues with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion during the 69th session of the Third Committee in 2014.<br\/><br\/>The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a unique peer review mechanism whereby the human rights records of individual states are reviewed in the UN Human Rights Council.  Ireland is an active participant in the UPR, and where applicable, raises concerns in relation to persecution on the basis of religion or belief during the dialogue with states under review. Ireland has raised the issue of freedom of religion or belief at the review sessions of Iran, the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea, Pakistan and Eritrea, each of which feature on the above-referenced list.<br\/><br\/>Ireland is committed to ensuring that all human rights principles and standards are promoted, protected and integrated in all of our development efforts. Ireland&rsquo;s policy for international development, <i>One World, One Future<\/i>reaffirms the centrality of human rights to Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.  Irish Aid supports a number of NGOs working on human rights issues<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>in Sudan, Somalia and Eritrea.  Irish Aid supports the NGO <i>UPR Info<\/i>in its work in Eritrea, building the capacity of civil society organisations to engage with the UN Human Rights Council&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review process and to influence key decisions and policies. Irish Aid supports Concern Worldwide in its work in Somalia, which includes a focus on human rights, and the International Federation of Human Rights in Sudan in its work helping human rights defenders to access United Nations human rights mechanisms.<br\/><br\/>While the security situation in Nigeria is complex and involves a highly diverse range of actors (insurgents, militants, religious cultists, farmers and nomadic herdsmen, criminals, etc.), the Islamic insurgent group Boko Haram poses a continued threat to political stability in Nigeria.  Thousands of civilians have been attacked, abducted or killed in the Borno and Yobe states of north-eastern Nigeria in a series of well-orchestrated, brutal attacks.  Ireland&rsquo;s position on Boko Haram is very clear and has been consistently re-stated; Ireland condemns unreservedly the violent activities of Boko Haram against all Nigerians, whether Christian, Muslim or otherwise, and urges the Nigerian authorities to take all appropriate steps to fulfil their obligations to protect their citizens and maintain law and order throughout Nigeria.<br\/><br\/>Recent months have seen a serious deterioration in the situation faced by minorities, including Christians, across the Middle East region which is cause for great concern. This is most obviously evident in the extreme brutality and lawlessness demonstrated by ISIS in Iraq and in Syria which is utterly abhorrent and unacceptable. Threats and violence aimed at minority communities, including Christians and Yazidis, are intolerable, wherever they occur. The descent of Syria into violence and disarray has left small Christian communities very exposed and sometimes subject to direct attack.  The spread of violence and extremism in Iraq is a matter of very serious concern for the Iraqi people and for the security and stability of the region. The protection of fundamental rights for all communities in Syria, Iraq and across the wider Middle East, including Christian communities, many of whom are faced with rising intolerance and threats, is integral to Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with these countries and societies.<br\/><br\/>Ireland raises the issue of the safety of Christians through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect minorities. The protection of Middle Eastern Christian communities is discussed in the relevant European and multilateral fora as well as in our bilateral relations with Middle Eastern states. Irish diplomats work with governments and civil society organisations to protect fundamental rights in the Middle East, and engage with Christian communities in the region, working with the leaders of these communities to discuss problems experienced by these communities and assist in bringing their concerns to the attention of national authorities. It should be noted that many of these groups request that any efforts made on their behalf be carried out very discreetly, as any special attention from western countries might increase their difficulties.<br\/><br\/>With respect to Iran, some Christian denominations are subject to persecution and this is a cause of continuing concern. This relates principally to some specific Christian groups, notably evangelicals. Some other religious minorities also face persecution. It should be acknowledged however that other Christian denominations, such as the substantial Armenian Christian community in Iran, are specifically tolerated and protected, to a certain extent, under the Iranian Constitution.  The UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran has estimated that there were, as of January 2014, 307 members of religious minorities in detention in Iran, of whom 50 were Christians. He details a worrying pattern of persecution faced by Christians and other religious minorities and suggests that converts from Muslim backgrounds are most commonly prosecuted. The UN Secretary General&rsquo;s report to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2014 on the subject of human rights in Iran noted there had been no improvements in the situation of religious minorities, who continue to face violations of their rights which are entrenched in law and in practice.<br\/><br\/>Ireland has repeatedly addressed the human rights situation in its bilateral contacts with Iran and in the relevant international fora.  In September 2014, at the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland expressed concerns about the persecution of some Christian and other religious minorities and our hope that the stated intention of Iran to improve human rights protection, an intention which we welcomed, will include these minority groups. These concerns are also relayed directly to the Iranian Ambassador and Embassy on all appropriate occasions. In addition, my Department participated in the recent Universal Periodic Review of Iran which took place at the Human Rights Council in October 2014, where we voiced our concerns in relation to the situation of religious minorities.<br\/><br\/>The report of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in 2014 details an appalling array of human rights abuses, including an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.  The Commission found that the State considers the spread of Christianity a particularly serious threat, and that, apart from the few organized State-controlled churches, Christians are prohibited from practising their religion and are persecuted.  On the basis of this report, the EU and Japan led a landmark resolution at the UN General Assembly in late 2014 which calls for the Security Council to refer DPRK to the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity.  The resolution was adopted by a strong majority of the UN General Assembly.  Ireland supported this UN resolution.<br\/><br\/>Ireland supports continuing efforts to develop Afghanistan into a peaceful, democratic nation, based on respect for fundamental human rights, including the rights of Afghan women, and respect for the rule of law.  Afghanistan has been and remains beset by huge security and economic challenges, which has impacted on the domestic human rights situation, including the situation of Christians, who are in a small minority.  The EU has expressed concern at the UN Human Rights Council over the notable gaps and challenges in the situation of human rights in Afghanistan.<br\/><br\/>During the past decade Ireland has contributed to international efforts aimed at assisting Afghanistan in realising its ambition of building a stable, democratic and prosperous society for all of the Afghan population.  Over the years we have provided police, military and civilian experts to the international peace support missions.  As the focus of international engagement has now moved from military to civilian-led engagement, Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to building a secure and stable environment will focus on training, capacity-building initiatives and support for civilian policing.  Ireland has also provided consistent support for humanitarian and development programmes in Afghanistan, including &euro;47 million in funding since 2005.<br\/><br\/>Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic relations with Pakistan are maintained by secondary accreditation via our Embassy in Ankara.  The Ambassador of Ireland accredited to Pakistan has conveyed the concerns of the Irish people about the persecution of Christians in Pakistan to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Islamabad on a number of occasions, most recently in November 2014. Officials in my Department have also raised our concerns regarding the blasphemy laws and persecution of Christians generally, with the Embassy of Pakistan in Dublin.<br\/><br\/>The EU adopted a 5 year engagement plan with Pakistan in 2012.  This plan aims to build a strategic EU-Pakistan relationship by forging a partnership for peace and development rooted in shared values, principles and commitments.  The EU engages in regular dialogue with Pakistan on human rights and democratic principles, and has called on the Pakistani authorities, at the highest level, to adopt measures to protect individual and minority rights in line with its Constitution and with international human rights standards and conventions. The fifth meeting of the EU-Pakistan Joint Commission, which reviews EU-Pakistan bilateral relations annually, met in Islamabad on 24 June 2014. The EU, while acknowledging efforts of the Government of Pakistan to strengthen human rights infrastructure in the country, expressed its concern on a number of human rights issues including freedom of the media, freedom of religion and belief and the situation of women.  The EU Special Representative for Human Rights (EUSR), Mr Stavros Lambrinidis, paid an official visit to Pakistan from 26 to 29 October 2014.  This visit provided opportunities for in-depth dialogue between the EU and Pakistan on key human rights issues.  The EUSR discussed the importance of implementing domestic laws to address major human rights challenges, including freedom of religion and belief and applications and misuse of blasphemy laws.<br\/><br\/>I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to actively support freedom of religion or belief across our foreign policy and monitor the situation of Christians worldwide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200046#WRB02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Military Aircraft Landings","counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200046#WRB02600"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[2660\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200046#WRB02700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his plans to change existing arrangements between his Department and the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Defence in respect of the monitoring of foreign military aircraft on Irish territory in order to ensure our neutrality is not breached.","asker":"1192","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":75,"content":"<p>Under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952, all foreign military aircraft require the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to overfly or land in the State.

Ireland and the other member states of the European Union are firmly of the view that the lifting of the embargo would facilitate an opening of the island&rsquo;s economy to the benefit of its people.  In addition, we and our EU partners do not believe that the continued embargo contributes in a positive way to the democratic transition in Cuba. We have expressed this position in our support for the relevant resolutions at the UN General Assembly, most recently on 28 October last year.  We have recorded also our strong opposition to the extraterritorial application of the legislation giving effect to the embargo.<\/p>  <p>  The US embargo against Cuba is codified in legislation passed by Congress.

The new EDF cycle is even more focused on those countries most in need than the previous cycle, which ran from 2007 to 2013. The EDF focus on the poorest countries is in line with the Ireland&rsquo;s international cooperation strategy, One World One Future which was launched in May 2013. <\/p>  <p>  The EDF is subject to various forms of rigorous monitoring and evaluation by a number of different and separate bodies: the European Court of Auditors; the EU&rsquo;s Results-Oriented Monitoring; the EU&rsquo;s Evaluation Unit; the European Parliament; and Donors including Ireland.

We strongly believe that the absolute prohibition of torture is one of the cornerstones of the international human rights framework and we recall that all countries are obligated to comply with this unconditional prohibition and that no exceptional circumstances may be invoked as a justification for torture or any other form of ill-treatment.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is fully committed to the prevention and eradication of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through our work in the EU and in other international fora such as the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland signed the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) on 28 September 1992, and ratified it on 11 April 2002.  Ireland also signed and ratified the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment on 14 March 1988.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's commitment to eradicating torture is further demonstrated through our support for the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture.

Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the OFP scheme of approximately &euro;607 million.     <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the phased OFP scheme age change reforms that were introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, is to reduce long-term social welfare dependency by ending the expectation that lone parents will remain outside of the workforce indefinitely.  These reforms aim to provide the necessary supports to lone parents to help them to access the Department&rsquo;s range of education, training, and employment programmes, to develop their skills set and, ultimately, to secure employment and financial independence.<\/p>  <p>  The final phase of the OFP scheme age change reforms will be taking place on 2 July, 2015, when the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which an OFP recipient&rsquo;s payment ceases will be reduced to 7 years for all recipients.  It is anticipated that approximately 30,200 OFP recipients will transition out of the OFP scheme on that day.  <\/p>  <p>  When introducing the OFP scheme age change reforms, a special provision was included for recipients who are claiming the domiciliary care allowance (DCA) payment for a disabled child aged under 16 years.  The half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance (CA) is only payable for children aged under 16 years where the DCA is also in payment.<\/p>  <p>  In these circumstances, the OFP payment is extended beyond the maximum age limit of the scheme and paid until the child for whom the DCA is in payment reaches the age of 16 years.  This special provision ensures that OFP recipients who care for a disabled child will continue to receive support until that child reaches the age of 16 years and can apply for the disability allowance (DA) in their own right.  <\/p>  <p>  As a result of this special provision, 1,650 lone parents will continue to receive both the OFP payment and half-rate CA and will not be affected by the OFP scheme age change reforms on 2 July, 2015.  <\/p>  <p>  Approximately 800 other customers who are claiming both the OFP and half-rate CA payments are caring for another person (i.e. an adult or a child aged 16 years or over) and, as such, are not in receipt of the DCA payment.  These customers will transition out of the OFP scheme on 2 July, 2015, and will have their CA claim automatically assessed and re-rated to a full-rate CA payment of &euro;204 per week and &euro;29.80 per week for each qualified child.  The income loss occurs as these lone parents are moving from one-and-a-half payments to a single full-rate CA payment.  This is the most advantageous option that is available to these lone parents.  These individuals will retain their existing secondary benefits such as the respite care grant, the household benefit package, and free travel. <\/p>  <p>  Historically, the transition of recipients from the OFP scheme to the CA scheme has always occurred in this manner, with concurrent OFP and half-rate CA entitlement being replaced with full-rate CA entitlement once the maximum age limit of the youngest child is reached.  There are no plans to review the current OFP reform process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200048#WRD01600","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":120,"content":"<p>Question No. 48 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Jobseeker's Allowance Applications","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200048#WRD01800"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[3148\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200048#WRD01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"if and when jobseeker's allowance may be granted in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>The person referred to has changed address and on 20 January 2015, requested a transfer of her jobseekers allowance application from Maynooth Branch Office to Portarlington Branch Office.

The targets cover both proposed and concluded sustainable solutions, with respect to the lenders' Republic of Ireland principal dwelling home\/primary residence ('PDH') and buy-to-let ('BTL') mortgagees. <\/p>  <p>  The targets are specifically set in relation to arrears cases which are 90 days or more overdue, which importantly includes borrowers in long-term arrears (in arrears > 720 days).

Its purpose is to discourage over-funding and over-accrual of pension benefits through tax-relieved and tax-subsidised arrangements.  The regime achieves this by imposing a significant tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down. <\/p>  <p>  When the SFT limit was reduced in Budget and Finance Act 2011 to a level of &euro;2.3 million, with effect from 7 December 2010, and was further reduced in Budget and Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 to &euro;2 million, with effect from 1 January 2014, the clear legal advice to the Government (as at the time of the original introduction of the regime in 2005) was that an individual who had pension rights in excess of the SFT limit at the relevant dates was entitled to protect or \"grandfather\" those rights.  Accordingly, the legislation provided that such individuals could protect their higher pension values, subject to certain ceilings and conditions, by applying to the Revenue Commissioners for a PFT certificate. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is seeking to establish the cumulative level of protection afforded and the estimated tax foregone resulting from the grandfathering arrangements outlined above.  The concept of \"tax foregone\" is arguably more applicable in the context of tax reliefs where there is a choice as to whether to pursue the particular policy stance or not.  In that regard, it is important to note that these grandfathering arrangements were not considered optional and were provided in the legislation following legal advice to that effect from the Attorney General.  In other words, introducing the SFT regime to put an end to the provision of excessive pension pots at the expense of the general body of taxpayers required the simultaneous protection of pension rights that had been built up legitimately by individuals under the tax provisions that applied up to the relevant dates.  This was the firm legal advice to the Government when the SFT was introduced and on each subsequent occasion that the SFT limit was reduced.  The choice, therefore, was to introduce the SFT regime, with grandfathering, or not at all. <\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, according to their records, since 7 December 2010, when the SFT was reduced to &euro;2.3 million, they have issued 924 PFT certificates with a value of some &euro;2,926 million.  Since 1 January 2014, when the SFT was further reduced to &euro;2 million, Revenue has to date issued a further 159 PFT certificates with a total value of some &euro;354 million.  The combined overall value of PFT certificate issued since 7 December 2010 is, therefore, &euro;3,280 million.  The cumulative additional value of pension benefits protected as compared with the SFT limits applying at 7 December 2010 and 1 January 2014, respectively is, therefore, some &euro;837 million.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200051#WRG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Lending","counter":198,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200051#WRG01150"},{"type":"question","counter":199,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[3205\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200051#WRG01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the Central Bank of Ireland will issue a definitive response to its consultation process on mortgage lending rules; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":200,"content":"<p>The consultation period regarding the\u00a0macro-prudential policy\u00a0for residential mortgage lending as set out in Consultation Paper\u00a0CP87 concluded in early December.\u00a0\u00a0I have now been informed by the Central Bank that it will publish the\u00a0responses to this\u00a0consultation paper and the final measures before the end of January 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200051#WRG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"NAMA Property Leases","counter":201,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200051#WRG01325"},{"type":"question","counter":202,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[3210\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200051#WRG01400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of businesses in arrears on their commercial leases to companies in which the National Asset Management Agency has an interest.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"question","counter":203,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[3211\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200051#WRG01500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total value of arrears on commercial leases to companies in which the National Asset Management Agency has an interest.","asker":"959","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":204,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 77 together.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware NAMA has acquired loans from the five participating institutions and is not the owner\/operator of properties.  The Agency's role is that of a secured lender.  Other than properties that have been enforced, all of which are listed on NAMA's website and which are managed by the appointed receivers\/administrators, properties continue to be managed by their existing owners or their professional managers\/agents albeit NAMA takes a very close interest in their efficient management and sale with a view to maximum loan repayment in order to protect the position of taxpayers.<\/p>  <p>  NAMA's primary concern is that properties securing its loans are professionally managed at the most economical cost to ensure that rental and occupancy is optimised towards the servicing of interest and capital repayment on related loans.  The owners\/professional managers are responsible for the efficient running of properties, which includes the collection of rents and service charges, arrangements for letting of vacant units and the operation of rent reviews in accordance with the leases into which tenants have entered.  As lender and holder of security on the asset, NAMA's approval is needed for key decisions such as significant new leases, rental reductions or abatements and plans for ultimate sale of the property.\u00a0 The Deputy will be aware that, following the acquisition of loans in 2010 and 2011, NAMA introduced a significant change on the previous practice of the banks in ensuring that it had full visibility over rental income and that it was appropriately captured.\u00a0 As a result of that policy, NAMA has to date generated &euro;5bn in non-disposal income, mainly rental income from properties held by its debtors and receivers.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  NAMA advises that across its entire Irish portfolio of secured assets aggregate arrears on commercial leases, including rent arrears, outstanding service charges and other unpaid charges, are of the order of &euro;18m relating to approximately 100 individual tenancies.\u00a0 NAMA is working with its debtors and receivers to ensure that arrears are addressed.  It is NAMA policy and practice that all income generated by assets securing the Agency's loans is captured and applied towards repaying a debtor's indebtedness to NAMA.<\/p>  <p>   As the Deputy is aware, in December 2011 NAMA introduced a rent abatement initiative to help small and medium businesses in the retail sector which were experiencing difficulties meeting their contractual rent obligations as a result of the economic downturn.\u00a0 Under that initiative, NAMA has received 370 applications for rent abatements through its debtors and receivers.\u00a0 Of these, 339 have been approved and a further 19 are currently being assessed.\u00a0 The aggregate annual value of approved rent abatements is &euro;23m.\u00a0 NAMA has also approved long-term rent reliefs worth in excess of &euro;40m to small and medium sized retailers around the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200051#WRG01600","answer":true,"speaker":"955"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Banking Sector","counter":205,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200051#WRG01650"},{"type":"question","counter":206,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[3214\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200051#WRG01700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans for selling Government holdings in Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and PermanentTSB; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"955"},{"type":"speech","counter":207,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware the Irish banking system is now in a much stronger position than it has been in recent years.

Given the scale of the State's investment some &euro;20.8 billion and the range of options available to recoup value from the bank, officials within my Department have appointed Goldman Sachs International to assist us with moving the bank to the next phase of its development.<\/p>  <p>  The focus will be on ensuring that the best decisions are made regarding potential capital restructuring options and sequencing in order to maximise the return of cash to the State from our AIB investments over time.  While this is just the start of the process, it is an essential first step on the road to recovering value for the taxpayer.  All options remain on the table and it is too early to specify what steps will be taken next or to put a timeline on decisions.<\/p>  <p>  Following the successful sales in 2013 of the BOI CoCos and Preference Shares investments, the State's remaining investment in the bank is its almost 14% equity stake.

Any decision to sell this stake will be influenced by valuation and the need to manage the trajectory of the State's debt to GDP ratio.  Officials in my Department monitor market conditions and valuation on an ongoing basis.<\/p>  <p>  In the case of Permanent TSB, the Comprehensive Assessment Adverse Stress\u00a0Test\u00a0result identified a shortfall of &euro;855 million.  As a consequence the bank has submitted a\u00a0Capital Plan to the ECB, which outlines how the\u00a0bank\u00a0intends to meet the capital shortfall.\u00a0 Much of the shortfall has been met\u00a0through performance in 2014 and deleverage of loans.  The remaining\u00a0shortfall will require the bank to raise capital, including equity capital, from private sources in 2015, diluting the State's shareholding.\u00a0 Details of the capital raise have not yet been finalised.\u00a0 While there are no current plans to sell shares held by the State during the process I will keep this under review as it may be required to ensure a successful capital raise process for the State and other\u00a0shareholders.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am of the view that the best way to protect the value of the State's shareholding is to ensure Permanent TSB is well prepared, that it conducts a comprehensive and competitive exercise to raise the capital with appropriate legal and financial advice, and that the State has meaningful oversight and involvement in the process.

A Code of Practice in the care and welfare of the greyhound has been established and published by Bord na gCon as per the requirements of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011. The primary objective of the Code of Practice is to set standards and clearly define what is expected of all individuals engaged in the care and management of registered greyhounds. As per the Code of Practice, in the event of the need for euthanasia, it must be undertaken as soon as practicable to avoid unnecessary suffering and shall be carried out in a humane way by a veterinary practitioner. <br\/><br\/>Greyhound welfare at Bord na gCon is managed by the Welfare Manager who can call upon three area stipendiary stewards and thirteen control stewards to conduct investigations of stray or mistreated greyhounds, conduct kennel inspections and investigate other welfare related incidents which have been reported to Bord na gCon. The Welfare Manager, all area stipendiary stewards and all control stewards have been appointed by Bord na gCon as Welfare Officers under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011. <br\/><br\/>Bord na gCon established a Welfare Committee comprising representatives from the breeding, racing, coursing, veterinary, bookmaker and adoption\/homing sectors in 2009. The aim of the Welfare Committee is to improve the care and management of racing, coursing and retired greyhounds by identifying problems and proposing solutions to a range of greyhound welfare issues over the whole lifecycle of a greyhound. The Welfare Committee also discuss greyhound welfare\/neglect cases and recommend appropriate sanctions to be imposed on individuals who, following investigation, have been identified as being in breach of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011. The Welfare Manager of Bord na gCon has recently been in contact with the ISPCA requesting that they report all cases of greyhound cruelty\/neglect\/mistreatment, which they have discovered, to Bord na gCon so that the matter can be fully investigated.<br\/><br\/>Bord na gCon through its registered charity the Retired Greyhound Trust (which it established in 1997) encourages greyhound owners to rehome their greyhounds following their retirement from racing. The Retired Greyhound Trust is actively involved in promoting retired greyhounds as pets in Ireland through the organisation of retired greyhound shows.

Under these regulations each Member State is allocated a volume quota of milk, above which a super levy fine (of 28.6 cents\/litre) has to be paid to the EU Commission by producers who contribute to the over production. It is not possible for me on a unilateral basis to adjust super levy rules.<br\/><br\/>Notwithstanding the foregoing, I have, on numerous occasions, called on the Commission to take action to mitigate the impact of super levy fines, primarily via utilisation of an adjustment to the butterfat coefficient, as this would not have required an amendment to existing regulations. However, given the reaction of the Commission, and the opposition of a blocking minority of Member states, some of which have gone so far as to seek to link the issue to possible measures to regulate supply after quotas are gone, there is no realistic prospect of any movement on the super-levy. This is also true of a butterfat adjustment, and coming into the final year of milk quotas, farmers should manage their milk supply with this in mind. <br\/><br\/>At national level I have impressed on the major banks the need to show flexibility in their dealings with farmers experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties in 2015. Co-ops may have a role in mitigating the impact of the global price downturn on their suppliers, and have some flexibility in relation to the phasing of superlevy bills to farmers. Furthermore Teagasc has recently commenced a series of dairy seminars throughout the country to help dairy farmers manage through 2015, while also planning the efficient development of their dairy business in a non-quota environment. It should also be noted that the Single Farm Payment will also provide a measure of income stability during the forthcoming period <br\/><br\/>There is evidence that milk suppliers are taking steps to manage their milk supply in the final months of the quota regime. The milk quota position for the period up to end-December 2014 leaves Ireland 5.93% over quota when account is taken of the butterfat content of the milk deliveries. This figure continues the downward trend in the over-quota figure, coming from a peak of 7.15% in October 2014. <br\/><br\/>This downward trend is welcome and <i>I would encourage milk producers to continue to manage production, with the help of their advisors, <\/i>into the important production months of February and March. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200053#WRJ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"GLAS Eligibility","counter":261,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200053#WRJ01750"},{"type":"question","counter":262,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[3153\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200053#WRJ01800","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the criteria that will be used for qualification for the new GLAS scheme.","asker":"968","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":263,"content":"<p>GLAS is an agri-environment measure under the proposed Rural Development Programme and as such aims to deliver overarching benefits in terms of the rural environment and address issues of climate change mitigation, water quality and the preservation of habitats and species.

In this they have the full support of the Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring that the necessary legislation is in place to address terrorist threats. The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2014 has already passed all stages in the Seanad.  The Bill, when enacted, will create the three new offences of, public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism. These offences will carry sentences of up to 10 years imprisonment on conviction on indictment. It is expected that the Bill will come before the D&aacute;il shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200056#WRM00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Asylum Applications","counter":324,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200056#WRM00750"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[3222\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200056#WRM00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the current resident status in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Laois; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1009"},{"type":"speech","counter":326,"content":"<p>If the person whose details were supplied has made an application for asylum or subsidiary protection, the Deputy will be aware that it is not the practice to comment on such applications for so long as they remain in the protection process.

The Saint Andrews Agreement included a commitment to take forward a review of the North South Implementation Bodies and Areas for Co-operation.  Progress secured in the Stormont House Agreement means that the North South Ministerial Council, meeting in Institutional format, will agree by end February 2015 a report on new sectoral priorities for North\/South cooperation, identified during Ministerial discussions since November 2013. A report on new sectoral priorities will be a standing item for future meetings of the NSMC meeting in Institutional format.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the Good Friday Agreement commitment regarding a Northern Ireland Civic Forum, the Government advanced the position that greater civic engagement would stimulate informed public debate in Northern Ireland in relation to key societal challenges. I welcome that the Stormont House Agreement provides for the establishment of a civic advisory panel to meet regularly on key social, cultural and economic issues and to advise the Northern Ireland Executive.  <\/p>  <p>  As is the case with all participants in the talks, there were a number of additional issues which the Government would have wished to see progressed further but there was not sufficient consensus among the parties at this time.  <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that it was included in a paper tabled by the Government at the outset of the talks, I was disappointed that a commitment to an Irish Language Act, either enacted in Westminster or the Northern Ireland Assembly, did not form part of the final Agreement.  I welcome, however, the explicit endorsement in the Agreement by the British Government of the principle of respect for and recognition of the Irish language in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Government will continue to advocate for an Irish Language Act and to encourage those Northern Ireland parties which currently support an Act to continue to build the necessary enabling consensus among their Executive colleagues.  <\/p>  <p>  Similarly, while the Government would have wished to see the establishment of a North South Consultative Forum and a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, the necessary enabling consensus was not forthcoming during the Stormont talks. <\/p>  <p>  The Government will avail of other opportunities to secure progress on these outstanding issues.  We will also continue our broader efforts to ensure that the full potential of the Agreements is realised towards achieving effective partnership government, genuine reconciliation between divided communities and economic prosperity for all in Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200061#WRR01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":472,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200061#WRR01550"},{"type":"question","counter":473,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[3067\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200061#WRR01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on any contact his Department has had with the Embassy of Israel to Ireland regarding the case of a person (details supplied); if he will report on any contact the Embassy of Ireland to Israel and the representative office in Palestine have had with Israeli authorities on this case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1197","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":474,"content":"<p>I am aware of the case of the person referred to, who was convicted of obstructing military operations in the West Bank, by blocking a military bulldozer engaged in construction.

The agenda items for this FAC were Counter Terrorism, EU relations with Russia, and Climate Change Diplomacy.<\/p>  <p>  The first issue discussed was Counter Terrorism, following recent events in France and Belgium. Ministers present re-affirmed the EU&rsquo;s commitment to preventing and combating terrorism and discussed how our collective efforts, within the EU and in partnership with third countries and organisations in the Middle East and elsewhere, could be strengthened.<\/p>  <p>  Our discussion in particular focused on how foreign policy initiatives can complement action being taken by Justice Ministers. At EU level, the need for the European Parliament to expedite approval of the Directive on Passenger Name Records was emphasised.  Ministers agreed to enhance the EU's activities outside of Europe, including through improving our communication efforts, and to place experts in key EU embassies to work on counter terrorism.  <\/p>  <p>  It was also agreed that an overview of the EU Counter Terrorism and Foreign Fighters Strategy for Syria and Iraq be published. This strategy had been approved by the FAC in October 2014.<\/p>  <p>  In the course of our discussions I highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s support for a comprehensive, human rights compliant approach to countering terrorism. An effective approach requires actions such as tackling root causes, outreach to vulnerable communities, promoting a counter narrative, while at the same time necessarily strengthening legal and security measures. <\/p>  <p>  Also in attendance at this discussion were Mr. Dimitris  Avramopoulos, the EU Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, and Mr. Giles de Kerchove the EU's Counter Terrorism Coordinator. <\/p>  <p>  The second item discussed at the FAC was relations between the EU and Russia. The crisis in Ukraine, following Russia's unacceptable actions there, has impacted in a profoundly negative way on EU Russian relations. A notable sense of common purpose and unity were present around the table in discussions. Our approach is to seek to change behavior and in particular to secure a stronger commitment from Russia to the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. Sanctions remain a key element of the EU approach to the crisis in Ukraine. There can be no question of a return to normal business in the absence of a change in Russia's approach to the crisis in Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  There was a wide spread view in discussion that there is merit in maintaining cooperation with Russia on important global and regional foreign policy issues such as Syria, Libya, Ebola and Iran. Russia is of course a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It was emphasized that this engagement would be in the perspective of enhancing EU interests and positions. Engagement with Russia is desirable and indeed necessary if progress is to be made in tackling these major challenges. Unity and consistency has been vital to the EU response to the crisis in Ukraine. The European Council will review these matters in March. I believe it is important that we remain resolute and united in our strategic approach to Ukraine and in our efforts to create the conditions which can lead to a peaceful resolution to the crisis that we all wish to see.<\/p>  <p>  Ministers had a working lunch at the FAC with the Secretary General of the League of Arab States (LAS), Dr Nabil Elaraby, and discussed cooperation between the EU and LAS, along with the situation in Europe&rsquo;s southern neighborhood, including Libya, Syria, and the Middle East Peace Process. Counter Terrorism was also discussed.<\/p>  <p>  The FAC then discussed an action plan for Climate Change Diplomacy in 2015. The plan sets out proposed contacts with third countries to prepare for the United Nations Climate Change Conference taking place in Paris in December 2015. The FAC agreed the proposed EU outreach action plan and the need for the coordination of efforts between the EU and Member States.<\/p>  <p>  Council Conclusions were agreed on Tunisia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.<\/p>  <p>  A proposed discussion by the Council on Libya was postponed by High Representative Mogherini and will now take place at the February FAC meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200062#WRS00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":482,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200062#WRS00350"},{"type":"question","counter":483,"qnumday":170,"qnumall":"[3241\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200062#WRS00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which he and his EU\/UN colleagues continue to monitor the ongoing situation in the Ukraine with particular reference to the need to bring about the cessation of hostilities and the amelioration of continued hardship to civilians; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":484,"content":"<p>The EU remains at the forefront of international efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Ukraine.

It is clear that progress is at last being made.  Each of the three countries has now strengthened capacity to isolate and treat patients, and the incidence of cases is beginning to show signs of decline.  Earlier this week, Mali was declared Ebola free after 42 days without any new cases being recorded.<\/p>  <p>  While case incidence continues to fluctuate in Guinea, the authorities have recently reported the lowest weekly total of new confirmed cases in the country since mid-August.  The numbers of new cases remain low in Liberia, and Sierra Leone has reported a decline in case incidence for the second week running.  <\/p>  <p>  This slow-down in the incidence of cases of Ebola in recent weeks is very welcome.

This requires that all States freeze without delay the funds and other financial assets or economic resources of Boko Haram, as well as ensure that neither these, nor any other funds, are made available, directly or indirectly, to the organisation by their nationals or by persons within their territory. <\/p>  <p>  At the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, Ministers endorsed a statement made on behalf of the European Union by the High Representative, Federica Mogherini, condemning the recent attacks.  I fully support the commitment given by the High Representative that the EU will continue to provide a comprehensive range of political, counter-terrorism and development support measures to Nigeria and its neighbours, while also continuing to disburse humanitarian assistance to the populations affected by the crisis.  The Foreign Affairs Council will hold a further discussion on the security situation in Nigeria on 9 February.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200062#WRS01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":501,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200062#WRS01650"},{"type":"question","counter":502,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[3248\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200062#WRS01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which the top ten locations worldwide currently in the throes of warfare, genocide, victimisation, starvation and abuse continue to receive attention\/assistance from the EU and UN; the extent to which positive intervention\/action continues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":503,"content":"<p>The locations currently experiencing warfare, victimization, starvation and abuse, remain a constant concern to the EU, UN and wider global community.<\/p>  <p>  Promoting stability and supporting efforts towards peace and security in parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East continue to require and receive major international attention.

As of 31 December 2014, the UN&rsquo;s workforce in the field consisted of 89,607 serving troops and military observers, 12,436 police personnel, 5,325 international civilian personnel, 11,762 local civilian staff and 1,844 UN Volunteers.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has a strong tradition of contributing to UN and EU peace-support missions.

The majority of the 371 Irish peacekeepers currently deployed overseas are serving at the three UN missions in the Middle East while smaller numbers are deployed to missions in Africa and Eastern Europe.<\/p>  <p>  The EU also takes a leading role in peacekeeping operations, conflict prevention and in the strengthening of international security in support of the United Nations, through the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Civilian crisis management missions are established under the CSDP in order to prevent the initiation or renewal of conflict and to help societies or fragile states to recover from violent conflict. At present, the EU operates 11 civilian CSDP missions across Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been a strong supporter of the Common Security and Defence Policy since its inception.  To date, we have deployed both military and civilian personnel to a total of 17 CSDP missions across Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade currently seconds nine experts to six civilian CSDP missions, with numbers expected to increase later in the year as new posts are filled.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards. Active participation in multilateral organisations, including the EU and the UN, provides us with an opportunity to voice our concerns regarding human rights abuses.

More than 200,000 people have lost their lives, and there are now over 12.2 million people in need of immediate life-saving support within Syria. Due to the violence and the lack of access to aid, 3.8 million people have left Syria for neighbouring countries.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis. Since 2011, Ireland has provided nearly &euro;29 million in humanitarian support, delivered through UN partners, the Red Cross and Irish NGOs. Ireland&rsquo;s support has been focused on supporting people displaced within Syria and those across the wider region.<\/p>  <p>  One of the most difficult features of this crisis is that many of those who are most in need are beyond the reach of humanitarian workers.  Both the Syrian Government and rebel factions are using siege tactics and heavy weaponry in populated areas. The targeting of humanitarian workers by the group Islamic State (ISIS) means that millions living in the areas which ISIS currently controls do not receive the help they so desperately need. The UN has responded by delivering cross-border aid, even where the Assad regime has withheld permission.  <\/p>  <p>  Winter has brought more hardship to Syrians already struggling to find safe shelter and ways to feed, clothe and protect their families from illness and exposure to risk. The United Nations and partners launched a US$206 million winterisation plan in October 2014, targeting 3.3 million people inside Syria. As part of this plan, UN agencies as well as the Syrian Arab Red Crescent and NGOs, have in recent months distributed vital assistance to hundreds of thousands of people across Syria.  Assistance has also been provided in the fact of difficult winder conditions in Lebanon and, in Jordan, the UN and NGO agencies has begun an emergency cash program to assist 41 000 vulnerable Syrian refugee children in refugee camps.  <\/p>  <p>  The humanitarian situation in Iraq remains precarious for the estimated 2 million internally displaced Iraqis and more than 233,625 Syrian refugees. Many areas in Iraq, especially those under the control of ISIS, remain inaccessible for international organisations. This has hampered the monitoring of needs and the delivery of humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable groups.  Some five million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. Ireland has provided &euro;1,155,000 in humanitarian assistance in response to the recent crisis which escalated in August 2014. <\/p>  <p>  Palestinian refugees continue to suffer profound hardship as a result of the conflict in Syria. Inside Syria, more than 95 per cent of the 480,000 Palestine refugees remaining in the country are in continuous need of humanitarian aid. Additional funds are required for the almost 60,000 Palestine refugees from Syria seeking refuge in Lebanon and Jordan with little access to livelihood opportunities and services<\/p>  <p>  In December, the UN released its 2015 Syria Crisis appeal plans, requesting over $8.4 billion to meet the needs of 18 million people in Syria and across the region. We are now considering how Ireland can best respond to the need for additional assistance in 2015, while remaining mindful of the huge needs of people affected by other humanitarian crises in Africa and elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200063#WRT01000","answer":true,"speaker":"979"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Strategy","counter":514,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200063#WRT01100"},{"type":"question","counter":515,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[3253\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200063#WRT01200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent to which trade continues to develop with various and new markets established through the efforts of his Department-embassies-cConsulates worldwide; the most successful locations in this regard in recent years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1055"},{"type":"speech","counter":516,"content":"<p>The advancement of Ireland&rsquo;s trade, tourism, investment and education promotion objectives is a central aspect of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and of the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its Embassy network. <br\/><br\/>While the majority of Irish services and merchandise exports go to Europe and the US and we must continue to cultivate these markets, the Government is strongly focused on the further development of trading partnerships with other important emerging markets.<br\/><br\/>Following the launch of the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy, &lsquo;Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy, 2010 - 2015&rsquo; in September 2010, and based on State agency priorities, a list of 27 priority markets were identified.

The primary enforcement responsibility in relation to water pollution rests with local authorities, which are in turn supervised by the Environmental Protection Agency for this purpose.\u00a0 Local authorities issue a significant number of enforcement notices every year under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act.\u00a0 These enforcement notices require respondents to carry out actions to prevent or remedy water pollution. These are followed up by prosecutions where necessary. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that Louth County Council on behalf of Irish Water has contacted the Water Pollution Inspectorate in Northern Ireland to investigate this specific allegation. The Council itself carries out regular sampling at various properties throughout the water distribution system for Dundalk and drinking water sample results for 2014 are fully compliant with the Drinking Water Regulations.     <\/p>  <p>  Enforcement in relation to illegal diesel laundering activities is primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners from the point of view of avoiding loss of revenue to the Exchequer. My Department assists local authorities in carrying out their role as competent authorities under waste legislation, which is to take the necessary measures, on behalf of the State, to ensure that any waste generated and left abandoned by the diesel launderers is disposed of without endangering human health and without harming the environment, in particular without risk to water.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately 1,200 incidents of diesel laundering waste dumping have been dealt with by local authorities since 2008 and to date my Department has reimbursed all of the costs associated with such disposal on a case by case basis. Almost half of the clean-up operations have taken place in County Louth with 596 incidents having been dealt with at a cost of approximately &euro;4.8 m.<\/p>  <p>  This is a significant expenditure borne at present by the Environment Fund. My Department, as part of on-going cooperation on repatriation of illegally deposited waste in Northern Ireland, has held recent discussions with the Northern Ireland authorities on the need to develop a mechanism for dealing with waste from cross-border diesel washings which would be factored into the overall discussions on waste repatriation. These discussions are on-going.   <\/p>  <p>  While there is anecdotal evidence which suggests that a large proportion of such waste has its origins in Northern Ireland, it has not been possible to prove an explicit link. Following discussions with An Garda Siochana, the Revenue Commissioners and Monaghan County Council, who have also been seriously affected by this issue, my Department has agreed to fund a pilot sampling programme of abandoned laundering waste material in order to generate improved intelligence.  This exercise may result in linking dump sites to particular laundering processes as well as the origins of the diesel based on the markers detected in the analysed material.  The pilot will be carried out by a specialised contractor who will visit the sites, sample the waste, deliver these samples to the State laboratory and compile a report based on that analysis. <\/p>  <p>  There is strong and active co-operation on this and other waste management issues between the relevant enforcement authorities on both sides of the Border, involving An Garda Siochana, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other enforcement agencies.  However, I will be writing to my counterpart in the Northern Ireland Executive, Minister Mark Durkan, to highlight again the problems being faced by border counties exposed to the consequences of environmental crime and will also raise the issue politically at the next meeting of the North South Ministerial Council.   <\/p>  <p>  I believe that a complete solution to this problem must necessarily involve effective and co-ordinated enforcement of the law from both a revenue and waste management perspective. In that context, my Department continues to liaise with representatives of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the local authorities concerned and the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement to seek to identify more effective enforcement solutions and these engagements will continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200065#WRV01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1088"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Projects","counter":585,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200065#WRV01750"},{"type":"question","counter":586,"qnumday":204,"qnumall":"[3163\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015012200065#WRV01800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the quantity in megawatts of renewable energy generating capacity that has received final planning permission by local authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la since 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1105","askee":"1088"},{"type":"speech","counter":587,"content":"<p>The data requested are not available within my Department.
