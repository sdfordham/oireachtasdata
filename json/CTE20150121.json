I welcome everyone present to the fourth public hearing of the joint committee.  There will be two distinct parts to today's proceedings.  Later, we will hear from Professor Philip Lane of Trinity College, Dublin, on the banking crisis and economic and monetary union but first we will hear from Mr. Klaus Regling on A Preliminary Report on the Sources of Ireland's Banking Crisis.<br\/>Mr. Regling is the first managing director of the European Stability Mechanism.  He is also chief executive officer, CEO, of the European Financial Stability Facility, a position he has held since the creation of the latter in June 2010.  Mr. Regling has worked for 38 years as an economist in senior positions in the public and private sectors in Europe, Asia and the US, including a decade with the IMF in Washington and Jakarta and a further decade with the German Ministry of Finance, where he prepared economic and monetary union in Europe.  From 2001 to 2008 he was director general for Economic and Financial Affairs of the European Commission.  During the period 2008 to 2009, he spent a year at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore where he researched financial and monetary integration in Asia.  In February 2010, the then Minister for Finance, the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, requested Mr. Regling to conduct a preliminary investigation into the crisis in the banking system in Ireland.  The report relating to that investigation was published on 31 May 2010.  Said report was co-authored by Mr. Max Watson, who sadly passed away in December.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.  I remind members that while Mr. Regling is managing director of the European Stability Mechanism and CEO of the European Financial Stability Facility, he has come before us only to discuss his report.<br\/>I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, he is protected by absolute privilege in respect of his evidence to this committee.  However, if he is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continues to so do, he will be entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and - as he has been informed previously - witnesses are asked to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br\/>I welcome Mr. Regling and invite him to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015012100002#A00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421798400,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting me to come before the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015012100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Klaus Regling"},{"type":"speech","time":1421798400,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Regling have his mobile phone switched on?

On the previous occasion on which I was here, namely, May 2010, Max Watson and I presented our report.  Unfortunately, as the Chairman mentioned, Mr. Watson passed away last month.  Had he not died, Mr. Watson would be here with me and I would be very pleased about that.  I thank the Chairman for confirming that the testimony I will give this morning relates to the report and is not linked to my current role as head of the EFSF and the ESM.<\/p>  <p>  The report was prepared as a diagnostic, not a forensic, study and it did not look at the role of individuals.  It was written from a &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; perspective to complement the report of Governor Patrick Honohan, who gave evidence to this committee last week.  The report - A Preliminary Report on the Sources of Ireland&rsquo;s Banking Crisis - Max Watson and I compiled analysed the factors which led to the crisis, sought to draw policy lessons and identify follow-up areas for investigation looking at the period up to the end of September 2008.  Reflecting the mandate given to us by the Minister for Finance at the time, the late Brian Lenihan, this deliberately excluded all policy decisions taken after the end of September 2008, including the granting of the bank guarantee at that time.<\/p>  <p>  In our report, we found numerous factors - global, domestic, macroeconomic and structural - that contributed to the crisis.  Taken together, these factors acted in a mutually reinforcing way and followed a decade of strong and extended economic expansion when Ireland&rsquo;s living standards first caught up with and then surpassed the average EU standard of living.<\/p> <p> As we all know, Ireland was one of the countries most badly affected by the financial crisis through a combination of homemade problems and global factors.  A succession of bubbles in equities, bonds, housing, commodity and credit markets were the key factors behind the global financial crisis that unfolded from 2007, originating in the United States.<\/p> <p> The roots of the problem in Ireland began earlier.  Following the creation of the single currency, Ireland's domestic financial services enjoyed a strong and extended boom.  This was facilitated by an influx of foreign savings as access to cross-border funding for Irish banks increased strongly.  It came at a time of very high global liquidity and a low risk premia.  This fuelled the existing strong Irish preference for property investment and developed into a blindspot, which was ominous in a country that had never experienced a property crash.  It was very striking to us, when we  researched our report, how many people we met who told us their own personal anecdotes about property investment.  Unfortunately, it is hard not to overstate the impact of this cultural attitude.  Property acquisition, as a topic, was almost a national obsession though not something we could easily quantify in hard data.  This cultural issue is by no means the sole cause.  On the economic front, relative to the domestic growth and inflation rates, monetary conditions were very easy and, in retrospect, we can see that this reinforced economic vulnerabilities.  Statistical tools also failed to capture underlying fiscal deficits.  The IMF later calculated that in 2007, although the headline budget was balanced, the underlying or structural deficit was 8.75%.<\/p> <p> Euro area financial integration was also under way during this period when, following the creation of the euro, interest rates were permanently lowered for the Irish economy.  Irish banks enjoyed unprecedented access to cross-border funds, while foreign banks entered the domestic market which intensified competition.  At the time, cross-border regulatory and supervisory structures had not kept up with this process.  Since then many of these points have been addressed through the banking union.<\/p> <p> Back in 2007, when the crisis first really struck, the single currency initially protected Ireland and other euro area member states from the currency turmoil that they would have otherwise faced.  Unfortunately, it was not enough as pressures built over the following year.<\/p> <p> Our report also found a clear lack of budgetary discipline, with pro-cyclical policies and a gradual shift in the tax base that left it fragile and increasingly dependent on the property sector.  It shifted from stable to cyclical sources like capital gains tax, corporation tax, stamp duty on property and consumer taxes.  It was also unusual that Ireland did not have a property tax and yet mortgage tax deductions were offered which created subsidies that distorted commercial real estate development.<\/p> <p> We also noted that there was insufficient surveillance from external bodies such as the EU institutions or the IMF.  The IMF was not strong or consistent in its criticism of the underlying dynamics of fiscal policy.  European Council opinions were favourable even if the Commission, as early as 2001, was concerned at pro-cyclical policies.  However, Stability and Growth Pact commitments were not seen in doubt, during the period up to 2008, partly due to an insufficient methodology for calculating structural fiscal balances, as I have already mentioned.  <\/p> <p> Across the banking sector there was weak governance and risk management - sometimes disastrously weak.  Within the banks, internal procedures were often over-ridden, sometimes systematically, and many banks were highly exposed to specific individual borrowers and property lending, especially commercial property.  Incentives were also badly structured, not just bonuses for top banking executives but also for middle-management and loan officers.<\/p> <p> Throughout this period, in the run-up to 2008, counter-cyclical fiscal or macro-prudential policies could have moderated the boom and cushioned the recession.  With a different official policy mix, perhaps a soft landing would have been possible, but instead official policies and banking practices merely added fuel to the fire.  For example, the Government could have mitigated the bubble by initiating fiscal policies that could have dampened, not stimulated, the economy.  Supervisors could have imposed tighter loan-to-value ratios.  Supervisors were neither hands-on nor pre-emptive.  They were also not used to technically complex problems.  There was also an absence of forceful warnings from the Central Bank on macro financial risks.<\/p> <p> In summary, weak financial supervision and bank governance combined with official policies to leave the economy vulnerable to a deep crisis.  In our view, the true burden of responsibility was quite broad.  We concluded with a number of follow-up areas for consideration which are as follows.  Why was there not a stronger reaction within the banks to this concentrated loan overexposure?  How were such governance failures initiated?  Why was the response of supervisors not more forceful?  Were there failures by auditors?<\/p> <p> Investigating the very serious breaches of corporate governance that were identified was also needed.  Finally, our report stated that it was important to identify lessons for future policy, not only in Ireland but in particular in future cases of countries that may join the EU area.<\/p> <p> The report concludes that these interlinked factors culminated to create what in many ways was a plain vanilla property bubble that ultimately burst with very painful social consequences.  Taken together, we found many interconnected factors that contributed to the crisis, including insufficient critical external surveillance institutions.   Ireland was a country where it seems no one was really in charge to prevent such a bubble from emerging over the previous four to fiver years that led to 2008.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015012100002#A00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Klaus Regling","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421798400,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Regling.

This relates to supervision but it also relates to the governance problems within banks and the concentration risks which became bigger and bigger.<\/p> <p>So it was all there but to a degree that one could not find in other countries, or not in all the areas in other countries.  If one looks at the report, for instance, there are charts that show the increase in property lending by individual banks and the concentration on that sector of the economy.  This is unprecedented.  There are no other cases, although maybe a little bit in Spain, but in Spain the supervisors acted quite differently.

We also make this point in the report.  This was not just an Irish problem as there was a debate at the time about light-touch supervision.  There was a widespread view - including in the United States, for instance - that markets would regulate themselves to a large extent.  Mr. Greenspan, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve at the time, often talked about this.  He is a good example because a few years ago he publicly admitted that this was a mistake.  It is another example where something that went wrong in Ireland also went wrong in many other countries, but this element was then reinforced by all the other problems I have just talked about, and which are to be found in the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015012100004#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Klaus Regling"},{"type":"speech","time":1421799000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>Was there something unique about the relationship between the banks, the regulator and Central Bank system in Ireland that one did not see in other jurisdictions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015012100004#C00600","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421799000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>The degree of the problem was perhaps bigger because it was very light-touch supervision.

When I re-read it, I also had that impression.  I hope it was fair, however, because there were many things to be criticised or to be critical about.  Seen against the global context, there were not only home-grown problems.  It was an unfortunate combination of home-grown problems against the global background of too much liquidity, too low interest rates for too long, and the search for yields from many parts of the world.  It was also the time when Ireland joined the euro area, which had positive impacts.  It prevented currency turmoil and led to the permanently lower interest rate.  In a way we were all learning what a permanently lower interest rate meant.  It is clear to economists that this is equivalent to a very strong, stimulatory monetary action, but it was the first time that something like this happened.  We were aware that monetary conditions would be very easy because of the fact that Ireland had joined the euro area and would therefore have permanently low interest rates.  It was clear that policy should react to that somehow.<\/p>  <p>  We make the point in the report, for instance, that there was a final appreciation of the Irish currency in the exchange rate mechanism in March 1998, a few months before the beginning of monetary union.  This was only done to act against this strong monetary push that was coming from the decline in interest rates.  At the same time, we had a very loose global monetary environment.  We had more financial market integration in Europe, in the EU, which was also something we wanted to see.  It is one of the advantages of the Single Market, and of the euro, to have more financial market integration, but this also meant that there was more liquidity available than before.  All this happened simultaneously.<\/p>  <p>  With hindsight it is easy to say that stronger policy action, in those areas where it was possible, would have helped a lot.  The two areas available were in fiscal policy and supervisory action.  Unfortunately, as we describe in the report, fiscal policy moved from being counter-cyclical early in that decade, to becoming pro-cyclical later in the decade.  It therefore added fuel to the fire.  <\/p>  <p>  On the supervisory side there was a light-touch approach, which was not intrusive or hands-on.  Instruments that were available were just not used, or used very late and very little, like reducing the loan-to-value ratios.  That is something that could have happened more forcefully, but one has to see it against the culture at the time.  Today, everybody who deals with these issues talks a lot about macro-prudential supervision, but that was not very fashionable at the time globally, and not alone in Europe.  With hindsight, however, it was clearly one of the areas, together with fiscal policy, where one could have done something and should have done more, but it did not happen at the time.  <\/p>  <p>  Going back to fiscal matters, there is a real issue here for me as an economist, that we were not able to calculate and are still not very good at calculating underlying fiscal balances.  It is an unresolved issue.  We learn as we go along but we always know more after a few years.  I mentioned the IMF data that said in 2007, as I quoted, that the nominal fiscal balance was in balance.  We thought the underlying structural deficit was very small at the time.  Today we know it was bigger than 8% of GDP.  <\/p>  <p>  Our report is critical on all these points but the criticism is spread very widely.  It is also spread towards economists who have not come up with a good methodology to calculate this.  It is of course critical of bank governance, supervisors and fiscal policy makers, though not only in Ireland.  The global background was not helpful at all.  These different elements from all sides reinforced the problems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015012100004#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Klaus Regling"},{"type":"speech","time":1421799000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>How surprised was Mr. Regling that, as he describes it, he found Ireland was a country where it seemed no one was really in charge?

Again, however, one has to see it against the background of the global, EU and Irish economies.  People thought at the time that things were going very well.  One will remember that the time was called the Great Moderation.  There was good growth, a good rise in the standard of living and low inflation.

They included, for instance, people at the BIS, Raghuram Rajan, who was the chief economist of the IMF at the time and who is now the Governor of the Central Bank of India, and John Taylor, a well-known US academic in Stanford.  There were people who criticised globally the monetary policy, excess liquidity and low interest rates - too low for too long, as Raghuram Rajan said - but they were clearly in a minority.  The majority of the academics of the central banks of the banks globally had a different view.  They all made good money when they were investing money and the majority of academics just did not share the view.

A very simple legalistic answer would be that the EFSF and ESM treaty actually states that we can provide financing only when the euro area as a whole is threatened.  That would be the legalistic answer.  Otherwise, we would not become active.  I think the reasons behind that are clear.  When the crisis hit Ireland, it was the first EFSF case.  Greece was hit earlier and the problem was solved initially in a different way.  There was a serious threat for the euro area as a whole because we saw at the time a lot of contagion - by \"contagion\" I mean the problems jumping from one country to another and more and more countries losing market access.  Then there was the threat that if no emergency financing was provided, countries would have had to leave.  That was when we created the EFSF.  That was one clear conclusion.  That is why we are much better equipped today than we were in 2009 and early 2010.  The EFSF was created in May and June 2010 to provide emergency financing.  Also, from the investor side - the other side of the coin - it is very clear today that at the time, many of the big investors were not in a position to differentiate between the different European economies - they had not done their homework studying the differences - so when one country got into difficulties they did not know how to interpret that and they also withdrew from the other countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015012100007#F01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Klaus Regling"},{"type":"speech","time":1421800800,"counter":101,"content":"<p>Our guarantee was put in place on 29 September.

I wanted to start by looking at the area of commercial property.  Reading Mr. Regling's report, one of the things that strikes me is that he emphasises time and time again the role that commercial lending, commercial property played and the concentration.  There has been a narrative there and indeed I think some of the comments he has made play into that narrative, where he talks about the national obsession that people had with property.  We had our own Taoiseach in Davos saying that we went mad borrowing and so on.<\/p>  <p>  Can Mr. Regling talk about the role commercial property played in that?  The information we now have from the Nyberg report suggests that 50% of the Irish loan book of Anglo belonged to 20 individuals, 51% of the loan book of Irish Nationwide was made up of 25 individuals and 190 borrowers made up &euro;62 billion of debt.  When we talk about the property bubble and the crisis here, was it essentially a commercial property bubble and was it essentially a small number of individuals?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015012100008#G03000","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1421801400,"counter":136,"content":"<p>Of course one had both.  One had the housing bubble as such - real estate - and when we talk sometimes about the obsession of the Irish public with real estate I think we refer to that.<\/p> <p>People really thought prices would never fall because the collective memory did not exist, unlike in the UK for instance where people know that once in a generation there is a crisis in the housing market and prices drop by 10%, 20% or 30%.  This collective memory did not exist here, so people thought it would always go up and the investment could not go wrong.  That relates I think to real estate.  On the property side, our research suggests that economically it is a more serious issue.  Data were quoted from Peter Nyberg's report.  He did his report about a year later so we did not look into that in that detail.  I take it that these numbers are the right ones but we did not work on those ourselves.  Economically, this misdirection of capital hit the Irish economy even more than the housing bubble because it seems that a lot of investment took place that was never really viable and will never be viable in the future.  It is a real loss, and that is quite different from real estate where we see already that prices are recovering.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015012100008#G03100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Klaus Regling","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1421802000,"counter":138,"content":"<p>If we look at NAMA, which again appeared afterwards, we see from reports by NAMA that housing made up less than a fifth of NAMA&rsquo;s assets.

We have much broader surveillance.  We have a banking union.  Countries are under stricter economic policy co-ordination that goes far beyond the fiscal side, which was always co-ordinated through the Stability and Growth Pact.  Now we also address all the other areas that can lead to problems.  We have an excessive imbalance procedure that looks at current accounts, wage developments, and competitiveness among other matters.  It is a new system.

That makes the system more vulnerable because, with hindsight, we know that these sources of tax revenue disappeared with the crisis.  That was a very strong reason the overall fiscal deficit became so big.  Unfortunately, with hindsight, that is exactly what happened.  The deficit became big because the reliance on cyclical revenue had become so large.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015012100010#J02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Klaus Regling"},{"type":"speech","time":1421802600,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Regarding those cyclical taxes, in 2006 they formed about 30% of the overall tax take in Ireland.

Max Watson's and my conclusion, not only for Ireland but globally, is that the structure plays less of a role than the culture.  We are not saying the structure, the institutional set-up, is unimportant but that it plays less of a role than the culture.  It is more important that the culture be the right one.  If the people play their role in an assertive hands-on way, that is more important than the institutional set-up because, even if the institutional set-up is perfect - if one can find a perfect set-up - but there is a hands-off, non-intrusive and too-polite approach in the belief that markets will find a way themselves, that set-up does not really help.

In the US, this system did not exist any longer in the second half of the last decade.  Everything was done by the financial markets.  Nobody really did a thorough credit analysis, as a loan office and bank should do, and that is why it all got out of control.  That was the origin of the global financial crisis.

By way of background, this is a particularly sensitive issue here because some of those who have pushed subsequent austerity justify it on the basis that \"we all partied\".

I would not call it speculation when people bought apartments and houses, because they did it given their belief that prices would only go up, it would be a good investment but would not be wrong, and they wanted to already buy apartments for their children early.  As we heard as an example, people bought apartments for their children who were still in school because they thought once they got out of school, university and start a job they would not be able to afford a house.  That is why we use the word \"obsession\" or almost obsession, which goes beyond what I see in some other countries.

An expert here, P.J. Drudy, writing in the <i>Journal of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland<\/i>, 2007, said &quot;there is evidence to suggest that land suitable for housing in some parts of the country, and especially in the Dublin area, is controlled by a relatively small number of landowners and developers.&quot;  Does Mr. Regling think it would be appropriate that there should be, for example, control of profiteering in building land, or in the subsequent housing, etc., that is built on building land?

Was it the case in reality that the property speculation goose, so to speak, was delivering golden eggs by the bagful for the bankers, bondholders and investors, and those who were benefiting simply wanted the good times to continue?  Perhaps that then worked its way through to the regulators and even the establishment politicians?  They were all drinking in the same well of free-market capitalism so let them at it.

What is surprising is that the policy world - the regulators, supervisors, central banks, policy-makers, and a large part of the academic world - believed for a very long time that this was the best possible approach.

We have now - I mentioned it earlier - the so-called excessive imbalance procedures.  This looks at macroeconomic imbalances that can lead to a crisis like excessive divergence in competitiveness, current account imbalances and credit bubbles.  All this is now done in a systematic way.  It did not exist before the crisis.  We always had a Stability and Growth Pact but not these other elements.  The Stability and Growth Pact has been strengthened.  There is less room for political interference now.  The Commission proposals will normally become European law.  We have done things on banking union, including transferring the supervision of important systemic banks to the single supervisory mechanism, SSM.  That is important.  We have the European financial stability facility, EFSF, and as a permanent crisis mechanism, the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, which did not exist before the crisis.  There are many different elements where we have tried to draw the conclusion.<\/p>  <p>  Let me mention also the European Systemic Risk Board, ESRB, which is not well known by the broader public.  It is a very important innovation because it has this mandate of looking at macro-prudential risks.  No one did that at the European level before 2008 and, let me say again, the same in the US and the UK.  So, not only a European phenomenon.  One clear lesson of the crisis is that these macro-prudential aspects can become very important.  Supervisors in the past only looked at the micro aspect.  They went into a bank - maybe not assertively enough - and looked at the loan book, loan by loan, and decided whether it was a good loan or a bad loan, whether the provisions were enough.  However, there was no one to add it all up, which is the macro-prudential side, to come to a judgement on whether, overall, from a macroeconomic perspective, what banks were doing in a country was excessive or not.  So, we have learned lessons in many different areas here in Ireland, but also in the euro area as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015012100013#M01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Klaus Regling"},{"type":"speech","time":1421804400,"counter":247,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Regling again on behalf of the committee for his participation today and his engagement with the committee.
