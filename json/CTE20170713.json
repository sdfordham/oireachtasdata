Deputy Madigan has written to the committee to state she will not be continuing as a member of the committee and will be replaced by the D&aacute;il in due course.  Deputy Farrell has indicated that he expects to continue on the committee.  Until such time as they are replaced, both members will still be members of the committee.<\/p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meetings of 4, 5 and 6 July 2017.

There is nothing specific that is not on the agenda in front of us.<\/p> <p>  The next item is correspondence.  Category A refers to correspondence for today's meeting.  Nos. 670 (i) and 670 (ii) are a briefing paper from Brendan Ryan, chief executive of the Courts Service and a briefing paper in respect of prosecutions for fixed charge notice motoring offences by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will be returning to that matter in the autumn.  We have indicated that as the complete report from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not available at present, we are deferring detailed examination of that topic.

Nos. 681B (i) to 681B (vi), inclusive, are items of correspondence  received on 10 July from Joe Nugent, chief administrative officer in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It includes a briefing note on Garda College income and expenditure, a Garda College restaurant profit-and-loss analytical review for 2009 to 2016, an analysis of expenditure for the Garda College division 2009 to 2016, a note in respect of Garda College restaurant funds transfers from 2010 to 2016, a note on correspondence relating to a previous voluntary disclosure settled with the Revenue Commissioners in 2010 and a note on an audit of EU-funded projects.

We were promised the Deloitte report time and time again and now we have been told it will be provided at some point after the summer break.  The letter goes on to say that the State Claims Agency: <\/p><blockquote>has confirmed that the final bill of costs relating to this specific case has not reached a final conclusion.  However, the [State Claims Agency] has clarified that interim payments totalling &euro;185,984.20 (which excludes settlement costs as per the High Court agreement) have been made.  <\/blockquote> <p>That is the only figure we have actually received and it excludes the High Court settlement costs.  We still have not seen the Deloitte report.  Mr. Tony O'Brien says that he will seek the permission of the commission of investigation to give us a copy when he receives it.

We are now dealing with it under correspondence and trying to keep track.  We were clearly led to believe that this report would be published sooner than it was.  We still have no date in that regard.  It is totally unacceptable.  This was commissioned approximately a year ago.  This was a simple report on what money was given or not given.  This is adding insult to injury with regard to what has happened in the Grace case.  This is why we end up having inquiries.  This is honestly appalling.  It is a bit early in the morning to be so outraged.  We are having a tribunal because of the Grace case.  It would be easier to extract teeth without anaesthetic than to get this report.  I do not wish to personalise this, but we have asked repeatedly whether the staff were in the employ of the HSE and whether they had been promoted.  We have now found out that four of the five have been promoted.  It is extraordinary that, if not for the two whistleblowers whose lives have been seriously impacted upon, we would not even have an inquiry, not to mention that we would have not have questions here.  Mr. O'Brien should be brought back before this committee.  The man is on a very good salary, he is in charge of a huge body and he should be setting an example with candour.

He said categorically that it would be published very soon.  He led us to believe it would be released almost immediately.  Here we are, almost a month later, and there is still no report.

The issue is that a levy is payable to Horse Racing Ireland on the basis of the published fee that the owner of a mare pays for the services of a stallion.  The actual fee charged can regularly be significantly less than the published fee.  Should the levy be based on the published fee or the actual fee paid?  It is similar to asking a person who is buying a house to pay stamp duty on the listed price as opposed to the actual price.  If that is what the statutory instrument states, it makes no sense.  There are vested interests in the industry that are quite satisfied with the regime, but others are very dissatisfied.  It is strictly based on a statutory instrument introduced by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the matter is 100% within the remit of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Due to the fact that it was done by statutory instrument and the public is paying fees based on this, however, I, as Chairman, was contacted.

It was not listed on the correspondence because it was received only this morning.  The letter is from Mr. Joseph Nugent.  I will read it out because it has not been published.  It states:<\/p><blockquote>I know from coverage in the media in recent days and from information from the committee secretariat that the Public Accounts Committee may intend over the coming days to publish its report in relation to the examination of matters arising from the interim report of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na internal audit unit on financial procedures at the Garda college, Templemore.<br \/><br \/>It would be appreciated if you confirm whether or not this is the case.  I note to date that no draft report has been received by the Commissioner from the committee in this regard.  I would be grateful for your confirmation that the committee intends to furnish the draft of its report in advance of publication in order that the Commissioner and other staff members in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who may have an interest in the report be afforded the opportunity to address the draft report's findings.<br \/><br \/>The recent media coverage also refers to additional material received by the committee, extracts of which have been published.  The Commissioner would be grateful if the committee would provide a copy of all such material received by it in order that it may be appropriately considered by the Commissioner and other Garda colleagues in conjunction with the committee's draft report.<br \/><br \/>I look forward to an early response. <\/blockquote> <p>I will respond in public.  We will not discuss it in any detail.  We will not be supplying a copy of the draft interim report.  We issued a report just two days ago on third level education.  We did not supply it to the Department of Education and Skills, the HEA or any of the colleges concerned.  The reports are not about personal findings and the parliamentary legal adviser will make sure it is within the proper procedure from the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It would not be normal to issue it for discussion.  We will give them a draft report just immediately before the launch.<\/p><p>Second, I will ask the secretariat if we have received additional material that is being referred to in the letter, that did not come through the Commissioner's office.

For the rest of the evening, the committee, in private session, will finalise our report on Templemore training college with a view to the report being launched next Tuesday at 2 o'clock.  As is normal in the Oireachtas, draft reports are not circulated.  It will go through the normal Oireachtas procedure.  That procedure does not involve issuing a draft report for comment.  The report will be issued in the same way as the education report two days ago.  We did not send a copy to the Higher Education Authority or the colleges concerned.  We issued the report on the day.  That is the normal procedure.  <\/p><p>There is a reference in the letter this morning which states: &quot;The recent media coverage also refers to additional material received by the Committee, extracts of which appear to have been published.&quot;  It may not have been by us.

It continues: &quot;The Commissioner would be grateful if the Committee would provide a copy of all such material received by it in order that it may be appropriately considered by the Commissioner and any other Garda colleagues in conjunction with the Committee's [draft] report.&quot;  If there is something we have received that has not come directly through Joseph Nugent or the Commissioner's office, we will of course arrange to send a copy of it in the event she does not have it already.

At the end of the year, just over 15,000 whole-time equivalent staff were employed, of which just under 13,000 were garda&iacute; or trainees, with the remainder being civilian employees.

The team and I look forward to discussing the Vote with you, Chairman, and members of the committee.<\/p> <p>  The current strength of the Garda service is approximately 13,300 sworn members, inclusive of all ranks, including 198 who were attested last week and assigned to stations throughout the country.  Approximately 300 members retire from the organisation each year.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has received Government approval to increase the overall strength to 21,000 personnel by 2021.  This will include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilian members.  At present, approximately 2,000 civilians in the organisation carry out senior management, administrative and technical roles.  The figure of 4,000 civilian members represents a target of 20% civilians over the next five years.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na currently has approximately 14% civilian staff members.  The increase will bring us into line with international norms and ensure that sworn policemen and women are available for and utilised in all operational areas, a commitment we are determined to achieve.  The Government approved an increase in civilian numbers by 500 in 2017 and recruitment for the first batch of this number has commenced.  We are determined to ensure that happens by the end of this year.<\/p> <p>  A new Garda recruitment competition was announced on 11 May 2017 with a closing date of 1 June 2017.  The competition had three streams: a main stream; a fluency-in-Irish stream; and a Garda Reserve stream.  The total of 5,300 applicants compares to 5,600 for the previous competition.  A new Garda Reserve recruitment competition was also announced on 23 March 2017.  A total of 2,394 applications were received with 1,593 applicants successfully passing the initial stage.  Interviews for this competition are ongoing and 600 have been held to date.<\/p> <p>  Pursuant to section 19(4) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 in October 2006 the Garda Commissioner became the appropriate authority for civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Simultaneously, a dedicated civilian human resources directorate was established to support the office of the Commissioner in discharging this new statutory responsibility and to drive forward the implementation of the civilianisation programme.  Civilian members are employed in a wide range of management, administrative and technical duties.  Administrative support duties in Garda stations and offices has enabled the establishment of the expansion of some vital services that are wholly or largely provided by civilian members, including the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the Garda information service centre in Castlebar, the Garda central vetting unit in Thurles, the fixed charge processing office and the call-taking function in the command and control centre along with immigration control officers in Dublin Airport.  As part of the engagement of additional civilian members it is proposed that a considerable number will be deployed to release Garda members to operational policing roles.  In 2017, it is expected that more than 100 Garda members will return to operational roles through this process.<\/p> <p>  The 2015 budget for the Garda Vote amounts to &euro;1.35 billion.  The original budget was increased by &euro;35.2 million and a surplus of &euro;1.85 million is liable for surrender to the Exchequer.  The original budget was increased in the Supplementary Estimate due to the payment of allowances and overtime for an extra roster period that fell due in 2015, in addition to the policing of the visit of the Prince of Wales and the implementation of Operation Thor that commenced on 2 November 2015.<\/p> <p>  In addition, funding requirements in a number of subheads increased.  The information and communications technology subhead increased for the maintenance and implementation of critical IT systems and for capital funding for the major investigations management system, known as MIMS.<\/p> <p>  The modernisation and renewal programme was launched on 9 June 2016, incorporating a range of initiatives to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to meet present and future challenges.  The programme has been formed based on recommendations made in 44 reports into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including all 11 reports of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.<\/p> <p>  Internal and external reports developed over the preceding ten years were taken into consideration as well as extended periods of consultation, workshops and focus groups with senior management within the organisation and with communities throughout the country.  To deliver on this programme I have established a strategic transformation office that is responsible for implementing these recommendations and working closely with the Policing Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to ensure key recommendations are addressed.  The new commission on policing will play a role in this as well.  We have recently recruited a civilian executive director for strategic transformation with the assistance of the Policing Authority.<\/p> <p>  An under-spend of &euro;32.2 million in 2015 arose in the capital building programme for three new divisional headquarters due to the timing of contracts and payments.  The under-spend resulted in a decrease in the original budget by &euro;25.4 million in the Supplementary Estimate.  This was utilised to fund additional capital requirements for ICT, Garda vehicles and aircraft.  The remaining &euro;6.644 million was carried forward to 2016 under the capital carry-forward provisions.<\/p> <p>  The issue of accommodation presents a risk to the organisation's ability to effectively assimilate the increased Garda and civilian resources approved by Government.  We are working closely with colleagues in the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of Public Works to address these matters.<\/p> <p>  The programme for a partnership Government recognises that garda&iacute; must have the modern technology and resources necessary: to prevent, detect and investigate crimes; to provide a security service to the State; and to prevent loss and harm to citizens and their property on a 24-7 basis.  Some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the capital plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime.

It is the biggest issue in my county at present.  One could see that from the front pages of the tabloid newspapers last week and from the Joe Duffy show.  Following a very serious incident the front cover of my local newspaper referred to crime in Meath being out of control.  A shopkeeper was beaten around the head with a glass vase by thugs.  The Mayor of Navan, Councillor Tommy Reilly, who is 73 years of age, had to intervene to save his son in that incident.  What is shocking is that a Garda car arrived at the scene, spoke to the thugs and then drove off.  It sparked a national debate on the front covers of all the national newspapers and on the Joe Duffy show.  It is a sad state of affairs for the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it takes the Joe Duffy show, apparently, to solve matters.  The Garda Commissioner says there is a palpable sense of people feeling confident but not in my county or my town.  A 73 year old man, the Mayor of Navan, had to intervene to save his son.  The garda&iacute; are not there.  There are no boots on the ground.  We do not see it.

However, people are afraid about that basic element of policing, namely, people staving off these thugs who appear to control towns such as Navan, Mullingar and Thurles.  They are allowed to wander the streets and not be challenged by the force that is supposed to be protecting people.  Why is it that a mother who walks down the streets of my home town of Navan is afraid?  These thugs seem to think that they own the streets.

We have 28 divisions throughout the country.

We have had a lot of input from victims' advocacy groups and support services in terms of the training provided, which we very much welcome.  We have also set up a national protective services bureau and are in the process of rolling out the implementation of divisional protective services bureaux to support more vulnerable victims.

Dublin city grew by 13%, D&uacute;n Laoghaire grew by 13%, south Dublin grew by 22%, Fingal by 43%, Meath by 44% and Kildare by 39%.  Kildare, Meath and Fingal make up the area that has seen huge growth.  There has not been a parallel increase.

It has never been the case that this has played a whole part in this up to now.  For the past ten or 12 years, I have engaged with various assistant commissioners about the deployment of resources because they have never matched population growth.

I have provided a chart which gives a high level breakdown of the expenditure.  As indicated in the chart, expenditure on pay was around &euro;49 million.  At year end 2015, a total of 948 full-time equivalent staff were employed in the Courts Service.  Members should note this pay figure does not include the salaries or pensions of judges.  Those are paid directly from the Central Fund of the Exchequer, and are estimated at around &euro;32 million for 2015.<\/p> <p>  The Courts Service incurred expenditure of &euro;20 million in 2015 in costs associated with the Criminal Courts of Justice building, which came into use in 2009 under a 25 year public private partnership arrangement.  The annual outlay includes elements of both acquisition costs and premises running costs, which over the life of the PPP are projected to be of the order of &euro;600 million.<\/p> <p>  The service has also been engaged for a number of years in progressing other PPP projects for the construction or refurbishment of courthouses.

I am pleased to report that a clean audit report has been provided by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the 2015 appropriation account.  Overall, the Vote was managed successfully and within budget at year end.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General stated, a surrender balance of &euro;1,135,706 was recorded on the Vote.<\/p> <p>  The Courts Service is responsible for the management and administration of the courts.  As the committee is aware, the administration of justice is a matter for the Judiciary and, in accordance with the constitutional independence of the Judiciary and the provisions of the Courts Service Act, is outside the scope of the functions of the Courts Service.  The committee will appreciate, therefore, that in my discussions with it today I am precluded from commenting on any matter relating to the exercise by a judge of his or her judicial functions or on any matter relating to the exercise of quasi-judicial functions by an officer of the court.  I am also, of course, precluded from commenting on matters of Government policy.<\/p> <p>  Since establishment, the Courts Service has worked to ensure the courts operate effectively and efficiently, that the use of available resources is optimised, that value for money is achieved, and the best possible service is provided to court users.  Since the Vote was last considered by the committee in 2014, the Courts Service, in common with other Departments and agencies, has seen a very welcome easing in the severe reduction in funding and staff numbers of previous years.  Using the resources available to us, the Courts Service continues to work with the Judiciary to introduce a broad range of changes and reforms, which yield significant savings for the Exchequer while maintaining access to justice and services for the public.  The service has diligently cut expenditure and has robust financial measures in place across the organisation to ensure expenditure is kept to a minimum and is incurred only where it is necessary and unavoidable, and that value for money is achieved.  We have also, through proactive management, increased court fees, thus reducing significantly the cost to the Exchequer of running the courts.<\/p> <p>  The Courts Service was established to support the courts in the administration of justice.  This is a unique role supporting the third branch of Government.  An effective courts system is critical to a functioning modern society.  As our society continues to evolve, it places many demands on our institutions, including the courts, and we operate in an increasingly complex environment that has seen considerable change and diversity in the economic, social, demographic and cultural landscape.  There are increasing levels of litigation, increased complexity in legislation, greater court user expectations and ongoing technological advances which pose challenges and opportunities.  To ensure it continues to fulfil its remit, the Courts Service must continue to adapt and evolve, responding proactively to promote access to justice and provide the necessary support for the Judiciary and the administration of justice generally.<\/p> <p>  The Courts Service has had a modernising agenda since its establishment in 1999.  In recent years, we have been successful in introducing a range of transformational changes which have delivered significant savings and benefits to court users.  The programme of structural, organisational and procedural reform, which continued during the economic downturn, introduced a range of efficiency and productivity measures across all aspects of the Court Service.  This programme of reform ensured that despite the severe reductions in staff numbers and funding, the Courts Service was able to continue to support the courts in a challenging operating environment, which included year-on-year increases in court sittings, increased judicial numbers and a programme of legislative reform, much of which impacted directly on the work of the Courts Service.<\/p> <p>  Significant performance and efficiency improvements have been achieved over the past five years as a result of a wide range of change projects implemented.  Increased productivity is highlighted by the 25% increase in the ratio of court sittings to staff and a 20% increase in ratio of judges to staff which has been achieved during this period.  The measures implemented included reform of the court regional and office structures, with the introduction of cross-jurisdictional combined court offices and the closure of smaller offices.  This initiative has reduced the number of provincial offices from 65 to 32.  This was the most radical reform in the courts administrative structures since the foundation of the State.  It introduced an effective single management structure for court offices, maximised the resources available and released county registrars from management functions to enable them use their professional and legal skills to focus on quasi-judicial work to the benefit of the administration of justice.  A review of the combined court office project is being carried out to review and assess the benefits realised and identify opportunities for further efficiencies and reform.  A programme of rationalisation of court venues was also undertaken, and overall the number of venues outside Dublin is now down to 85 from 267.  This has concentrated business in fewer venues of a standard more suitable for the administration of justice.  These measures have successfully maximised the use of resources and freed up judicial and staff time to support the hearing of cases.<\/p> <p>  We have also worked to introduce a substantial programme of legislative and process reform.  An ongoing programme to streamline court procedures is under way.  We have also, in collaboration with the courts rules committees, sought to address key obstacles to access to justice, including reducing delays and the cost and complexity of proceedings while at the same time promoting and facilitating recourse to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.  For example, the facilitation of mediation initiatives in the area of family law in Dublin and at a number of venues throughout the country offers very effective alternatives to court determined outcomes, resulting in real and significant ongoing benefits for the parties involved.  It also provides savings in judicial and staff time.  We work on an ongoing basis with the Department of Justice and Equality in proposing areas of legislative reform and supporting the implementation of the legislative reform programme.  This focus on procedural and legislative reform has resulted in improved operation of the courts and efficiency in the use not only of Court Service resources but also, and importantly, those of other justice agencies.  There has been increased staff flexibility in a number of areas, such as logging of digital audio recording by court registrars and increased in-house ICT and legal support, all of which have yielded significant savings.<\/p> <p>  The Courts Service has also made considerable progress on the information and statistics provided on the operation of the courts.  These are published in the annual report and available on the Courts Service website.  Recognising one of the pillars of the public service reform programme, which deals with greater openness and transparency, the Courts Service continues to progress improved reporting on a range of matters linked to the operation of the courts and intends, through the development of integrated case management systems, as soon as resources allow, to continue to extend the range of data which can be provided.<\/p> <p>  The Courts Service recognises that technology is a key enabler in delivering improved services to court users and achieving improved efficiencies.  Significant benefits have already been achieved through the ICT projects already in place for a range of stakeholders, including savings for the Exchequer and better service to court users.  The implementation of our ICT programme has resulted in the optimisation of courtroom and court support technology, including the roll-out of digital audio recording to all court jurisdictions and venues; extended use of video link and videoconferencing, which has resulted in significant cross-justice sector efficiencies, particularly in the Irish Prison Service; facilitating data exchange between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service through the criminal justice interoperability project, which has generated savings for both organisations; court-generated financial transactions, valued at &euro;1.8 billion, have been transformed and centralised in a shared service centre utilising modern financial accounting technology; and the development of case management and e-filing projects, including the case management systems for small claims, the personal insolvency service, the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court, ICT support for the new fines legislation, and e-filing projects, such as the debt claims online project and e-licensing, which are still under way.<\/p> <p>  The very welcome additional funding provided in 2016 and again in 2017 for investment in ICT has allowed the Courts Service to commence a programme of maintenance and development of our ICT infrastructure, equipment and systems, including a comprehensive cybersecurity programme, which is critical to maintaining the integrity of ICT support for the courts.  An ICT strategy has been put in place to ensure ICT development in the next three years is focused on achieving the maximum benefit for the court user and the State.<\/p> <p>  The Courts Service has also continued its capital building programme with the development of seven public private partnership, PPP, courthouse projects around the country.  The first of these projects, the courthouse in Drogheda, was completed in June and was officially opened on Monday.<\/p><p>The remaining six projects which will provide state of the art court accommodation and facilities are on target for completion this year.<\/p><p> When these projects are completed only five major will remain to be addressed and we are progressing the acquisition of sites where appropriate and necessary to ensure that we are in a position to undertake those projects as soon as funding becomes available.  We are also progressing development of a family law and children's court complex and the Hammond Lane site by the Four Courts.  This project presents a once in a lifetime opportunity to provide much needed accommodation and facilities for vulnerable people coming before the courts.  The accommodation and facilities in Dublin are not adequate and this project will ensure that current and future needs for the hearing of children and family law cases can be met.  It is also proposed to provide accommodation for the Supreme Court which publicly acknowledges and recognised its position as the highest court in our justice system.  Significant progress has been made on this project and the business case for funding is with the Department of Justice and Equality for consideration.  <\/p><p> In addition to the provision of new and refurbished court buildings, the Courts Service is also responsible for ensuring that court accommodation is maintained to an appropriate standard which meets the needs of court users and protects the architectural integrity of our historic courthouses.  The additional capital funding provided in 2016 and 2017 will allow a planned maintenance programme to be put in place to address the deficiencies in court accommodation around the country on an ongoing planned basis. <\/p><p> The Courts Service launched a three year learning and development strategy in 2016 to ensure the service has the skilled competent and engaged staff needed to support the administration of justice now and in the future.  Between 2008 and 2015, as a result of cuts in staffing and funding, there was a significant erosion of resources allocated to training and this was exacerbated by the impact on our corporate knowledge and expertise with the loss of many experienced staff.  The learning and development strategy is designed to address these deficiencies and through staff training and skill development play important part in building organisational capability and capacity.  The strategy is delivered using a blended learning approach, using in house experts and on line facilities where possible to maximise the resources available.  Additional staff and funding have been provided to support the implementation of the strategy in developing a learning culture throughout the organisation and developing technical and management capacity. <\/p><p> It is critical that the Courts Service has the capabilities and operating model to continue our reform agenda, meet the challenges we are facing and capitalise on opportunities as they arise.  In keeping with the renewed focus at government level on key reforms in the civil and wider public sectors, the Courts Service is committed to putting in place a co-ordinated and focused approach to the implementation of change in the organisation.  To this end a change management office was established in 2016 to clearly define, prioritise and drive change and reform in a co-ordinated manner and to ensure that the full potential benefits of change projects are captured and realised.  A three year high level change programme has also been put in place with a strong customer focus and based on delivering improved outcomes with measurable benefits for court users and other stakeholders. <\/p><p> The Courts Service priority always has been and will continue to be the provision of front line core court services to support the judiciary and court users.  This can only be achieved through the ongoing review of the organisation and the delivery of services and the continued implementation of our change modernisation programme.<\/p><p> The Courts Service strategic plan for the period 2014-17 set out the key priorities for the service over the last three years and in the lifetime of that plan considerable progress was achieved in the review and reform of our structures and service delivery with a focus on maximising the use of technology; developing our staff and rationalising processes.  The next strategic plan, currently being worked on, will build on these achievements and, informed by the strategies and change programme already in place, will define how the Courts Service can continue to play a key role in delivering improved access to justice, better support for the administration of justice and delivery of improved value for money for tax payers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017071300002#Y00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499932800,"counter":901,"content":"<p>Members have indicated in the following sequence, Deputies Catherine Murphy, Marc MacSharry, David Cullinance, Catherine Connolly and Mary Lou McDonald.
