In my introductory statement, I will focus on how our mission to safeguard stability and protect consumers is demonstrated through our work on the tracker mortgage examination, Brexit, the banking sector, the insurance sector, and the macroprudential mortgage measures.<\/p> <p>  I am joined by Ms Sharon Donnery, the deputy governor for central banking; Mr. Ed Sibley, the deputy governor for prudential regulation; and Ms Derville Rowland, the director general for financial conduct.  This reflects the reorganisation of the Bank&rsquo;s financial regulation functions in recent weeks into two pillars.  Mr. Sibley is in charge of prudential regulation and Ms Rowland is in charge of financial conduct, which includes consumer protection.  Mr. Sibley is now responsible for the supervision of credit institutions, banks and credit unions, insurers and the asset management industry.  He represents the Central Bank on the supervisory board of the European Central Bank under the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, and on the boards of the European Banking Authority, EBA, and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA.  On the financial conduct side, Ms Rowland is responsible for the financial conduct of firms in relation to their customers and clients.  This includes consumer protection, securities and markets supervision and enforcement.  She is a member of the board of supervisors of the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA.  The reason we did this reorganisation is to reflect the evolution of the European System of Financial Supervision, ESFS, including the centralisation of prudential supervision of systemically important banks under the SSM.  It also recognises the dual regulatory approach by which the Central Bank is responsible both prudential regulation and financial conduct regulation.<\/p> <p>  I turn to our consumer protection role.  Our vision is for a well-functioning, well-managed and well-regulated financial services system that safeguards stability and protects consumers.  This is best delivered by a strong culture of compliance, with firms and individuals within firms acting in the best interests of customers.  However, this needs to be reinforced by comprehensive and enforceable legislation, intrusive risk-based supervision, a credible threat of enforcement and powers of redress when consumers have suffered detriment.  As was harshly illustrated by the financial crisis, a fundamental protection for consumers lies in ensuring that the financial system is stable and that individual financial firms are subject to prudential regulations which require them to be sound and solvent, that is, to maintain substantial capital and liquidity buffers to guard against risks.  Our oversight of the system includes the authorisation of firms - the gatekeeper role - a fitness and probity regime and other governance-related requirements.  It also includes a regime to manage the resolution or closure of firms in the event of failure.  Finally, our macroprudential measures seek to build resilience across the financial system, for example, through the limits on mortgage loans to guard against over-lending and over-borrowing.<\/p> <p>  The national consumer protection framework is formed by us the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO.  In addition, we actively participate in European and international bodies that work to safeguard the interests of consumers.  Our role as the national resolution authority also contributes to both our stability and consumer protection mandates.  We are responsible for the orderly resolution of failing credit institutions, credit unions and certain types of investment firms.  For example, members will be aware of the recent appointment of provisional liquidators to Charleville Credit Union.  We took this action to protect the savings of members, which are underpinned by the deposit guarantee scheme.  The Central Bank is conscious that there is a demand for the services of a credit union in the local area and is committed to ensuring credit union services are available in the community.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the tracker mortgage examination.  The examination is focused on ensuring that lenders provide fair outcomes for all debtors damaged by unacceptable failings in the handling of tracker mortgages, which has caused considerable suffering for many of those affected.  It is clear that all lenders did not sufficiently recognise or address the scale of those unacceptable failings until Central Bank intervention.  We have had to repeatedly challenge certain lenders and push to the limits of our powers in order to drive them to identify and remedy affected customers in an appropriate manner.  This is a basic reason the examination has required significant time to progress.  If certain lenders had conducted their reviews in line with the requirements of the framework and offered better initial proposals in respect of redress and compensation, the examination would be at a more advanced stage.  We recognise the hurt and damage the actions of lenders have caused for many debtors.  This is evident in the calls we receive to our helpline and the powerful testimony from the brave individual who appeared in public before this committee last week.  As I will outline, we are pushing the limits of our powers to ensure affected customers are remedied appropriately.<\/p> <p>  The examination is the largest, most complex and most significant conduct review that we have undertaken to date in the context of our consumer protection mandate.  Unusually for a live supervisory investigation, we publish regular updates on the examination as our work progresses, precisely because we realise customers and, indeed, the wider public need information.  The latest one was published in the past few days, which the committee has received.  We have also set out principles for lenders to pay appropriate redress and compensation to affected customers, commensurate with the consumer detriment.  Among other important aspects, the principles provide for an up-front payment to enable borrowers to take independent advice regarding the redress and compensation offers made to them.  The appeals process ensures that customers have the option to challenge any aspect of the redress and compensation.  Importantly, the customer can accept the offer while still making an appeal and the offer cannot be reduced by virtue of lodging such an appeal.  In addition, customers have retained the option to bring a complaint to the FSO and-or to initiate court proceedings.<\/p> <p>  The examination is being conducted in phases.  Phase 2 required lenders to conduct a review of their mortgage loan books, identify affected customers, as well as those deemed to have been in-scope but not impacted, and submit a report of their findings.  All relevant lenders have provided phase 2 reports to the Central Bank.  As our latest update shows, by the end of September, lenders had identified approximately 13,000 affected accounts . Approximately 60% of these cases arise as a result of customers not receiving a tracker product, and the balance relates to customers not receiving the correct tracker margin.  As of end-September, lenders have rectified the interest rates applied to approximately 7,700 affected accounts.  This represents 98% of customers identified by lenders as requiring rate rectification.  The submission contains a table outlining the progress comparing the March update to the September update.  The table also indicates that the total payout so far is &euro;120 million to 3,300 customers.  With regard to the payouts, lenders are required to categorise affected customers by reference to the type and level of detriment suffered.  The types of loss identified range from overcharging as a result of the application of incorrect interest rates up to loss of ownership of mortgaged properties.  Where home or property loss has occurred, a lender is further required to conduct a causation analysis to determine whether loss of ownership resulted from its failings.  To date, lenders have reported that as a result of their failings, loss of ownership has occurred in respect of 23 homes and 79 buy-to-let properties.  As the analysis continues, we anticipate that more such cases will be identified.<\/p> <p>  As the overall reviews by lenders are subject to ongoing assurance work and challenge by the Central Bank, it is possible that more accounts may be identified more generally as the examination progresses.  We will publish a further update in early 2018.  Our assurance work involves challenging the findings of the reviews by each lender through on-site inspections, reviewing materials and meeting with the directors of these banks.  We also are receiving information directly from customers which has informed our approach and focus in particular institutions.  While assurance work is ongoing in a number of lenders, the Central Bank is concerned from the work completed to date that two lenders may have failed to identify populations of impacted customers or failed to recognise that certain groups of their customers have been affected by their failures.<\/p><p> We are of the view that some of these customers have been affected and, accordingly, are entitled to redress and compensation.  We have challenged these two lenders on these issues and they will report back to us by the end of October.  As the Central Bank progresses this work, other lenders will be challenged in a similar way.  Where we believe there are customers who may have been wrongly excluded by lenders, we will, using our statutory powers as appropriate, require those lenders to inform them of their decision and of the recourse options available.<\/p><p> The framework has been designed so that the phases can run concurrently within lending institutions in order that each lender can be dealt with as quickly as possible.  This means that third and fourth phases - the calculation and payment, respectively, of redress and compensation - can begin while the assurance work continues.<\/p><p> In respect of redress and compensation, the Central Bank does not have the statutory power to compel lenders to implement redress and compensation in respect of failures that occurred prior to 1 August 2013.  Having said that, we have made our expectations very clear to lenders and published principles for redress so that people are aware of what is expected of their lenders.  However, initial proposals from certain lenders fell materially short of our expectations.  Examples of material deficiencies included: failing to offer compensation for certain affected cohorts of customers; unacceptably low offers of compensation; unacceptably low payments for independent advice; and failing to recognise certain types of detriment sustained by customers for compensation purposes, including customers who may have switched lenders as a result of being on the incorrect interest rate.<\/p><p> As a result of our repeated challenges, lenders have significantly improved their redress and compensation proposals and appeals processes.  To the end of September, &euro;120 million had been paid out in redress and compensation under the examination.  Prior to the launch of our examination, under the separate mortgage programme for Permanent TSB and Springboard Mortgages limited, there were payouts of &euro;36.8 million and &euro;6.2 million, respectively.  This was required by the Central Bank as part of that previous process.<\/p><p> We expect all relevant lenders to have initiated redress and compensation by the end of 2017.  In the meantime, our work continues.  We are also liaising with other State agencies, including the CCPC, the FSO and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> Finally, we have two enforcement cases open, two more are in train and I expect more to follow.  We will continue to provide updates to the public on our examination and enforcement actions as this work continues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508401800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>To assist members with their questions, will Professor Lane respond generally to the various points in his opening statement regarding the limit of the Central Bank's powers?

To expand, there was a significant shift in 2013.  We now have the power to impose redress in respect of any damage or episodes that occurred after August 2013.  We can insist that the banks offer a redress scheme in these types of cases.  As most of the damage involved in the tracker mortgage examination occurred before 2013, we have to operate under the legislation which was in effect before 2013.  Any new powers for the future would not help us deal with the scenario which existed before 2013.  We had the powers to compel the banks to produce the information contained in the second stage reports but, in terms of consequences and offering redress and compensation payments to the debtors, we have to use moral suasion and point out to the banks that they are better off putting forward these schemes on a voluntary basis.  Otherwise, they will be dealing with this issue for a long time through the ombudsman and the courts system.<\/p> <p>  If they are consumer-focused, they should recognise that it is much better to put forward a decent scheme now, rather than forcing people to go to the ombudsman and the courts.  The redress and compensation schemes currently being introduced are not being put in place under any powers of compulsion the Central Bank has.  We are essentially using our regulatory powers to point out that we have this information and that we can tell that there has been significant loss to consumers.  We are pointing out that the banks should not be asking consumers to be going forward wholesale to the ombudsman and the courts, but rather that they should be voluntarily putting schemes in place.  We are also telling them what we expect from those schemes.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Ms Rowland to add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508401800,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I can add to that in more specific ways if the committee wishes.  When this issue arose, the framework of the examination was developed in the context of the enforcement investigation into Springboard Mortgages limited and Permanent TSB, which the members will be familiar with.  It emerged in that way.  As we were going through the investigation, it crystallised for us that the tracker matter would have a very severe effect on people if we looked at the consequential impact downstream.  As the investigation progressed, we have seen loss of home ownership, loss of buy-to-let properties and all of the devastation that has wrought on people, particularly in the context of the recession which everybody was living in.<\/p> <p>  We are, as the committee will know, the systemic regulator and we have many powers.  Since 2010 and the reform of the Central Bank after the crisis, there has been significant amplification of our powers.  I want to be very clear about that.  We have used the powers given to us under section 22 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 for information-gathering purposes.  We have extensive powers to require, on deadline and demand, the provision of specific documents and information.  We used that power when carrying out the first phase of the reports, when we demanded information to scope out and plan this enormous exercise.  We are talking about more than 2 million accounts and a great volume of information has to be acquired.  I am sure that every member of the committee understands that we would be here for decades if we had to deal with 2 million accounts on a case-by-case basis.  We had to come up with a structure which would move us through such a large-scale piece of work in an intelligent way which would be constructed to cut through the data, but which had strong degrees of assurance drilled in.  The section 22 powers have therefore been used to good effect to meet the deadlines.  The deadlines for the first phase have been met and, contrary to what may have been said in other appearances before the committee, all the deadlines imposed for the second phase have also been met.  As an aside, we were not necessarily happy with the content of what was provided and some lenders have been told to go back and do better.<\/p> <p>  We are now coming to the third and fourth phases.  In plain terms, it was our view that having an impact on people at the tail-end of the process would be going about it the wrong way around.  The most important thing was to deal with the detriment imposed on people.  The first thing we did in that space was to put out a signal and a requirement that no repossessions were to occur until there was a totally gated procedure to ensure that the cases in question were not contaminated by this difficulty.  The second thing we did was to get the lawyers together so that we could confer in respect of what we thought fair and reasonable tortious principles to assist people might look like.  We knew that this was outside the strict scope of our powers but, looking at the scale of this problem, we thought it might offer a reasonable, quick, upfront payment alternative in addition to the normal infrastructure the State has to deal with such issues.  As the committee well knows, recourse to the FSO is available on a case-by-case basis after complaints have been dealt with through the lending institutions.  That is the normal course.  For the more serious matters, cases may progress to the courts.  Since we were dealing with such scale, we thought that this additional option of compensation, which is not a typical power for a systemic regulator to even wish for or seek, might be useful in this case.<\/p><p> We also demanded that any limitation period arguments would be held in abeyance by the lenders.  Very importantly, we could not look at everything on a case-by-case basis or we would be here for decades but we stood firm about the quality of the scheme and having a good appeal mechanism in place so people could bring personal information forward before independent arbiters would assist.  That is a very important part of the framework.  We have moved into an unusual space.<\/p><p> There is a statutory power in the 2013 Act to order redress.  However, that power is prospective and does not capture the harm that has accrued in this instance because most of said harm predated the creation of that power.  In fact, what has happened in a regulatory context was that when the supervisors in consumer protection became aware of these issues, they actually moved to close the gaps and strengthen the provisions in the codes.  This is one of the main reasons it cuts off at an earlier period.<\/p><p> What we are doing is pursuing enforcement investigations in detailed, forensic ways.  There is a full suite of enforcement powers.  The committee may be aware there have been five significant court litigations challenging the constitutionality of the powers.  There have been many judicial reviews all the way to the Court of Appeal.  We have successfully defended the right of the Central Bank to use its enforcement infrastructure to support proper and effective regulation.  However, none of this delivers an answer to individuals sooner rather than later.  It is for this reason that we thought this was a good additional option.  From a conceptual perspective - let us forget the law for a moment because it is a tool to be pressed into use when necessary - this is an opportunity for lenders to show that they are different culturally to what was the case during the crisis and that consumer protection is something they can proactively consider.  They can also show, in instances where they have caused harm, that they can take the burden off the individual, on a voluntary basis, and afford him or her reasonable redress and compensation.  This will allow lenders to demonstrate that they are capable and able to put consumer protection at the heart of their consideration and just do the right thing.<\/p><p> We have moved into this space, which is unusual.  It is the result of a timing issue; it brings the monetary sums upfront.  This may not be a complete answer to the harm that has been done to people, but it is something and it is better than letting the matter pass.  We have taken the time to challenge them and it has taken longer for people, which I fully accept.  However, I think it is worth it because to come to us with proposals of no appeal is utterly unacceptable given that decision-making about appeals is the point at which the nuances will be heard.  It is really very important.  To deny the fact there is consequential impact is just not acceptable.  As we move in to look at this under our authorised officer powers, we will find more disagreement and we will commit to using those powers.  This has already started with one of the lenders.  We are demanding that the two with which we are not happy - we will find we are not happy with more - to come back and answer us.  We have imposed deadlines in this regard.  We believe that the disagreement has probably reached the stage with some of them whereby there is no point in continuing an inconclusive conversation any more.<\/p><p> If people are left out of the scope and we think they should be included, we do not have the power to deliver them into the compensation and redress scheme on a voluntary basis because the decision lies with the lender and not with us.  What we do have is the power to direct a lending institution to identify, by name, the specific individuals about whom we are concerned and to notify them in writing of its decision not to include them and to tell them of their right of redress to the FSO and to the court.  The reason we need this to be done is so people are on specific notice of their rights and can assert them.  In this context, we have been in touch with the FSO to discuss the very welcome amendment to the limitation period, which enables cases to be brought in a longer time span and that is not a difficulty.  This is very welcome, and the ombudsman also sees the benefit of the normal infrastructure working.  If this happened today - I hope it will not but, in the context of financial services across the globe, consumer protection issues do arise - a key feature of the system is to be able to fix those problems.  We have redress powers.  We do not have compensation powers, which are different, but one would think that is usually a matter for the courts because of the specific consideration, but we do have redress powers that would apply today so we would be in a somewhat different position.  I hope this is of assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Derville Rowland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508401800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I want to pick up on Ms Rowland's final point.

If the banks continue to point to their legal advice and we to our legal view, the result will be a legal conflict which would delay a lot of payments and would only address harm from 2013 onwards.  I appreciate that there is a lot of frustration around this but I would like to point to the following.  First, in the case of various lenders, a lot is being paid out now relating to the whole duration of the damage and not only post-2013.  This is a success of the examination.  Second, we are pushing back.  With the pushback there has been a lot of movement over the course of the year in various cases.  It is true to say that more remains to be done.  We do reserve the option of taking cases to the ombudsman and the courts.  As there is no longer a time limit on the harm, it means that the pre-2013 losses will be subject to rectification and compensation by the ombudsman.  That is very important.

We think there is a common culture across the banks, which is that if there is any ambiguity or area of doubt about how to interpret a contract, to interpret it in the bank's favour rather than the customer's favour.  That was a common dynamic across the system.  Second, as the Deputy said, given the movements in funding costs and in interest rates, the economic incentive for these banks was essentially to interpret any possibility of making their own profitability higher to the detriment of customers.  There are common factors there.  In a similar situation, there is a common culture, which comes back to many things about the banks.

They may have been using the legal ambiguity in the understanding that they could stand over such an interpretation, even if customers might have a very different interpretation.  The fair-minded person on the street might think it is surely obvious that the natural interpretation is that the tracker rate should be the original rate, as the Deputy suggested earlier, or that it is obvious that the customer has a right, but the legalistic interpretation might be different.

One is that in many of these institutions there has been significant internal turnover.  The management teams are different and the banks themselves, under the pressure of their leadership, have had to take a big look at how they operate.  A basic issue is poor documentation and being unclear to their customers and themselves about what exactly a product means.  It is not just us.  The European momentum is to have much clearer contracts and a greater amount of information provided.  It is to recognise that the circumstances of the world can change and that we should be crystal clear about what people understand going into a contract.  That basic systems-and-clarity issue is important.  It is also the case that a great deal of our consumer protection work these days is about bringing to the attention of boards the fact that part of the work of a board relates to governance and that ensuring staff on the front line who are designing these products and interacting with customers take seriously their obligation to put the customer first.  That is an ongoing engagement.  Ultimately, the culture issue is being pushed partly by us.  It is definitely in the long-term interests of the banks to elevate the protection-of-consumers agenda within organisations.  In this process, many hundreds of millions are going to be spent, not just in payouts but in the internal costs of running it.  Not just here, but around the world, there have been so many conduct scandals in recent years that it creates a major incentive for the banks to change their ways.  We have seen in this process, however, that they have relied on lawyers to narrow down the scope of the examination, which indicates that this is far from a revolution in how the banks operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1508401800,"counter":169,"content":"<p>That is precisely where I was going with the next question.

I really want to find out the answer to this question.  What powers does the Central Bank need to ensure it can get the redress and compensation scheme under way for all of the banks by the end of the year?  Ms Rowland has said the Central Bank has no compensation powers.  Why is that the case?  What powers does it need?  This is the problem.  It appears from what we are hearing that in cases prior to 2013, when the bulk of the wrong tracker interest rates were imposed, the Central Bank can do absolutely nothing.  Effectively, from what I can see, it has no legal powers to put a redress and compensation programme in place.  What needs to be put in place by way of legislation to give the Central Bank the power to seek redress and compensation for those who were affected prior to 2013 and to ensure it can dictate to the banks that under a certain measure customers who have been impacted on should be dealt with?  Ms Rowland has said the Central Bank requires the banks to write to individuals to state they believe they have not been impacted on and that they will have to go to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  It appears that in the case of the banks and the Central Bank, the tail is wagging the dog.  The Central Bank has not included in its update that under existing legislation it did not have the power to do anything in cases prior to 2013.  What powers does it need from the Oireachtas to enable it to solve this problem?  I acknowledge that 13,000 cases have been identified in the investigation, but there are many more homeowners who need to be identified also.  Not only must they be identified, they must also receive compensation in a timely fashion.

Do the delegates realise the impact this issue has had on people's lives?  If a person has a mortgage of &euro;200,000, he or she could be paying an extra &euro;4,000 a year based on the tracker versus the variable rate.

There are extraordinary situations, such as those the committee heard last week, where the severity of loss may be such that the affected customer may reasonably want to test whether the amount of compensation is sufficient by bringing their case to the ombudsman and, if they are still not satisfied, to then resort to the courts system.  There are many options for those affected but the hope is that, although the examination process is still too slow, it will deliver an upfront payment sooner rather than later.  Approximately 3,000 people have already received a payment and approximately 13,000 more will be paid in the coming months.  This in no way damages or restricts a person's option to take the payment and still bring his or her case to the ombudsman and the courts.  Consequently, this gives many layers of redress or recourse for those affected.  We are not saying that people should immediately go to the ombudsman.  They should consider the redress and compensation offer they receive from the bank, take the independent advice, which will be paid for under this mechanism, and at that point make a decision.  I imagine the independent advisers, who have been very involved in helping people deal with this issue, will be able to help people work out if the offer is sufficient or if they should go to the ombudsman to seek more compensation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#R00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1508401800,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I am not quite clear on the process and members of the public will be less clear.

I wish to address overcharging and sharp practices in respect of commercial loans to SMEs.  Such a loan could be a tracker mortgage or a similar financial product such as a rate swap product involving a bank inducing a company that is trying to trade out of trouble onto another product which would cost it more money, or unilateral rate changes involving the cost of funds plus a margin.  Banks have their own formula for calculating the cost of funds and that is a moveable feast.  Banking sources have indicated that there are SMEs in similar situations to private citizens in that they have suffered enforcement actions by banks following non-performance of loans into which banks tricked their SME customers either by removing them from a tracker or putting them onto some similar financial product to their detriment.  The particular cases of which I have heard suggest this does not solely concern enforcement action and overcharging but also extreme situations involving the closure of businesses, loss of jobs and personal fallout for those involved.  I raise this issue in regard to SMEs and tracker mortgages in particular.  Members know that SMEs do not have access to the financial ombudsman in the same manner as a private citizen.  Their recourse for remedy is to the courts and they do not have the same avenues of recourse that Professor Lane said are available for private customers.  In view of information I have been given and cases that have been brought to my attention I wish to know the extent to which the Central Bank has been investigating or assessing the impact on SMEs as part of its assessment and crystallisation of the dispute in respect of tracker mortgages and similar financial products.  How many such cases has the Central Bank discovered within that assessment process?  What provision are the banks making for compensation in such cases?  To what extent are SMEs included in the tracker redress scheme?  This is another cohort that is not being talked about.  I have heard of cases, even from people within the banking community who have dared to come forward, which indicate there is an equal and perhaps even more devastating problem in this area because although the focus is on people and their homes, and there is a clear reason for that, some small businesses have been devastated by the overcharging, sharp practices and possibly illegal activities of banks, although the latter remains to be proven.  I want to know about this particular area of lending.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#R01100","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508401800,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I will let Ms Rowland respond to that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#R01200","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508401800,"counter":277,"content":"<p>Any tracker-related issue, whether that be a buy-to-let on a commercial basis or otherwise, is in scope of this examination.

Regarding enforcement, penalties and fines, it would seem that, notwithstanding what the country has gone through and the backlash against banks, they still seem to believe that they do not need to adhere to the same standards as other professions.  If someone's solicitor is fined, the solicitor does not turn around and send a fee note to a different client telling him or her to help pay the fine.  With the banks, however, whatever financial penalties the Central Bank imposes on them just seem to be passed on to customers.  How are they paying?<\/p> <p>  This speaks to the issue of the banks' culture.  Some members have outlined a litany of incidents, namely, the bogus non-resident accounts, the DIRT scandal, systematic overcharging of customers by NIB, the tracker loan scandal involving all of the banks, general governance issues at Anglo Irish Bank and INBS, AIB and Allfirst, the PPI situation and endowment mortgage sales.  These are just the headline issues.  In terms of culture, what sanctions will make a difference to bankers' thinking?  They do not operate like human beings at all.  This is what is constantly reported back by people who have had encounters.  As a country, taxpayers and a Government, everyone had to stretch to save the banking system for public interest reasons.  As such, that professionals within the banks have not been held to account seems to be a major issue.<\/p> <p>  The greatest impact the Central Bank could have is to tell banks that if they breach a certain threshold of behaviour, it will consider revoking their operating licences.  That is what will hit them.  They will pass on fines and the like.  That is what they do.  They are like a machine that swallows up fines and grabs that money from somewhere else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#S01600","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speech","time":1508401800,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Time, Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#S01700","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508401800,"counter":299,"content":"<p>Let me make several responses.

I do not just mean in terms of financial regulation but also in the context of the entire system of accountability.  Transparency is a part of that.

We have been in an after-the-event compliance environment, historically, in respect of our approach to these things.  Scandals occur and are followed by aftermaths and clean-ups.  There always will be difficulties and scandals, I think.  I am experienced enough in financial regulation to be somewhat pessimistic about it.  However, someone has to keep dropping in the medicine.  We have got to have high standards, expect more and keep driving for that challenge.  We must work together to bring about a more proactive consideration of consumer impact.  I wonder how often anyone in a boardroom discussed impact on consumers before products were sold.  I think they are discussed after things happen.

Professor Lane has to understand this.  I am tired of listening to the Central Bank telling us all of these things.  I understand them.  I understand Ms Rowland's difficulties in respect of the law and everything else.  The fact of the matter, however, is that when one goes back to it, these banks did wrong by their customers, before 2013 and after.  They went to the courts and failed.  Mr. Kissane told the committee at one stage that he had won court cases and the banks still fought similar cases, rather than conceding.  Forgetting all the talk about the legal framework and everything else, although that is required, people are asking what are the banks' responses, on a human level, to the theft they have conducted and to what they have done.  Professor Lane has said that he has challenged them.  Does he still have to challenge them?

We agree with the Chairman that referring only to the legal framework is not sufficient.  That is why we have gone beyond that framework in respect of our regulatory powers to push the banks into developing redress and compensation schemes, which will mean that more people will receive redress and compensation than would have been possible had we just left it to the ombudsman and the courts system to deal with this matter.  We fully agree that it is not sufficient just to resort to legalistic interpretations.  The motivation is strong within the Central Bank to ensure that our processes are not just <i>pro forma<\/i>.  We are pushing back in order to ensure that as many people as possible receive reasonable redress and compensation payments.<br\/><br\/>It is very important to recognise that there is variation.  Some banks have proactively signed up and conducted themselves in a reasonable manner.  That is seen in the fact that thousands of cases have already been concluded in terms of redress and compensation.  Other banks were slower but we have now pushed them into a situation in which we believe more redress and compensation schemes will be initiated very soon.  We have also signalled that various cohorts of populations remain in dispute.  It is not a one-size-fits-all response.  We believe a lot of progress was made this year to get us to our current position.  We should not have been required to push the banks to get this far.  I do not want the message to be that not much has happened in respect of this situation.  A lot has happened.  There has been a lot of progress and much of it will crystalise into more payments to more people in the coming months.  There remain outstanding issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#U01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1508401800,"counter":334,"content":"<p>If I was a customer I would like to hear that, but do I believe it?  No, I do not.  I will tell Professor Lane why.  Some of the banks which have appeared before the committee told us that customers would not be paid until next year, perhaps even late next year.  One bank brazenly told us that it would not meet the deadlines.  Its representatives sat there and told us that the bank would not meet the deadline and it would not give us the figures we asked for.  They told us that, in fact, the bank would not tell us anything until this thing was over.  That is the kind of respect it showed for the Irish Parliament.  That bank is licensed in this country.  I do not have great faith in it.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is that in 2016, the Central Bank spend &euro;7.3 million on legal fees.  I wonder how much will be spent in 2017.  I am not critical of the Central Bank spending the money - it has to - my criticism is that it has to.  My criticism is that the banks are forcing the Central Bank and the Irish taxpayer to pay even more money in the course of 2017 to try to resolve this issue.  It will cost even more money.  In terms of professionals, did Professor Lane ever ask the auditors or the legal advisers in those banks about this particular tracker issue?  Did they know about it?  Surely if they audited the books in the way in which they should, they would have known about it.  Is it not amazing that every single bank had the same problem at the same time?  They all had tracker issues.  It has happened to them all and they are all fighting it in the same way.  Can we not call it what it is?  It is a cartel.  It was an arrangement.  They were going to dump on the customers and remove their rights to trackers.

When the representatives of the Central Bank appeared before the committee last year, I made the point that the schemes the bank had to sign off on were inadequate.  I welcome the fact that the bank has challenged two of the schemes.  When a person has been overcharged by &euro;30,000 on a tracker mortgage, that money is stolen from him or her.  I know some individuals in this position.  I have sat in their houses and listened to their concerns.  They have cried in front of me when they told how their children's childhoods were taken from them and how matters were made worse when they did not have the money to cover medical procedures.  Some people blame the financial distress this caused them for the breakdown of their marriages and no longer having access to their children on a 24-7 basis.  A person who has had &euro;30,000 stolen from him or her by a bank is being offered &euro;3,000 compensation, which amounts to &euro;1 for every day he or she did not have access to his or her money.

Compensation is proportionate and we would expect higher rates for the more severe scenarios.  The back-up is that one can appeal the level of compensation within the framework.  The circumstances of every individual are different.  The lender is supposed to take into account the circumstances of the individual when making the initial offer.  If, however, the initial offer is not enough, then the independent appeals process provides a mechanism to challenge it.  If the outcome of the independent appeals process is not to the satisfaction of the customer, then the ombudsman stands ready to take his case.  Finally, there are the courts.  In cases where the losses have been really severe, I would expect that these other mechanisms to kick in when the initial offer of the bank is not enough.

They were required to look at the groups of people affected from the viewpoint of different experiences that they had, from the gravest which is the loss of home ownership and loss of property and all the horror that brings.  Certain proposals are being made by lenders.  Another variant is that the proposals are not uniform, because it is the boards of the lenders that are approving the offers.  I am sure the Deputy heard different information about various categories from the lenders that appeared before the committee so he knows very well that they vary.  That is at the most severe.

From memory, I cannot remember the exact year the change came in.  Prior to that, it was &euro;5 million.  There are also disqualifications and other powers.  There is another perspective to this, which is a very powerful tool, as the Central Bank absolutely believes transparency and publication is more important, or just as important.  Not just in Ireland but throughout the world, if one speaks to other regulators or has discussions in other jurisdictions, it is often the case that fines are one dimension to measure what went wrong but reputation is very important.  Transparently publicising in as much detail as possible the outcome of enforcement cases is a very important tool in achieving regulatory compliance within the institution that was the subject of the case itself.  It sends a very important message across all of the institutions, not just in that area but in all of the other areas of the markets.  The Central Bank of Ireland has committed completely to that perspective in its enforcement approach, in so far as we are able to within the confines of the law.  After cases are concluded one will see all of the information we are able to put into the public domain about those cases.  I believe there was a discussion at one of these hearings about one of those very cases.

What are the views of the Central Bank on prohibiting any discrimination by lenders between new and existing customers?  The Governor may say it does not apply any more and, to be fair to most lenders it does not, but there are cases where different treatment still occurs.  If we take, for example, Permanent TSB's existing customers, when it comes to a fixed rate offering the lowest offer they will receive is 4.2%, irrespective of their loan to value ratio.  New customers can get a rate as low as 3.2%.  This is one example of clear discrimination between new and existing customers.<\/p> <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission did a paper on mortgage options and looked at the issue of cashback offers in the mortgage market.  It made the point these offers and their marketing are potentially exploitative of consumer biases and may result in consumers making decisions for short-term gains that over the medium or long term are not in their best interests.  It has recommended that a joint working group examine the issue further.  The focus groups that have been done have found that many consumers are confused and unable to really assess what is in their best long-term interests.

One now sees in the mortgage market all sorts of different offers which, I do not disagree, are hard to process.  How does one compare all of these different offers?  There is definitely a challenge in that regard but that is the nature of a commercial mortgage market.<\/p> <p>  On the cash back, no doubt there is a potential risk to some consumers.  For others, there is a value.  People's lives are different, for instance, there is the value of saying that one accepts one will pay more over the long run but one accepts that because one's short-run needs are such that the cash back is valuable to him or her.  In other words, there is a trade-off that maybe it would protect some types of households who are genuinely making an error and not properly calculating the cost, but others can make that calculation and with full eyes open decide cash back is their preference.  There is a global debate about behavioural finance, not only in terms of paternalism but in terms of at least ensuring there is enough information and transparency, and having online calculators so that people can plug the numbers in as easily as possible.

We really only have half the equation.  We have the Central Bank &ndash; the regulator.  The more I think about the banks, the angrier I get.  Most of these banks were bailed out by the taxpayer.  I suspect that if this investigation, late and all as it was to start, had never unfolded, then the banks would have pretended this was not going on.  I have had people come to me in Limerick with various cases involving these institutions.  They have sought documentation.  They were being switched from tracker to fixed and from fixed to variable.  Most of the time they cannot even find out precisely what the arrangement is.  Many people were getting so worn down that they were going away by stealth.  Manners must be put on the banks.<\/p> <p>  The banks cannot expect that things are back to normal.  I remember in July 2008, the banks came before this committee.  Many of them said there were no problems.  One of the institutions, Bank of Ireland, said there were problems.  A short time later they were back with the begging bowl looking for taxpayers' money with a night time raid on Government Buildings.  The problem is that they are having it both ways.  Let us consider the people on tracker mortgages.  The banks are getting their money - I was going to say that it was resting in the banks' accounts.  The banks are taking customers' money from over-charging them.  Second, they are taking the same customers' money from the hard-paid taxes they have paid for services.  That money ended up going into these banks.  It was double jeopardy for the ordinary punter or tracker-mortgage holder.<\/p> <p>  I expect that the Central Bank would apply the firm arm of the regulator to ensure this matter is resolved post-haste by the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#QQ03700","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508401800,"counter":626,"content":"<p>We are absolutely committed to pushing this forward.<\/p><p>Much of it has been completed in some banks.

We operate as part of a European system of banking supervision.  Setting capital levels for banks, which are what are called significant institutions and include the main Irish retail banks, takes place within the Single Supervisory Mechanism.  We, as part of that mechanism, with the ECB and the other competent authorities across the eurozone, make the determination as to the appropriate level of capital to be held within any bank that is deemed significant.  We have an important and active role to play in terms of the execution of the work, the methodologies that are used and the final decision making process.  Every year we complete our risk assessment taking into account the issues the banks face today as well as on a forward-looking basis.  We consider what are reasonably plausible stress scenarios.  We would expect the banks to be undertaking their own capital planning, including stress testing, as well.  We use that to set up minimum capital requirements for banks to hold.<\/p> <p>  We also issue capital guidance which we expect them to hold over and above the hard requirement.  In theory, the banks have some degree of choice as to whether they hold it but in practice they are all above it.  Typically, capital requirements are set towards the end of the year.  We are coming to the very end of that process now and are setting capital requirements for all of the Irish retail banks.  These will take in all our considerations as to the risks they face on a forward-looking basis, whether it is Brexit-related, the conduct risk that we have thought about or other factors.  That sets a minimum capital requirement.  We have a small buffer on top as guidance.  In reality, we expect the banks to hold a bit more above that.  We do not like to see banks that are just on the surface or with very little margin between the regulator requirements and the requirements they hold.  That will capture the Brexit risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#BBB00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speech","time":1508401800,"counter":887,"content":"<p>As a result of the assessment carried out by the financial stability division of the Central Bank on the risk relating to Brexit, are we likely to see additional capital requirements on at least a number of the Irish institutions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#BBB00500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508401800,"counter":888,"content":"<p>How I can answer that is somewhat limited.  If we look across the European system, historically - and this is partly driven by our experience in the crisis - the level of capital that we require banks in Ireland to hold would probably be slightly higher than is the case in other jurisdictions.  There has been a degree of normalisation of that through the consistency and level playing field that is trying to be driven through banking union.  In-built in the capital requirements, as of last year and into this year, was the outcome of the 2016 European banking authority stress test.  As referred to by the Governor, that was a severe stress test, particularly for the Irish banks, because it brought in comparisons with historical loss levels that had been incurred by banks in the recent past.  Where banks were operating in systems whereby they had high loss levels, which was evidently the case in Ireland, the stress test outcome was more negative than that in those jurisdictions which did not have a history of credit losses.  That would also have influenced the capital levels which would have been set coming out of the EBA stress test in 2016 and, broadly speaking, what we expect to see in terms of capital levels and capital requirements this year is for them to be consistent with those that were set in 2016.  There are perhaps different drivers underneath that, but overall we expect capital levels to be broadly the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#BBB00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508401800,"counter":889,"content":"<p>Many different factors influence capital levels.

A community bank which raises funding and lends locally has positives but also has the negative of exposure only to that region.

First of all, I think the Senator is referring to the fact that the ombudsman made decisions prior to all of this, which fell either side of the pro and the con for consumers.  They won some and they lost some.  When we started the examination, we were aware of that.  We have a very good line of information between the consumer protection area in the Central Bank and the ombudsman.  Since we were aware of it and thought it should be looked at again in a wider way, we put it in as one of the requirements of the framework.  We have tried to be really clear about it and started at zero again.  Every tracker-related issue was put inside this examination.  That is why it is so huge.  We did not want to come back and have to gather up parts of this again and say it was problematic.  It started at the widest possible parameter and moved in to any kind of tracker-related issue or mortgage where a change had happened - we set out quite a degree of detail about that.  Inside of those criteria also would be the cases from the ombudsman, notwithstanding that the ombudsman may have found against those people.  The lenders were told to look at the cases again within this wider lens.  That is what is happening.  I hope that answers the Senator's question.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the limitation period is actually something different.  What we had in mind was time delay for long-tailed cases.  It is important that if they are very serious cases, they could be permitted to be brought before the court without difficulty and in addition to the ombudsman's office.

In August 2007, the original notification came in.  There was an inspection by the Central Bank in early October 2007 and the investigation concluded that the reported breach did not suggest a wider and more systematic erosion of overall liquidity and that the bank was back in compliance within the limits within 24 hours.<\/p> <p>  Additional claims were made in 2010, both in the media and the Seanad, that there had been numerous breaches of liquidity by the firm in question.  A further investigation was undertaken at the instruction of the Central Bank.  An independent third-party firm was engaged to check compliance with the liquidity requirements.  This investigation did not highlight any further breaches.<\/p> <p>  There was significant investigation of the issues raised and the matter is closed.  More generally, the overall message reflected in the letter cited by the Chairman is that if there are liquidity breaches, the correct way to deal with them is through investigation.  If an investigation establishes a systematic regulatory violation, the administrative sanctions procedure would be invoked.  The general answer is correct.

Not all breaches across the regulatory spectrum will end up as an enforcement case.  One would not be able to bring that volume of cases.  We have a strategy of targeted and reactive enforcement.  Reactive enforcement occurs in the most serious cases and we make the space to give resources to bring them forward.  The tracker loan issue is a very good example of that approach.  We also have targeted enforcement where we predefine areas where we see that compliance levels are low and it is very important to bring them up.  We take a targeted set of enforcement measures to improve them.  Transaction reporting in the markets area was another example.  During the years we have taken quite a number of prudential focused cases in different areas that were very important.  To be clear, from the very beginning of the enforcement strategy, as stated in 2010 until now, there has not been a total zero tolerance threshold for every single breach across the spectrum of regulated areas.  We may take one or two of a particular type where we see non-compliance in an area and may take more.  There are other regulatory tools in the escalation pyramid that are also used as enforcement measures to complement it.  That is the general approach.  We also have supervisory warnings as an enforcement tool which are private between the entity and the regulator.

Since then, in this jurisdiction, significant whistleblowing legislation has been passed and brought into force.  There has been more than one type.  It is a really important signal of confidence in the Central Bank and its current whistleblowing and listening obligations.  As Mr. Sibley has already stated, we take those obligations extremely seriously.  We have a whistleblowing desk.  We take the information in.  Employment law protections are now built into the system in this jurisdiction which I do not believe were there before, so the legislative framework is different.  We have a dedicated whistleblowing function so that when information comes into the Central Bank it is sent immediately to the line supervisors, as they are the experts with regard to the institutions that they supervise, so that they can assess that information and action is taken.  That is an important point to make in terms of the structure of the system now and the formulation of whistleblowing legislation and how it has been brought in as an important part of the infrastructure in this jurisdiction.
