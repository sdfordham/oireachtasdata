The general secretary points out that the ETBI is a voluntary body and does not have any governance role over ETBs.  Rather, its job is to promote the interests of the sector.  As such, it does not have a similar role to that of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, in respect of the third level sector.<\/p> <p>  When we discussed inviting a number of ETBs to appear before us, members asked that we also invite the ETBI, but it is a different type of organisation than the HEA, in that it is not a conduit for funds and receives no State funding.  It is just an association.  It has annual conferences and might arrange training, but it is not funded directly.  It has no oversight role even though it has a fancy name.  Given that the oversight role in respect of ETBs remains with the Department of Education and Skills, I propose that, when we are engaging with the sector, we should direct these questions to the Department.  I see no role for the ETBI in our examination.<\/p> <p>  When we debate our work programme and decide which ETBs to invite, I ask that members submit which ETBs they would like to attend and the rationale for same.

The company is trying to ascertain whether properties of dissolved companies pass to the State and whether it can buy such a property to expand its company.<\/p> <p>  I have raised this matter outside the committee previously.  Forward Emphasis knows that a company has been dissolved and that there is an asset.  It understands that the assets of dissolved companies transfer to the State legally and it wants to buy an asset from the State.  For the benefit of members, I raised this issue following a previous meeting by way of parliamentary question.  According to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, when a company such as the one in question is dissolved, its remaining assets automatically transfer to the State.  The State has no mechanism in place to know which assets are being transferred to it, which is extraordinary.<\/p> <p>  I asked a further question on this topic.  This person might have written to us after seeing my parliamentary question.  I asked what monetary assets had been transferred to the State from dissolved companies.  In 2013, they amounted to &euro;151,000.  In 2014, they amounted to &euro;10.8 million.  In 2015, they amounted to &euro;513,000.  Last year, they amounted to &euro;371,000 up to the date of my parliamentary question.  The &euro;10.8 million was from a single company's bank account outside the State.  It landed out of the blue and was lodged into the Central Fund.<\/p> <p>  All that we can do is ask the company to engage directly with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Department is the only body that should have a handle on assets automatically transferring to the Minister, but we now know that it has no handle on that at all.  The company should take up the issue with the Department.  We will advise it accordingly of where to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101900002#C02700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1508400000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Theoretically, 100 companies could dissolve and 100 sets of assets would transfer to the State, but the State would know nothing about them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101900002#C02800","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1508400000,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101900002#C02900","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1508400000,"counter":54,"content":"<p>From a value for money point of view, should this not be an issue that the committee pursues separately?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101900002#C03000","speaker":"1346"},{"type":"speech","time":1508400000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Yes.

Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next heading is statements and accounts and there are three statements of accounts.  I will come back to all of the HIQA-related correspondence.  The first of three statements and accounts is the National College of Art and Design, a qualified audit opinion on the basis that it did not keep adequate accounting records and failure to control governance over the year's, an  operating deficit of &euro;758,000 and an accumulative deficit of &euro;1.4 million.  The basis for the recognition of deferred pensions is an issue.  The 2014-15 financial statements were certified on 3 October 2017 but have not yet been presented.

I will refer to the various items of correspondence first.  We will then discuss them because they are all on the same issue.  I want to put them all together for discussion.  Items Nos. 822A(i) to (iv) are the opening statement and supporting documentation from HIQA for today's meeting.  We received an opening statement yesterday and a revised opening statement this morning.<\/p><p>The next item of correspondence related to this is correspondence dated 18 October from Tadhg Daly, CEO of Nursing Homes Ireland, declining an invitation to appear at the committee.  I will read that letter into the record.  It is a short letter.  We wrote to Nursing Homes Ireland after the last meeting after we had considered the correspondence that had been sent to us anonymously.  We discussed it at the last meeting.  The committee received that documentation and it was circulated.  We wrote to Nursing Homes Ireland and the reply that came in yesterday said:<\/p><blockquote>I acknowledge receipt of your request to NHI to attend, as a voluntary witness, a hearing before the PAC next Thursday (19th October) in regards certain matters that have been the subject of recent media coverage.<br \/><br \/>The Board of Directors has instructed me to reply as follows.<br \/><br \/>I am not in a position to attend such a meeting at this time.  It is also important that I emphasise that all information connected with the matters to which you have referred, and aspects of which have been the subject of certain recent media reports, remains strictly confidential and covered by legal privilege.<br \/><br \/>It is a matter of the most serious concern to NHI, its officers and its memberships that purported extracts of a clearly recognised confidential and legally privileged memorandum have appeared in the public domain.  NHI has not waived privilege over the content of its documentation and continues to rely on the strictly confidential nature of the information to which you have referred.  Equally this privilege also applies to the setting within which the discussions you refer to took place, as this involved a consultation with legal advisors.  The priority for NHI remains to ensure that there are no further breaches of NHI's legal rights, or of the legal rights of its officers, ex-officers and members.  <br \/><br \/>A further issue which prevents me from accepting your invitation to attend is that you have not provided me with the nature of the questions which the members of PAC might wish to canvass and as you will appreciate this substantially curtails my ability to prepare appropriately for any such meeting.  Should you wish me or any other officer of NHI to re-consider such a request in the future I would respectfully ask that you would provide an agreed agenda, including a schedule of agreed questions which the members of PAC intend raising, and that you would do so within a reasonable time frame in advance of such a meeting.<br \/><br \/>Kind regards,<br \/><br \/>Tadhg Daly<\/blockquote> <p>As a result of that, it is clear the document we received the last day was a document prepared for Nursing Homes Ireland which it says is legally privileged.  It is saying it is not waiving its legal privilege.  The issue is that the Oireachtas has a job to protect the rights of citizens and citizens have rights to legal privilege.  It is not the function of the Committee of Public Accounts to ignore that we have been specifically informed in legal writing that these documents have legal privilege regardless of how they came into our possession.  They were published in the <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>which is the reason we discussed the matter.  It is the function of the Oireachtas to protect our citizens and their legal rights.  I am just making that statement before we decide what to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101900002#E00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1508400000,"counter":134,"content":"<p>Our function is to protect the legal rights of the citizens and taxpayers who pay into the nursing homes support scheme fund, otherwise known as the fair deal scheme, which finds its way to public, private and voluntary nursing homes and which has been the subject of considerable comment and controversy as we have said repeatedly in recent times.  When private nursing homes interact with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which administers taxpayers' money, they have to do so on an individual basis.  To act collectively is illegal.  We are all about observing the letter of the law.  I find this letter from Mr. Daly quite extraordinary and unacceptable.  It is unacceptable that he is refusing to come in and assist the committee with our deliberations.  We have in our possession not an extract of minutes but the complete minutes of a meeting that Mr. Daly convened on 23 October 2015.  It was with three partners from Eversheds who are Nursing Homes Ireland's legal advisers.  Mr. Brian McEnery, who is the serving chairperson of the board of HIQA, which regulates nursing homes, was also in attendance at that meeting.  The provenance and authenticity of the minutes of the meeting have not been challenged anywhere so far as I can see.

These raise very serious issues.  We understand that issues regarding using a collective effort to bring the State to the table to extract more money from the fair deal scheme were considered and debated at this meeting.  We also understand that methods of increasing voluntary or individual contributions in private nursing homes were also discussed.  Of course, it is not appropriate - in fact, it is illegal - for a collective effort to be entered into in those matters, which is alarming.  The whole area of conflicts of interest is also alarming.  As we have seen reports of it, we know that Mr. Brian McEnery, the serving chairman of the board of HIQA, also attended this meeting.<\/p> <p>  We cannot overstate the seriousness of the matters that arise.  Mr. Daly needs to present himself to the committee.  He will be aware that we are in receipt of documentation and that we are in receipt of an email he sent to members of Nursing Homes Ireland.  He will be aware that we are in receipt of correspondence in which he directs those same people to destroy the minutes we have.  All of this is very disturbing.  While I know Mr. Daly would be presenting himself as a voluntary witness, I am sure he would not contest the fact that large sums of public money find their way into private voluntary nursing homes, all of which are members of his organisation.

Nursing Homes Ireland has stated it has not waived legal privilege over this document or the setting in which the meeting took place.  As we have not had time to get our own legal advice on this I will insist that members do not refer to the document, which is a minute of that meeting prepared by Nursing Homes Ireland's legal adviser, which contains the heading that the document contains legal advice which is legally privileged.  Members are free to discuss the opening statements and content of the meeting, but not reference the exact document mentioned because it is legally privileged.  I do not want reference to that particular document, but the contents of the article in the <i>Sunday Independent, <\/i>which deals with the meeting and HIQA's attendance at it, is fully open for discussion here today.<\/p><p>I also want to put on record that because of the late receipt of the reply from Nursing Homes Ireland, which we received yesterday, we had expected it would be here today, so we have not had time to get full legal advice.  In the meantime, as Chairman I am taking the cautious view, pending legal advice, not to refer to the document, which is legally privileged.  HIQA had already submitted its statement, in which it refers in detail to the contents of that meeting.  Through the secretariat, I sent word yesterday to HIQA not to include that aspect of its opening statement today because, as Chairman, without the benefit of legal advice I was taking the cautious view I do not want to trespass into that meeting where we have been informed by Nursing Homes Ireland that the minutes of the meeting are legally privileged.  However, the committee had a detailed discussion in private session this morning, and I am quite happy to be guided by the committee that HIQA's original statement should be read into the record as it was originally intended, and my sending a message to HIQA was merely exercising a cautious approach pending legal advice.  We are very happy for HIQA to discuss it and I apologise for any discommoding I caused yesterday evening by asking HIQA to shorten its statement.  The committee is very happy, and I am happy to go along with the advice of the committee, for the full statement to be on the public record today.<\/p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones should be switched off.<\/p><p>I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.<\/p><p>I believe Mr. Quinn will make a brief opening statement, followed by Mr. McEnery.  The speakers have indicated in the following sequence: Deputies McDonald, MacSharry, Cullinane, Connolly and Catherine Murphy.  I invite Mr. Quinn to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101900002#M00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508400000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>On behalf of HIQA, I wish to thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the Committee of Public Accounts this morning.  As the Chairman has said, I am accompanied by my colleagues Ms Mary Dunnion, director of regulation and chief inspector of social services and Mr. Brian McEnery, chairperson of the board.<\/p> <p>  At our appearance before this committee on Thursday, 28 September, the issue of potential conflicts of interest arose, specifically with regard to Mr McEnery and his role as both chairperson of the board of HIQA and as an adviser to nursing home operators.  Subsequently, an article was published in a Sunday newspaper, which was discussed by the committee last week.  In order to help answer any questions the committee may have, I wish to outline HIQA's governance arrangements and how we handle conflicts of interest.<\/p> <p>  HIQA is committed to high standards of corporate governance.  We have a clear policy on conflicts of interest, which ensures that staff and board members are aware of their obligation to act in the best interests of HIQA and to avoid situations where there may be a potential or actual conflict of interest.  This policy is in line with Government policy, as set out in the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies 2016.<\/p> <p>  HIQA&rsquo;s code of governance and code of business conduct, which was approved by the Minister for Health in October 2014, also reflects the obligations of board members and staff under the ethics in public office legislation.  Both documents have been submitted to the committee for reference.  Our policy and procedures on conflicts of interest apply to board and staff members and are adhered to at all times.  Furthermore, at the beginning of every board session, the sub-committees of the board and attendees from HIQA's management team are requested to declare any real or potential conflicts of interest.  Any declarations are recorded in the relevant minutes.<\/p> <p>  All of HIQA's inspection staff work within a scheme of determination, which must be agreed to and signed upon commencing employment with HIQA.  This scheme of determination clearly shows the level of regulatory decision-making the chief inspector permits her regulatory staff to make.  In addition, regulatory staff work within a specific code of conduct, which includes a confidentiality clause.<\/p> <p>  The regulation of designated centres is based on a series of steps.  This includes the initial receipt of information, which can include mandatory notifications, unsolicited concerns and protected disclosures; inspection activity, that is announced, unannounced or registration inspections; and the creation of a centre profile, which contains a description of the centre, a regulatory assessment of information received and the findings of inspections.<\/p> <p>  All regulatory activities, whether information or evidence received, regulatory judgments or inspection reports, are gathered, generated and saved within a secure information management system.  Access to this system is determined and approved only by the chief inspector.  No member of HIQA's board has access to this system.<\/p> <p>  Regulatory risk and judgments, and potential and actual enforcement actions, are managed by HIQA's regulatory risk committee, chaired by the chief inspector.  All records of this meeting, decisions made and actions planned are stored within the information management system.<\/p><p>The chief inspector provides a monthly assurance report to HIQA's executive management team, a bi-monthly report to the board of HIQA and a quarterly report to the board's regulation committee.  These assurance reports include an update on progress made against annual business plan objectives, details on the frequency of meetings of HIQA's regulatory risk committee and details of mitigating actions taken against any regulatory risks.  Reports on quality assurance include information on key performance indicators, internal audit reports and an update on the external stakeholder engagement schedule.  Furthermore, the chief inspector produces and publishes an annual report detailing all regulatory activities, which is a requirement of the Health Act 2007.<\/p><p> As CEO, I, along with the chief inspector and director of regulation and other officials from HIQA, regularly attend Oireachtas committees when requested.  So far this year, we have presented to the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, the Joint Committee on Health, the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs and, of course, this committee.<\/p><p> Finally, HIQA has received correspondence from a private nursing home provider containing a number of assertions regarding perceived conflicts of interest.  This correspondence was copied to some Members of the Oireachtas.  HIQA has directly replied to this through our chief inspector and director of regulation, Mary Dunnion, and separately through our board chairperson, Brian McEnery.  We have made all of this correspondence available to committee members.  I will now hand over to chairperson of HIQA's board, Mr. McEnery, who will address specific points raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101900002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Quinn","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508400000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  In May 2013, I was appointed chairperson of the board of HIQA.  It is a great honour to chair the board of the authority because its work is important in improving quality in our health and social care sectors.  Since the authority's formation, I have been enormously impressed by the impact it has had on service improvement.  As a student, I worked as a care assistant in the UK and saw, at first hand, the positive impact of regulation in that health system.  I am enthusiastic about the role of Ireland&rsquo;s regulatory body in our health service.<\/p> <p>  The board has in recent times been particularly focused on ensuring that there are prudent and effective controls which enable risk to be assessed and managed.  We have devised a new and more comprehensive risk management suite of tools in the authority and these are aimed at ensuring that risks to the delivery of the authority's agenda are managed and mitigated.  The board and its committees are also focused on ensuring that the resources of the authority are used optimally.  Some of the key work undertaken by the board in recent times includes: approval of annual budget and corporate plan; approval of the annual report of the authority and its financial statements; and the assessment of performance of the CEO.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that the committee wishes to address issues of conflict of interest and a recent report in the media surrounding a meeting of nursing home operators that I attended.  I will address both of these issues in this statement.  I suspect this is what committee members wish to ask me about so I am more than happy to address it directly.  I am also happy to inform committee members about the exact nature of my contribution to the event.<\/p> <p>  First, just to set out the background to my appointment, I applied for the position of chairperson through the Public Appointments Service system.  I displayed current and comprehensive experience of the health care arena garnered throughout my professional career.  I have at all times before, during and since my appointment tried to ensure that I maintain the highest ethical standards in accordance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and, indeed, the code of governance of my own professional body, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.  In that context, I have been clear at all times that I am currently a partner in BDO Ireland and head of health care in that practice.  I indicate openly and transparently on the HIQA website that I am one of the firm's health care consulting partners.  I additionally outline on the HIQA website that I have been an adviser in the older person care sector for the past 17 years and that I edited the Nursing Homes Ireland annual nursing home survey.  I further outline that I produced the report A Fair Price for Care - Ireland on behalf of Age Action Ireland.  I also outline on the HIQA website that I worked as a care assistant in a UK older person dementia care home in the past.  In addition, I outline that I have acted as financial adviser to primary care centres, acute care facilities and older person care centres throughout Ireland and that I have a broad range of health care sector experience from both a financial and operational perspective.  In a sense of openness about my professional life, I believe I could not have made it more transparent that I am a financial adviser to the health care sector and in particular to nursing home operators.  This comprises a significant portion of the professional work which I do and I have never tried to hide or deny that.<\/p> <p>  When I came before the Joint Committee on Health and Children as a new chair to present my credentials in 2013, I outlined then that I have specialised in the area of advisory services in health care.  I went on to state that for the past ten years or more, I have provided financial, operational and strategic advisory services to acute, older person and primary care services throughout Ireland.  In my annual declaration of interests to the Standards in Public Office Commission, I state my professional capacity within BDO.  Finally, the BDO website states clearly that I negotiate rates for nursing homes with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and work in health care advisory.  It is clear that I advise nursing homes, hospitals and primary care centres.  In 2015, I believe I spoke at six conferences on the topic of nursing homes, the financial implications impacting the sector, the fair deal as it impacts on nursing homes and the statistics of the industry.  In the middle of 2015, BDO launched the nursing home survey, Ireland's most in-depth nursing home research publication, which analysed the financial performance of the sector.  This was launched by the then Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch.  At the time of launch, I spoke extensively to the press and media about the report and its findings.<\/p> <p>  I was invited by Tadhg Daly, the CEO of Nursing Homes Ireland, to attend an operator meeting in my professional capacity on 23 October 2015 to speak about the sector.  I spoke about financial matters and answered questions that were asked of me based on my professional experience.  I was there as an invited speaker and participated when invited by the meeting.  I left the meeting before it concluded as my professional advisory input was no longer required.  In that respect, I left prior to the attendees discussing next steps or actions.  It was not unusual for me to speak at conferences relating to nursing homes as I had, by 2015, given a number of presentations to the pillar banks and a commercial conference provider for nursing home operators and at the formal launch of the nursing homes survey.  This was the context in which I came to speak at the event on 23 October 2015.  I accepted an invitation, was there as a financial expert and spoke about financial matters.<\/p> <p>  I would like to set out what I said at the meeting and to show that my contribution was based on advice for the sector in general.  I am of the view that advice was entirely appropriate to the audience and was good advice for the sector in general.  I outlined the following in answer to questions put to me after I was welcomed to the meeting by Tadhg Daly.  I spoke about the finances of the industry and the fair deal scheme.<\/p><p>I spoke about the genesis of the scheme and the criteria the NTPF applies when agreeing rates with nursing homes.  I also spoke about the financial impact of the NTPF reducing fair deal rates and about labour rate inflation and staffing shortages.  In response to a question, I said that the NTPF acknowledged that nursing home costs were increasing.  It often accepted that these costs were reasonable and prudently incurred and that it would like to be able to give a better fair deal rate but the budget simply was not there.  I relayed to the meeting that the NTPF negotiators often stated to me and to operators during negotiations that it was important that there was a voice calling for an increased budget for the fair deal to back up its own requests.  I outlined that the NTPF frequently stated to operators that the fair deal budget was reduced as a result of austerity and that increases in the fair deal rates to cover cost increases would not be forthcoming to any great extent until the fair deal budget increased.<\/p><p> In response to a question about the four criteria used to determine the fair deal rate, I outlined to the meeting that the NTPF, in meetings with me and my clients, recognised the criteria it uses are somewhat arbitrary and need to change.  In response to a question about the first Deloitte report on the fair deal scheme, I stated that in my opinion it failed to recommend sufficient changes to the scheme&rsquo;s methodology, changes which I believed the NTPF may have also wanted.  In response to another question about the criteria for pricing care, I stated that the scheme lacked sophistication and outlined that as a financial adviser, I believed setting a rate for a home was wrong.  I suggested that it would be much better to have a rate pertaining to the resident and their needs rather than to a building.<\/p><p> When responding to a question about the appeals process, I outlined to the meeting that my experience was that operators were better off not just accepting the rate offered by the NTPF off the bat and that engagement and challenge around their case was likely to be better than not negotiating.  When asked about the need to provide more beds, I said I believed that different parts of Government were sending different signals to the sector.  The EIIS scheme, for example, was extended to nursing homes to encourage new developments, but simultaneously fair deal rates were being cut, which was a contradictory message.<\/p><p> On a final question to me about the possible direction of travel, I suggested there should be engagement with the NTPF and good communication channels between providers and commissioners, that the cost of care should be a consideration and not just an arbitrary pricing mechanism, and that there should be some equality between providers with similar circumstances, that is, blatant inconsistencies in the scheme should be focused on and removed.  I suggested an independent appeals process should be sought in future enhancements of the fair deal scheme and that operators should not be afraid of engaging in the appeals process, as I had found it useful in a number of instances.  However, I suggested the appeals process can, if it goes the full way, take as long as nine months and this is too long.  Beyond answering the questions posed to me, I did not contribute to discussions surrounding strategy.  As the guest attendee, I left when the questions and answers session finished and before the attendees went on discuss follow-up actions.<\/p><p> On the board and governance, the role of the board of HIQA is to be the governing body of the authority.  I am the non-executive chairperson of the authority&rsquo;s board and I, or other board members, do not have operational involvement in the workings of the authority.  I want to outline this to the committee for a few reasons.  Section 42 of the Health Act states the chief inspector is accountable to the Oireachtas in his or her work.  The chief inspector is not accountable to the board and so the board and I, as chair, do not have any remit over the regulation of nursing homes or other facilities regulated by HIQA.  Legislatively, this is the case.<\/p><p> The board does not get involved in executive decision-making.  The chief executive is the accountable person under section 24 of the Act and so, in operational matters, he is the person who runs the authority and has the responsibility and accountability.  Operational matters are not brought to the board for decisions because that is not its role.  The way HIQA is legally constituted means that I, as board chairperson, cannot, do not and would not intervene or even have information relating to HIQA inspections.  I have, on one occasion, been asked to intervene personally by a nursing home operator who sought that a HIQA report would not be published on the HIQA website.  I refused to intervene.  In the follow-up correspondence, I was informed that the disappointed party intended to inform Oireachtas Members of my professional role.  I say this as I wish to provide members with all of the relevant information regarding my role. <\/p><p> I welcome the opportunity to be present at this committee.  There is no conflict of interest in providing nursing home owners with financial advice, including advice on negotiating with the NTPF, and being chairman of the regulatory authority.  This is because of the unique way HIQA is legally constituted.  Clearly this was established at the point of me being appointed to the role of Chairman from the very outset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101900002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brian McEnery","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508400000,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McEnery.

Its primary functions include supporting the development, welfare and protection of children, offering care and protection for children whose parents are unable to do so, and maintaining and developing the services needed in order to deliver supports to children and families.  Prior to 2014, many of the agency&rsquo;s functions were undertaken by the Health Service Executive.  Staff, assets and systems were transferred from the HSE to the agency on its establishment.<\/p> <p>  The agency's financial statements for 2016 record total income of &euro;682 million, almost all of which comes from Vote 40 - Children and Youth Affairs.  This includes &euro;16 million provided to support the agency's capital investment.  The agency's expenditure in 2016 was &euro;680 million.  Some 35% of expenditure related to staff costs.  The agency employed approximately 3,600 whole-time equivalent staff at the end of 2016.<\/p><p>The agency incurred expenditure of &euro;118 million on foster care and aftercare allowances in 2016, and a further &euro;96 million on independent placement provision, including residential care.  Expenditure in 2016 of &euro;144 million was in respect of grants to almost 1,000 organisations delivering services under three key programmes: &euro;98 million on child welfare and protection; &euro;25 million on the school completion programme; and &euro;21 million on family and community support measures.<\/p><p> I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the agency's financial statements for 2016, which were certified on 23 June 2017.  However, the audit report drew attention to the statement on internal control in which the board acknowledges that there had been inadequate monitoring and oversight of grants paid to outside agencies.  The control weaknesses identified included delays in the signing of some service level agreements &mdash; audit sampling found that some agreements for the calendar year 2016 were signed as late as quarter 3 of 2016; inconsistencies in the agency's ongoing monitoring of grant-funded agencies, which is carried out through monitoring meetings and receipt of financial reports and staffing returns from grant-funded agencies; and consistent review of the financial statements, with some cases identified where no evidence was available to demonstrate that required financial statements had been received or reviewed.<\/p><p> In 2016, as in previous years, non-compliance with procurement rules continued to be an issue for the agency.  When it was established, the agency took over a number of contracts which had originally been put in place by the HSE.  The HSE continues to provide support in defining the agency's procurement needs and in managing its procurement processes.  The agency noted that it will take a sustained focus over a number of years to achieve high levels of adherence to public procurement rules.<\/p><p> The agency's statement on internal control outlines steps being taken to resolve the issues.

As mentioned, I am accompanied today by my colleagues, Ms Helena Hanna and Mr. Gerard Hughes from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Mr. Alan Breen is my head of communications and Mr. Peter O'Brien is the senior accountant.<\/p> <p>  I will not go over all the history of the agency.  Most committee members will be familiar with it.  Tusla was set up in 2014.  It is just slightly over three and a half years old, and it brought together a number of services from the HSE, the National Educational Welfare Board and the Family Support Agency as well as some services related to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Suffice to say, the establishment of the agency was one of the largest and most ambitious programmes of reform undertaken by Government and the most comprehensive reform of child protection, early intervention and family support services ever undertaken in the country.  We have 4,000 staff and in 2018 we will have an operational budget somewhat in excess of &euro;700 million.  The 2016 outturn for Tusla was a surplus of &euro;626,000 for pay and non-pay, and a capital surplus of &euro;1.88 million, less than 0.1% of our total budget.<\/p> <p>  We have been undertaking a very ambitious and far-reaching transformation programme affecting structure, processes, practices, policy, methodology and, of course, organisational culture.  We are leading an organisation whose staff are trying to deliver supportive, co-ordinated and evidence informed services to positive outcomes for children, young people, families and communities.  Our staff have an appetite for change.  As I go round the country, the level of enthusiasm and commitment for change is very encouraging.  They have embraced that positive approach and that is being captured as we move into the next three-year corporate plan, which starts next year.<\/p> <p>  I would say, and my colleague from the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned it, that when we were set up, most of our corporate functions were very heavily dependent on the HSE through a memorandum of understanding, including some of the areas the Comptroller and Auditor General have drawn to our attention around procurement and the management of grants.  It is our intention to become as fully self-sufficient and independent from the HSE as is possible while at the same time still taking account of the Government's shared services agenda.<\/p> <p>  We have embarked on this transformation programme.  We have had additional investment over the past two to three years and I would say that we have unapologetically used most of that investment for front-line development to try to make our front-line services more robust and responsive.  We have an opportunity to develop our capacity in some of these corporate areas, especially finance, HR, estates, ICT and areas around freedom of information, health and safety, data protection, etc., because we cannot continue to be dependent on the HSE on an ongoing basis.  We need to be independent and we have begun to invest in these corporate functions as well as, not instead of, I hasten to add, continuing to invest in our front line with the advent of mandatory reporting.<\/p> <p>  I have mentioned in the statement that one such programme is our child protection and welfare strategy which is underpinned by a national practice approach called Signs of Safety.  We have been giving political parties a briefing on these as we move forward.  They are fundamentally aligned to the principles of Children First, which, as the committee will be aware, is due to be commenced on 11 December.  Children and families will very much be at the centre of our assessment and decision-making and the approach will be strengths based, evidence based and outcomes focused.<\/p> <p>  On some headlined progress to date, as we have highlighted in our annual report, we have managed since establishment to achieve a 38% reduction in cases awaiting allocation.  There were some signs that was beginning to taper off and that the graph was going steadily downwards.  It has begun to plateau a little and further work is being done to keep that on a downward trajectory.  Within that, there has been a 77% reduction in cases that were deemed to be a high priority.  More than 2,000 inspections of early years services were carried out in 2016 and there were 432 new registrations-notifications in 2016, which was a threefold increase on 2015.  Educational welfare services worked with an additional 3,700 new children in the 2015-2016 academic year, and 31,000 children and 23,500 families were referred to family support services, also in 2016.  A total of 155 family units of accommodation were provided, including 147 emergency refuge and family units, in domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services.<\/p> <p>  There are a range of additional improvements and enhancements within financial governance and controls which cover a range of expenditure areas.  These are referred to in the background information that we have provided.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge and welcome the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and its findings.  I and the agency value the process the Comptroller and Auditor General undertakes which highlights the areas that need change and improvement.  The independent audit process also identified areas of strength and showed where good and tangible progress has been made year on year.  I am aware of the current weaknesses within the agency regarding procurement and grants in particular.  Alongside the senior management team, I am leading on the implementation of specific and relevant programmes to address these weaknesses and bring about improvements.  As these long-term solutions are in the process of being introduced, some of the same issues might come out again in 2017 but I am confident the Comptroller and Auditor General will see clear plans and actions in place to address these issues.<\/p> <p>  The specific issue of non-competitive procurement has been raised.  We selected procurement as a priority area to be addressed.  The steps we have taken thus far to address these issues include the implementation of a three-year procurement plan which will address the short and long-term needs of the agency.  The plan identifies the priority procurement categories for the next three years, emphasises the need to improve collaboration and recognises that continued training and communication with all relevant staff is a key task to sustaining the changes made.  We have established a team dedicated to procurement which will be its sole responsibility.  That is another example of us using the additional investment to become as self-sufficient and independent as possible.<\/p> <p>  On the specific issue raised of the monitoring and oversight of grants to outside agencies, as was mentioned, the agency funds in excess of 900 separate organisations to the sum of approximately &euro;144 million.<\/p><p>As part of our transformation programme, a dedicated project working group was established to develop and implement a programme of governance and compliance for the section 56 and section 59 grant-funded agencies.<\/p><p> The objectives of this programme include the creation of a new section 56 and section 59 contract, which has now been completed - our corporate solicitors have finalised that - with an accompanying governance framework and an internal governance model.  The internal governance model includes a standardised process and structure for the review and monitoring of service deliverables.  It will be further supported by the introduction of a commissioning unit and a compliance unit whose focus will be on the governance and oversight of those grant-funded agencies.<\/p><p> Obviously for any programme of change of this magnitude to be effective, it must commence with knowing where the weaknesses are and knowing what needs to be changed; we know that with the help of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I and my senior management team were acutely aware when Tusla was established that there were significant areas to be improved.  I knew this would be a difficult challenge to undertake but we believe it is not insurmountable and we have already made very significant progress on all the areas that have been highlighted.<\/p><p> In order to build upon and continue with developing Tusla as the agency which provides the best services we can for children, young people and families, we need to be given some time.  We have been given additional resources.  We believe that some further additional investment in years two and three of our new corporate plan for 2019 and 2020 is necessary.  The additional investment we have had has been hugely helpful in allowing us to make the improvements we have made so far; there is still more to do.<\/p><p> I thank the Chairman for inviting me and my colleagues to appear before the committee to present and discuss our annual financial statements for 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101900002#NN00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred McBride","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508400000,"counter":755,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McBride.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101900002#OO00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1508400000,"counter":756,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McBride for his patience.

One of the areas is where we have used agency staff in administrative and managerial grades.  The original contract was meant to be solely for front-line practitioners - social workers, social care and the like.  We have all had a very significant need for administrative and managerial grades as we have developed the agency.  That is an area we need to address.  We have commenced a procurement exercise to address this; it is in the region of &euro;7 million.<\/p> <p>  The other one made headlines in relation to private foster care.  We buy places for children from independent fostering agencies and they hitherto have not been subject to contractual arrangements.  We have a process in place now to put them on a kind of framework contract, including supported lodgings as well; so that is in hand.<\/p> <p>  The other areas are around psychology, assessments and therapeutic assessments, often court-directed where if a HSE psychologist has not been available we have been forced to buy an assessment, essentially, from a private therapist or psychologist, many of whom, as I understand it, are employed by the HSE anyway, but do this privately.  That is an area that clearly needs to be tightened up.  We have plans to ensure there is a contractual framework around that.<\/p> <p>  There was an issue raised about security.  Of course, security for some of our buildings may be security in a special care unit, residential unit or secure unit for our children.  There are particular needs there.

It is lamentable when a new agency, such as Tusla, is bringing &euro;5.2 million of bad habits into the organisation.

How is Tusla getting those agencies and suppliers on board in terms of service level agreements?  It was highlighted, for instance, that some of the SLAs were not signed until the third quarter of the year in which they were in operation.  That is clearly not acceptable.  That might not necessarily be suppliers; it might be other service providers through the Tusla family.

We submitted, as part of the Estimates process last year, three case scenarios.  These were a modest increase in referrals which may result from mandatory reporting, a moderate increase and a more extreme increase.  Ultimately we went with the more modest increase in referrals, based on research that we had carried out on other jurisdictions which had introduced this model.  There is a school of thought that, given that the Children First guidance has been out for some years, that people have been acting as if mandatory reporting is already in place.  Whether that is true or not is difficult to say.  It is also difficult to be absolutely precise about the numbers of additional referrals that Tusla may get.  We have developed a business case on the more modest increase.  In preparation for that we have 304 staff of all grades in the recruitment process currently.  Some 185 of them are social workers.  We are hoping to land a significant number of those in 2017, before year end.  A number may then fall over into the early part of next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101900002#QQ00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred McBride"},{"type":"speech","time":1508400000,"counter":800,"content":"<p>How far into the recruitment process is Tusla?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101900002#QQ00300","speaker":"1300"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508400000,"counter":801,"content":"<p>Each role is at a different stage.  Some will have had job offers, some will have had start dates already established and some will be waiting on Garda vetting.  We are confident we can get most of the 304 staff in by the end of the year, and a further 150 staff next year.  Overall there will be 454 new staff members over the next 14 months or thereabouts.  As part of the 2018 estimates process there is investment to deal with that.  It is difficult to be precise and say that will be enough staff to deal with the increase in referrals, but we base these numbers on the case scenarios we developed.  We created a reasonably sophisticated business case.  If the numbers of referrals are within that modest bracket we feel that Tusla can cope with it.  It is not all about social workers.  There are only a limited number of social workers produced in Ireland every year.  It also encompasses administrative grades, social care workers, family support workers and other grades of staff as well who can assist in diverting referrals away from the \"statutory\" social work intervention.  Some of these referrals can be diverted to a lower level, a less formal type of response.  It is very important that we respond to these referrals in a proportionate way by neither over-reacting or under-reacting to them.  We are confident with the investment and with the numbers that we have projected that we can deal with that.<\/p> <p>  A very important development is our national childcare information system, NCCIS.  It is a client index system, a management information system which will track all of the children we deal with now and into the future, regardless of where they are in the country.  Eight of our 17 operational areas will be using NCCIS by the end of this year, with the remaining nine coming on stream by the summer of next year.  That will assist in getting a timely and proportionate response to these referrals and ensure that as children move around the country with their families they are tracked and that whatever response we have made to those referrals is captured and that information shared.  We will also have a dedicated email address in each of the 17 areas for receiving and responding to mandated reports, which is another development we are putting in place at the moment.  We are becoming increasingly independent from the HSE on the ICT front.  We have our own domain now which contains Tusla-only information and which is managed by us.  We are not relying on the HSE in that regards.  The roll-out of NCCIS will represent significant progress for the whole ICT strategy.  While we cannot be completely sure about the increase in referrals we have made a reasonably sophisticated calculation in terms of what we need, which formed the business case that went to the Department as part of the estimates process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2017101900002#QQ00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Fred McBride"},{"type":"speech","time":1508400000,"counter":802,"content":"<p>My last question specifically refers to referrals from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

In my introductory statement, I will focus on how our mission to safeguard stability and protect consumers is demonstrated through our work on the tracker mortgage examination, Brexit, the banking sector, the insurance sector, and the macroprudential mortgage measures.<\/p> <p>  I am joined by Ms Sharon Donnery, the deputy governor for central banking; Mr. Ed Sibley, the deputy governor for prudential regulation; and Ms Derville Rowland, the director general for financial conduct.  This reflects the reorganisation of the Bank&rsquo;s financial regulation functions in recent weeks into two pillars.  Mr. Sibley is in charge of prudential regulation and Ms Rowland is in charge of financial conduct, which includes consumer protection.  Mr. Sibley is now responsible for the supervision of credit institutions, banks and credit unions, insurers and the asset management industry.  He represents the Central Bank on the supervisory board of the European Central Bank under the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, and on the boards of the European Banking Authority, EBA, and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA.  On the financial conduct side, Ms Rowland is responsible for the financial conduct of firms in relation to their customers and clients.  This includes consumer protection, securities and markets supervision and enforcement.  She is a member of the board of supervisors of the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA.  The reason we did this reorganisation is to reflect the evolution of the European System of Financial Supervision, ESFS, including the centralisation of prudential supervision of systemically important banks under the SSM.  It also recognises the dual regulatory approach by which the Central Bank is responsible both prudential regulation and financial conduct regulation.<\/p> <p>  I turn to our consumer protection role.  Our vision is for a well-functioning, well-managed and well-regulated financial services system that safeguards stability and protects consumers.  This is best delivered by a strong culture of compliance, with firms and individuals within firms acting in the best interests of customers.  However, this needs to be reinforced by comprehensive and enforceable legislation, intrusive risk-based supervision, a credible threat of enforcement and powers of redress when consumers have suffered detriment.  As was harshly illustrated by the financial crisis, a fundamental protection for consumers lies in ensuring that the financial system is stable and that individual financial firms are subject to prudential regulations which require them to be sound and solvent, that is, to maintain substantial capital and liquidity buffers to guard against risks.  Our oversight of the system includes the authorisation of firms - the gatekeeper role - a fitness and probity regime and other governance-related requirements.  It also includes a regime to manage the resolution or closure of firms in the event of failure.  Finally, our macroprudential measures seek to build resilience across the financial system, for example, through the limits on mortgage loans to guard against over-lending and over-borrowing.<\/p> <p>  The national consumer protection framework is formed by us the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO.  In addition, we actively participate in European and international bodies that work to safeguard the interests of consumers.  Our role as the national resolution authority also contributes to both our stability and consumer protection mandates.  We are responsible for the orderly resolution of failing credit institutions, credit unions and certain types of investment firms.  For example, members will be aware of the recent appointment of provisional liquidators to Charleville Credit Union.  We took this action to protect the savings of members, which are underpinned by the deposit guarantee scheme.  The Central Bank is conscious that there is a demand for the services of a credit union in the local area and is committed to ensuring credit union services are available in the community.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the tracker mortgage examination.  The examination is focused on ensuring that lenders provide fair outcomes for all debtors damaged by unacceptable failings in the handling of tracker mortgages, which has caused considerable suffering for many of those affected.  It is clear that all lenders did not sufficiently recognise or address the scale of those unacceptable failings until Central Bank intervention.  We have had to repeatedly challenge certain lenders and push to the limits of our powers in order to drive them to identify and remedy affected customers in an appropriate manner.  This is a basic reason the examination has required significant time to progress.  If certain lenders had conducted their reviews in line with the requirements of the framework and offered better initial proposals in respect of redress and compensation, the examination would be at a more advanced stage.  We recognise the hurt and damage the actions of lenders have caused for many debtors.  This is evident in the calls we receive to our helpline and the powerful testimony from the brave individual who appeared in public before this committee last week.  As I will outline, we are pushing the limits of our powers to ensure affected customers are remedied appropriately.<\/p> <p>  The examination is the largest, most complex and most significant conduct review that we have undertaken to date in the context of our consumer protection mandate.  Unusually for a live supervisory investigation, we publish regular updates on the examination as our work progresses, precisely because we realise customers and, indeed, the wider public need information.  The latest one was published in the past few days, which the committee has received.  We have also set out principles for lenders to pay appropriate redress and compensation to affected customers, commensurate with the consumer detriment.  Among other important aspects, the principles provide for an up-front payment to enable borrowers to take independent advice regarding the redress and compensation offers made to them.  The appeals process ensures that customers have the option to challenge any aspect of the redress and compensation.  Importantly, the customer can accept the offer while still making an appeal and the offer cannot be reduced by virtue of lodging such an appeal.  In addition, customers have retained the option to bring a complaint to the FSO and-or to initiate court proceedings.<\/p> <p>  The examination is being conducted in phases.  Phase 2 required lenders to conduct a review of their mortgage loan books, identify affected customers, as well as those deemed to have been in-scope but not impacted, and submit a report of their findings.  All relevant lenders have provided phase 2 reports to the Central Bank.  As our latest update shows, by the end of September, lenders had identified approximately 13,000 affected accounts . Approximately 60% of these cases arise as a result of customers not receiving a tracker product, and the balance relates to customers not receiving the correct tracker margin.  As of end-September, lenders have rectified the interest rates applied to approximately 7,700 affected accounts.  This represents 98% of customers identified by lenders as requiring rate rectification.  The submission contains a table outlining the progress comparing the March update to the September update.  The table also indicates that the total payout so far is &euro;120 million to 3,300 customers.  With regard to the payouts, lenders are required to categorise affected customers by reference to the type and level of detriment suffered.  The types of loss identified range from overcharging as a result of the application of incorrect interest rates up to loss of ownership of mortgaged properties.  Where home or property loss has occurred, a lender is further required to conduct a causation analysis to determine whether loss of ownership resulted from its failings.  To date, lenders have reported that as a result of their failings, loss of ownership has occurred in respect of 23 homes and 79 buy-to-let properties.  As the analysis continues, we anticipate that more such cases will be identified.<\/p> <p>  As the overall reviews by lenders are subject to ongoing assurance work and challenge by the Central Bank, it is possible that more accounts may be identified more generally as the examination progresses.  We will publish a further update in early 2018.  Our assurance work involves challenging the findings of the reviews by each lender through on-site inspections, reviewing materials and meeting with the directors of these banks.  We also are receiving information directly from customers which has informed our approach and focus in particular institutions.  While assurance work is ongoing in a number of lenders, the Central Bank is concerned from the work completed to date that two lenders may have failed to identify populations of impacted customers or failed to recognise that certain groups of their customers have been affected by their failures.<\/p><p> We are of the view that some of these customers have been affected and, accordingly, are entitled to redress and compensation.  We have challenged these two lenders on these issues and they will report back to us by the end of October.  As the Central Bank progresses this work, other lenders will be challenged in a similar way.  Where we believe there are customers who may have been wrongly excluded by lenders, we will, using our statutory powers as appropriate, require those lenders to inform them of their decision and of the recourse options available.<\/p><p> The framework has been designed so that the phases can run concurrently within lending institutions in order that each lender can be dealt with as quickly as possible.  This means that third and fourth phases - the calculation and payment, respectively, of redress and compensation - can begin while the assurance work continues.<\/p><p> In respect of redress and compensation, the Central Bank does not have the statutory power to compel lenders to implement redress and compensation in respect of failures that occurred prior to 1 August 2013.  Having said that, we have made our expectations very clear to lenders and published principles for redress so that people are aware of what is expected of their lenders.  However, initial proposals from certain lenders fell materially short of our expectations.  Examples of material deficiencies included: failing to offer compensation for certain affected cohorts of customers; unacceptably low offers of compensation; unacceptably low payments for independent advice; and failing to recognise certain types of detriment sustained by customers for compensation purposes, including customers who may have switched lenders as a result of being on the incorrect interest rate.<\/p><p> As a result of our repeated challenges, lenders have significantly improved their redress and compensation proposals and appeals processes.  To the end of September, &euro;120 million had been paid out in redress and compensation under the examination.  Prior to the launch of our examination, under the separate mortgage programme for Permanent TSB and Springboard Mortgages limited, there were payouts of &euro;36.8 million and &euro;6.2 million, respectively.  This was required by the Central Bank as part of that previous process.<\/p><p> We expect all relevant lenders to have initiated redress and compensation by the end of 2017.  In the meantime, our work continues.  We are also liaising with other State agencies, including the CCPC, the FSO and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> Finally, we have two enforcement cases open, two more are in train and I expect more to follow.  We will continue to provide updates to the public on our examination and enforcement actions as this work continues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508401800,"counter":1336,"content":"<p>To assist members with their questions, will Professor Lane respond generally to the various points in his opening statement regarding the limit of the Central Bank's powers?

To expand, there was a significant shift in 2013.  We now have the power to impose redress in respect of any damage or episodes that occurred after August 2013.  We can insist that the banks offer a redress scheme in these types of cases.  As most of the damage involved in the tracker mortgage examination occurred before 2013, we have to operate under the legislation which was in effect before 2013.  Any new powers for the future would not help us deal with the scenario which existed before 2013.  We had the powers to compel the banks to produce the information contained in the second stage reports but, in terms of consequences and offering redress and compensation payments to the debtors, we have to use moral suasion and point out to the banks that they are better off putting forward these schemes on a voluntary basis.  Otherwise, they will be dealing with this issue for a long time through the ombudsman and the courts system.<\/p> <p>  If they are consumer-focused, they should recognise that it is much better to put forward a decent scheme now, rather than forcing people to go to the ombudsman and the courts.  The redress and compensation schemes currently being introduced are not being put in place under any powers of compulsion the Central Bank has.  We are essentially using our regulatory powers to point out that we have this information and that we can tell that there has been significant loss to consumers.  We are pointing out that the banks should not be asking consumers to be going forward wholesale to the ombudsman and the courts, but rather that they should be voluntarily putting schemes in place.  We are also telling them what we expect from those schemes.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Ms Rowland to add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508401800,"counter":1338,"content":"<p>I can add to that in more specific ways if the committee wishes.  When this issue arose, the framework of the examination was developed in the context of the enforcement investigation into Springboard Mortgages limited and Permanent TSB, which the members will be familiar with.  It emerged in that way.  As we were going through the investigation, it crystallised for us that the tracker matter would have a very severe effect on people if we looked at the consequential impact downstream.  As the investigation progressed, we have seen loss of home ownership, loss of buy-to-let properties and all of the devastation that has wrought on people, particularly in the context of the recession which everybody was living in.<\/p> <p>  We are, as the committee will know, the systemic regulator and we have many powers.  Since 2010 and the reform of the Central Bank after the crisis, there has been significant amplification of our powers.  I want to be very clear about that.  We have used the powers given to us under section 22 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 for information-gathering purposes.  We have extensive powers to require, on deadline and demand, the provision of specific documents and information.  We used that power when carrying out the first phase of the reports, when we demanded information to scope out and plan this enormous exercise.  We are talking about more than 2 million accounts and a great volume of information has to be acquired.  I am sure that every member of the committee understands that we would be here for decades if we had to deal with 2 million accounts on a case-by-case basis.  We had to come up with a structure which would move us through such a large-scale piece of work in an intelligent way which would be constructed to cut through the data, but which had strong degrees of assurance drilled in.  The section 22 powers have therefore been used to good effect to meet the deadlines.  The deadlines for the first phase have been met and, contrary to what may have been said in other appearances before the committee, all the deadlines imposed for the second phase have also been met.  As an aside, we were not necessarily happy with the content of what was provided and some lenders have been told to go back and do better.<\/p> <p>  We are now coming to the third and fourth phases.  In plain terms, it was our view that having an impact on people at the tail-end of the process would be going about it the wrong way around.  The most important thing was to deal with the detriment imposed on people.  The first thing we did in that space was to put out a signal and a requirement that no repossessions were to occur until there was a totally gated procedure to ensure that the cases in question were not contaminated by this difficulty.  The second thing we did was to get the lawyers together so that we could confer in respect of what we thought fair and reasonable tortious principles to assist people might look like.  We knew that this was outside the strict scope of our powers but, looking at the scale of this problem, we thought it might offer a reasonable, quick, upfront payment alternative in addition to the normal infrastructure the State has to deal with such issues.  As the committee well knows, recourse to the FSO is available on a case-by-case basis after complaints have been dealt with through the lending institutions.  That is the normal course.  For the more serious matters, cases may progress to the courts.  Since we were dealing with such scale, we thought that this additional option of compensation, which is not a typical power for a systemic regulator to even wish for or seek, might be useful in this case.<\/p><p> We also demanded that any limitation period arguments would be held in abeyance by the lenders.  Very importantly, we could not look at everything on a case-by-case basis or we would be here for decades but we stood firm about the quality of the scheme and having a good appeal mechanism in place so people could bring personal information forward before independent arbiters would assist.  That is a very important part of the framework.  We have moved into an unusual space.<\/p><p> There is a statutory power in the 2013 Act to order redress.  However, that power is prospective and does not capture the harm that has accrued in this instance because most of said harm predated the creation of that power.  In fact, what has happened in a regulatory context was that when the supervisors in consumer protection became aware of these issues, they actually moved to close the gaps and strengthen the provisions in the codes.  This is one of the main reasons it cuts off at an earlier period.<\/p><p> What we are doing is pursuing enforcement investigations in detailed, forensic ways.  There is a full suite of enforcement powers.  The committee may be aware there have been five significant court litigations challenging the constitutionality of the powers.  There have been many judicial reviews all the way to the Court of Appeal.  We have successfully defended the right of the Central Bank to use its enforcement infrastructure to support proper and effective regulation.  However, none of this delivers an answer to individuals sooner rather than later.  It is for this reason that we thought this was a good additional option.  From a conceptual perspective - let us forget the law for a moment because it is a tool to be pressed into use when necessary - this is an opportunity for lenders to show that they are different culturally to what was the case during the crisis and that consumer protection is something they can proactively consider.  They can also show, in instances where they have caused harm, that they can take the burden off the individual, on a voluntary basis, and afford him or her reasonable redress and compensation.  This will allow lenders to demonstrate that they are capable and able to put consumer protection at the heart of their consideration and just do the right thing.<\/p><p> We have moved into this space, which is unusual.  It is the result of a timing issue; it brings the monetary sums upfront.  This may not be a complete answer to the harm that has been done to people, but it is something and it is better than letting the matter pass.  We have taken the time to challenge them and it has taken longer for people, which I fully accept.  However, I think it is worth it because to come to us with proposals of no appeal is utterly unacceptable given that decision-making about appeals is the point at which the nuances will be heard.  It is really very important.  To deny the fact there is consequential impact is just not acceptable.  As we move in to look at this under our authorised officer powers, we will find more disagreement and we will commit to using those powers.  This has already started with one of the lenders.  We are demanding that the two with which we are not happy - we will find we are not happy with more - to come back and answer us.  We have imposed deadlines in this regard.  We believe that the disagreement has probably reached the stage with some of them whereby there is no point in continuing an inconclusive conversation any more.<\/p><p> If people are left out of the scope and we think they should be included, we do not have the power to deliver them into the compensation and redress scheme on a voluntary basis because the decision lies with the lender and not with us.  What we do have is the power to direct a lending institution to identify, by name, the specific individuals about whom we are concerned and to notify them in writing of its decision not to include them and to tell them of their right of redress to the FSO and to the court.  The reason we need this to be done is so people are on specific notice of their rights and can assert them.  In this context, we have been in touch with the FSO to discuss the very welcome amendment to the limitation period, which enables cases to be brought in a longer time span and that is not a difficulty.  This is very welcome, and the ombudsman also sees the benefit of the normal infrastructure working.  If this happened today - I hope it will not but, in the context of financial services across the globe, consumer protection issues do arise - a key feature of the system is to be able to fix those problems.  We have redress powers.  We do not have compensation powers, which are different, but one would think that is usually a matter for the courts because of the specific consideration, but we do have redress powers that would apply today so we would be in a somewhat different position.  I hope this is of assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Derville Rowland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1508401800,"counter":1340,"content":"<p>I want to pick up on Ms Rowland's final point.

Does the Central Bank have the power, under the 2013 Act and where customers are currently being overcharged, to impose a redress position on those bank?

If the banks continue to point to their legal advice and we to our legal view, the result will be a legal conflict which would delay a lot of payments and would only address harm from 2013 onwards.  I appreciate that there is a lot of frustration around this but I would like to point to the following.  First, in the case of various lenders, a lot is being paid out now relating to the whole duration of the damage and not only post-2013.  This is a success of the examination.  Second, we are pushing back.  With the pushback there has been a lot of movement over the course of the year in various cases.  It is true to say that more remains to be done.  We do reserve the option of taking cases to the ombudsman and the courts.  As there is no longer a time limit on the harm, it means that the pre-2013 losses will be subject to rectification and compensation by the ombudsman.  That is very important.  Our strategy is to look at the lifetime of the damage, not just 2013 onwards.  If we focus only on 2013 onwards, in most cases not enough would be paid out.

That was a common dynamic across the system.  Second, as the Deputy said, given the movements in funding costs and in interest rates, the economic incentive for these banks was essentially to interpret any possibility of making their own profitability higher to the detriment of customers.  There are common factors there.  In a similar situation, there is a common culture, which comes back to many things about the banks.

If they were re-reading contracts and determining that certain scenarios were not really catered for in the way those contracts were written, they may have interpreted in light of that ambiguity that the correct rate should be X, or that certain customers should not be returned to trackers after the expiration of a fixed period.  They may have been using the legal ambiguity in the understanding that they could stand over such an interpretation, even if customers might have a very different interpretation.  The fair-minded person on the street might think it is surely obvious that the natural interpretation is that the tracker rate should be the original rate, as the Deputy suggested earlier, or that it is obvious that the customer has a right, but the legalistic interpretation might be different.  Essentially, much of the dispute centres on the gap between what one might be able to base a court case on and what needs to be done to put the customer first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#M02200","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1508401800,"counter":1491,"content":"<p>I still think it is a stretch that it would happen in the different banks in the same period of time.<\/p><p>The witnesses might come back on that.

One is that in many of these institutions there has been significant internal turnover.  The management teams are different and the banks themselves, under the pressure of their leadership, have had to take a big look at how they operate.  A basic issue is poor documentation and being unclear to their customers and themselves about what exactly a product means.  It is not just us.  The European momentum is to have much clearer contracts and a greater amount of information provided.  It is to recognise that the circumstances of the world can change and that we should be crystal clear about what people understand going into a contract.  That basic systems-and-clarity issue is important.  It is also the case that a great deal of our consumer protection work these days is about bringing to the attention of boards the fact that part of the work of a board relates to governance and that ensuring staff on the front line who are designing these products and interacting with customers take seriously their obligation to put the customer first.  That is an ongoing engagement.  Ultimately, the culture issue is being pushed partly by us.  It is definitely in the long-term interests of the banks to elevate the protection-of-consumers agenda within organisations.  In this process, many hundreds of millions are going to be spent, not just in payouts but in the internal costs of running it.  Not just here, but around the world, there have been so many conduct scandals in recent years that it creates a major incentive for the banks to change their ways.  We have seen in this process, however, that they have relied on lawyers to narrow down the scope of the examination, which indicates that this is far from a revolution in how the banks operate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1508401800,"counter":1495,"content":"<p>That is precisely where I was going with the next question.

I really want to find out the answer to this question.  What powers does the Central Bank need to ensure it can get the redress and compensation scheme under way for all of the banks by the end of the year?  Ms Rowland has said the Central Bank has no compensation powers.  Why is that the case?  What powers does it need?  This is the problem.  It appears from what we are hearing that in cases prior to 2013, when the bulk of the wrong tracker interest rates were imposed, the Central Bank can do absolutely nothing.  Effectively, from what I can see, it has no legal powers to put a redress and compensation programme in place.  What needs to be put in place by way of legislation to give the Central Bank the power to seek redress and compensation for those who were affected prior to 2013 and to ensure it can dictate to the banks that under a certain measure customers who have been impacted on should be dealt with?  Ms Rowland has said the Central Bank requires the banks to write to individuals to state they believe they have not been impacted on and that they will have to go to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  It appears that in the case of the banks and the Central Bank, the tail is wagging the dog.  The Central Bank has not included in its update that under existing legislation it did not have the power to do anything in cases prior to 2013.  What powers does it need from the Oireachtas to enable it to solve this problem?  I acknowledge that 13,000 cases have been identified in the investigation, but there are many more homeowners who need to be identified also.

There are many options for those affected but the hope is that, although the examination process is still too slow, it will deliver an upfront payment sooner rather than later.  Approximately 3,000 people have already received a payment and approximately 13,000 more will be paid in the coming months.  This in no way damages or restricts a person's option to take the payment and still bring his or her case to the ombudsman and the courts.  Consequently, this gives many layers of redress or recourse for those affected.  We are not saying that people should immediately go to the ombudsman.  They should consider the redress and compensation offer they receive from the bank, take the independent advice, which will be paid for under this mechanism, and at that point make a decision.

I wish to address overcharging and sharp practices in respect of commercial loans to SMEs.  Such a loan could be a tracker mortgage or a similar financial product such as a rate swap product involving a bank inducing a company that is trying to trade out of trouble onto another product which would cost it more money, or unilateral rate changes involving the cost of funds plus a margin.  Banks have their own formula for calculating the cost of funds and that is a moveable feast.  Banking sources have indicated that there are SMEs in similar situations to private citizens in that they have suffered enforcement actions by banks following non-performance of loans into which banks tricked their SME customers either by removing them from a tracker or putting them onto some similar financial product to their detriment.  The particular cases of which I have heard suggest this does not solely concern enforcement action and overcharging but also extreme situations involving the closure of businesses, loss of jobs and personal fallout for those involved.  I raise this issue in regard to SMEs and tracker mortgages in particular.  Members know that SMEs do not have access to the financial ombudsman in the same manner as a private citizen.  Their recourse for remedy is to the courts and they do not have the same avenues of recourse that Professor Lane said are available for private customers.  In view of information I have been given and cases that have been brought to my attention I wish to know the extent to which the Central Bank has been investigating or assessing the impact on SMEs as part of its assessment and crystallisation of the dispute in respect of tracker mortgages and similar financial products.  How many such cases has the Central Bank discovered within that assessment process?  What provision are the banks making for compensation in such cases?  To what extent are SMEs included in the tracker redress scheme?  This is another cohort that is not being talked about.  I have heard of cases, even from people within the banking community who have dared to come forward, which indicate there is an equal and perhaps even more devastating problem in this area because although the focus is on people and their homes, and there is a clear reason for that, some small businesses have been devastated by the overcharging, sharp practices and possibly illegal activities of banks, although the latter remains to be proven.

Regarding enforcement, penalties and fines, it would seem that, notwithstanding what the country has gone through and the backlash against banks, they still seem to believe that they do not need to adhere to the same standards as other professions.  If someone's solicitor is fined, the solicitor does not turn around and send a fee note to a different client telling him or her to help pay the fine.  With the banks, however, whatever financial penalties the Central Bank imposes on them just seem to be passed on to customers.  How are they paying?<\/p> <p>  This speaks to the issue of the banks' culture.  Some members have outlined a litany of incidents, namely, the bogus non-resident accounts, the DIRT scandal, systematic overcharging of customers by NIB, the tracker loan scandal involving all of the banks, general governance issues at Anglo Irish Bank and INBS, AIB and Allfirst, the PPI situation and endowment mortgage sales.  These are just the headline issues.  In terms of culture, what sanctions will make a difference to bankers' thinking?  They do not operate like human beings at all.  This is what is constantly reported back by people who have had encounters.  As a country, taxpayers and a Government, everyone had to stretch to save the banking system for public interest reasons.  As such, that professionals within the banks have not been held to account seems to be a major issue.<\/p> <p>  The greatest impact the Central Bank could have is to tell banks that if they breach a certain threshold of behaviour, it will consider revoking their operating licences.  That is what will hit them.  They will pass on fines and the like.  That is what they do.

We have got to have high standards, expect more and keep driving for that challenge.  We must work together to bring about a more proactive consideration of consumer impact.

Professor Lane has to understand this.  I am tired of listening to the Central Bank telling us all of these things.  I understand them.  I understand Ms Rowland's difficulties in respect of the law and everything else.  The fact of the matter, however, is that when one goes back to it, these banks did wrong by their customers, before 2013 and after.  They went to the courts and failed.  Mr. Kissane told the committee at one stage that he had won court cases and the banks still fought similar cases, rather than conceding.  Forgetting all the talk about the legal framework and everything else, although that is required, people are asking what are the banks' responses, on a human level, to the theft they have conducted and to what they have done.

We agree with the Chairman that referring only to the legal framework is not sufficient.  That is why we have gone beyond that framework in respect of our regulatory powers to push the banks into developing redress and compensation schemes, which will mean that more people will receive redress and compensation than would have been possible had we just left it to the ombudsman and the courts system to deal with this matter.  We fully agree that it is not sufficient just to resort to legalistic interpretations.  The motivation is strong within the Central Bank to ensure that our processes are not just <i>pro forma<\/i>.  We are pushing back in order to ensure that as many people as possible receive reasonable redress and compensation payments.<br\/><br\/>It is very important to recognise that there is variation.  Some banks have proactively signed up and conducted themselves in a reasonable manner.  That is seen in the fact that thousands of cases have already been concluded in terms of redress and compensation.  Other banks were slower but we have now pushed them into a situation in which we believe more redress and compensation schemes will be initiated very soon.  We have also signalled that various cohorts of populations remain in dispute.  It is not a one-size-fits-all response.  We believe a lot of progress was made this year to get us to our current position.  We should not have been required to push the banks to get this far.  I do not want the message to be that not much has happened in respect of this situation.  A lot has happened.  There has been a lot of progress and much of it will crystalise into more payments to more people in the coming months.  There remain outstanding issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#U01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1508401800,"counter":1660,"content":"<p>If I was a customer I would like to hear that, but do I believe it?  No, I do not.  I will tell Professor Lane why.  Some of the banks which have appeared before the committee told us that customers would not be paid until next year, perhaps even late next year.  One bank brazenly told us that it would not meet the deadlines.  Its representatives sat there and told us that the bank would not meet the deadline and it would not give us the figures we asked for.  They told us that, in fact, the bank would not tell us anything until this thing was over.  That is the kind of respect it showed for the Irish Parliament.  That bank is licensed in this country.  I do not have great faith in it.<\/p> <p>  The other issue is that in 2016, the Central Bank spend &euro;7.3 million on legal fees.  I wonder how much will be spent in 2017.  I am not critical of the Central Bank spending the money - it has to - my criticism is that it has to.  My criticism is that the banks are forcing the Central Bank and the Irish taxpayer to pay even more money in the course of 2017 to try to resolve this issue.  It will cost even more money.  In terms of professionals, did Professor Lane ever ask the auditors or the legal advisers in those banks about this particular tracker issue?  Did they know about it?  Surely if they audited the books in the way in which they should, they would have known about it.  Is it not amazing that every single bank had the same problem at the same time?  They all had tracker issues.  It has happened to them all and they are all fighting it in the same way.  Can we not call it what it is?  It is a cartel.  It was an arrangement.

When the representatives of the Central Bank appeared before the committee last year, I made the point that the schemes the bank had to sign off on were inadequate.  I welcome the fact that the bank has challenged two of the schemes.  When a person has been overcharged by &euro;30,000 on a tracker mortgage, that money is stolen from him or her.  I know some individuals in this position.  I have sat in their houses and listened to their concerns.  They have cried in front of me when they told how their children's childhoods were taken from them and how matters were made worse when they did not have the money to cover medical procedures.  Some people blame the financial distress this caused them for the breakdown of their marriages and no longer having access to their children on a 24-7 basis.  A person who has had &euro;30,000 stolen from him or her by a bank is being offered &euro;3,000 compensation, which amounts to &euro;1 for every day he or she did not have access to his or her money.

Compensation is proportionate and we would expect higher rates for the more severe scenarios.  The back-up is that one can appeal the level of compensation within the framework.  The circumstances of every individual are different.  The lender is supposed to take into account the circumstances of the individual when making the initial offer.  If, however, the initial offer is not enough, then the independent appeals process provides a mechanism to challenge it.  If the outcome of the independent appeals process is not to the satisfaction of the customer, then the ombudsman stands ready to take his case.  Finally, there are the courts.  In cases where the losses have been really severe, I would expect that these other mechanisms to kick in when the initial offer of the bank is not enough.

They were required to look at the groups of people affected from the viewpoint of different experiences that they had, from the gravest which is the loss of home ownership and loss of property and all the horror that brings.  Certain proposals are being made by lenders.  Another variant is that the proposals are not uniform, because it is the boards of the lenders that are approving the offers.  I am sure the Deputy heard different information about various categories from the lenders that appeared before the committee so he knows very well that they vary.  That is at the most severe.

It sends a very important message across all of the institutions, not just in that area but in all of the other areas of the markets.

If we take, for example, Permanent TSB's existing customers, when it comes to a fixed rate offering the lowest offer they will receive is 4.2%, irrespective of their loan to value ratio.  New customers can get a rate as low as 3.2%.  This is one example of clear discrimination between new and existing customers.<\/p> <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission did a paper on mortgage options and looked at the issue of cashback offers in the mortgage market.  It made the point these offers and their marketing are potentially exploitative of consumer biases and may result in consumers making decisions for short-term gains that over the medium or long term are not in their best interests.  It has recommended that a joint working group examine the issue further.

In other words, there is a trade-off that maybe it would protect some types of households who are genuinely making an error and not properly calculating the cost, but others can make that calculation and with full eyes open decide cash back is their preference.  There is a global debate about behavioural finance, not only in terms of paternalism but in terms of at least ensuring there is enough information and transparency, and having online calculators so that people can plug the numbers in as easily as possible.

We really only have half the equation.  We have the Central Bank &ndash; the regulator.  The more I think about the banks, the angrier I get.  Most of these banks were bailed out by the taxpayer.  I suspect that if this investigation, late and all as it was to start, had never unfolded, then the banks would have pretended this was not going on.  I have had people come to me in Limerick with various cases involving these institutions.  They have sought documentation.  They were being switched from tracker to fixed and from fixed to variable.  Most of the time they cannot even find out precisely what the arrangement is.  Many people were getting so worn down that they were going away by stealth.  Manners must be put on the banks.<\/p> <p>  The banks cannot expect that things are back to normal.  I remember in July 2008, the banks came before this committee.  Many of them said there were no problems.  One of the institutions, Bank of Ireland, said there were problems.  A short time later they were back with the begging bowl looking for taxpayers' money with a night time raid on Government Buildings.  The problem is that they are having it both ways.  Let us consider the people on tracker mortgages.  The banks are getting their money - I was going to say that it was resting in the banks' accounts.  The banks are taking customers' money from over-charging them.  Second, they are taking the same customers' money from the hard-paid taxes they have paid for services.  That money ended up going into these banks.  It was double jeopardy for the ordinary punter or tracker-mortgage holder.<\/p> <p>  I expect that the Central Bank would apply the firm arm of the regulator to ensure this matter is resolved post-haste by the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#QQ03700","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508401800,"counter":1952,"content":"<p>We are absolutely committed to pushing this forward.<\/p><p>Much of it has been completed in some banks.

We operate as part of a European system of banking supervision.  Setting capital levels for banks, which are what are called significant institutions and include the main Irish retail banks, takes place within the Single Supervisory Mechanism.  We, as part of that mechanism, with the ECB and the other competent authorities across the eurozone, make the determination as to the appropriate level of capital to be held within any bank that is deemed significant.  We have an important and active role to play in terms of the execution of the work, the methodologies that are used and the final decision making process.  Every year we complete our risk assessment taking into account the issues the banks face today as well as on a forward-looking basis.  We consider what are reasonably plausible stress scenarios.  We would expect the banks to be undertaking their own capital planning, including stress testing, as well.  We use that to set up minimum capital requirements for banks to hold.<\/p> <p>  We also issue capital guidance which we expect them to hold over and above the hard requirement.  In theory, the banks have some degree of choice as to whether they hold it but in practice they are all above it.  Typically, capital requirements are set towards the end of the year.  We are coming to the very end of that process now and are setting capital requirements for all of the Irish retail banks.  These will take in all our considerations as to the risks they face on a forward-looking basis, whether it is Brexit-related, the conduct risk that we have thought about or other factors.  That sets a minimum capital requirement.  We have a small buffer on top as guidance.  In reality, we expect the banks to hold a bit more above that.  We do not like to see banks that are just on the surface or with very little margin between the regulator requirements and the requirements they hold.  That will capture the Brexit risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#BBB00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speech","time":1508401800,"counter":2213,"content":"<p>As a result of the assessment carried out by the financial stability division of the Central Bank on the risk relating to Brexit, are we likely to see additional capital requirements on at least a number of the Irish institutions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#BBB00500","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508401800,"counter":2214,"content":"<p>How I can answer that is somewhat limited.  If we look across the European system, historically - and this is partly driven by our experience in the crisis - the level of capital that we require banks in Ireland to hold would probably be slightly higher than is the case in other jurisdictions.  There has been a degree of normalisation of that through the consistency and level playing field that is trying to be driven through banking union.  In-built in the capital requirements, as of last year and into this year, was the outcome of the 2016 European banking authority stress test.  As referred to by the Governor, that was a severe stress test, particularly for the Irish banks, because it brought in comparisons with historical loss levels that had been incurred by banks in the recent past.  Where banks were operating in systems whereby they had high loss levels, which was evidently the case in Ireland, the stress test outcome was more negative than that in those jurisdictions which did not have a history of credit losses.  That would also have influenced the capital levels which would have been set coming out of the EBA stress test in 2016 and, broadly speaking, what we expect to see in terms of capital levels and capital requirements this year is for them to be consistent with those that were set in 2016.  There are perhaps different drivers underneath that, but overall we expect capital levels to be broadly the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#BBB00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Sibley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508401800,"counter":2215,"content":"<p>Many different factors influence capital levels.

It would be possible for an entity to decide its goal was not to satisfy some private shareholders but to have wider community objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#EEE00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508401800,"counter":2279,"content":"<p>The banking market in Ireland is changing again.  There is a degree of recovery in the retail banks.  We are seeing expansion again in what I would describe as the internationally focused banks.  They do not spend a lot of time serving the Irish economy and Irish customers, rather they enter Europe.  Credit unions obviously have an important role to play across the country, particularly from a financial inclusion perspective.  The sector faces some challenges, but we are supportive of credit unions in trying to deal with the viability challenges they face.<\/p> <p>  Something at which we look very closely is the uncertainty surrounding financial innovation and potentially a degree of fragmentation in banking-like services being provided.  Specific niche entities are coming in.  We see it particularly with the providers of payments services.  What we have not seen to date - this is the ultimate aim of banking union - is more cross-border activity across the eurozone.

The evidence from the United States is that once cross-state banking was permitted there, banks became much more efficient and could be a cheaper provider of credit because of the diversification.  A community bank which raises funding and lends locally has positives but also has the negative of exposure only to that region.  If a region in Ireland is reliant on an industry that gets into trouble, the local bank will get into trouble because it is so concentrated in a locality.  There are pros and cons in having these locally focused banks.<\/p> <p>  In the end I ultimately agree with my predecessor.  We need a variety of banks.  With consolidation in Europe, there will be some large banks which will be hyper-efficient because they will have the scale and technology to run the underlying systems cheaply and at the same perhaps supplement them - this is a public policy decision - with some more locally focused banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#EEE00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Philip Lane"},{"type":"speech","time":1508401800,"counter":2281,"content":"<p>I apologise that I had to step out to attend another meeting earlier.<\/p> <p>  The Central Bank is putting considerable pressure on the major banks to sell off loans - good and bad loans - perhaps bundled to get their books in order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#EEE00600","speaker":"1380"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1508401800,"counter":2282,"content":"<p>Let me refine that comment.

We have a very good line of information between the consumer protection area in the Central Bank and the ombudsman.  Since we were aware of it and thought it should be looked at again in a wider way, we put it in as one of the requirements of the framework.  We have tried to be really clear about it and started at zero again.  Every tracker-related issue was put inside this examination.  That is why it is so huge.  We did not want to come back and have to gather up parts of this again and say it was problematic.  It started at the widest possible parameter and moved in to any kind of tracker-related issue or mortgage where a change had happened - we set out quite a degree of detail about that.  Inside of those criteria also would be the cases from the ombudsman, notwithstanding that the ombudsman may have found against those people.

Not all breaches across the regulatory spectrum will end up as an enforcement case.  One would not be able to bring that volume of cases.  We have a strategy of targeted and reactive enforcement.  Reactive enforcement occurs in the most serious cases and we make the space to give resources to bring them forward.  The tracker loan issue is a very good example of that approach.  We also have targeted enforcement where we predefine areas where we see that compliance levels are low and it is very important to bring them up.  We take a targeted set of enforcement measures to improve them.  Transaction reporting in the markets area was another example.  During the years we have taken quite a number of prudential focused cases in different areas that were very important.  To be clear, from the very beginning of the enforcement strategy, as stated in 2010 until now, there has not been a total zero tolerance threshold for every single breach across the spectrum of regulated areas.  We may take one or two of a particular type where we see non-compliance in an area and may take more.  There are other regulatory tools in the escalation pyramid that are also used as enforcement measures to complement it.  That is the general approach.  We also have supervisory warnings as an enforcement tool which are private between the entity and the regulator.

Taking the point that a meeting has been agreed with Mr. Sugarman and the Chairman, which is very good, we are now in 2017.  These events date back to, I believe, 2007 and that time.  Since then, in this jurisdiction, significant whistleblowing legislation has been passed and brought into force.  There has been more than one type.  It is a really important signal of confidence in the Central Bank and its current whistleblowing and listening obligations.  As Mr. Sibley has already stated, we take those obligations extremely seriously.  We have a whistleblowing desk.  We take the information in.  Employment law protections are now built into the system in this jurisdiction which I do not believe were there before, so the legislative framework is different.  We have a dedicated whistleblowing function so that when information comes into the Central Bank it is sent immediately to the line supervisors, as they are the experts with regard to the institutions that they supervise, so that they can assess that information and action is taken.  That is an important point to make in terms of the structure of the system now and the formulation of whistleblowing legislation and how it has been brought in as an important part of the infrastructure in this jurisdiction.  It is not, I believe, just in financial services, but right across the board, and it is right that it is.  It is right that I am clear about our support for that and the importance we place on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2017101900002#JJJ02300","nonspeaker":"Ms Derville Rowland"},{"type":"speech","time":1508401800,"counter":2386,"content":"<p>I am very much aware of that legislation and so are a number of others who turned out to be whistleblowers.

Lastly, in terms of vulture funds and how they manage accounts, I asked the Governor about the general communication from banks.  I have to tell him that in dealing with some of the vulture funds, such as Capita, and their managers, it is unacceptable the rounds that one has to go to to get the information relevant to one's case.  For instance, they do not return calls as efficiently or quickly as they should because they are dealing with a party on the other end who is stressed in more ways than one.  In attending the meetings I was taken aback by the attitude, as I stated today in the D&aacute;il, to sit opposite one of these, Capita, and to hear staff tell the borrower that he or she should get the money from parents, brothers, sisters, neighbours or the local credit union, but that it wants the money.  I am taken back by the general attitude within Capita to the management of its different property loans, etc.  It does not give the individual a chance.  It is only by intervention of outside help that individuals get the basic information that they are entitled to.  It is not acceptable for that message to be sent out through them.  The Central Bank should take note of the type of attitude that individuals are experiencing when they come up against the big monied well-armed legal people, such as the one I have dealt with so far, Capita.
