The T\u00e1naiste will be aware that on 19 September the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, who had targeted savings of &#8364;75 million in abolishing 1,100 allowances, announced he could only find one allowance for existing workers that could be cancelled and the savings would only come to &#8364;3.5 million, a significant gap.  Subsequent to this statement, both IMPACT and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions conveyed to the Government and the Minister there were further possibilities and that the Minister had not gone far enough, should have dug deeper and there was room for consultation.  The Minister indicated he would undertake such consultation.  Suddenly, on 28 September, nine days later, the Minister found he cut 90 allowances instead of one.  That is a 9,000% improvement in nine days.  The public and private sectors could take some lessons from that.<\/p><p><br \/>  What procedure will the Government adopt to reduce these allowances?  Is the procedure going to be within the terms of the Croke Park agreement?  What savings does the Minister now envisage achieving?  According to reports, one allowance he is proposing to cut, if cut last year, would have saved the country the grand sum of &#8364;2,500.  Another one would have saved less than &#8364;20,000.

They certainly include Opposition Deputies whose responsibility it is to hold the Minister to account and to raise the appropriate issues.  Now, that contempt is also clearly held for the Standing Orders of the House, in spite of the Ceann Comhairle's efforts to compel the Minister to reply appropriately to a Deputy.  The Minister's attitude could be best summed up by saying, \"How dare you question me?\"  I believe this has been nakedly exposed by his refusal to answer clear and concise questions and the obfuscation he employs in the answers he gives.  Last evening, the Minister issued a further so-called reply to me following the Ceann Comhairle's ruling yesterday to the effect that he was in breach of Standing Order 40A.  That further reply oozes contempt.  I will be further referring the matter to the Ceann Comhairle today.  We have further evidence this week of the Minister's arrogance in the report of his so-called meeting in Leinster House earlier this week with the founder and principal of one of the country's foremost children's charities.<\/p><p>  Whatever one's view of what took place at this week's Committee of Public Accounts, when the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the director general designate of the Health Service Executive appeared before the committee, there is undoubtedly a concern, which I have heard expressed by those of all views across the Chamber, that the engagement got off to an unprecedented bad start.  Given that the Minister for Health is the person who will appoint the members of the new HSE directorate, including the director general, and the growing evidence of the Berlin Wall that he is building around himself, his Department and the HSE, has the T\u00e1naiste any concerns about the fact that only those already working in the HSE who already hold the grade of national director can be considered for these crucial posts?  Should these opportunities not be open to public competition?

We introduced a new procedure or Standing Order and we asked the House to agree that where a Member was not satisfied with a reply from a Minister, the Member could take the case to the Ceann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle could make a ruling on it.

Let us make no mistake: there are Members in the House, including members of the T\u00e1naiste's party, who view what occurred at the Committee of Public Accounts as indicative and demonstrative of what is wrong at the helm of the Department of Health and of the Minister's disposition permeating to all at the highest level within that Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100004#B03700","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1349948700,"counter":58,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy \u00d3 Caol\u00e1in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100005#C00100","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1349948700,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I would ask the T\u00e1naiste to note that there are reports this morning that there is growing disillusionment within his party at the Minister, Deputy Reilly's, continued stewardship of the Department of Health.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100005#C00200","speaker":"969"},{"type":"speech","time":1349948700,"counter":60,"content":"<p>Sorry, Deputy, you are over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100005#C00300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"speech","time":1349948700,"counter":61,"content":"<p>That is real and the T\u00e1naiste cannot deny it.

There was support for the treaty across all sectors of society, including retail, agriculture and business, because they recognised its importance to ensuring continued investment, stability, recovery and growth.  The treaty is one of a number of measures aimed at helping the economy to recover and avoid future economic crises.  The vote was a positive step on our road to recovery because it ensured not only that we could access the European Stability Mechanism but also that future Governments would not have the power to be as reckless with taxpayers' money as they were in the past.<\/p><p>  Formal ratification of the treaty will only take place once the Fiscal Responsibility Bill 2012 is enacted.  The Bill provides for the implementation in Irish law of Articles 3 and 4 of the fiscal compact treaty to strengthen rules on the management of the public finances.  Article 3 sets out the budgetary rules to which future Governments will have to adhere, while Article 4 sets out debt rules.  The Bill provides a statutory basis for a range of fiscal policy and expenditure management reforms in Ireland.  The fact that the budget rules will be implemented across 25 EU member states will also give Ireland and the eurozone security.  The strength of other economies in the eurozone is vital to the survival of the euro and a return to growth in the economy.<\/p><p>  The Bill establishes the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on a statutory basis to monitor Ireland's fiscal policy.  I welcome the establishment of the council which will comprise five experts from various backgrounds who will independently review the Government's budgetary targets and objectives.  The fact that the council will comment publicly on actions taken by the Government in respect of fiscal policy can only serve to introduce greater transparency to the process.  We already know the council's position on the economy from the reports it has issued.<\/p><p>  Article 3 of the treaty provides for a number of fiscal rules, including a commitment by governments that the general government budgetary position shall be balanced or in surplus.  There is also provision for an automatic correction mechanism which will be triggered in the event that there are significant deviations from budgetary targets or the adjustment paths towards it.  Allowance will be made for deviations from objectives in exceptional circumstances.   Article 4 provides for a reduction of 5% per annum in the difference between the actual debt-to-GDP ratio and the 60% threshold where a member state's debt is in excess of this threshold figure.  It is important that these fiscal rules are implemented in Irish law in order to increase governmental accountability and transparency.  Implementation of the budget rules will also increase investor confidence in the economy and have a positive impact on our ability to attract foreign direct investment which has improved greatly since the Government entered office.  Foreign investors will be confident that the Government is controlling the country's finances and that we are able to fund the country into the future.  This will lead to further investment in job creation and growth measures.<\/p><p>  The Government has thus far met its targets and fiscal commitments under the EU-IMF programme.  We have strictly adhered to the plans set out by the troika, which is appreciated by all concerned.  The Bill will make a valuable contribution to the reform of Ireland's budgetary framework and help us to get our finances back on track.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100007#E03500","speaker":"1019"},{"type":"speech","time":1349949900,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Terence Flanagan, for outlining the technical aspects of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill 2012.  Public finances are in meltdown in Ireland, across the eurozone and around the globe.  The ballooning of sovereign debt in the last three years is due to the conversion of private banking sector losses which have not yet been fully recognised into national debt.  At a conference held in Wyoming in August 2011 it was pointed out that the economies of developing nations with combinations of sovereign, household and non-financial business debt exceeding an aggregate of 300% would be suffocated and become depressed, sometimes for a long period, as has happened in Japan.<\/p><p>Many wise and highly qualified experts in economics and finance have pointed out that it is the debt burden across nations that is causing the problem.  It is good that governments address their own fiscal responsibilities and the generation and spending of revenue in a balanced way across the sectors of the economy, including health, pensions, education and social welfare supports for people who become unemployed or who need extra help and assistance.  These are the main sectors that governments have become involved in over the last number of years, particularly since the Second World War.<\/p><p><br \/> When the financial system ran amok due to the lack of regulation of prudential operation and greed in the industry across the globe, the financial infrastructure - savings and pensions - of nations became imperilled and governments were strong-armed and frightened into taking on the huge liabilities and losses of these sectors.  We are right to examine fiscal responsibility and to address the current budget controls in Article 3 of the treaty, and it is right for governments to consider the controls on debt-to-GDP ratios under Article 4.  However, I lose my confidence in the bureaucrats and the establishment when I see that even in the drafting of Article 4 there is a contradiction.  The fiscal advisory council, which is being institutionalised by means of this Bill, got a fright when I pointed this out to it when it came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  We should read this again so we can think about it.  When bureaucrats do not get it right, where does it leave us with regard to getting overall direction and strategy right?  Article 4 states:<blockquote> When the ratio of a Contracting Party's general government debt to gross domestic product exceeds the 60% reference value referred to in Article 1 of the Protocol (No 12) on the excessive deficit procedure, annexed to the European Union Treaties, that Contracting Party shall reduce it at an average rate of one twentieth per year as a benchmark, as provided for in Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467\/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure, as amended by Council Regulation (EU) No 1177\/2011 of 8 November 2011.<\/blockquote>This contains a contradiction in terms, but some ground is retrieved in the second part of what is a long and clumsy sentence by the use of the phrase &quot;as provided for&quot; in a previous Article.  This is messy and undermines confidence in the bureaucrats.<\/p><p><br \/>  For the next 18 months, we as a Parliament must set aside the partisan petty politics of the past.  We must put them aside and spearhead a well focused and well directed effort towards the recovery of this nation.  We must examine where we are in terms of debt.  Our household debt, our non-financial business or corporate debt and our sovereign debt are the highest in the developed world.  However, the penny has not dropped - or rather, the cent has not dropped - in Brussels.  We must keep hammering this point home.  Hungary, which was damaged due to low interest rates in the EU region, is now struggling under an IMF programme.  The Government there is publishing one-page advertisements in the country's newspapers pointing out to the IMF the situation in Hungary and how it will not be pushed around but will talk raw horse to the IMF.  We need to do that and to keep doing that.<\/p><p><br \/> Our vote in favour of the treaty was 60:40, but we should remember that 60% was because of the fear that we would not have access to the ESM.  That was the main driving force behind the 60% vote.  The driving force was not what was contained in the fiscal stability algebra of fiscal balance in an annual budget and debt-to-GDP ratios, but whether we would have access or be left hanging out to dry or left in the quicksands of a financial burden.  As Deputies, we all know that households are in difficulty.  People come to us in tears and distress because they cannot handle the debt.  This is the message we must get across.<\/p><p><br \/> Basel III had all to do with financial regulation and I commend it, along with the book <i>Guardians of Finance<\/i>, to the House.  It talks about the sentinel and the regulators of the financial world.  We need a qualified and articulate sentinel that will be able to assess and monitor the regulators in the financial system.  That is where the problem lies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100007#E03600","speaker":"1027","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349950500,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Fiscal Responsibility Bill 2012.  The Bill addresses Articles 3 and 4 of the stability treaty and in doing so it is another piece of the complex jigsaw the Government, the previous Government and all citizens have had to compile and piece together in a difficult and painstaking way in order to get the country back on the road to fiscal sustainability and to restoring economic sovereignty.  Just as the stability treaty sends out a message to the wider world and to those we depend on to lend this country money that we are open for business and that we are prepared to take the measures we must take and to learn from the economic mistakes of the past, the passage of this Bill through the Oireachtas is another step.<\/p><p>  To bring the issue down to brass tacks, the passage of this Bill will mark the maturing of our nation and, I hope, of our politics.  What it means is that the days of auction politics are truly over.  In the past, every time we had a general election, there was a little extra children's allowance or a bump up in the pension or whatever, regardless of whether these were sought or assessed or whether analysis had been done as to whether the country could afford it.  Those days must now be over.  However, yesterday we saw one party in this House continue in a regrettable manner with auction politics, by coming out as opposing a property tax to which it had signed up.  This serves nobody well.<\/p><p>  Deputy Mathews is correct.  We need mature and bipartisan discussion and we as a Government need to embrace ideas from others.  We need to forgo auction politics, under which promises are made that if people vote for us we will get rid of some tax or hike up spending.  All of us, including members of political parties and Independent Members, are guilty of this.  However, this Bill puts manners on us and puts an end to that practice by compelling the Government and the Oireachtas to live within certain parameters.  This is important.  Clearly, there are issues that need to be addressed and areas of spending that need to be increased when we regain economic sovereignty, but the notion of throwing money around and of whoever promises the most money winning the election is ridiculous.  It has brought about much of the pain and suffering that Irish families are experiencing every day.<\/p><p>  With that in mind, what this Bill does with regard to putting the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on a statutory basis must be seen as a welcome development.  It was proactive and beneficial that the Government established the council before the passage of its legislation, but the enhancement of its role and the placing of it on a statutory basis when the Bill passes will be a welcome development.  The council will provide independent oversight and will allow the public, the media, those talking heads that like to comment on the economy and taxpayers with greater access to advice, economic opinion, transparency and a greater level of mature engagement on the issues surrounding fiscal probity in this country.<\/p><p>  The fact that the council will continue to make public assessments and pronouncements is vital.  However, there is one caveat.  It is important to make this caveat or we may pack up and go home.  The Fiscal Council cannot become the Government.  The economy drives society and a successful economy can help bring about a more equal society and address many societal issues.  There has been commentary in the media and in this House recently that the fiscal advisory council has said we &quot;must&quot; do something and therefore the Government &quot;must&quot; adopt it in whole.<\/p><p>That defeats the purpose of a participative democracy.  That defeats the purpose of a Government.  A Government's priority has to go beyond the economy.  I welcome the provisions in this Bill that will ensure future Governments have to account for their actions.  If they choose not to accept advice, they will have to explain that decision.  If they deviate from the parameters that are being set out, they will have to explain why that has happened.  It would be wrong of the media or Opposition or Government politicians to presume that the Fiscal Advisory Council will be the be-all and end-all of this country.  It will not decide our budgets and everything else.  We do not want to go back to the days of unelected representatives meeting in private rooms and having too much influence.  I respectfully suggest that the Government needs to strike a balance between the need to account for any decision not to accept the advice of the Fiscal Advisory Council and the need for the Government and this House to uphold their political and societal remit, which is broader than the remit of the council.  That is important because government is about more than the running of the economy.<\/p><p> As part of this discussion on fiscal responsibility, I want to share with the House my experiences of some of the difficulties that have been experienced by the Committee of Public Accounts in trying to establish fiscal transparency.  In my short time as a member of that committee, I have found there is generally quite a high level of scrutiny of governmental and departmental spending, regardless of whether people like individual decisions.  Secretaries General and heads of agencies, etc., are brought before the committee to be scrutinised at a public forum and to have questions put to them.  It is clear that there is a lack of transparency with regard to how public money is spent by the HSE and local authorities.  Members will be aware that the Committee of Public Accounts had a much-publicised and talked-about meeting with the HSE the other day.  Representatives of the HSE were called before the committee to account for a significant budget over-run that is causing concern in every community.  They told the committee that the HSE is operating with eight different financial systems that were inherited from the old health board structure.  How many years have passed since the establishment of the HSE?  It has yet to develop a single co-ordinated system.  It receives information that is fed in from 50 other financial systems.  Anyone watching this debate who is involved in small business will say it is a recipe for disaster to have to depend on 58 different financial systems.  These legacy issues have to be addressed.  The rush to establish centralisation, as in the case of the HSE, is a mistake if structures are not put in place to ensure proper financial probity.<\/p><p> The same problem applies to local authorities.  We scrutinise public funds to the nth degree until the moment they leave a Department and go to Wicklow County Council or any other local authority.  We cannot ask any more questions about money once it reaches local authority level.  The Committee of Public Accounts does not have a remit in this area.  Council budgets are difficult to read.  It is extremely difficult for taxpayers to understand them.  It is frustrating for Members of this House who are trying to get to the bottom of them.  The Government is attempting to broaden the tax base by asking people to pay the household charge and, presumably, introducing a property tax in a matter of weeks.  If we expect people to start contributing to local coffers, there is a greater onus on us to provide for transparency in local government.  Perhaps the Committee of Public Accounts could be given a new remit, or an alternate structure could be set up, to address the transparency deficit in terms of how local authorities spend their money.  The local audit committees are part of an in-house structure.  The public needs to know what is going on.  I am most frequently asked about the household charge not by those who do not intend to pay it, or who are in downright opposition to it, but by those who want to know what it is for, where it is going and how they can pay it.  If I am honest, I will admit that we have made significant mistakes in this regard.  We have to learn from them.  We could learn from the British system.  I believe the British authorities circulate a document once a year to say where taxpayers' money is going.  That is the level of transparency people need.  If we are serious when we talk about fiscal responsibility and transparency, we need to go in the same direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100008#F00200","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349951100,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputy Mick Wallace.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100009#G00200","speaker":"1015"},{"type":"speech","time":1349951100,"counter":192,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

This Bill, which represents a move away from that approach, proposes to enshrine neoliberal policies in law forever and in perpetuity.  If it is passed, we could face the spectacle of a Government that wants to implement different economic policies finding that its mandate, as an expression of the will of the people, is in contravention of our law.  This legislation will put the interests of bankers, etc., ahead of the interests of the population.<\/p><p>  I agree with much of what Deputy Mathews had to say.  Many of the points that were made during the referendum debate have been rehashed in this House in recent days.  The outcome of the referendum was largely based on fear, rather than an understanding of the content of the legislation itself.  We were told we had to vote &quot;Yes&quot; to avoid a severe budget in the winter.  The dogs on the street know that the budget we are facing will probably be one of the most severe we have ever had.  We were told to vote &quot;Yes&quot; for a working Europe and to deliver jobs.  As soon as the referendum was over, we saw an exodus of jobs.  The job creation announcements of recent days have been offset by job losses.  The Government made a key announcement when it said that a further 8,000 jobs are to be lost in the public sector.  That is the direction in which this is going.<\/p><p>  When one weighs the policies that have been pursued over recent years and the strategy outlined in this legislation against the IMF's admission that it got its austerity sums wrong and the fact that we are continuing merrily along the way of austerity, one has to ask whether the lunatics have taken over this asylum.  The IMF has made it clear that its calculations were wrong.  We did not need the IMF to say that the impact of austerity has been a multiple of what it thought it would be.  We know it from our direct experience of the hardship that people in this country are having to cope with every day.  The IMF has accepted that it made a mistake and that the pain being inflicted on the patient will kill him rather than make him better.  The IMF intends to carry on anyway, however, because that is what it said it would do.  That is the logic that underpins the legislation we are passing here today.  We have consistently got the growth figures wrong in this country - we have always overstated the predicted level of growth - and they have had to be revised downwards repeatedly.  Given that there is no international recovery and domestic demand is being slashed and devastated for the seventh successive year, it is time to call a halt.  It is not a good idea to continue with austerity by enshrining it in law.  It is a very bad idea.  These policies are not part of the solution - they are actually adding to the problem.  Those points have to be taken on board.<\/p><p>  I wish to make it clear that this legislation is about putting the needs of bankers and bondholders ahead of the interests of ordinary people.  In effect, it is about legitimising and normalising the socialisation of private debt.  It does nothing to deal with the real issues that are being faced by ordinary people.  In recent days, the point has been made that we are being asked to give legislative effect to Articles 3 and 4 of the treaty, which were the most controversial aspects of it, and thereby bring them into Irish law.  During the referendum campaign, it was argued that this does not matter because these provisions exist anyway.  That is absolutely and patently false.  The balanced budget provision in Article 3 is a new one.  The idea of confining the structural deficit to 0.5% of GDP is new.  That is a fact.  That is what we are bringing into law here today.<\/p><p>  The Bill also provides that if Government debt exceeds 60% of GDP, the country will be compelled to reduce it by one twentieth the following year under Article 4.  I will give a flavour of what that means in reality, setting aside all the statistics, etc.  It will present new difficulties for the Irish economy and Irish economic policy.  Over the past five years, in excess of \u20ac20 billion has been taken out of the Irish economy, with devastating effects.  We know that the stated aim of the Government is to take a further \u20ac8 billion or more out of the economy in order to meet the 3% targets.  This new provision means we are facing the spectacle of just under \u20ac6 billion in additional cutbacks.  The Government has to say where that money will come from.  It did not answer that question during the treaty debate.  Will the money come from the cuts in disability payments to those between the ages of 16 and 18 that have been flagged?  Will it be found by attacking elderly citizens, for example by taking away their electricity or reducing their rates?  Will universal payments like child benefit be taken away?  Will 500,000 home help hours be withdrawn?  Will the pay of public sector workers be butchered?  Will employment levels in the public service be slashed further?<\/p><p>What we are talking about is curtailing public expenditure to deal with a problem that is essentially one of private debt.  However, it does not work.  The policies we are bringing in are outlawing investment.  The only way in which we could actually deal with the crisis is being outlawed by this provision.<\/p><p> We know also that as and from 1 January, when the treaty comes into effect, it is expected that our debt-to-GDP ratio will be just short of 120%, or \u20ac200 billion, which will mean a repayment of approximately \u20ac4.8 billion a year under the new criteria of the 1\/20th debt reduction rule.  We have to deal with this.  We also have to deal with another feature of the treaty - the ability of one country to bring another to the European Court of Justice for failing to meet the criteria laid down for the structural deficit.  This is a new provision which could result in the imposition of penalties of up to 0.1% of GDP on the country in question, which, in the case of Ireland, would be the equivalent of \u20ac1.6 billion.  Just what this country needs is penalties of billions of euro for not meeting these targets.  It is, therefore, extremely regressive legislation.<\/p><p> The establishment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, far from being a blow for democracy, actually amounts to the opposite in that it takes powers away from the elected representatives.  It basically states, &quot;You can vote for any Government you like, but, once it comes into power, it is going to be bound by these decisions; therefore, take the pain and get on with it because austerity is here to stay.&quot;  That seems to be the impression that is being given.  We have to add the fact that no economy ever recovered through austerity measures.  What we need is not more of the same, as it has been proved that this has had disastrous consequences.  Continuing on in the same way is not just foolish, it is also dangerous and damaging to the population of the country.  We need something radically different, not this Bill.  What is needed has to centre on reducing the debt burden which will not go away.  Unless it is addressed, there is no future for the country.<\/p><p> The second thing which has to be done but is not being done is to put people to work.  We have a scenario where there was \u20ac32 billion in uninvested profits in 2010 alone.  Why is the Government not taking measures such as introducing taxation measures and so on to encourage job creation, to ensure jobs are created with the billions of euro in profits being earned on the backs of the people?  We have the spectacle of the ECB loaning over \u20ac100 billion to banks at a rate of 1% to pay off debts to bondholders.  Meanwhile, jobs are being created in wind and wave energy projects in a sector in which we are to the forefront because of geographical conditions, yet what do we hear?  The private sector, frothing at the mouth and with its eyes open, is looking at the scale of the benefits to be gained.  Why is the State not investing in these jobs, developing the wind turbine energy sector and leading from the front?  If we bring in these policies under the fiscal treaty, in effect, we will be outlawing the idea of a State-led programme of public works to put people to work.  Instead, we have the ludicrous measures aired by the likes of the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, last week, whereby we would have people working for their dole payment by cutting hedges and doing the work of council workers, at a time when the number of council jobs is being diminished.  That is not the way forward, which we can say with certainty because these are the policies that have already failed.<\/p><p> I take great heart from the struggles throughout Europe and the developing momentum in Portugal, Spain, Greece and elsewhere, with ordinary people taking to the streets.  We see the spectacle of general strikes and Portuguese workers forcing the government to withdraw from a brutal attack which would have resulted in workers losing a month's pay a year.  It would actually be pro-European and a gesture of solidarity for us in Ireland to align ourselves with the people concerned and say to them that we are on their side and that their fight is our fight.  Part of our reason for doing this should be pursuing a rejection of the treaty and a refusal to provide for it in law.  It should mark the beginning of a debate to find an alternative strategy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100009#G00400","speaker":"1015","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349951700,"counter":195,"content":"<p>A big argument is raging in Europe as to what is actually best for the peoples of Europe.  Mr. Barroso has argued that in the age of globalisation pooled sovereignty means greater power for individual members.  This does not wash, however, with the peoples of Europe and many claim political virtue and economic interest demand a halt to integration and a reassertion of the powers of national legislatures.  There is no doubt that enhanced co-operation on an economic level is desirable in some ways.  Unfortunately, however, politically, the likely outcome is a further shift in power away from the elected representatives to unelected technocrats and a further weakening of democracy in Europe.  It will lead to greater powers for the bankers at the European Central Bank and lawyers at the European Court of Justice, with the civil servants in Brussels who interpret their judgments.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is amazing how people can sit on either side of the fence, yet both are convinced that their arguments are right.  Many in Europe actually believe the real villain of the crisis is the concept of financial capitalism and how it has operated.  It is said the crisis did not start in Europe but in America, where the manner in which financial transactions were allowed to be deregulated completely undermined the system worldwide.  That is the all the more reason to have tighter financial regulation.  The proposed transactions tax is one step in the right direction.  Ireland is saying &quot;No&quot; to it because Britain is saying &quot;No&quot; and there is a fear jobs will be lost in the financial centre and relocated to London.  It is very important, therefore, that Ireland and Britain buy into this idea because we will end up in the same place again, unless we increase regulation in the financial sector.  When the crisis began in 2008, there was much talk about doing things differently.  The neoliberal idea was undermined, but four years on it is gathering pace again and there is huge pressure on governments not to be too severe in the manner in which they regulate financial institutions.  I find this frightening and short-sighted.  The world will not solve its problems until it tackles this issue.<\/p><p><br \/>  We have talked over and over about so many ideas.  I recently read an extract by Ha-Joon Chang who has written several very good works, one of which I find very definite and clear.  Referring to the problems of the 1980s and 1990s, he states:<blockquote>Throughout the 1980s and 90s, when many developing countries were in crisis and borrowing money from the International Monetary Fund, waves of protests in those countries became known as the &quot;IMF riots&quot;.  They were so called because they were sparked by the fund's structural adjustment programmes, which imposed austerity, privatisation and deregulation...<br \/><br \/><br \/>  The IMF programme, in other words, met such resistance because its designers had forgotten that behind the numbers they were crunching were real people.  These criticisms, as well as the ineffectiveness of its economic programme, became so damaging that the IMF has made a lot of changes in the past decade or so.  It has become more cautious in pushing for financial deregulation and austerity programmes...<br \/><br \/><br \/>  Given these recent changes in the IMF, it is ironic to see the European governments inflicting an old-IMF-style programme on their own populations.  It is one thing to tell the citizens of some faraway country to go to hell but it is another to do the same to your own citizens, who are supposedly your ultimate sovereigns.  Indeed, the European governments are out-IMF-ing the IMF in its austerity drive so much that now the fund itself frequently issues the warning that Europe is going too far... [This is scary.]<br \/><br \/><br \/>  What has been happening in Europe &#8211; and indeed the US in a more muted and dispersed form &#8211; is nothing short of a complete rewriting of the implicit social contracts that have existed since the end of the second world war.  In these contracts, renewed legitimacy was bestowed on the capitalist system, once totally discredited following the great depression.  In return it provided a welfare state that guarantees minimum provision for all those burdens that most citizens have to contend with throughout their lives &#8211; childcare, education, health, unemployment, disability and old age.<br \/><br \/>...Instead of it being explicitly cast as a rewriting of the social contract, changing people's entitlements and changing the way the society establishes its legitimacy, the dismembering of the welfare state is presented as a technocratic exercise of &quot;balancing the books&quot;.  Democracy is neutered in the process and the protests against the cuts are dismissed.  The description of the externally imposed Greek and Italian governments as &quot;technocratic&quot; is the ultimate proof of the attempt to make the radical rewriting of the social contract more acceptable by pretending that it isn't really a political change.<br \/><br \/><br \/>  The danger is not only that these austerity measures are killing the European economies but also that they threaten the very legitimacy of European democracies &#8211; not just directly by threatening the livelihoods of so many people and pushing the economy into a downward spiral, but also indirectly by undermining the legitimacy of the political system through this backdoor rewriting of the social contract.<\/blockquote><\/p><p>We must look at the bigger picture.  In the same way that business now works too much on a short-term level in order to achieve short-term gain, the political process is behaving in a similar manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100010#H00200","speaker":"956","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349952300,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I support the Bill because more than 60% of the people and 66% of those in Cork South-West voted in favour of the referendum on 31 May.  That cannot be ignored by those who speak about there being a democratic deficit.<\/p><p>  The Bill deals with the core issue of the functions of this House, namely, to raise taxes from citizens and provide that these moneys are spent for the benefit and in the best interests of all citizens properly and effectively.  The reason the Bill is before us is that we have seen gross examples of fiscal irresponsibility in recent decades, mainly on the part of the main Opposition party, whose members are not present.  During the period between 1997 and 2011, the Fianna F\u00e1il-led Government expanded total Government expenditure from \u20ac23 billion to \u20ac76 billion.  It more than trebled Government expenditure in 14 years or, to put it another way, in 1997 the then Government was spending approximately 40% of gross national product.  When it left office last year the then Government was spending approximately 60% of gross national product.  How one can call that responsible defies explanation.  The result of the trebling of the national Exchequer debt from \u20ac39 billion in 1997 to a crippling \u20ac119 billion in 2011, or 94% of gross national product, has been catastrophic for the country.<\/p><p>  One could ask where the money was spent and whether it was managed well for taxpayers or, as we suspect, if the then Government had bought the electorate with its own money or if it had borrowed the money and spent it on mismanaged projects with major cost overruns.  Let us remind ourselves and commentators of approximately 20 examples of projects around the country initiated by Fianna F\u00e1il-led Administrations between 1997 and 2011 which represented extremely bad value for taxpayers.  Marina projects were railroaded through by Ministers in counties Kerry, Galway and Sligo, on which a total of \u20ac5.72 million was wasted.  I will start with the smaller projects.  A new passport system went over budget by \u20ac8 million.  Overruns in the renovation of Farmleigh House came to \u20ac9 million.  The Punchestown Centre - a huge white elephant - cost more than \u20ac14.8 million in mismanaged funds.  A total of \u20ac18.9 million was wasted on the purchase of five properties that were never used in the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers.  The refurbishment of Cork courthouse cost \u20ac25.35 million above and beyond what had been projected.  We spent \u20ac26.5 million on the Thornton Hall prison site, yet not one sod has been turned.  Who remembers MediaLab Europe?  The sum of \u20ac35.5 million was wasted on it.  There was a cost overrun of \u20ac37 million on the Kilkenny flood relief project.  The cost of e-voting machines is put, conservatively, at \u20ac60 million which went down the Swanee.  The cost of the extension of the medical card system to all persons over 70 years of age was underestimated by \u20ac60 million.  Stadium Campus Ireland, otherwise known as the &quot;Bertie Bowl&quot;, cost the State \u20ac100 million.  The PPARS payroll system cost the State \u20ac160 million.  Cost overruns and the under-estimation of pre-1953 pension entitlements are estimated at \u20ac201 million and counting.  The cost overrun on the East Link and West Link toll bridge projects was \u20ac407 million.  Cost overruns in the mismanagement of the Luas project amounted to \u20ac471 million.  The cost underestimation for the Dublin Port tunnel amounted to \u20ac350 million.  The cost of the decentralisation programme is \u20ac900 million and counting.  The residential institutions redress scheme deal with the religious orders cost the State above and beyond what it should have by an estimated \u20ac1.2 billion.  The construction costs of five major inter-urban dual carriageway or motorway routes reached \u20ac3.25 billion owing to cost overruns and mismanagement.<\/p><p>  That is a small sample list of 20 projects I examined involving gross mismanagement and waste by Governments between 1997 and the previous election.  It comes to a grand total of \u20ac7.331 billion.  We could do with that capital investment now.  I am reminded of the advertisement about insurance fraud which warned about someone \u201cputting their hand in your pocket\u201d.  These projects which were mismanaged essentially cost \u20ac1,600 for every man, woman and child in the country.  To put it another way, it was \u20ac10 million wasted for every Fianna F\u00e1il Deputy who sat on the benches of this House in the ten years between 1997 and 2007.  We now see the consequences.  <\/p><p>  The Independent Members in this House cannot even agree on whether one should pay the household tax.  They are encouraging non-payment of a sustainable taxation measure that is being lauded by socialist groups across the globe.  That defies logic.  It is a great luxury that they can rant and rave across the floor and oppose every move to increase sustainable Exchequer income or reduce Exchequer expenditure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100011#J00200","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1349952300,"counter":198,"content":"<p>That is not true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100011#J00300","speaker":"1017"},{"type":"speech","time":1349952300,"counter":199,"content":"<p>However, they must remember that the people voted for the Government by a considerable majority to remedy the situation and that they confirmed that decision by voting in favour of the fiscal compact in the referendum.<\/p><p>  In simple terms, we cannot borrow money if we cannot pay it back and, to paraphrase a former Taoiseach, we are living way beyond our means.  How well he knew it.  According to the 2012 Estimates, as a Parliament, on behalf of the people, we will spend \u20ac55.75 billion or \u20ac12,192 for every man, woman and child in the country.  That is fine, but the real problem is that we are only raising \u20ac38.08 billion or \u20ac8,312 for every man, woman and child in taxes and other income.  We are overspending by \u20ac3,879 for every single person.<\/p><p>  Members opposite will oppose every effort to increase revenue by one euro or one cent or to cut expenditure.  They do not want to pay back one red cent.  Regrettably, such policies and ideology are as bankrupt and defunct as the country.  We need a plan to reform the country\u2019s financial affairs.  I look forward to other Deputies accepting the reality in order that they can reform their ideology and policies to bring them more into line with those of their European and global colleagues.  There is something uniquely Irish about the way the parties on the left are carrying on.  I call for fiscal responsibility to be shown by Members on the other side of the House because if we all work together, we will have a better result for the people.  I have no problem with anyone pointing to weaknesses or faults in the proposals to remedy the economic climate.  We would welcome counter-proposals.  In opposing everything, however, they are following the same path followed by Fianna F\u00e1il and the Progressive Democrats in the past decade and a half, but in the opposite direction, in that Fianna F\u00e1il never knew how to stop spending, while the Progressive Democrats never knew how to stop cutting taxes.  These two irreconcilable policies could never work together and we all have to live with the results.  It is time we all played our part in rebuilding the country.  We must all put our shoulders to the wheel a little more forcefully.<\/p><p>We cannot oppose everything.  We have voted by a large majority to be more fiscally responsible.  With that in mind I want to see those who oppose a cut in expenditure or a rise in tax propose a realistic alternative.  If ever we needed a fiscal responsibility Bill we need one now so that this can never happen again.  That is the present situation but I want to see a better way of planning our nation's finance so that my children and grandchildren and everybody else's children do not have to face this situation again in another 20 years.  This is cyclical; it happens and will happen again as it happened before.  By joining this pact we will ensure stability for all our citizens.<\/p><p> Our Ministers have to make hard choices every day of the week.  We have inherited the Croke Park agreement, which is a delicate balance between the interests of those working for our State, and reducing our deficit.  I encourage those in the public service to make a contribution to rebuilding our economy.  I hope the new fiscal council created by this legislation will have a positive effect on our economy and that people will never be told, for example, to go off and commit suicide as they were before.  It might make better law if the Government was able to publish its reaction to the council's reports and give reasons for possibly not accepting all its recommendations so that we can all judge for ourselves whether the best road has been taken.  We are not all experts but we can be self-critical - as we should be.  As part of our path to fiscal responsibility we need to examine our laws and regulations on development land, the building industry, our banks and other financial institutions, the handling and management - or mismanagement - of investors' money, the handling and previous mishandling of taxpayers' money.  All need to come under scrutiny.<\/p><p> I encourage the Minister for Finance to examine the possibility of promoting a savings scheme to kick-start a saving habit among our young people who are often offered often less than 1%  interest although the Government pays much higher interest rates to borrow.  I am sure an incentive package could be devised by the National Treasury Management Agency which would be of benefit to the State and its citizens.<\/p><p> I am proud to support this legislation which has the support of the people.

As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated in the House on Tuesday last, when he moved Second Stage of this Bill: &quot;This B\u00edll will allow us to ratify the stability treaty, in line with our fellow euro area member states, which is in the interests of this country and the euro area &quot;.  The Minister is continuing his journey all over the the European circuit, pressing the case for Ireland.  Today, tomorrow and at the weekend he is at a World Bank annual general meeting in Japan.  He is encouraging his euro colleagues to firm up details of the decisions which were taken last June at the EU summit to split Ireland's banking and sovereign debt.  The President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, addressed a packed House last week.  The ECB President, the EU Commission and the President of the European Council, Hermann von Rompuy, have all stood by the agreement of 29 June, which in itself is significant.  Much has been said about the statement by the &quot;gang of three&quot; Finance Ministers that the ESM will not apply to legacy bank debts.  I suspect, however, those comments are just their opening negotiating positions.  We all know from our experience in Europe that unanimous agreement is very often achieved in cases where countries started out being diametrically opposed and I believe that will happen on this occasion as well.  I have every confidence that the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach will keep the EU 27 to the deal agreed in June.<\/p><p>  The legacy of the collapse of Anglo Irish Bank and the issue of the promissory note continue to pose challenges for this country.  A further payment of \u20ac3 billion is due in March.  Recent comments by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, show he is anxious to have at least an indication before December's budget  from the EU of its intent in dealinq with the Anglo Irish Bank promissory note so that he has all the information he needs when he sits down to frame the budget.  However, even if there is a breakthrough before then there is no getting away from the fact that this budget will be the most challenging in our history.  There is no easy way to plug a deficit of \u20ac3.5 billion.<\/p><p>  I have argued in the past, as have many other Deputies on this side of the House, that we should be budgeting for a number of years in advance.  That would do away with much of the kite-flying that has become a norm at this time of the year.  The domino effect of the collapse of our economy and the onslaught of the global recession, which have created EU-wide uncertainty, have reinforced the need for fiscal rectitude and proper planning.  At the start of the recession Europe had been struggling to get to grips with this crisis.  Its response was to establish a treaty on stability and establish the European Stability Mechanism, which have steadied the ship.  Ireland had already signed up to tighter fiscal rules in in the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 and the Stability and Growth Pact in 1997.  It is clear these rules failed, however, because countries did not adhere to them.  As a result, ordinary people are now paying a very high price.<\/p><p>  The austerity measures forced on us because of our bailout arrangement have been painful and have had a considerable impact on our people.  Notwithstanding, a glimmer of hope is emerging.  The latest quarterly report from the ESRI shows that output grew last year for the first time in four years, expanding by 1.4% in GDP terms.  The IMF's latest outlook paints a similar picture.  I wish the Minister well in his deliberations in Japan where he will meet all the important players.  He has a close political relationship with Christine Lagarde.  I believe he will come home well equipped to prepare the budget and consider the outlook for the future.<\/p><p>  The IMF report states that the Irish economy will grow by 0.4% this year and by another 1.4% next year, which is the best outlook for any EU country in a bailout.  Take the Greek economy, for example, which is predicted to slump by 6%, or the Portuguese economy, predicted to slow by 3%, with similar predictions of slowdowns in ltaly and Spain by 2.3% and 1.5%, respectively.  The same IMF outlook predicts there will be a modest pick-up in the global economy next year, with the emerging countries growing at four times the rate of the so called advanced economies.  The saying is that a rising tide lifts all boats and this is very true of the global economy.  While green shoots are beginning to emerge in this country, without a global lift in the economic tide recovery here will be held back.   That is why it is extremely important for Europe to get its act together.  Both the ESRI and IMF concur that Ireland's recovery will be limited if the global situation does not change.  The IMF has warned European policy makers they must deepen financial and fiscal ties within the eurozone given that its debt crisis is the main threat to global financial stability.  Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, the director of the IMF stated: &quot;The choice today is between making the necessary but tough policy and political decisions, or delaying them - once more - in the false hope that time is on our side.&quot;<\/p><p> Given that Irish people have already endured four years of austerity, time is of the essence.  If, as already stated, Ireland is to move ahead, then a strong eurozone will be required.  It is not, as many of those on the Opposition benches have stated, all doom and gloom in the context of Ireland's future.  Our international credibility is at an all-time high and there is international recognition for our Government's work in restoring the economy.  I am Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and I am obliged to travel as part of my job.  I meet politicians from various countries and they indicate their respect for Ireland in the context of what has been done here in the past 12 to 18 months.  They also respect the confidence the Government has engendered.  One need only consider the work the Government has been doing in order to restore the economy.  The Taoiseach's photograph appeared on the front cover of <i>Time<\/i>magazine last week under the headline &quot;The Celtic Comeback&quot;.

The commentary provided in this article is extremely positive with regard to Ireland's future and its author pointed out that we are better positioned than most other European countries to recover from the crisis. The article also cites the fact that we have one of the most competitive labour markets in Europe.  We have a young and educated workforce which, for example, is the main reason why Ireland attracts so much foreign direct investment.  Hewlett-Packard chose Ireland because it needed highly skilled workers who also possess good language skills.  This week, a number of announcements have been made in respect of the creation of jobs.  Deputy Clare Daly indicated that the position with regard to jobs in this country has gone from bad to worse.  I am of the opinion - the experts back me up on this - that the unemployment rate has stabilised.  The news in recent days that Kerry Group and Paddy Power will be creating 900 and 600 jobs, respectively, is a testament to the work the Government is doing.  The article in <i>Fortune <\/i>magazine to which I refer points out that, unlike Greece, Ireland's economy is overwhelmingly made up of exports.  In that context, exports account for 80% of this country's GDP.  This compares to a figure of 7.2% for Greece.  The article also cites our competitive corporation tax rate as the main driver in respect of foreign direct investment.<\/p><p><br \/>  I am firmly of the view that Ireland's roar will return.  When it does, we must ensure that a more robust financial regulatory system capable of coping with future recessions will be in place across the eurozone.  I support the provisions in the Bill and I welcome the placement of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on a statutory basis.  Having a good fiscal advisory council which provides an independent assessment of the Government's budgetary plans can play a pivotal role in achieving disciplined fiscal performance.  Tightening our fiscal rules and ensuring that eurozone countries maintain budgetary discipline is the next step in enhancing confidence in the eurozone.  This Bill is extremely important.  The strong vote by the Irish people in favour of the stability treaty was a clear signal that they want stability.  Strengthening the fiscal stability framework within the eurozone is essential if we are to return to growth.  The Bill is a key part of that framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100013#L00300","speaker":"974"},{"type":"speech","time":1349953500,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the hugely important debate relating to the Fiscal Responsibility Bill 2012.  The duty of an Independent Deputy is at all times to challenge, question and put forward alternatives in the context of dealing with the current major economic crisis.  Independent Members have done this on many occasions in the Chamber.  Sadly, however, we have often been ignored by the Government, which is not prepared to listen to different options in order to resolve the economic mess in which we find ourselves.<\/p><p>  This debate is about fiscal responsibility and, above all, the future of this country, which is currently experiencing mass unemployment and immigration.  It also relates to the cuts with which citizens, those with disabilities and the elderly are being obliged to deal.  I accept that we must manage our finances in a sensible and practical manner.  We must get our act together before it is too late.  In the lead up to the budget, there will be a need for a fair and common-sense approach to be taken.  That is why we must focus on fiscal responsibility during this debate.<\/p><p>  The Minister for Finance and the Government must wise up to the fact that real progress will not be made without a deal on our debt.  There is massive support on the Opposition benches for such a deal.  It will not be possible to foster economic growth - the Government will be obliged to slash services further - if we do not obtain a deal on our debt from Europe.  I accept that the Government is pushing an agenda in this regard.  It must, however, be more robust in its efforts because otherwise we will go nowhere fast.  I am not trying to score political points here, I am merely reflecting the economic reality about which ordinary people are informing me.  Independent commentators nationally and internationally have indicated that we must deal with the elephant in the room, namely, our debt.  If we do achieve a deal on our debt, we will then be in a position to extricate ourselves from the current mess by instigating development and growth strategies.<\/p><p>  It is not fair for those on the Government benches to have a lash at Opposition Deputies in respect of this issue, particularly in light of the latter's support for the efforts being made to achieve a deal on debt.  Of course people welcome the announcements in the past couple of days by Kerry Group and Paddy Power in respect of job creation.  It is fantastic that these jobs are going to be created and I welcome the fact that some of them are quite different from the norm.  This reflects the fact that people are thinking outside the box in the context of the creation of employment.  Projects such as those announced by Kerry Group and Paddy Power should be warmly welcomed, particularly in the context of the impact they will have with regard to economic development.  We must face up to the reality these jobs, and many like them, will be taken up by highly-skilled individuals.  A large number of those who comprise the workforce are highly educated but we must ensure the needs of those in other sections of the population are taken into account.<\/p><p>  The Fiscal Responsibility Bill 2012 provides a statutory basis for a range of fiscal policy and expenditure management reforms.  It makes specific provision to the effect that the budgetary and debt rules contained in Article 3 and Article 4 of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union take effect in national law.  The Bill will also establish the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, on a statutory basis and sets out its functions.  The debate in which we are engaging is, therefore, also about these matters and does not merely relate to balancing the books.<\/p><p>  When people come forward with constructive proposals, we must take them seriously.  We must also listen to those who challenge the prevailing view.  I am amazed that there was no reaction from the Government or society in general to the comments made recently by Professor Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel economics laureate.  Professor Stiglitz is quoted as stating that the European solution to the euro crisis is wrong.  He challenged both the Government and Irish economists in respect of this matter and indicated that, in historical terms, the austerity cure has almost never worked.  I do not get why this cure is still being administered, particularly if it has almost never been successful in the past.  Professor Stiglitz informed the International Bar Association, at the opening of its conference in Dublin recently, governments have misdiagnosed what went wrong in the eurozone and are also advocating the wrong solution to the crisis.  He further stated that austerity was &quot;tried in 1929, the IMF tried it in Asia and Latin America.  Each time it succeeded in turning downturns into recessions, recessions into depressions.&quot;<\/p><p>  I am not a whizz kid when it comes to economic forecasts etc.  When, however, a Nobel economics laureate such as Professor Stiglitz makes a statement, we need to examine the points he is making.  The gurus in the Departments of Finance and the Taoiseach must consider the import of what Professor Stiglitz has had to say in respect of Ireland.  Professor Stiglitz has also pointed out that Europe\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio is less than that of the US and he noted that the US can borrow at almost negative interest rates.  He highlights the point that the fundamental problem in Europe is that the euro was a flawed currency arrangement that did not meet the conditions needed to establish a common currency and that a structural change of the euro arrangement is needed.  Is that a common-sense proposal?  I do not know.  However, I do know that we must respond in respect of what Professor Stiglitz has said.<\/p><p>  In his address to the International Bar Association, Professor Stiglitz also indicated that the reform of banking systems will be necessary.  He pointed out that, at present, these systems are as strong as the governments of the countries that guaranteed them.  This means that where a government is weak, confidence ebbs and money flows out of the banks, thereby reducing their capacity to lend to businesses.  Professor Stiglitz stated that the latter, in turn, leads to the further weakening of economies.<\/p><p>I refer to the classic example which is well known to the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and Deputy Buttimer and that is the issue of small business.  We have reduced the banks' capacity to lend to businesses.<\/p><p><br \/> I refer to Joseph Stiglitz who said that Europe was likely to face turmoil for some time to come.  He said that another issue of concern was the growth of inequality in the major economies which has been exacerbated by the crisis.  He further stated that in 2010 in the United States, for example, 93% of growth went to the top 1% of the population and that economic inequality leads to political inequality, including inequality in access to justice.  He links the economic debate with the broader societal debate about justice and the economy.<\/p><p><br \/> Many people associate justice with citizens' rights but we need to think of economic rights.  There is no point in the Government having a nice, happy-clappy debate about the children's referendum when it is slashing services to children.  I note an element of hypocrisy and this policy needs to be challenged.<\/p><p><br \/> We all accept the need for fiscal responsibility and that there needs to be good governance of budgets.  In my view, anyone who does not agree should not be in public life or politics.  People have to pay their taxes.  None of us likes voting for taxes or paying them.  That includes all Members of the Oireachtas.  There is no point in whingeing to the media.  Some members of the Independent group are talking about loyalty.  I will not be loyal to anyone who does not pay his taxes and is going around the country.  That is my political position; it is not a personal position.  It is business, it is politics.  I challenge anyone on that issue.<\/p><p><br \/> To return to the subject of small businesses, the retail sector supports 250,000 jobs.  The Government needs to realise that these small businesses are a very important part of the economy.  I remind the Government of what it promised in the programme for Government: <blockquote>We will reduce the cost of Government imposed red-tape on business, in part by streamlining regulatory enforcement activities out of a merger and rationalisation of existing structures.<\/blockquote>For example, an employer who employs fewer than ten workers in a local community is often overlooked.  However, such employers must be taken seriously when it is noted that together they employ 250,000 workers.  We all welcome the big announcements such as from Kerry Group and Paddy Power but as an Independent Deputy I want to support the small businesses employing three to five or six people because it is a very important sector.<\/p><p><br \/> I refer to the costs associated with running a local shop.  The annual cost of permits and licences is &#8364;5,436 a year; the time involved in ensuring compliance and completing surveys averages 50 hours; management time in the retail sector averages &#8364;24 an hour; the cost of this compliance is estimated at &#8364;1,200 per retailer; the cost of compliance for the average retailer is &#8364;6,636 a year; an ordinary small retailer can be subject to up to 18 separate licences over 17 separate inspections every year.  We need to listen to the people on the ground, particularly those retailers who support 250,000 jobs.<\/p><p><br \/> I suggest some ideas for raising a few bob for the State.  I refer to the situation in the cigarette trade.  The highest individual cost to the State from blackmarket trading comes from tobacco smuggling.  The illicit tobacco trade accounts for &#8364;526 million of lost Exchequer revenue annually and &#8364;500 million in lost retail sales to an industry where difficult trading conditions are putting upwards of 6,000 jobs at risk.  We are losing taxes to the value of &#8364;526 million and the small business sector is losing revenue.  As of 9 July 2012, the total number of cigarettes seized by Revenue this year stood at 66 million with a retail value of &#8364;28 million.  That is a lot of money and these statistics are about the guys who got caught.  Most of them get through the system and onto the streets.<\/p><p><br \/> There is a health dimension to this trade.  The illicit cigarette trade also undermines the State policy of reducing smoking prevalence by means of high pricing.  Whereas legitimate retailers sell cigarettes at &#8364;9 a pack, criminals can afford to sell them for as little as &#8364;3.  Some of the criminal gangs in the Dublin area are directly involved in that trade because they see there is more money to be made from cigarette smuggling and it gives them less grief than dealing in drugs.  One study found that the lead content in fake Marlboro Red cigarettes was 17 times higher than is found in the genuine product.  This means that smoking 20 counterfeit cigarettes is the equivalent of smoking 340 genuine cigarettes.  This has been described as a potential health time bomb by medical experts.  I suggest revenue could be raised for the State by dealing with this illicit trade.  Some of my colleagues opposite were having a go at the Opposition and saying we never bring forward proposals.  Here is one proposal that would raise &#8364;526 million and another that would raise &#8364;500 million.<\/p><p><br \/> Deputy Noel Harrington had a go at some of the Opposition parties and members of the Independent group about the household charge.  The bottom line is that people do not want a tax on family homes.  I am one of those people.  I do not agree with a tax on a home.  I have no problem about taxing property and wealth but I disagree fundamentally with a tax on the family home.  That is my position made clear.  I voted against the legislation.  When the Government takes a lash at members of the Technical Group and Independent Members, I remind the Members opposite of what the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, said in the D\u00e1il on 2 February 1994:<blockquote>It is morally unjust and unfair to tax a person's home, and by so doing grind him into the ground.  Indeed in cases it could probably be unconstitutional.  It reminds me of a vampire tax in that it drives a stake through the heart of home ownership, through enthusiasm and initiative, and sucks the life blood of people who want to own their own home and better their position.  If the Government fails to appreciate the passion with which people will defend their rights to own their home and have it looking as well as it should, it is making a serious mistake.<\/blockquote>I will not take lectures from anyone on that side of the House about that issue.  I have no problem with the introduction of taxes but let the hypocrisy and the lectures stop.  I recently asked a parliamentary question of the Minister for Finance about the amount of extra revenue that could be raised by increasing income tax on couples earning &#8364;120,000 if there were a 5% tax increase.  The reply stated that the figure would be &#8364;214 million with &#8364;176 million of that yield derived solely from applying the change to all married couples.<\/p><p><br \/> I take the point about the issue of corporation tax that people do not wish to damage foreign direct investment.  However, I wonder whether it has been independently assessed to see if this is the reality.  I asked a parliamentary question of the Minister for Finance about the amount of extra revenue that would be generated if the corporation tax was increased from 12% to 15%.  I asked the question to find out how many extra bucks could be collected to beef up the economy and to stop the cutting of home help hours or slashing services to the disabled.<\/p><p>There was a large public meeting this week in Ballymun, where representatives of St. Michael's House, which delivers services for people with intellectual disabilities throughout the city, expressed their concerns regarding proposed cuts.  According to the Minister's own figures, an increase in the corporation tax rate from 12.5% to 15% would raise in the region of \u20ac675 million per annum.  Government Members often complain that we on this side of the House never offer constructive revenue-raising proposals.  I have offered several suggestions today in regard to tobacco duty, corporation tax and other taxation measures, including a proposal regarding couples earning \u20ac120,000 per year.  We all accept the need for fiscal responsibility.  As such, there is an obligation on those of us who object to Government policy to offer imaginative solutions.  That is what I have sought to do today.  I do not claim to have all the solutions, but in the context of a required saving of \u20ac3.5 billion in the forthcoming budget, some of the options I have outlined today are deserving of consideration by the Minister.<\/p><p> Following the endorsement of the fiscal compact in the referendum on 13 May 2012, the Fiscal Responsibility Bill 2012 was published on 18 July 2012.  Formal ratification of the stability treaty will only take place once the Bill has been enacted.  The Government considers it critical in a European context that the State is in a position to meet its treaty obligations well before the deadline of the end of 2012.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the implementation of Articles 3 and 4 of the fiscal compact in domestic law.  Article 3 requires provision in national law for the budgetary rules contained therein, while Article 4 sets out the debt rules to which member states must adhere.  As a consequence of the acceptance by the electorate of the referendum proposal last May, the legislative provisions required by the treaty are consistent with the Constitution.  Section 2 of the Bill requires the Government to comply with the budgetary and debt rules contained in the treaty.  That is the core issue in this debate.<\/p><p> In considering its obligations in the area of fiscal responsibility, I urge the Government to listen to ordinary people who are functioning in the real economy.  Our problems require real-world solutions and commonsensical proposals if we are to bring this great country of ours out of its economic nightmare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100013#L00400","speaker":"1017","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349954700,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I propose to share time with Deputy Damien English.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100015#N00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1349954700,"counter":216,"content":"<p>That is agreed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100015#N00300","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1349954700,"counter":217,"content":"<p>As I listened to Deputy Finian McGrath's contribution, it seemed to me that he was talking about a different world from the one in which we live.  The Government is charged not only with governing this State but with ensuring we have a country to hand on to the younger generation, including the young students in the Visitors Gallery today.  This Bill is about fiscal responsibility, about the obligation to manage the public purse in a prudent manner on behalf of the people.<\/p><p><br \/>  It is interesting to consider that some of the loudest protests to Government policy come from Members opposite whose colleagues are in government in the North.  The latter must manage a block grant from the British Government, which involves making difficult choices regarding expenditure, decisions which their party colleagues in this Parliament condemn the Government for taking.  I welcome Deputy Finian McGrath's proposals on taxation.  I am pleased to hear that he has paid the household charge and that he is committed to supporting the Government in its endeavours to reconstruct our country.  When I read in this morning's newspapers, however, that Fianna F\u00e1il is opposed to a property tax, I could only laugh with incredulity.  This is the party which signed us up to the agreement with the troika and committed to the introduction of this very tax in its revised programme for Government and in the national recovery plan.  Its hypocrisy knows no bounds.<\/p><p><br \/>  This Bill is about responsibility - responsibility in how the Government manages budgets and delivers public services for citizens, as well as its responsibility as a member of the eurozone.  Deputy Peter Mathews is absolutely correct in that it is also, by definition, about financial regulation.  We do not have to cast our minds back far to see that a lack of regulation in the financial services sector and the irresponsible activity it enabled played a large part in getting us to where we are today.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has described the rules set out in the legislation as sensible and prudent and as representing a reasonable and responsible approach to budgeting.  That is what we must instil in young people and in all our citizens.  One cannot spend money one does not have.  One cannot live on tick, on the never-never, <i>ad infinitum<\/i>.  The forthcoming budgetary process will be difficult.  The requirement to take &#8364;3.5 billion out of our economy deserves thoughtful and constructive debate in this House.  The overriding principles must be fairness in the provision of services and the obligation to instil growth and promote employment.  Some of the Members opposite baffle me with their voodoo economics.  Instead of constructive proposals, they simply want to throw money everywhere.  We spend &#8364;13.8 billion on the health service annually.  The tactic of simply throwing money at a problem has not worked in the past and is not an option now.<\/p><p><br \/>  The electorate endorsed the provisions contained in this Bill in the referendum at the beginning of the summer.  This Government was given a mandate to govern, make decisions, create employment, manage our economy, reform the institutions of the State and get people back to work.  No other Government since the foundation of the State has faced a challenge of this scale.  Apart from managing the economic crisis, we must restore confidence in the country and market it to the world as a super place to invest, with young, bright and educated workers who deserve the opportunity in make their living here.  That requires action and leadership from the Government.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly referred to his aim of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business by 2016.  That is no small challenge.  It will require a collaborative approach and a commitment from parties on both sides of the House.  If we are to rebuild our country, we must move away from the politics of protest and condemnation which are in themselves a potentially effective political weapon.<\/p><p><br \/>  What is required instead are manageable, deliverable and tangible solutions.  Perhaps Joe Duffy will consider hosting a solution day on his radio programme which would give ordinary people an opportunity to offer constructive suggestions and solutions.  Ireland is a small, open economy.  We have had great news on the jobs front this week but also, regrettably, job losses.  I agree with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, that we should avoid kite-flying in the run-up to the budget.  As well as seeking to instil confidence, we should also be careful not to frighten people.  We must all be careful of the language we use, whether from the Opposition or Government benches.  Likewise, members of the fourth estate must be conscious of the impact of their commentary.  People throughout the country are under pressure - t\u00e1 siad faoi bhr\u00fa.<\/p><p><br \/>  A great deal of debate is focused on the need for a deal on our bank debt.  The Bill before us is one of many pan-European measures being taken to deal with the financial difficulties facing Governments across Europe.<\/p><p>It provides a framework for the prudent management of the economies of the eurozone.  Deputy Shane Ross who has just joined us will be aware that some European countries abandoned prudent and responsible fiscal management.  We must all live up to our responsibilities in this regard.  The Government, in particular the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, has been working closely with its European partners to secure outcomes that will benefit the people.  The onus is on the European Union to ensure these outcomes are achieved.  EU Finance Ministers and the President of the European Central Bank, Mr. Mario Draghi, are working to secure a deal on Irish banking debt.  Mr. Draghi should note that Ireland, the poster boy for reconstructing an economy and the best student in the class, must be offered a stimulus by way of a successful renegotiation of our banking debt.  The issues involved are complex, however, and negotiations are proceeding slowly.  Discussions must continue until the negotiations bear dividends.  <\/p><p> The same people who argued that the Government would not secure a deal on the interest rate applied to our debts have criticised the current efforts to secure a deal on bank debt.  As the negotiations proceed, we must not lose sight of the bigger picture and the efforts being made behind the scenes to secure a deal.  People have co-operated in the reconstruction of the country.  For this reason, we need to create confidence and share the burden.  As the budget approaches, we must debate all the issues in the House, but we must also highlight improvements in investor sentiment, the reduction in bond yields and the successful return of the National Treasury Management Agency to the debt market.<\/p><p> The most important reason for securing a deal on bank debt is to deliver for families.  President Obama and his challenger, Governor Mitt Romney, constantly refer to the middle class in the US election campaign.  Never before has the term &quot;middle Ireland&quot; been so apt.  This section of the population is being squeezed, targeted and asked to pay, as I observe daily when I meet people in my clinics, while canvassing, in the GAA club and restaurants and shops as I walk around my constituency and other parts of Cork city.  Whereas incomes have declined, costs have not decreased in many areas.  Last week Allied Irish Banks announced an increase in its variable interest rate on mortgages.  The announcement followed a previous increase in the bank's mortgage rate and similar increases by Bank of Ireland.  It is mind-boggling that Bank of Ireland requires current account holders who wish to avoid paying bank charges to maintain \u20ac3,000 in their accounts.  Do bank chief executives know people who have \u20ac3,000 in their current account on certain days of the month?  This daft requirement is morally wrong and should be changed. <\/p><p> The issue of energy prices must also be tackled.  I listened recently to a radio interview with the Commissioner for Energy Regulation in which he provided an articulate justification for allowing Bord G\u00e1is and Electric Ireland to impose prices increases.  This year gas and electricity prices have increased by 8.5% and 4.8%, respectively, while the public service obligation charge has increased by \u20ac9.67 for all users.  These increases have a major effect on the financial circumstances of households.  Deputies can make a stand on this issue. <\/p><p> I support the action being taken on the issue of private health insurance by the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.  Insurance premiums have increased repeatedly in recent years, with some providers having increased prices three times in the past two years.  Middle Ireland has been hit again and we see the fallout in terms of increased pressure on public health services as people opt out of private health insurance or change their insurance cover or plan.  A regular health insurance plan which cost \u20ac665 in 2008 now costs \u20ac1,240, an increase of 86% in a five year period during which incomes declined.  We are penalising again those who are responsible and compliant.  Families face many day-to-day pressures.   In terms of the impact on ordinary families, it is crucial that the efforts being made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to secure a deal on bank debt are successful.<\/p><p> This is an important Bill.  The Government is being prudent in the measures it is adopting to rebuild the economy and look after the national interest.  It must also recognise the role being played by middle Ireland and the need to provide further assistance as part of our efforts to manage the economy.  It is important that the budget is fair and balanced and pro-jobs and pro-growth.  This week different growth projections have been provided by the IMF, the ESRI, the Department of Finance and IBEC.  Which of these projections is correct?  How is it possible to plan for growth when there are so many competing figures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100015#N00400","speaker":"989","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349955300,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I concur with much of the latter part of Deputy Jerry Buttimer's contribution.  I am not trying to be mischievous in welcoming comments such as those made by the Deputy, especially when they come from the Government benches.  When the Deputy addresses the issue of middle Ireland, he is reflecting a growing body of opinion that the so-called coping classes, those who are somehow managing to make ends meet in the current difficulties, are finding that they may no longer be able to cope.  The Fiscal Responsibility Bill is aptly and cleverly named, but it is, unfortunately, a reflection of the groupthink that has come to take middle Ireland for granted.  While \"fiscal responsibility\" is a magnificent phrase, the Bill should be renamed, depending on which way one views it.  It is, however, another part of the straitjacket and lack of flexibility to which the Government agreed in running the economy.<\/p><p>It is part of the area which Deputy Buttimer just addressed when he spoke about last week's bank interest rate rises and recent rises in health insurance premiums.  What I find difficult about this agenda is that when the Government is asked about these rises, as happened on Leaders\u2019 Question the other day, both of which are hitting the coping classes in middle Ireland very badly, it responds it is not its baby.  The VHI is a State-owned and run organisation.  The Government makes great play of the fact that AIB and Bank of Ireland are the pillar banks and in which it puts great store in developing its banking policy.  Not only that, the Government owns 99% of AIB.  When I asked the T\u00e1naiste last week what he would do about AIB\u2019s interest rate rise on the standard variable rate, which is unfair and unjust to those involved, he said as AIB is a commercial organisation it is not up to the Government to do anything about it.  He also added that he thought I would be the last person who would suggest the State intervene in a commercial organisation.<\/p><p> He is wrong.  I believe the Government should be interfering on a microbasis everyday with what is happening in AIB and other State-owned banks.  For anyone on the Government benches to stand back and claim it is not the Government\u2019s business is conniving in a crucifixion.  It is up to the Government to intervene when State banks are behaving in an unacceptable way, leaving middle class people without any money at the end of the week.  One cannot take the view these are somehow independent commercial bodies anymore and whatever they do has nothing to do with oneself.  The view must be taken that there are grounds for interference in the activities in State-owned banks, which are making people\u2019s lives impossible, if we own them or have been given guardianship of them.<\/p><p> The Fiscal Responsibility Bill is part of that austerity agenda which gives the Government the chance to cop out.  Whereas it has the laudable objective in balancing the books, it again gives the Government the opportunity to say this is not its responsibility because it implements Articles 3 and 4 of the fiscal treaty.  That is a terribly convenient stance to take.  While in some ways it is difficult for the Government to sacrifice its independence - which it has done anyway - it makes it easier to point the finger overseas and claim they made us do it.  It is a bit like Deputy Buttimer making laudable noises against the Bill, as well as making some courageous reservations about Government policy, but saying because he is under the party Whip he must vote for it.<\/p><p> The measures referred to by Deputy Buttimer are not the only ones that will put many middle class people over the edge.  Hitting child benefit will actually hit the same people, many in negative equity, which the bank interest rates rise will hit.  It is part of the fiscal responsibility agenda.  The worst hit, however, about which a big head of steam is growing and which is dictated to a large extent by Europe, is the idea of property tax.  I cannot understand how the Government has not seen that those whose mortgages are going up as a result of last week\u2019s rise in interest rates are exactly the same people it will ask to pay property tax in December.  They will be exactly the same properties on which they will be paying increased mortgages, say, \u20ac1,000 extra a month on a \u20ac300,000 loan, along with a fair amount in property tax.  They simply will not be able to pay it.  Fiscal responsibility, austerity and all the laudable objectives in trying to balance the books have their limitations.  One cannot take child benefit away, impose a property tax, put people in straitjackets with their mortgages while introducing the Fiscal Responsibility Bill.  People will be put over the edge by this type of measure.<\/p><p> The legislation was born out of the fiscal treaty referendum.  That was a battle the Government fought and won and it is now imperative for the Government to ensure this legislation gets through.  To some extent, however, this measure defines our relationship with Europe.  That relationship is far from being the satisfactory one the Government always puts forward in the House but a very unhappy one.  Our relationship with Europe is a happy one for Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Austria and the other powerful nations because our compliance with their wishes could not be more impeccable.  It is not a happy one for us.  We satisfactorily sit in the bad boy\u2019s corner, happy to be there because we get a pat on the head for staying there and striving to get out of it.  If we were to get a dividend out of passing this referendum for Europe, it should have been more than a pat on the head. <\/p><p>We did not get it.  As a result of this and the vote on the treaty in May the Taoiseach came home on 29 June and, like Neville Chamberlain returning from Munich, said we had secured the deal, that it was a game changer, that we had received the dividend and that anyone who had expressed reluctance about the treaty was wrong.  We were to introduce the Fiscal Responsibility Bill because we had got the deal and I was the first to congratulate him in the House.  I said the fiscal treaty had been delayed, but I congratulated him on what appeared to be a great deal and agreed that if the Taoiseach had secured a special deal on the bank debt for Ireland, the delay might have been worthwhile.  However, as everyone knows, it is a phantom deal - it has been vanishing.  The dividend for introducing this Bill is not that deal.  Only two days ago the chief of the European Stability Mechanism in answer to a question about the Irish deal, which was, I believe, coded as legacy debt, said it had not even been discussed by a single European body.<\/p><p><br \/> What is Ireland getting out of the European Union in return for this fiscal responsibility deal?  Ireland seems to be getting a slap in the face.  It is looked upon as a chronic offender; it is being patted on the back for doing minor things and introducing measures which are utterly unacceptable to the coping classes.  Should we not inform those in Europe that we are not to be taken for granted?  Should we not inform Angela Merkel, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the Dutch and the Finns that we have noted what they said some weeks ago to the effect that our deal was a phantom one?  It is obvious that the banking deal in which we put so much hope is disappearing before our eyes.  If we are going to behave in the way the great powers in Europe want, we are entitled to get something back.  What are we doing?  Who are our allies in Europe?  It seems we are reduced to forming alliances with countries that are errant in their ways, like ourselves.  It seems that we are in the corner of Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, which are not the strongest allies to have in Europe.  We are taking our orders from the strong powers, but we get little back.<\/p><p><br \/> The European Union has reason to be grateful to Ireland.  The Government has done as it has asked at every turn.  As a result of a deal with the troika, the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund, the Government has decided to introduce property taxes, allow the banks to put up interest rates, cut child benefit and do other things that have made life especially difficult for those on middle incomes.  Without a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>, the result of such measures will be that many on middle and lower incomes will be pushed over the edge.<\/p><p><br \/> This type of Bill could be passed if it were conditional on something happening in the interests of Ireland.  If we were not treated as second-class citizens or a second-class country by the European powers, we could accept a Bill of this sort, but we are seeing exactly the opposite.  The deal on the Anglo Irish Bank bonds which had been portrayed as possibly coming to a head and to be agreed in October has been postponed.  The latest expectation, as the Minister for Finance noted recently, is that perhaps we should be looking more closely at a date in March because that is when the next &#8364;3 billion is due to be handed over.<\/p><p><br \/> I suggest to the Government that in order that it is not taken for granted by any of the great institutions or powers of Europe it should make it clear that the &#8364;3 billion payment is no longer a certainty.  We have run out of rope with the bondholders because we cravenly paid all of that money over, but we should make it clear and give notice to those expecting payment that it can no longer be taken for granted if we continue to be treated in the way we are being treated by the European powers, in particular, by Germany, Finland and the Netherlands.  These powers have clearly signalled to us that we cannot take for granted a deal that we believed was in the bag on 29 June.  That deal on legacy debt appears to be off the table.  It has not yet been discussed by any European body.<\/p><p><br \/> The idea of setting up a fiscal advisory council which forms part of the Bill is probably a good one.  The Government has the apparatus and the propaganda organs of the State working for it so ardently.  Therefore, it is right that the Government should set up a fiscal advisory council, but only if it is to be truly independent.  However, I am doubtful about the possibility in Irish political life of politicians of any party setting up a truly independent body.  It is almost impossible to point to any body or institution established in the past 20 years to which politicians have appointed independent directors who have made totally impartial decisions.  The body politic has been so stained by party politicians appointing their <i>prot\u00e9g\u00e9s<\/i>to such bodies.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council may be a worthy body.  It has produced some seemingly independent reports.  However, such bodies have been tainted by the behaviour of past Governments which put their <i>prot\u00e9g\u00e9s<\/i>on the boards with the result that the bodies made reports so partisan that they were lacking in credibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100016#O00200","speaker":"953","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349956500,"counter":222,"content":"<p>I agree with a large chunk of the comments of the previous speaker, Deputy Shane Ross, although I disagree with some of them also.  I have previously expressed my view of the relationship between the former President of France and the German Chancellor.  To some extent, their occasional meetings served to undermine the functioning of the European Union.<\/p><p>It seems that Chancellor Merkel, now that there is a new French President, has gone in other directions to seek support.  Deputy Ross referred to a meeting which took place recently between the Finnish, Dutch and German Finance Ministers.  It was a strange meeting to say the least, particularly seeing as I understand that the Dutch Finance Minister did not even stand in the recent election and will not be a member of the Dutch Government in future.  They produced a document which was completely at odds with the agreement on debt, particularly from Ireland's standpoint, as reached by the Heads of Government in June last.  I agree with Deputy Ross on that meeting between those three finance ministers and the outcome of it.  What was achieved in the agreement between the Heads of Government in June must be delivered from an Irish perspective.  We must work with all our endeavour over the next number of months to ensure that agreement comes to pass.  I agree certainly with that.<\/p><p> However, I cannot agree with Deputy Ross's shock, horror and amazement at the issue of property tax.  He spoke about how this is something that has built up a head of steam in the past few weeks and months.  Irrespective of where one stands on the issue, property tax has been on the political agenda for the past two years and each political party had positions on property tax in advance of the last election.  I understand the Sinn F\u00e9in position speaks about taxing 80% of the value of property.  The previous Government had a position on site valuation.  A decision has not yet been made as to what form of property tax will be introduced next year.<\/p><p> I agree with Deputy Ross that there must be clear exemptions and treatment for those who have paid exorbitant amounts of stamp duty and those who are in difficulties meeting their mortgage payments at present, but there are a number of people - perhaps Deputy Ross himself is in the category - who do not have substantial debts on their private residences and it is legitimate that a tax would be imposed upon those in that category.  It is key, whatever shape the tax takes, that the rate would be affordable and that clear exemptions should be laid out.<\/p><p> The Fiscal Responsibility Bill is born out of the decision of the people a number of months ago and their vote on the stability treaty.  The idea that governments would budget sustainably in future is something I wholeheartedly support.  Anybody who has even the faintest grasp of economics must support a situation whereby governments would be in a position to sustain themselves in terms of their expenditure based on the revenues they can bring in.  There were, until a few minutes ago, a number of school groups in the Gallery.  It is completely unjustifiable that in the future we would continue to borrow money and heap debt on future generations because we cannot sustain the present public expenditure.  It is highly desirable that balance would be brought to the economic books of the country.  It is a symptom of what happened in the worst excesses of the Celtic tiger - the five or six years prior to 2008 - when public expenditure was built completely on an unsustainable taxation source.  I suppose we are reaping the whirlwind from that by having to reduce public expenditure at a time when tax revenues are also under pressure.  It is correct that any Government should try to reach a position whereby it is not heaping debt onto future generations and whereby it is not continuing to build up the amounts that would have to be paid in interest repayments as well as building up the debt itself.  The reality is that the programme in which we are currently involved is constructed in such a way that the correction is taking place over a number of years, not all at once.  No doubt it is imposing considerable pressure, particularly on public services.  It will continue to do so, at least over the course of the next 12 months, but it is neither fair to the future of the children who were in the Gallery a minute ago and others in schools around the country nor sustainable that we would say that we will continue to borrow selfishly and heap debt onto their heads, debts that they would have to repay in the future.  I fully endorse what is contained within the Fiscal Responsibility Bill and I will be supporting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100018#Q00400","speaker":"966","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349957100,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who is away on European Union business of importance to the State.<\/p><p>  We have had a constructive debate on the importance of this Fiscal Responsibility Bill which will implement key provisions of the stability treaty, as voted for by the Irish people.  The Fiscal Responsibility Bill will implement the fiscal rules in the stability treaty.  These rules are sensible and prudent and represent a responsible approach to budgeting.<\/p><p>  The debate over the last few days has raised a number of issues, proposals and queries that I would like to take this opportunity to respond to.<\/p><p>  I welcome the support of Deputy Michael McGrath and his party for the Bill, and note that he may be bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage on the appointment of fiscal council members.<\/p><p>  The views expressed by Deputy Pearse Doherty mirrored the arguments put forward by him and his party during the fiscal stability treaty referendum.  However, the Irish people considered all the arguments and supported the treaty and, as the Minister, Deputy Noonan, already stated, the purpose of this Bill is to implement the stability treaty.<\/p><p>  Deputies Pearse Doherty and McDonald also criticised what they see as the narrow mandate of the fiscal council, particularly the lack of a remit to consider the social impact of its fiscal policy recommendations.  This is the function of Government.  Furthermore, there are a number of bodies supported by the State, such as the ESRI and the National Economic and Social Council, the reports of which consider all aspects of policy development, including social impacts.<\/p><p>  Some Deputies suggested some changes be made to how the fiscal council prepares its reports, and its profile.  I remind Deputies that an objective of this legislation is to put the council on a statutory basis, and also to ensure its independence.  Therefore, the style and content of the fiscal council reports is a matter for the council but I am sure it is aware of those comments.<\/p><p>  With regard to Deputy Pearse Doherty's wish that Government should be required to respond to all of the council's recommendations, I want to point out that we have responded to the council's previous reports in the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement in November last and in the stability programme update in April last.  The Medium-Term Fiscal Statement later this month will respond to the council's latest fiscal assessment and it is the Minister for Finance's intention to continue this practice.<\/p><p>  There were some comments by Deputies which suggest some confusion about the debt rule.  I remind Deputies that the debt rule specifies that when the level of general Government debt exceeds 60% of GDP, the Government must reduce the debt by one twentieth of the difference between that level and 60% - not one twentieth of the whole debt.<\/p><p>  With regard to the comments about a solution for our banking debt, discussions are ongoing between Ireland, the ECB and other members of the troika.  ECB President Draghi said the ECB &quot;is cooperating with the Irish Government in trying to find a solution&quot; to this issue.<\/p><p>The ECB President also reiterated the remarks of the Taoiseach, the EU Commission, the President of the European Council, and the President of the European Parliament that the Council agreement of 29 June stood.  That agreement stands and it is important in the context of the integrity of European Union, relationships between member states and Heads of State, that agreements entered into are fully complied with and implemented and that there be no doubt about that.  The  discussions taking place are complex and we are focused on delivering the best deal for the Irish taxpayer.<\/p><p> A number of Deputies criticised the Bill as being a charter for continued austerity and therefore not sustainable.  What is not sustainable is the prospect of continuing to borrow approximately \u20ac1.5 billion each and every month.  The recent improvements in market sentiment towards Ireland, as evidenced by much improved secondary bond yields, stem from the fact that we are delivering on our commitments, returning the economy to growth and reducing the deficit in the public finances.  Enacting this Bill, ratifying the stability treaty and implementing our fiscal policy in compliance with the Bill are further steps on this path.  Any alternative path would be irresponsible.  Ireland is committed to returning our public finances to sustainable levels by 2015.  This is designed to ensure long-term economic growth, instil investor confidence and bring down the cost of debt which has to be serviced by Irish taxpayers.  This strategy has shown recent signs of success with the significant lowering of bond yields since early summer and the successful return of the NTMA to the debt market.<\/p><p> Of course, listening to Deputy Shane Ross on his usual soap box, one would think that no improvement has taken place and no advances of any description have been achieved.  Deputy Ross, who is now indistinguishable in his political views from Deputies Joe Higgins and Richard Boyd Barrett, is essentially opposed to everything and recognises no good in anything.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100019#R00200","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349957700,"counter":226,"content":"<p>It is onwards and upwards for the United Left Alliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100020#S00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1349957700,"counter":227,"content":"<p>He seems to be blissfully unaware-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100020#S00300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1349957700,"counter":228,"content":"<p>The Minister should stick to writing novels and love stories.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100020#S00400","speaker":"953"},{"type":"speech","time":1349957700,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Deputy Ross seems to be blissfully unaware that the State, this year, is dependent on the European Union, the IMF and the ECB for \u20ac16 billion, which is necessary to maintain public services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100020#S00500","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1349957700,"counter":230,"content":"<p>How much of that is debt interest?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100020#S00600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1349957700,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Deputy Ross says that Ireland is getting no benefit from its relationship with the European Union but he is entirely blind to the impact on this State if the funds that we can currently access were no longer available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100020#S00700","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1349957700,"counter":232,"content":"<p>How much of the total is debt interest?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100020#S00800","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1349957700,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Deputy Ross referred to the Taoiseach's return from the Heads of State meeting in June as being like Neville Chamberlain coming back to England in 1938.

The debate is also timely as the start of the Irish Presidency of the European Union looms ever closer.  Our ability to support and promote sustainable development in Ireland will be critical in meeting the social, economic and environmental needs of the population now and into the future.  This is as true in the international and European context as it is here and that is why the issues we are debating here today will resonate throughout our Presidency of the European Union.<\/p><p>  On assuming office, I felt it was important to start the new parliamentary cycle with a clear policy framework for environmental sustainability over the medium to longer term.  This is the first comprehensive policy statement on sustainable development in Ireland since the inaugural Sustainable Development: A Strategy for Ireland was published in 1997 by my colleague, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.  The framework on sustainable development resulted from what was a protracted process of cross-government consultation, which also involved consultation with other key stakeholders and civil society, on a draft document which I circulated at the end of 2011.<\/p><p>  The public consultation phase included a stakeholder information seminar which was attended by a wide range of stakeholders.  I was quite struck at the level of engagement of stakeholders across a diverse range of sectors.  What was most encouraging was evidence of increased interest from the business sector in the development of the framework.  Ensuring the strong participation of business in sustainable development is critical to its success, not just in terms of the economic pillar, but also in integrating the social and environmental dimensions.  Irish business has already stepped up to the plate on this issue, the agrifood sector being an obvious example, where companies increasingly see the risks associated with food security, untrammelled resource use, and the threat from climate change.  The intensive consultative process which was led by a cross-departmental high level group on sustainable development brought added rigour to the finished product and I was pleased to note the broad welcome that it has received across all sectors.<\/p><p>  Our Sustainable Future was launched in June last and was Ireland's main national contribution to the Rio+20 conference held in Rio de Janeiro at the end of June, at which I represented the Government.<\/p><p>  While considerable progress has been made in Ireland since the inaugural 1997 document was published, significant gaps remain and an updated policy was long overdue.  We needed this new framework to systematically ensure that sustainability considerations are integrated into all economic and other policy development processes, concentrating on the key problem areas where progress has been slower.  We set about this task, taking our lead from the EU sustainable development strategy and from Europe 2020 and its flagship initiative on resource efficiency.  The challenge facing us is neatly described in the aim of Europe 2020, namely, to place Europe on the road to a smarter, sustainable and inclusive future.<\/p><p>  This framework adopts a whole-of-government approach to policy making, reflecting the important inter-linkages between different policy areas and providing a context within which policy conflicts and trade-offs can be examined and resolved at an early stage.  It takes a medium to longer-term view of how Ireland can transition to a resource-efficient, low-carbon, climate resilient economy, while recognising and adapting to the current priorities of economic recovery and fiscal stability.  It is no longer appropriate to think of growth as just focusing exclusively on economic issues.  We also have to factor in the environmental impacts and associated costs.  We must look at the quality of that growth, its effects on the environment and society and at the jobs it creates.  There is a growing global consensus that our current systems of production and consumption are not sustainable and need to be replaced by a more mutually supportive interface between environmental protection and economic and social development.<\/p><p>  The Rio+20 outcome document, The Future We Want, reflects the global consensus around advancing the green economy agenda.  The action oriented wording on the green economy contained in the outcome document provides a good basis for future policy development at the international, EU and national levels.  The document specifically recognises that each country can choose an appropriate approach, in accordance with national sustainable development plans, strategies and priorities.  The OECD and the United Nations Environment Programme, UNEP, have played leading roles in developing policy and research on green growth.  As part of our preparations for the Irish Presidency, I recently met with Achim Steiner, director general of UNEP, to discuss these and other issues.  Ireland will have responsibility for co-ordinating EU input into the UNEP General Council to be held in Nairobi in February next.  The fact that we have put in place a framework for sustainable development places us in a good position to lead the debate on these issues during our Presidency.<\/p><p>  My colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, will shortly publish a policy statement on the green economy which has also involved the whole-of-government approach that underpins the Our Sustainable Future document.  The potential for the transition to the green economy to create decent jobs is well documented and we are committed to using our time in Government to promote this objective, as expressed in the Action Plan for Jobs 2012.  This framework offers the context for that development, including public and private sector inter-linkages, government support for enterprise, and coherent cross-government action.<\/p><p>  Promoting resource efficiency is at the heart of the transition to the green economy as we attempt to use fewer materials and goods to provide the same output.  The EU roadmap to a resource-efficient Europe under Europe 2020 sets out our objectives in this regard, while this framework provides the national context for implementation.  As part of this approach, I would particularly like to mention the joint Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform action plan for green tenders.  This action plan, the first of its kind to be introduced in Ireland, sets out to assist public authorities in successfully planning and implementing green public procurement practices.  It does this by highlighting existing best practice and by using international evidence to identify actions to boost green public procurement.  Our objective is to ensure that 50% of all public sector procurement will be based on green criteria and we are working closely with relevant Departments to deliver on this objective as a matter of priority.<\/p><p>  The framework document is an action-oriented, pragmatic approach on the part of the Government and we are committed to delivering the measures it contains over the coming years.  As part of the plan, we have committed to a high level of political oversight, through the Cabinet sub-committee on climate change and the green economy, chaired by An Taoiseach.  Departments will regularly report on their progress on the implementation of the measures and actions for individual sectors to a specially established high level interdepartmental group on sustainable development.  Membership of this group is in the process of being finalised and I expect the group's first meeting will take place shortly.  Representation on the group is at assistant secretary level and I will act as its chair.<\/p><p>  The concept of inclusivity is especially important in terms of our wider global responsibilities.  Despite the current challenges faced by our economy, we must remain conscious of the global sustainable development agenda and of our obligations towards least developed and developing countries.  While the transition to the green economy for Ireland will be focused on reducing our carbon footprint and improving our resource efficiency, this transition for the developing world is much more fundamental in its efforts to eradicate poverty.  In this regard, we remain committed to the current 0.7% target for overseas development aid, the millennium development goals and the outcomes of the 2002 world summit.<\/p><p>  Increasingly, the focus of our ODA programme is on promoting sustainability and food and nutrition security.  However, the means of doing so goes beyond just financial assistance to a broader programme that includes information exchange and technology transfer.  This new and more practical approach is much more in line with the long-term objectives of sustainable development and creates greater opportunities for the meaningful involvement of the private sector.<\/p><p>  As we prepare to assume the Presidency of the EU next year, we will have the opportunity to consolidate this progressive approach in both the follow up to the Rio+20 conference, as set out in The Future We Want, and also in the wider consideration of the post-2015 development agenda.  For many years we have enjoyed a very positive reputation for our support of the developing world, and the timing of this Presidency offers us a unique opportunity to consolidate that reputation by actively working towards the positive implementation of the Rio outcome and the establishment of a positive, action-oriented post-2015 development agenda.<\/p><p>  Again, I would like to express my satisfaction with this opportunity to raise this issue in the House.  Sustainable development is an issue which I believe warrants the highest priority within the overall policy making system, not just because of the opportunities it presents for green growth, but because we do not have any other option.  Sustainable development is defined as development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.  We are already aware that the current patterns of consumption and production are unsustainable for a planetary system that is under significant pressure and so to protect ourselves and the future for our children, we must change the way we do things.<\/p><p>  Too often our political and policy concerns are focused on finding short-term solutions to the problems of today, without giving due consideration to the long-term implications of our decisions.  This framework seeks to address this challenge by putting in place structures and identifying measures that will protect our economy, our society and our environment now and into the future.  We have a clear responsibility to the generations that follow us, both within our borders and in the international context.  This framework gives voice to that responsibility and clearly demonstrates Ireland's commitment to be at the forefront of the international sustainable development agenda, while protecting our national ecosystems and resources for generations to come.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of other Members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100022#U00300","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1349958900,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to discuss sustainable development in Ireland.  I propose to analyse existing Government policy before discussing the progress - or lack of it - that has been made by the Government in implementing that policy.  I will examine the role of sustainable development in two of the primary areas of this country's economy - agriculture and planning.  I will also consider the need for sustainable development to be part of our relationships with our international partners, including those at EU level.<\/p><p>  Real sustainable development must be at the core of future public policy domestically and internationally.  Fianna F\u00e1il has made significant progress over the past decade in advancing environmentally friendly policies and copperfastening the role of sustainable development at the heart of public policy.  The words of the current Government must be matched with action.  It is vital for the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to stop stonewalling on the climate change Bill.  He needs to begin to make real progress on that issue.  Sustainable development is about striking the right balance between the economy, social issues and the environment and ensuring that people in Ireland and other parts of the world are able to enjoy economic prosperity, social progress and a high-quality environment now and into the future.  Rather than gains in one of these areas being offset by losses in the other two, we need to get all three to work together if we are to improve people's quality of life.<\/p><p>  I acknowledge the Government's specific policies in this area, as set out in its framework for sustainable development.  I recognise and empathise with the objectives of the Government framework, which are to &quot;identify and prioritise policy areas and mechanisms where a sustainable development approach will add value and enable progress towards the strategy aims&quot;, to &quot;highlight and promote existing sustainable practices that, with the correct support, can underpin sustainable development more generally&quot;, to &quot;strengthen policy integration, coherence and co-ordination and bring a long-term perspective to decision-making&quot;, to &quot;set out governance mechanisms which ensure effective participation within Government and across all stakeholders&quot;, to &quot;set out clear measures, responsibilities and timelines in an implementation plan&quot;, to &quot;set out how progress is to be measured and reported on through the use of indicators&quot; and to &quot;incorporate adequate and effective monitoring, learning and improvement into the Framework process&quot;.  These objectives will remain mere objectives as long as the Government delays the laying of proper foundations for their development.<\/p><p>  As I said earlier, the Government has yet to publish a climate change Bill, which should be an integral part of any strategy to combat global warming.  It needs to set a series of targets across society to ensure environmentally friendly practices.  Rather than prioritising this issue, the Government has allowed it to languish on the C list of its legislative agenda, which relates to Bills that are due to be published next year.  When Deputies ask about legislation each day on the Order of Business, it is becoming more frequent for them to be told that a Bill will be introduced next year, as opposed to this session.  Next year will be a long year.  The Government's actions are not matching the rhetoric that was evident in the soundbites that were rushed out before and after last year's general election.  Both of the parties that are now in government made such commitments.  The Labour Party said that no property tax would be introduced while it was part of any Government.  It said that red-line items such as child benefit would not be touched.<\/p><p>  The new Government said things would be done differently.  Reference was made to burning bondholders, abolishing the Seanad in the new Administration's first year and safeguarding against cuts in welfare and tax increases.  Having boxed itself into a corner on such a wide range of issues, the Government has destroyed the huge level of trust that was placed in it by a large majority of the people of the State.  That is not great for democracy.  It does not give us much confidence in the leadership qualities that the Government aspires to as it tries to lead the country out of the recession and to prepare policy frameworks on a wide range of issues that will benefit the economy and the environment into the future.  The trend that appears to be emanating from Government circles in recent months is evident in many of the examples I have mentioned, including the climate change Bill languishing on the C list.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100023#V00100","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1349958900,"counter":242,"content":"<p>We will not agree to Fianna F\u00e1il's climate change Bill anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100023#V00200","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1349958900,"counter":243,"content":"<p>The Government is producing worthy documents but failing to legislate for them.

As I said last night on Private Members' business, I am glad that the Government has continued the Food Harvest 2020 policy and set about working with all stakeholders to make sure its targets can be achieved by 2020.  This approach was vindicated this week when an announcement was made by Kerry Group.  I welcome the faith in this economy that is being shown by such a fantastic indigenous company, which is a global market leader.  We have to recognise the importance of the agriculture sector to our economy.<\/p><p>  I would like to refer briefly to CAP reform.  There is an onus and a responsibility on the Ministers for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Environment, Community and Local Government to ensure the \u20ac1.6 billion envelope is retained.  It should be retained and no doubt it will be.  The Government has our full support in its efforts to ensure that is what happens.  The mechanisms used for the disbursement of those funds can be adjudicated on with other parties, with a view to ensuring money goes to those who need it most.  We must make sure we are not hampered by environmental issues that might prevent us from being able to draw down the majority of the funds that will be available.  The practices that were sanctioned by previous Governments under schemes such as REPS and AEOS must be maintained.  Given that there has been an underspend of \u20ac200 million in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, it is unfortunate that AEOS has been diminished.  That money could have gone a long way towards copperfastening sustainable development in the agriculture sector and thereby reducing the threat that may arise in the course of the CAP negotiations.  As we said last night, we will hold the Government to account while supporting its efforts to meet its goals.  If we feel it is not performing as it should, it will be held to account for that.<\/p><p>  Ireland has a reputation for green production, with farmers focusing on work that involves environmentally sound practices.  There should be no need for them to be punished, considering the background work they have done.  There is no logic in shipping beef and other food that is produced in South America in dubious environmental circumstances halfway across the world when it can be produced here with less of an environmental impact.  It is critical for sustainable development to take an international perspective and recognise the core role of farmers as custodians of the unique countryside environment.<\/p><p>  The 2002 spatial strategy centred on the need to focus future planning and development on nine gateway cities and large towns and nine medium-sized hub towns.  Many of the larger gateway cities experienced population growth that was lower than the national average while strong growth took place within commuting distance of those gateways.<\/p><p>The national spatial strategy update and outlook reaffirmed the Government's commitment to implementing the strategy and set new priorities and objectives, taking on board experiences since 2002.  We believe balanced regional development, maintaining as many people as practical on the land, and adequate housing provision, under which people get a house suited to their needs and resources, are essential in achieving sustainable development.  Fostering sustainable communities that encompass a strong sense of civic pride and participation is part of the crucial social capital we bequeath to future generations and helps tie society together.  Spatial planning helps to secure these viable, vibrant communities through the effective use of space, designing public areas as recreational facilities, putting in place good transport links and constructing mixed communities.<\/p><p> In this light, the Government's retail planning guidelines threaten to undermine the vibrancy of town centres across the country by hollowing out businesses and driving them out of town centres.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100023#V00700","speaker":"1101","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349959500,"counter":249,"content":"<p>That is nonsense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100024#W00200","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1349959500,"counter":250,"content":"<p>This was a regressive move by the Government that damages the concept of sustainable development and, again, exposes the failure of Government to match rhetoric with action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100024#W00300","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1349959500,"counter":251,"content":"<p>The Deputy should read the guidelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100024#W00400","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1349959500,"counter":252,"content":"<p>It is back to the question of rhetoric and action.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100024#W00500","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1349959500,"counter":253,"content":"<p>The Deputy, without interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100024#W00600","speaker":"971"},{"type":"speech","time":1349959500,"counter":254,"content":"<p>The Government has not matched its actions with the rhetoric when it talks about climate change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100024#W00700","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1349959500,"counter":255,"content":"<p>Ask the shopkeepers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100024#W00800","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1349959500,"counter":256,"content":"<p>Ask the shopkeepers?

The Government must play an active role in establishing and implementing EU policies to ensure that all countries are in lockstep on the issue and no competitive issues arise that disadvantage certain countries.<\/p><p>  The Amsterdam treaty made sustainable development a core task of the European Community.  In December 1999 the EU Heads of State and Government asked the Commission to produce a sustainable development strategy, entitled A Sustainable Europe for a Better World, for the EU, and it was presented to the Gothenburg summit in 2001.  The Treaty of Lisbon states that one of the EU's objectives is to work for sustainable development based in particular on a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment.  The Europe 2020 strategy adopted by the EU in 2010 sets targets for the decade in the following areas: employment, research and development and innovation; climate change and energy; and education and poverty and social exclusion.  The 2020 strategy reaffirms the collective determination to ensure fiscal sustainability, including accelerating plans for fiscal consolidation.  It supports a shift towards a resource-efficient and low-carbon economy, and the European Commission has committed to using a range of financing and economic instruments to achieve this objective.<\/p><p>  To conclude, I want to reiterate our commitment to sustainable development, which has to be at the core of future public policy, both domestically and internationally.

However, as I have said on numerous occasions during these few words, the Government must match its words with actions.  It is vital the Minister moves the climate change Bill a bit further than the C list.  He would like to finish his term with more than a C grade.

Sustainability is a much used and abused and often misunderstood term.  If someone wants to sound environmentally friendly, he or she simply peppers his or her contribution with the word \"sustainability\".  Sustainable development has been defined as balancing the fulfilment of human needs with the protection of the natural environment so these needs can be met, not only in the present but in the future.  The Brundtland Commission, which the Minister quotes, defines sustainable development as development that \"meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\"<\/p><p>  This is an important framework document that should be the compass for decisions made by the Government and should guide Government policy.  It should not be seen simply as a Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government document or as an afterthought by other Departments, statutory agencies or public bodies.  To be effective, the framework for sustainable development must receive the political support and resources it requires to ensure its success.  Unfortunately, in response to a parliamentary question I tabled in June, the Minister stated that no extra resources would be allocated for its implementation.<\/p><p>  In the document's introduction, the Minister states: &quot;I welcome the fact that political oversight will be delivered through the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and the Green Economy, supported by the High-Level Inter-Departmental Group on Sustainable Development chaired by my Department&quot;.  The reality is different.  Unfortunately, the Minster's track record on climate change is very poor.  Despite the fact that climate change is mentioned five times in the document, the Minister continues to flip-flop on the issue.  So far, no heads of a Bill have been drafted and no contact has been made with Departments to ensure they have an input.  Climate change continues to be moved down the agenda, which annoys me greatly.  The Cabinet committee on climate change and the green economy meets in secret, with no minutes and no accountability, whereas, under the previous Government, for all its faults, the Cabinet sub-committee on climate change was an all-party committee focused on drafting a climate change Bill.<\/p><p>  It must be a priority for this Government to introduce a climate change Bill.  It is the cornerstone around which a sustainable future can be built, a point on which I hope we can all agree.  The Minister has had the public consultation.  We must now have the drafts of the Bill circulated to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Time is not on our side.  The consequences of failing to draft and agree a climate change Bill are much too serious to simply ignore it or put it on the back burner.<\/p><p>  The framework document states: &quot;Ireland is required to progress down an annual emissions reduction trajectory from 2013, reaching a point in 2020 where emissions are equivalent to 20% below their level in 2005.&quot;  The document clearly outlines the consequences if the Government fails to introduce a climate change Bill.  If we continue with current levels of consumption, we would need three planets' worth of resources to keep us going.  Our overall ecological footprint is the tenth highest in the world, and we must change this.  The document goes on to state: &quot;Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are among the highest per person in the world.&quot;  There can be no more arguments, prevarication or stalling.<\/p><p>  Meanwhile, the Northern Ireland Assembly is proceeding with the drafting of a climate change Bill in line with the Westminster Bill.  The Minister knows that the challenges and consequences of global warming do not stop at borders.  Here is an opportunity to approach this issue in a real, all-Ireland way.  In fact, the draft Bill produced by the sub-committee on climate change during the term of the last Government is available, and Deputy Hogan's ministerial colleague, Deputy Simon Coveney, was an enthusiastic champion of the Bill. <\/p><p>  Whatever we do in regard to the new Bill, it must have five key components.  First, it must contain legally binding five-year carbon budgets.<\/p><p>Second, it must have an independent expert authority looking at the evidence and publishing its advice to the Government.  Third, there must be a science-based target for 2050.  Fourth, EU leaders have accepted the findings of the global Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that there must be a reduction in emissions of 80% to 90% compared to the 1990 baseline figure by 2050.  The fifth element is that there must be a commitment to meeting these targets domestically.  We simply cannot buy our way out of meeting the targets.  It would be far too costly an approach, both financially and environmentally.  We must have clarity and certainty in order that business and householders can invest.<\/p><p><br \/> The challenge of sustainability must be viewed in an historical context.  There has been close a correlation between economic growth and environmental destruction.  Right through the industrial revolution the environment and its inhabitants suffered.  Forests, rivers and lakes were destroyed in an effort to meet the demands of growth and greater profits.  In this country entire counties were deforested to meet the needs of the industrial revolution in Britain.  The walls of the House of Commons are panelled with wood from forests in County Cork.<\/p><p><br \/> The World Business Council for Sustainable Development states &quot;Business cannot succeed in societies that fail&quot;.  A major hurdle to the achievement of sustainability is poverty.  It has been widely acknowledged that poverty is one source of environmental degradation.  Such an acknowledgment has been made in the Brundtland Commission report, Our Common Future, and the United Nation&#8217;s millennium development goals.  According to the Brundtland report, <blockquote>Poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems.  It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality.<\/blockquote> Poverty has become a reality for more families in the State today than was the case ten years ago.  Unfortunately, the level of child poverty has increased for the first time in more than a century.  A total of 200,000 children are now living in poverty.  More than 700,000 people in total are living in poverty, and the unemployment rate is almost 15%.  Meanwhile, the Government continues to bail out zombie banks to the tune of billions of euro.  It is not sustainable for the level of poverty to increase, while billions of euro is exported to unguaranteed bondholders.  <\/p><p><br \/> Treating the environment as an afterthought may generate short-term profit at the expense of sustainability.  Sustainable business practices, on the other hand, integrate ecological, social and economic concerns.  Growth that depletes ecosystem services is sometimes termed &quot;uneconomic growth&quot; as it leads to a decline in quality of life.  Minimising such growth can provide opportunities for local businesses.  To combat poverty, create jobs and provide an economic stimulus, the Government must develop the green economy.  It must not be kept in the hands of a secret Cabinet sub-committee but must instead become a reality for the people of the country.  We must involve them in the process.<\/p><p><br \/> The notion of sustainability as a business opportunity has led to the formation of organisations such as the Sustainability Consortium of the Society for Organizational Learning, the Sustainable Business Institute and the World Council for Sustainable Development.  Research focusing on progressive corporate leaders who have embedded sustainability in a commercial strategy has yielded a leadership competency model for sustainability.  The expansion of sustainable business opportunities can contribute to job creation through the green economy.<\/p><p><br \/> In my county of Laois there is significant potential for wind energy projects and the establishment of wind farms.  If such farms are located sensitively on unused land through local consultation, this industry could provide jobs and energy for communities beyond the midlands and even these shores.  Sinn F\u00e9in calls on the Government to kick-start the wind power industry with a &#8364;600 million investment in infrastructure, in addition to a &#8364;400 million investment by the European Investment Bank.  We favour reforming and reducing the lead-in time necessary for projects and would mandate the ESB to develop an extra 300 MW of offshore wind generation capacity in the next five years.  It is estimated that this industry has the capacity to create 50,000 jobs over a 15 year period.<\/p><p><br \/> Tourism is under-resourced and untapped in the midlands, particularly in Counties Laois and Offaly.  Laois and Offaly county councils are committed to financially backing the development of a mountain bike trek through the beautiful Slieve Bloom Mountains.  However, the project urgently needs the backing of the Government and Tourism Ireland.  It has the backing of the local authorities.  It ticks all the boxes; it is about job creation and sustainability and will provide an economic stimulus in rural areas of counties Laois and Offaly where there is little work to be found.<\/p><p><br \/> Energy efficiency measures could also increase profits by reducing costs and provide jobs.  A total of 1.4 million houses in the country are in need of insulation and retrofitting.  According to the Institute of International and European Affairs, an investment of approximately &#8364;14 billion would be required to bring residential housing stock up to an average building energy rating, BER, of C1.  We heard much talk from the previous speaker about C ratings.  This measure would save the average household &#8364;1,496 a year.  It would also help the country to reach its 20% energy efficiency target by 2020.<\/p><p><br \/> Sinn F\u00e9in supports the framework document, but, more importantly, we aim to hold the Government to account to ensure sustainability becomes the common thread running through all Government policies and actions.  The Minister states in the introduction to the document that &#8220;the business as usual approach will not suffice.&#8221;  We agree.  We have an opportunity to break the business as usual cycle, but the Minister must prioritise the drafting and circulation of the heads of the climate change Bill.  I appeal to him to do so.  The Bill will be the litmus test of whether the Government is serious about pursuing sustainability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100024#W02600","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349960100,"counter":275,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Barry Cowen and Brian Stanley for their contributions, apart from the few errors Deputy Barry Cowen made in his contribution, which I will choose to ignore, about sustainable development in the context of planning and Fianna F\u00e1il's record.

For example, in Waterford Institute of Technology, the spending in the president's office alone increased from \u20ac30,000 in 2000 to more than \u20ac600,000 in 2008.  From recent reports, I understand there have been numerous breaches of financial governance procedures and protocols within the institute.<\/p><p>  I compliment the Committee of Public Accounts and its members who are currently examining this matter and I hope the spotlight will ensure full transparency around this problem.  Also in my constituency, De la Salle College in Waterford city, a second-level college with a great educational heritage and reputation, has had its reputation damaged in recent times due to the college's racking up more than \u20ac500,000 in debts on school refurbishment projects that, according to a recent whole school evaluation, had little educational benefit.  Management and governance were so poor the Department of Education and Skills had to appoint an administrator to manage the college while these debts are being dealt with.<\/p><p>  I am aware also of a national school in County Waterford where in recent years it was discovered that a former principal was operating a number of bank accounts and had held school moneys without the knowledge of the school's board of management.  The same principal had adopted annual accounts at board of management meetings over a number of years, knowing full well these moneys were neither being accounted for nor reported to the board of management.  When this came to light an initial two accounts were discovered, with a further four discovered subsequently.  Only under the threat of disciplinary action did the principal give full permission to the board of management to access all the bank accounts he had opened and in which school funds were held.  Eventually more than \u20ac77,000 was transferred by the former principal from these private accounts back to the authorised board of management bank account.  In total, 19 private bank accounts were discovered which had been opened and operated by the former principal without the knowledge or approval of successive boards of management.  Eventually, the board engaged independent expertise at its own cost.  The experts did a forensic analysis of the accounts and compiled some very important questions that required answers from the former principal.  The board requested a break-down and explanations from him regarding the \u20ac77,000 which was transferred back to the authorised school account.<\/p><p>  I do not suggest any school funds were misappropriated but there were financial irregularities in this case and one can only imagine the distress and upheaval this matter has caused within the entire school community.  The board of management asked specific questions of the former principal about certain transactions that went through these private accounts.  When these questions were put to him he went on sick leave and never returned.  He subsequently retired.  To this day many questions remain unanswered regarding the operation of these private accounts and the management of school finances during this period.<\/p><p>  What disappoints me is that during all of this time successive boards of management of the school in question sought assistance from the Department to deal with these issues but they received very little support or advice and were left to their own devices to manage what had become a very difficult financial problem.  A whole school evaluation was carried out during the period and even though the inspectors were informed of the financial irregularities they did not examine them closely other than to make a passing reference in their final report.  This is not good enough.  Millions of euro of taxpayers' money is put into our educational system.  We are entitled to expect thorough and adequate financial governance, as well as checks and balances to ensure the proper management and allocation of these funds.  If this can happen in the two colleges and this primary school in my constituency we can be sure it is happening in others around the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100026#Z00100","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1349960700,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  The issues raised in regard to expenses which occurred in the past in the office of the president in Waterford Institute of Technology are of serious concern.  It is incumbent on all public sector organisations and governing authorities to ensure public funds are expended in an appropriate manner.  It is simply not acceptable for scarce public money to be squandered on lavish expenses in public institutions.<\/p><p>  The Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, are committed to ensuring the efficient and effective spend of all resources within higher education.  While it is not feasible for the Department or the HEA to monitor or approve all individual levels of expenditure within the higher education sector, there are clear accountability and governance procedures in place within institutions and reporting mechanisms to the Minister for Education and Skills and to the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>  With regard to the particular issue associated with Waterford Institute of Technology, an external review commissioned by the institute to ascertain the extent of spending by the office of the president is nearing completion and I understand the HEA hopes to receive that report shortly.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has asked officials in the Department, in consultation with the HEA, to consider what further steps may need to be taken and is awaiting that advice.<\/p><p>  In the wider higher education sector, under both university and institute of technology legislation, the president is the accountable officer of the institution and is answerable to the committees of the Oireachtas in regard to the disposal of moneys.  The legislation also provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General undertake annual audits of the financial statements of universities and institutes of technology, which include a review of expenditure incurred by the institutions.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reports regularly on these audits.<\/p><p>  Furthermore, and in line with practice in the public and private sector, codes of governance have been agreed at a sectoral level which provide for a range of effective measures around procedures for procurement, tendering, financial reporting, internal audit and travel.  This further increases the accountability of institutions by requiring the establishment and implementation of specific mechanisms in these areas.<\/p><p>  Robust processes and systems combined with constant vigilance, regular review of processes and procedures and prompt reaction to any failures are key components of an effective accountability and control system.  Each university and institute of technology is required to submit to the HEA an annual statement confirming adherence by the institution to all appropriate procedures and measures in regard to financial control, such as I have outlined.<\/p><p>  The Deputy spoke also about financial governance in second level schools.  Voluntary secondary schools are privately owned and privately managed.  The accounts of such schools are provided annually to the financial support services unit, FSSU, which is operated under the auspices of the joint managerial body.<\/p><p>In effect, the FSSU provides an internal audit function for schools in the sector and conducts audits and investigations where necessary.  The VECs are audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The accounts of comprehensive and community schools are monitored on a monthly basis by the schools financial section of the Department of Education and Skills.<\/p><p> The Deputy also referred to primary schools.  As he is aware, there are more than 3,000 primary schools in the State and each of these is privately owned and operated under a range of patronage arrangements.  Most commonly, the local bishop will be the patron of the Catholic primary schools in a particular diocese.  Educate Together, the Protestant bishops, providers of disability services and Foras P\u00e1tr\u00fanachta na Scoileanna L\u00e1n-Ghaeilge are the other patrons involved in the arrangements to which I refer.  There are no formalised financial accounting procedures in place in respect of primary schools.  However, such schools are required to make their accounts available to the Department of Education and Skills upon request.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100026#Z00200","speaker":"1042","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1349961300,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I note the protocols and procedures to which the Minister of State referred in respect of second and third level.

However, the Minister of State should acknowledge the fact that millions of euro of taxpayers' money are being invested in private schools - which come under the patronage of various bodies and entities - to be expended on the education of our children.

I am disappointed that when the assistance to which I refer was sought, support was not forthcoming.  I have raised this matter in the public interest.

One of the positives with regard to our system is that primary schools enjoy a huge degree of autonomy and independence in the context of their governance.  However, this brings with it a serious burden of responsibility for members of boards of management.  There is also a burden of responsibility on local communities in the context of ensuring that those who are elected or appointed to these boards possess the relevant expertise to allow them to be effective in their work and to identify and cope with issues such as those to which the Deputy refers.

There is no doubt that it is better than the old system, with which 66 awarding authorities were involved and to which were attached different types of application process.  I accept that there have been improvements.  Unfortunately, however, the new system has proven to be problematic for a number of students.  In certain instances, information has not been forthcoming.  When students make contact by telephone in order to obtain additional information, the operators on the other end of the line do not have it to hand.  This has created significant problems for a small number of students in the context of having their grants awarded.  The latter is having a knock-on effect for such students in that they are having difficulties in accessing timetables because they have not yet been able to access the grant system.  They are also encountering problems with regard to accessing facilities as a result of the fact that they are not yet registered.<\/p><p>  I am aware of one case involving a family that is in receipt of social welfare and whose child is attending UCC for the first time.  The family in question lives 40 miles from the college.  As a result of difficulties with regard to registering under the grant system, it is costing the family almost \u20ac100 per week to send the student in question to and from UCC by public transport.  It has not been possible for the family to purchase textbooks because the grant has not yet been approved.  This is giving rise to major problems.  The family in question applied for the grant and submitted all the necessary paperwork in advance of the relevant deadline.  However, the paperwork was returned and additional information is being sought.  When the family tried to obtain the latter from the Revenue Commissioners, they were informed that it would take a week.  A further three weeks will have passed by the time this information is obtained, returned and processed.  What has happened in this case has led to a huge financial burden being placed on the student in question.  He now faces the possibility of being obliged to drop out of college.  He applied to his local credit union to try to secure a short-term loan but, unfortunately, he was unsuccessful in this regard because he could not get a guarantor.<\/p><p>  As a result of the flaws in the SUSI system, a small number of students have not been awarded their grants and are facing some really tough choices in the context of whether they can continue to pursue their college courses.  Will the Minister of State review the position with regard to the SUSI system?  The Union of Students in Ireland, USI, has highlighted a number of improvements which could be made in order to make the system more efficient and cost-effective.  I ask that the Department consult the USI in respect of some of the proposals it has put forward.  The USI carried out a survey in respect of all the students who use the SUSI system in order to discover whether the flaws and inefficiencies to which I refer can be ironed out prior to the next round of applications in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100027#AA00400","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1349961300,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Brien for raising this important matter.  As he stated, a new, fully centralised online student grant application system was launched in June.  This system is being operated by a central grant awarding authority, Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, which has been established as a unit of the City of Dublin VEC.  Up to last year, students applied to 66 different local authorities and VECs for grant assistance and the Deputy will be aware of the difficulties these bodies had in dealing with the huge increases in the numbers applying for student grants in recent years.  The new facility automates and replaces the previous manual application arrangements with a centralised, easy-to-use online system of application for all new grant applicants nationwide from the 2012-13 academic year.  It has been designed in such a way as to interactively guide students through the application process.  Renewal applications for students already in receipt of a grant for their current courses will continue to be dealt with by the existing 66 grant-awarding authorities.<\/p><p>  Under the old system the majority of third level students were paid by cheque, a costly and inefficient method of making payments.  Under SUSI, students will be paid on a monthly basis directly into their bank accounts.  This will lead to all SUSI grant applicants in an institution receiving their payments in the same way by means of electronic funds transfer.  The main aim of the project is to substantially improve the grant application experience for over 66,000 new applicants each year.  A tailored list of the documentation required to support these grant applications has issued to all students concerned.  A significant change to the process for this year is that only photocopies, rather than originals, of the supporting documentation are required.<\/p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the completion of the award process and subsequent payment of grants depends on students' returning the required documentation to SUSI.  Some 19,000 students have yet to return this documentation to enable their applications to be processed to completion.  A further 20,000 have returned incorrect or incomplete documentation.  I understand that SUSI is actively following up with all of these applicants - by post, e-mail and text message - to ensure that the correct supporting documentation is returned as quickly as possible in order that their applications can proceed to the final decision stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100027#AA00500","speaker":"1042"},{"type":"speech","time":1349961300,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

A student may be unaware that the paperwork with the application is not complete.  I know of a case where the short form of a birth certificate was submitted instead of the long form.  As a consequence, the decision to offer a grant was delayed.  A number of issues need to be ironed out.  I am aware that USI has proposed a clearer tracking system to enable students to follow the progress of their application and a more user-friendly website.  I have been told by those using the website that it is not user-friendly.  The Unions of Students in Ireland wants better briefing and training of the help desk workers because on many occasions the information is not readily available to callers.<\/p><p> I have no doubt that the SUSI system is a much better process and I welcome it wholeheartedly.

Hospitals must concentrate on maximising efficiency and getting the best possible services for patients from the budgets available to us through cost-containment measures such as a reduction in spending on agency and overtime, a reduction in activity to bring it into line with approved levels, and better management of in-house support services such as catering, laundry and back-office functions.  In meeting the challenge of managing within budgets, the focus is on ensuring that essential services are protected and that patient safety and quality remain paramount.  Greater efficiencies are possible in both front line and support services.  Reductions in costs are currently being realised through measures such as the implementation of the HSE's acute medicine clinical care programme, which has saved 121,003 bed days to date this year.  Other clinical programmes are also gradually reducing the average length of stay for patients, which in turn reduces the number of bed days needed.  Similarly, the HSE's transitional care initiative is shortening the average length of stay in acute beds by putting in place 190 transitional care beds and 150 rehabilitation beds this year, to which patients can move when appropriate.  The Deputy raises the matter of laundry services at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  The Department is aware that the provision of these services has been significantly impacted by a number of retirements of staff who, under the current moratorium, cannot be replaced.  The Department is also aware that at present there is no capital allocation for the replacement of laundry equipment at the hospital.<\/p><p>  The public service agreement outlines the importance of right sourcing: the need to consider whether support services, such as laundry, are best placed in-house, whether it is economically advantageous to outsource these services and whether outsourcing could be disadvantageous to those using these services.  In the spirit of that agreement, the health service implementation body has met with local union representatives and local management and discussed the matter at a full hearing.  The HSIB has recommended that both parties work together to ascertain the feasibility of providing an in-house laundry service for the region.  Site visits have taken place.

The latter has shown an excellent commitment to flood prevention measures generally and has responded to all of the issues I have raised in this regard in the House.  I am obliged, however, to raise the situation of the residents of Maryfield Crescent in Artane, which was flooded in the summers of 2008 and 2009 and again in October 2011.  On rainy days such as today, the residents become worried that they will endure further flooding.<\/p><p>  Dublin City Council has indicated that before any flood relief measures can be taken in the area, there must be a hydraulic analysis of the Naniken river.  The problem, however, is that the council claims it does not have the \u20ac50,000 required to undertake that analysis.  When I inquired recently as to whether the Office of Public Works might provide the council with the funding it needs to proceed, I was told that such an analysis is not eligible under the minor works scheme.  The situation, therefore, is that the council cannot proceed with the hydraulic analysis which is a prerequisite to the implementation of any potential flood relief measures.  The expenditure involved, at \u20ac50,000, is very little in the overall scheme of things but could have a huge impact for these families.  Some of them have no home insurance and, as such, their properties are effectively worthless.  Any potential buyer of a house in Maryfield Crescent would likewise be ineligible for home insurance and would not, therefore, obtain a mortgage.  In other words, the residents are locked into their current homes for the foreseeable future.<\/p><p>  Will the Minister of State indicate whether the OPW will provide the necessary funding to Dublin City Council to carry out the required hydraulic analysis of the Naniken river?  Without that analysis, the council cannot identify a long-term strategy for the alleviation of flood risks in the estate and the residents will remain in a no-man's land.  I acknowledge that significant flood relief work is ongoing in other parts of the country and in other areas in my constituency, including the Clanmoyle Road in Donnycarney.  In the case of Maryfield Crescent, however, no remedial process can commence until the hydraulic analysis is carried out, after which the council would be in a position to identify a way forward.  As I said, an outlay of only \u20ac50,000 might be the first step in making life easier for the residents.<\/p><p>  Although I am loath to raise this issue in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, I have little choice in the matter since Dublin City Council has washed its hands of it.  It is probably not a matter for this House, but I am obliged to take this opportunity to seek the Minister of State's assistance in moving towards a solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100029#CC00100","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speech","time":1349962500,"counter":308,"content":"<p>The Deputy should not apologise for raising this matter in the House as he is quite entitled to do.  I understand his frustration at the bureaucracy he has encountered both from our side and from Dublin City Council.  He is absolutely within his rights as a Member of this House to highlight the matter publicly.<\/p><p>  The Naniken river runs underground for most of its length through the built-up suburbs of north Dublin, including Artane.  As it is conveyed by way of a culvert for a substantial part of its entire length, it forms an integral part of the urban storm drainage system and is monitored and managed as such by Dublin City Council.  The only open section runs through St. Anne's Park.  Responsibility for the design, construction, maintenance and upkeep of drainage infrastructure rests with the relevant local authority in the first instance and with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government as the funding body for investment in that infrastructure.  The Office of Public Works does not have a role or function in this area.<\/p><p>  In order to ascertain why the drainage system in the area is not performing as it should, Dublin City Council must undertake a hydraulic analysis of the culverted river.  Regardless of the cost involved, it does not fall within the remit of the OPW to take the lead in or fund such a study.  That is a matter for the council.  As I said, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government provides funding to local authorities to undertake such works.  In this instance, Dublin City Council has indicated that it has insufficient funding to carry out the required analysis.  The issue for the OPW is that getting involved in this project would set a precedent for every other drainage scheme in the country.  Moreover, the OPW can only take on a project where it has a mandate to do so.  The minor works scheme is operated in accordance with a transparent model whereby applications from local authorities are assessed on the basis of a cost analysis.  Were the office to take on a project outside of that model, it would set a precedent for every other local authority to seek funds.  That is a difficulty.<\/p><p>  I am acutely aware that it is of little interest to the residents of Maryfield Crescent which arm of the State carries out or funds the study.  Nonetheless, it is important that clear lines of responsibility are maintained and that Dublin City Council takes the lead in carrying out the necessary work to address the drainage problems and associated flooding in the Artane area.  I am advised, based on information provided by the council on the extent of its culverted length, that the Naniken river will not be included in the eastern catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, study being undertaken by RPS consultants.  It was deemed that the upper reaches of the river are piped to such a degree that it is effectively part of the storm drainage network, the assessment of which is outside the OPW's remit.  Moreover, the OPW has concluded that the lower open reach through St. Anne's Park does not pose a risk of such scale as to warrant inclusion in the study.<\/p><p>  I understand the residents of Maryfield Crescent met with engineers from Dublin City Council in recent weeks.  It was agreed at that meeting, which was attended by Deputy \u00d3 R\u00edord\u00e1in, that a local flood forum is to be formed in the area.  This will consider ways in which individuals can develop their resilience to floods and protect their own properties by way of devices such as individual flood gates, non-return valves and so on.  This is an excellent initiative which I would like to see replicated in other parts of our main cities and towns and, indeed, within rural communities.  Everyone has a role to play in minimising the impact of flooding.  The State, for its part, through the OPW and the local authorities, is making huge efforts to deal with the main flooding problems throughout the country.<\/p><p>  The OPW, in association with Dublin City Council, has overseen significant flood relief projects in Dublin, including the completed River Tolka flood relief scheme and the ongoing works on the River Dodder.  In addition, the OPW has approved a total of \u20ac1.854 million under the minor works scheme for the city and greater Dublin area.  Under its major capital works programme, meanwhile, the OPW has nine major flood relief schemes at construction stage.  It is expected that another four schemes will commence construction before the end of 2013, subject to completion of procurement and other preparatory formalities and availability of funding.  A further 11 schemes are at various stages of design and planning.  In addition, under the minor works and coastal protection scheme, the OPW provides funding to local authorities for smaller-scale, more localised mitigation measures in their areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100029#CC00200","speaker":"958"},{"type":"speech","time":1349962500,"counter":309,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and his acknowledgement of my frustration and that of the residents in question.

Responsibility for the regulation of the gas market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which is an independent statutory body.  Until 1 October 2011, the CER regulated the Bord G\u00e1is Energy tariffs for its residential and smaller business customers, at which point price regulation for the latter group ended.  The regulator still regulates the Bord G\u00e1is Energy tariffs for its residential customers.  Prices charged to business gas customers are wholly a commercial and operational matter for the suppliers concerned and the same is the case for non-Bord G\u00e1is Energy suppliers to residential customers.  Business and domestic customers can avail of the competitive offerings, including discounts from a number of supply companies.<\/p><p><br \/>  Concerning the most recent increase, I understand a marginal increase in wholesale international gas prices, which are sterling denominated, did not impact on the increase as much as the deterioration in the euro-sterling exchange rate and increase in gas network tariffs.  The upward pressure on gas network tariffs is primarily due to a reduction in gas demand and higher financing costs for Bord G\u00e1is Networks, both of which are related to the financial situation here and abroad.  In making its decision, the Commission for Energy Regulation takes account of the need to protect consumers from unnecessary price increases by ensuring that only reasonable legitimate costs are recovered by Bord G\u00e1is Energy.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Government is concerned at the impact of electricity and gas price increases, especially on vulnerable households.  Included in the measures taken by the Government to combat vulnerability to high energy prices is the Better Energy: Warmer Homes Scheme.  More than 17,000 low income homes will benefit this year from energy efficiency retrofits under the scheme, resulting in lower energy costs and improved comfort and well-being in the households in question.  In addition, the Department of Social Protection provides supports for electricity and gas customers and operates a fuel allowance scheme.  Some &#8364;464 million was disbursed under these schemes in 2011. <\/p><p><br \/>  The Commission for Energy Regulation is also working with energy suppliers to ensure vulnerable customers are protected through,<i> inter alia<\/i>, the installation of pay-as-one-goes meters. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100030#DDD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1349963100,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I note the Minister's abdication of responsibility in respect of the role of the Commissioner for Energy Regulation in pricing.

The latest hike in gas prices will result in an increase in the average annual bill, which was \u20ac700 in 2011, to \u20ac1,000 per annum.<\/p><p>  As the Minister indicated, the role of the Commission for Energy Regulation is to protect the interests of consumers and act as a brake on the price hiking instincts of utility companies.

From the date Bord G\u00e1is Energy submitted its application until the delayed date of the regulator's announcement, the position had deteriorated.  A major factor in this deterioration was the decreasing value of the euro against sterling.  This and geopolitical events have driven recent developments.<\/p><p>  Looking back over recent years, the professional modelling system used by the Commission for Energy Regulation does not vary.  If, owing to a set of given circumstances, the model provided for a decrease in price, a decrease was awarded.  Similarly, increases are awarded where the model indicates they are warranted.  I do not have any basis to criticise the modelling used by the regulator based on the advice available to me.  For example, in both half years of 2011, the Commission for Energy Regulation did not give any increase and in the previous half year - to 30 September 2010 - the regulator reduced the price by 8%.  In one half year in 2008, the regulator increased the tariff by 20% and in one six month period the tariff was increased by 32%.

The Government is committed, to meet our 2020 binding targets, to increasing the figure for renewable energy to 40% in the electricity sector, 10% in the transport sector and 12% in the heating sector, which together amounts to 16% overall, in line with our target under the EU renewable energy directive.<\/p><p><br \/>  New renewable electricity generation has been supported to date in Ireland by the AER and REFIT schemes.  These schemes which provide guaranteed floor prices for renewable electricity are financed through the public sector obligation, PSO, levy that is funded by all electricity consumers and not through direct Exchequer funding.<\/p><p><br \/>  Separate to the schemes mentioned which underpin delivery of our renewable electricity target, there has been a certain level of public funding allocated as research funding to the wave and tidal energy sector in recent years.  This sector is still at the research and development phase and is not yet commercially viable anywhere in the world.<\/p><p><br \/>  Ocean energy was recently identified as a priority area in the research prioritisation exercise undertaken by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, given its potential for the development of a future industrial sector.  The development of ocean energy sources has been pursued in line with the 2006 ocean energy strategy published by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre, HMRC, in Cork has a wave test tank where early stage devices can be tested and has developed a systematic protocol for the scaling up and testing of wave technology.  In addition, ocean energy research is engaged in at certain third level education institutions.<\/p><p><br \/>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, ocean energy development unit has encouraged the ocean energy sector, including through the administration of a prototype development fund of grants, whereby up to 50% co-funding for scale testing and other research in the ocean area has been provided for industry.<\/p><p><i>  Additional information not given on the floor of the House<\/i><\/p><p><br \/>  SEAI, together with the Marine Institute, has been involved in the development of the Galway Bay wave test site and the Marine Institute, together with IBM, has been involved in the SmartBay project, creating ICT links side by side with the development of ocean energy technologies.<\/p><p><br \/>  The number of long-term sustainable jobs that new renewable energy projects can deliver depends on a variety of factors.  The employment figures quoted by the Deputy are estimates based on a variety of assumptions.  A 2009 report by the Irish Wind Energy Association, IWEA, entitled, Jobs and Investment in Irish wind energy, estimated that the wind energy sector in Ireland can support 1.5 jobs per MW installed.  At the end of 2011, 17.6% of our electricity was from renewable sources, with approximately 1900 MW installed.  At an EU level, the European Wind Energy Association analysis found that at European level there were 15 jobs created per MW.  Wind turbine and component manufacturing provide the majority of employment opportunities, representing 12 of the 15 jobs created in the European Union for every MW installed.<\/p><p><br \/>  The ability to harness a high level of employment from renewable energy projects depends, to a large extent, on related industry such as turbine and cable manufacturing industry being based in Ireland.  This would only occur if renewable electricity access to the much larger UK market was achieved as the Irish market on its own would not sustain such investments.  The potential for export of renewable electricity was outlined in the strategy for renewable energy 2012-20 which I published earlier in the year.<\/p><p><br \/>  The mechanisms by which renewable energy can be traded with another country are provided for under the renewable energy directive in articles relating to co-operation mechanisms.  The use of these co-operation mechanisms under the directive requires formal agreement between two or more governments.  I have had a number of bilateral discussions with my UK counterpart in this regard and we are actively exploring the possibility of trade in renewable energy between the two jurisdictions, with a view to reaching a memorandum of understanding by the end of the year.<\/p><p><br \/>  A key principle for me in the event of export of Ireland&#8217;s renewable energy resources is to ensure an adequate return for the State from such activity.  In the event, for example, that renewable power was being exported to the United Kingdom, for example, it will be necessary to ensure the costs associated with new transmission infrastructure to export the power and the cost of a support scheme for renewable developers are paid for by UK consumers, rather than Irish consumers.  If the Government decides to enter an intergovernmental agreement under the directive with the UK or any other Government, it will ensure sufficient return and benefits to the State from such projects.  This would likely include either a share of the renewable value of the projects or the imposition of a financial royalty type payment on exporting projects.  Wind energy projects typically pay around &#8364;7,000 per MW installed to the local authority as a rates payment every year.  On top of this, most projects typically pay between &#8364;1,000 and &#8364;1,500 per annum as a community benefit fund to the local community in return for any inconvenience caused in the locality.  The export royalty payment which would be made directly to central government would be in addition to these existing payments.<\/p><p><br \/>  The State energy companies, notably the ESB and BGE, are already engaged in the renewable energy sector.  Further investments by these companies in the sector would be a matter for them, taking account of their commercial remit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100031#FF00825","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1349963700,"counter":333,"content":"<p>My question was about how the State would benefit from our substantial resources with reference to wave, wind and tidal energy, particularly as Ireland has one third of all renewable resources in north-west Europe.

These households were solely reliant on the analogue television network, which is switching off in 13 days' time, at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 24 October.  Households that use only pay television platforms, such as Sky or UPC, are not affected by the analogue switch-off.  They amount to a little over 1,300,000 households, or 82.1%, according to the latest ComReg quarterly report.<\/p><p><br \/>  As part of the digital switchover information campaign, Millward Brown Lansdowne has been undertaking regular research on the number of analogue-only households which have yet to make the switch.  I informed the Deputy in a reply to a Parliamentary Question on 18 September 2012 that in August 2012 approximately 200,000 homes in the country were still using the analogue television network for their primary television reception.  Since then, two further research exercises have taken place.  On 2 October I announced encouraging results from a Millward Brown Lansdowne tracking study on the digital television switchover which was carried out between 10 September and 20 September.  This research showed that between mid-August and mid-September some 50,000 viewers who were reliant on analogue television network made the switch to digital television, leaving approximately 150,000 still to make the switch.  Awareness of the digital switchover has increased by 1% to 94%, with awareness among users who are reliant on analogue - the main target group - even higher at 97%.  Awareness that it is happening this month is at 92%, an increase of 10%.<\/p><p><br \/>  I decided further research was needed to take into account the recent national digital switchover week, which ran from 17 September to 23 September.

It is assisting people to make the switch to digital.  This comprehensive campaign includes advertising on television and local radio stations; an analogue marker to act as a constant reminder to everyone using the analogue service to switch to digital; a dedicated website, <i>www.goingdigital.ie<\/i>; research; a national telephone helpline; and an information booklet delivered to every household in the country by final week in July.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100032#GG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1349964300,"counter":345,"content":"<p>Additional information not given on the floor of the House.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1349964300,"counter":346,"content":"<p>Furthermore, feedback from the national digital switchover outreach programme, which I established earlier this year, is positive; people know what is taking place but they are inclined to leave switching over until close to the switch-off date.

As I noted when I addressed the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland annual conference earlier this year, \"Local radio gives a voice and enhances social dialogue for people of all ages - it provides a forum for local communities; it enhances a local community; its gives confidence to people and indeed is an expression of the community in which the station is broadcast\".<\/p><p>  However, it should be borne in mind that these stations were founded as commercial operations, with the profit motive as their primary objective.  Station owners sought and accepted licences on clear terms, terms which included a limited amount of public-service type content.  Moreover, in many cases, their success in the licence application process was assisted by the voluntary commitments they gave in regard to the provision of public-service type content, over and above that required by the relevant legislation.  The licences were accepted in the knowledge that public funding was not available for small broadcasters.  The fact that some of these stations are now undergoing an understandable degree of financial stress does not mean that the State should immediately step in and provide funding.  They remain commercial enterprises.<\/p><p>  Moreover, it should also be noted that their very popularity in the communities they serve is, in many cases, as a result of the local news content and current affairs type programming that they provide and which, in turn, gives them a strong advertising presence and thus earning potential.

While it is true that neither the Altmark principles nor the general state-aid rules prohibit the State funding of services of a general economic  interest, it is categorically not possible for the State to simply decide to fund a set of incumbent licence holders during a licence period.  Such a move, quite apart from the reaction of the European authorities, would expose the State to the risk of prosecution from other operators who may have considered applying for a licence were the revenue stream available.  In order for funds to be dispersed in the manner suggested, an entirely new scheme would therefore have to be constructed involving primary legislation and a new licensing round whereby revised licences would be offered to the market.

The plan commits to high-speed broadband availability across the country and specifies that 70 to 100 Mbps will be available from commercial market operators to more than half of the population by 2015.  At least 40 Mbps, and in many cases faster speeds, will be available to at least a further 20% of the population - and potentially as much as 35% - during the lifetime of the Government.  Finally, a minimum of 30 Mbps will be available to every remaining home and business in the country, also during the lifetime of the Government.  During the preparation of the national broadband plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expected to provide 70 to 100 Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  The precise areas to be provided with those services will be determined by the commercial market operators.<\/p><p>  One of the first steps in delivering on the 30 Mbps and 40 Mbps commitments will be the completion of a formal national mapping exercise to determine the exact position with regard to commercial service providers\u2019 existing and planned broadband services throughout the country.  Preparatory work has commenced within my Department to expedite this task.  The mapping exercise will identify the areas of the country in which there is a market failure in the provision of high-speed broadband services.  It will also identify where the market is expected to succeed in the delivery of high-speed broadband over the coming years.  This process is expected to take several months to complete and until then, the precise areas of the country which will require State intervention will not be known.  It is likely, however, that rural areas, including those covered by the national broadband scheme, NBS, will require intervention.  Roll-out will be targeted to commence in 2014, when the mapping, State aids and procurement processes are complete and when the current contract for the National Broadband Scheme expires.<\/p><p>  I reiterate that the Government remains committed to the delivery of the speeds to which I referred, in order to ensure that all parts of Ireland, including rural or remote parts of the country, have access to modern high-speed broadband services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100034#JJ00100","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1349965500,"counter":370,"content":"<p>My party supports the target of 70 to 100 Mbps for at least 50% of the population, as contained in the plan.

Broadband penetration in many rural areas is less than 20%.  There is no specific detail as to how the Government might address this in the plan.  There is no date for the delivery of the national minimum speed but rather a vague promise that it will be achieved during the lifetime of the Government.  I expect and assume that is because, as mentioned within the plan, the indicative cost to the State for its roll-out is \u20ac175 million over the period of the plan.  The Minister has stated that his Department has commenced dialogue with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and NewERA with a view to identifying funding sources.  Has the Minister any update on this dialogue?  How is it progressing, when is it likely to conclude and at what point will the Minister be in a position to inform the House of the availability of this funding?

Extraordinary developments are under way at present and I have no doubt that the private telecommunications companies will furnish more than 50% of the population with industrial-strength broadband by 2015, which is ahead of the target set by the Commissioner in Europe.  I do not see any point in my replicating that or seeking to spend State money where the telecommunications companies are capable of providing the service.<\/p><p>  Deputy Cowen will say, entirely fairly, that the service will generally be provided in the more populous areas - that is, in largely urban areas - and he is right about that.  It is for that reason that we opted for the three-tier architecture in the plan.  It is hard to say, until the mapping exercise is done, what is the size of the bottom tier but the commitment is that those in that tier will have broadband services of not less than 30 Mbps.  At the moment, most of those people would not even have 2 Mbps.  The design and procurement process will stipulate that the successful bidders to do the job for the State will have to comply with that prospectus.<\/p><p>  We will be ahead of the general European digital agenda targets.  The expectation for the lifetime of the Government is 2016 and it is within that timeframe that the commitment to provide the second tier with speeds of 40 Mbps or better and the bottom tier with speeds of 30 Mbps or better lies.  That will encroach on the NBS areas, although it is not possible to say where exactly until the mapping exercise is done.  The previous Government's contract on the NBS runs until August 2014.  In any event, the State aids procurement process is painfully slow.  It is not something that is designed to penalise Ireland in particular but is the same across all member states.  It is a painfully slow process but one we must go through because the net point about the plan is that it acknowledges that State intervention is necessary where the private sector cannot provide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100034#JJ00300","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1349965500,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I welcome the national broadband plan and the ambitious targets therein but my concern is for areas that lie in the bottom tier.

Many residents of those villages work in Dublin and further afield but would have the option of working from home if they had high-speed broadband access.

In the case of second level schools, we started to install high speed broadband in parts of the country where the service was weakest so that every second level school in 13 counties in the west of Ireland will be connected by the middle of this month.

This action plan was a requirement under the energy services directive and further updates will be required in 2014 and 2017.   The second action plan, which I will be bringing to Government shortly, provides a progress report on delivery of the national energy savings targets implemented under current EU requirements as well as energy efficiency policy priorities between now and 2020.  The action plan will show that Ireland is on track to deliver the 20% energy saving target.<\/p><p><br \/>  My Department has participated in a number of conferences organised by the sustainable energy for the rural village environment project, including most recently last Friday, 5 October, and is fully aware of the research undertaken to date.<\/p><p><br \/>  The new energy efficiency directive, which will supersede the existing energy services directive, has been adopted by the Council of Ministers and European Parliament.  It will translate elements of the European efficiency plan into binding measures on member states, including an annual rate of renovation for central government buildings of 3%; an inventory of central government buildings with a total useful floor area over certain thresholds; an obligation on public bodies to procure products, services and buildings with high energy efficient performance; obligations on industry relating to energy audits and energy management systems; and a common framework for national energy savings obligation schemes equivalent to annual energy savings of 1.5% of energy sales.  The new directive will be published in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union<\/i> in November and will enter into force in 2014.  Transposition of the directive will be progressed over the coming months.<\/p><p><br \/>  The 3% renovation target for central government buildings represents a challenge for Departments and the Office of Public Works but the energy savings will greatly outweigh the costs of renovation.  We will work closely with the OPW over the coming months to prepare a plan for the realisation of this target.  In respect of the proposed 1.5% obligation scheme in article 7, which is at the heart of the new directive, it is clear this will be a difficult target to deliver.  Our intention is to work constructively over the next 12 months with energy suppliers already engaged in delivering energy saving targets to construct a suitable obligation scheme.<\/p><p><br \/>  Adequate private and public funding is critical to delivering on the objectives, particularly in article 5.  In this context measures to address Government debt and accounting barriers are required if we are to realise the potential for energy performance contracting in the public sector.

Hopefully, we can design a product that will both enhance participation and at the same time create jobs in the retrofit process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100036#LL00700","speaker":"947"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Broadcasting Legislation","time":1349966700,"counter":388,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100036#LL00750"},{"type":"question","time":1349966700,"counter":389,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[43686\/12]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100036#LL00800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"if he will introduce amending legislation to the Broadcasting Act insofar as it relates to balance on broadcasting during referendum campaigns; his views on whether he believes that balance in broadcasting should be more reflective of the balance of opinion generally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"970","askee":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1349966700,"counter":390,"content":"<p>The Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the establishment of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, as the independent regulator responsible for the oversight of compliance in relation to broadcast content in the State.  One of the objectives of the authority, set out in section 25(<i>b<\/i>), is to ensure &#8220;that the democratic values enshrined in the Constitution, especially those relating to rightful liberty of expression, are upheld,&#8221;.<\/p><p><br \/>  Section 39 of the 2009 Act provides for the duties of broadcasters and includes, for example, duties relating to objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs.  In the discharge of its functions, the BAI is required, under section 42, to draw up broadcasting codes on the standards and practice to be observed by broadcasters and for compliance matters.<\/p><p><br \/>  In the context of these statutory provisions, the BAI has developed a broadcasting code on referenda and election coverage, which was published in September last year.  This code sets out the rules that Irish broadcasters must comply with when covering any election, or referendum held in the State.  The aim of the code is to ensure that broadcasters&#8217; coverage of all elections and referenda is fair, objective and impartial.  Coverage should be undertaken without any expression of a broadcaster&#8217;s own views on an election or referendum or on election parties or candidates.  The code also contains specific provisions that relate to party political broadcasts and moratoria on coverage of referenda and-or elections.  It also restates the prohibition on broadcasters airing political advertising.<\/p><p><br \/>  In view of the forthcoming referendum, the BAI has recently taken the opportunity to remind broadcasters of their obligations.  Broadcasters must ensure, for example, that coverage of the referendum is fair and equitable to all interests.  The BAI has also highlighted the need for broadcasters to put in place transparent mechanisms for ensuring that coverage in the run-up to the referendum and on the day that citizens cast their vote is fair, objective and impartial.  It is incumbent upon the BAI and all broadcasters in the State, to ensure that they adhere to the code on referenda and election coverage, as well as to the spirit and letter of the relevant judicial rulings in this area.  I have no plans to amend the existing legislation in the area as suggested by the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100036#LL00900","answer":true,"speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1349967300,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I do not believe the original question sought the Minister's opinion on whether he would amend the legislation to cater for the forthcoming referendum.  It was tabled because it would be interesting to get the views of the Minister who is responsible for this area on the legislation as it stands.  We are facing into a campaign on a referendum to enshrine children's rights in the Constitution.  My party is in favour of it, as are the Minister's party, Fine Gael, and Sinn F\u00e9in.  It seems there is an overwhelming consensus in favour of the proposed amendment.  It is almost as if professional contrarians are the only people who intend to vote \"No\".  Is the Minister concerned that the need for balance might lead to minimal media coverage of the referendum campaign?  Does he consider it possible that broadcasters might decide to limit their coverage of it, rather than providing a platform for certain people?  Does he agree that the broadcasting balance rules mean that some people see the campaign for a \"No\" vote as a media opportunity?  When elected representatives participate in referendum debates, everyone knows their agenda and their credentials.  If unelected people suddenly emerge as part of the \"No\" campaign, they might not be obliged to declare their interests.  I am looking for the Minister's perspective on the legislation as it stands, especially considering the situation we find ourselves in now.  Given that the vast majority of Deputies support the proposed amendment to the Constitution, does the Minister consider that the media will limit its coverage of the campaign in order to comply with the Act as it stands?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100037#MM00100","speaker":"1101"},{"type":"speech","time":1349967300,"counter":392,"content":"<p>I have heard the fear expressed that the children's referendum will not get the ventilation, scrutiny, debate and promotion it deserves because the apparent support of everybody in this House for the proposed amendment will make it difficult for broadcasters to implement the 50-50 rule as they have traditionally done.

If the overwhelming majority of the people, as demonstrated by their representation among the membership of this House, are in favour of a particular amendment, I agree that it seems difficult to know how the 50% on the other side can be comprised.  I have seen legal commentary to the effect that this is a self-imposed limitation on the part of the broadcasters, given that the judgment does not say there should be 50-50 coverage.  I suppose that in interpreting it that way, the broadcasters erred on the side of impartiality and wished to be seen to be fair.  In one of the legal commentaries I read, I noted Dr. Gavin Barrett's thoughts on Deputy Cowen's point about the circumstances that can be created:<blockquote>In practice, the '50-50' rule creates a perverse political incentive to oppose Constitutional amendments on European treaties.  A politician who supports such an amendment will normally find him- or herself occupying a crowded field of experienced politicians jostling for the maximum of 50% of the airtime guaranteed to the 'yes' side.  A politician who opposes the amendment occupies a much less crowded space populated by much less experienced political actors.  For the 'no' side, the 50% operates more as a minimum guarantee.<\/blockquote>He went on to say that political parties or politicians could engage in grand-standing by opposing a proposed constitutional amendment, regardless of whether they were convinced of the merits of their opposition, in order to avail of the 50% of coverage available to that side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100037#MM00400","speaker":"947"},{"type":"speech","time":1349967300,"counter":395,"content":"<p>We have used up the time allotted for Question Time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100037#MM00500","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"speech","time":1349967300,"counter":396,"content":"<p>Does that mean we will not reach my Question No. 9?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100037#MM00600","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1349967300,"counter":397,"content":"<p>The time limit for the day's debate has expired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2012101100037#MM00700","speaker":"1027"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1349967300,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Written Answers follow Adjournment.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1349967300,"counter":399,"content":"<p>The D\u00e1il adjourned at 5.45 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 16 October 2012.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
