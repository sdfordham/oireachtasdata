In keeping with normal procedures this will be formalised in a series of Statutory Instruments.  A necessary first step in preparation for these commencements is the appointment of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority after which the Authority will appoint its own Chief Executive.  I can confirm that nominations to the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority have been received from the relevant nominating bodies as set out in the Legal Services Regulation Act.  The appointment by Government of the relevant nominees under the various criteria set out in the Act will then be subject to approval by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Government will appoint one of the lay members of the Authority to be Chairperson.  At the same time, preparations are also being made in support of the public recruitment, by the new Regulatory Authority, of its Chief Executive whose terms and functions are similarly set out in the 2015 Act.  A start-up support team is being established and a suitable premises is being identified from which the new Authority can commence its operations. <\/p>  <p>  These are the initial steps that will enable the members and Chief Executive of the new Regulatory Authority to spear-head the coming into operation of the new legal services regulatory regime.  This stage will also include the phased commencement, under the appropriate Statutory Instruments, of the Parts of the Act such as those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the Roll of Practising Barristers and Pre-Action Protocols.  Under section 7 of the 2015 Act, I will also, by order, appoint a day to be the establishment day for the purposes of the Act.<\/p>  <p>  Following establishment of the Authority and appointment of a Chief Executive the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced.  The managed commencement of these functions is planned for the Autumn in order to allow adequate time and preparation to ensure their effectiveness and success as crucial components of the new regulatory framework.  It should be noted that, under the relevant transitional provisions contained in the 2015 Act, complaints already made to the Law Society under the Solicitors Acts will be brought to completion under that framework and existing law.<\/p>  <p>  In support of the planned and managed commencement of the relevant Parts of the 2015 Act proposed, as I have outlined, between now and the end of this year, an allocation of &euro;1 million has been made under the Justice Vote for 2016 as set-up support for the new Regulatory Authority.  This will be provided on a recoupable basis.  As an independent corporate body under statute the new Authority will have the power to manage the conduct of its affairs and its finances.  The annual running cost of the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority, including the new complaints regime and Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal which will deal with both solicitors and barristers, is estimated at a figure of &euro;4.5 million.  Once in operation, the new regulatory regime will be self-funding by means of a levy on the regulated legal professions under the terms set out in the 2015 Act.<\/p>  <p>  As far as any lobbying may be concerned, there is broad public interest being expressed in general correspondence with my Department in support of the early implementation of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 and its package of structural reforms.  This has been conveyed positively with the emphasis to date being on the roll-out of the new legal costs transparency measures, the coming into operation of the new public complaints framework and the commencement of the process for the introduction of pre-action protocols in medical negligence cases.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to protected disclosure, I very much share the concern of the Deputy that the new legal services regulatory regime be bolstered by robust protected disclosure safeguards.  The Deputy will be aware that the legal services sector-specific measures on protected disclosure, which were in the original Legal Services Regulation Bill as published in 2011, were overtaken by the enactment of the Protected Disclosures Act in 2014, which now provides a comprehensive suite of employment and other protections to whistle-blowers who are penalised by their employer or suffer a detriment from a third party on account of raising concerns regarding possible wrongdoing in their workplace.

These include an examinership process, appointment of a receiver and liquidation in those cases in which a company is beyond rescue. The Act includes detailed provisions which regulate the appointment and the powers of examiners, receivers and liquidators respectively.

The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 (Section 108) Regulations 2009 - S.I. No. 655 of 2010 - provides that the rate of commission may not exceed five per cent of the gross amount of any money received. This applies in particular in the case of housing loan mortgages.

Key to achieving this goal is the commitment in the Programme for Government, &quot;A Programme for a Partnership Government&quot; to continue the ongoing accelerated Garda recruitment programme with a view to increasing Garda numbers to 15,000.  Taking account of projected retirements, the current rate of recruitment will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark this year.

The maximum \"set-aside\" is &euro;63,500 or the remaining value of the pension funds, after taking the tax-free retirement lump sum, if less than &euro;63,500.

These sections are replacements for the existing general anti-avoidance rule contained in sections 811 and 811A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The new provisions reformed and simplified the arrangements Revenue have to follow in order to challenge a transaction as a tax avoidance transaction. The general principles as to what constituted a tax avoidance transaction remain, broadly, the same under both sets of provisions. <\/p><p>Sections 811C and 811D apply to transactions commenced after 23 October 2014. The provisions of sections 811 and 811A continue to apply to transactions commenced before that date.<\/p><p>At this stage, the provisions of sections 811C and 811D have not been applied by Revenue. The reason for this is that tax returns based on avoidance transactions covered by the new provisions will only start to be filed on or after 31 October 2016. There is, theoretically, a very small possibility of a transaction started and finished in the period 23 October 2014 to 31 December 2014 being reflected in a tax return filed on or after 31 October 2015 but the likelihood of this is small.<\/p><p>In any event, the filing of a tax return that reflects an underlying tax avoidance transaction (the tax avoidance transaction itself is not described in the return) is only the start of a process of challenging such a transaction. Once an underlying transaction is identified, it must be thoroughly investigated and all relevant facts (commercial, legal and contractual) relating to the transaction established. Once these facts are established the transaction in its entirety needs to be analysed to establish the precise tax provisions that are being abused or misused. Only at this stage, a process which can take some time, would Revenue be in a position to challenge the transactions under the new rules by issuing tax avoidance assessments under section 811C.<\/p><p>While tax and interest must be paid once a transaction is found to be a tax avoidance transaction under the general anti-avoidance rule, civil tax penalties, as such, do not apply. Instead, a tax avoidance surcharge of 30 per cent of the tax avoided applies in avoidance cases. This surcharge may be reduced if a taxpayer agrees a settlement at an early stage of the process. Tax, interest and the tax avoidance surcharge applies under both the new and old anti-avoidance provisions, but it should be noted that in the case of transactions commenced before February 2006 only the tax avoided is payable where a transaction is found to be a tax avoidance transaction.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that there are no criminal tax offences involving tax avoidance that can be subject to criminal prosecutions.<\/p><p>It should be noted that 452 cases under the general anti-avoidance legislation covering a potential of &euro;168 million in tax are being actively managed currently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400063#WRE02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motor Insurance","counter":290,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400063#WRE02950"},{"type":"question","counter":291,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[15583\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400063#WRE03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the extent to which motor insurance companies use telematics in determining premiums; if his review of the cost of insurance is examing how telematics could influence prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":292,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[15738\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400063#WRE03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is aware of and his plans to examine issues causing difficulties for returning emigrants in accessing car insurance, including for commercial purposes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":293,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165 and 169 together.<\/p><p>As\u00a0Minister for Finance, I am\u00a0responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation\u00a0but\u00a0am\u00a0prohibited from\u00a0interfering in the provision or pricing of insurance products.\u00a0The EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing, or terms and conditions of an insurance product. \u00a0<\/p><p>The provision of insurance cover and\u00a0the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and\u00a0is based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept\u00a0and\u00a0adequate provisioning to meet those risks.\u00a0 These are considered\u00a0by insurance companies on a case by case basis. \u00a0Variations in the costs and risks of providing motor insurance cover can vary between different countries.\u00a0 <\/p><p>With regard to the situation of returning immigrants, Insurance Ireland, which represents the insurance industry in Ireland, has informed me that, in general terms,\u00a0where there has been no motor insurance in an individual's name and there is a gap of cover of two years or more since their last insurance, the no claims\u00a0discount is deemed invalid.

That Act also increased the maximum \"set-aside\" amount required to be placed in an AMRF from &euro;63,500 to an amount equivalent to 10 times the State Pension (Contributory) which at that time would have amounted to &euro;118,900. \u00a0In Finance Act 2013, I decided to rescind those increases and to return the pension income requirement and the \"set-aside\" requirement to their original levels (&euro;12,700 and &euro;63,500, respectively). Finance Act 2013 also included provisions to ensure that individuals impacted by the higher limits introduced by Finance Act 2011 were not disadvantaged.<\/p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2014, I introduced changes to allow owners of AMRFs to draw-down up to 4% of the value of the assets in such funds on one occasion in each year instead of the facility to draw-down the accrued income and gains of such funds, as had applied prior to the changes. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension \"nest-egg\" to provide for the latter years of his\/her retirement. Up to Finance Act 2014, the capital invested in an AMRF could not be accessed until the AMRF owner reached age 75 (or met the guaranteed pension income requirement before then) at which point the AMRF becomes an ARF with unrestricted access to the funds, subject to taxation. While the capital sum in an AMRF could not be accessed, as set out, any income, profits or gains accrued from the investment of the capital could, up to the Finance Act 2014 changes, be withdrawn by the AMRF owner, subject to tax at the marginal rate. <\/p>  <p>  Under the previous access arrangements for AMRFs, the extent of any income, profit or gains would depend on the performance of the investment options taken and could, therefore, be highly volatile with the possibility of little or no gains accruing in certain years. In addition, the scale of the capital allowed for in an AMRF, at &euro;63,500, would not always permit for investment returns of any significant scale to be made using a prudent investment policy. <\/p>  <p>  I decided to change the arrangements for AMRFs so as to allow AMRF owners voluntary, tax-liable access to a maximum of 4% of their AMRF assets each year up to the point at which the AMRF becomes an ARF. This change provides AMRF owners with access to a definitive and certain level of income from their AMRF rather than the uncertain level of income which access to the accrued income, profits and gains in the AMRF provided. <\/p>  <p>  The change allowing access to a specified percentage of the capital in an AMRF is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to provide a more certain form of supplementary income prior to reaching age 75. This facility also ensures that an individual will have some remaining funds in the AMRF at age 75 to provide for their remaining years, assuming the individual has not purchased a pension annuity in the meantime.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals whose AMRF represents a less significant part of their retirement funds and whose circumstances would allow for greater investment risk and, therefore, potentially greater investment returns will be limited to the 4% level of asset draw down.

The Charter is an initiative of the Department of Education and Skills, the then Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, working in association with the Arts Council.  I am delighted to report progress on the Charter objectives as follows. <\/p>  <p>  A Charter Implementation group under the chairmanship of Professor John Coolahan was appointed oversee the implementation of the Charter objectives and report on its progress.<\/p>  <p>  The Arts in Education Portal: Ireland's first Arts in Education Portal, the key national digital resource for arts in education in Ireland, was launched in May 2015.  Since its launch up to the end of March, there have been 18,145 visitors (per session) with 43,295 page views, an average of nearly 4,000 page views per month.  A celebration and demonstration of the success of the Portal formed part of the National Arts in Education Day, held at The Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA) on 23rd April 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Teacher &ndash; Artist Partnership as a model for Continuing Professional Development (CPD) initiative:  A major new development is the more focused attention to helping artists and teachers to develop together their understanding, expertise and creative pitch for arts in education work for children at different age levels.  A significant initiative in this regard was the initiation, in 2014, by the Charter Group of a pioneering programme of joint teacher - artist collaboration in continuing professional development.  The scheme, \"Exploring Teacher Artist Partnership as a Model of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for Supporting and Enhancing Arts Education\" commenced in the summer of 2014 will be launched shortly. It is intended that each of the 21 Education Centres will have the capacity to implement this model locally and regionally into the future through strategic planning involving collaboration and co-operation with the various Local Authority Arts Offices, art organisations, educational institutions and school communities.<\/p>  <p>  Artists in Residencies in Higher Education Institutions: Significant developments regarding arts in education for initial teacher education have also been taking place.  Higher education institutions, particularly colleges of education, have been extending their offerings of arts in education courses and experience for student teachers.  The provision of a set of 'artists in residency' bursaries by the Arts Council, for such institutions has been a major boost to this work.<\/p>  <p>  Artists-Schools Guidelines: The Artists-Schools Guidelines, were originally published in 2006.  A number of changes have occurred in the arts in education landscape in Ireland since the Guidelines were first published.  A significant change arising from the Charter is the launch of a national digital resource for the arts in education: www.artsineducation.ie.  Given this changing landscape, the Arts Council, on behalf of the Implementation Group of the Arts in Education Charter, is currently reviewing the Artists-Schools Guidelines to examine whether and how they should be updated to continue to act as a useful resource.<\/p>  <p>  Nationwide Mapping of Arts Provision, Relevant to Education: Planning is underway to incorporate a mapping of organisations, events, artists and locations at regional and local level throughout the country, which could be drawn upon for arts-in-education purposes.  This will be incorporated in the Arts-In-Education Portal on an incremental basis.  This could be a major resource for schools, and also help to highlight areas of limited or poor provision, with a view to its remediation. <\/p>  <p>  ARIS &ndash; Arts Rich Schools: The Arts in Education Charter charges the Arts Council, in co-operation with the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht, and the Department of Education and Skills, with the promotion of Arts Rich Schools (ARIS).  According to the Charter &ndash; \"ARIS will incentivise and recognise those schools (primary and post-primary) which in a range of ways make the arts a key part of school life and place the arts centrally within the life of the school community affecting pupils primarily but also teachers, parents, other staff and community.\" A working group has been established and is assisting with the development of Ar&iacute;s.  The working group is working to develop a feasible implementation plan for a first phase of Arts over three years (2017-2019).<\/p>  <p>  Research in Arts in Education: The Arts in Education Charter refers to the need for access to research that builds on existing good practice and explores new models of arts and school practice to create a source of knowledge and experience for policy makers and practitioners to draw on.  The Implementation Group has had communications with the Higher Education Authority, higher education institutions and associated bodies on how best a repository of such research can be established as an on-going source of such provision.  Discussions are still underway with the aim that such a National Digital Research Repository for Arts in Education would be established over the next 18 months. <\/p>  <p>  Music Generation: The Music Generation initiative is co-ordinated and managed by Music Generation Ltd. through its National Development Office.  Between 2010 and 2015, 11 Music Generation Music Education Partnerships (MEPs) were established as part of Phase 1 of the initiative, with the aim to provide non-mainstream vocal and instrumental music tuition for young people. In 2015, Music Generation Ltd. announced Phase 2 of the initiative during which up to 9 additional new MEPs will be established over the period from 2016 up to 2020.50% of the initial funding for Phase 1 of this initiative came from philanthropic sources and the remaining 50% funding was from MEPs.  After 3 years, the Exchequer took up 50% funding as the philanthropic funding were phased out. Phase 2 will similarly funded.<\/p>  <p>  Non-mainstream Music Education Bursary Scheme 2016: The Department of Education and Skills also established the new Non-mainstream Music Education Bursary Scheme in February 2016 worth &euro;50,000.  The Purpose of the scheme is to provide support by way a cash grant, to established, smaller-scale, non-mainstream music education\/community music initiatives with limited or no access to other forms of public funding.<\/p>  <p>  Local Arts Education Partnership (LAEPs): An objective of the Arts in Education Charter which will make a major contribution to rooting arts in education at local and regional level as normative provision, is the Local Arts Education Partnerships (LAEPs).  The impact of co-operative efforts by the statutory agencies, the local authorities and the ETBs, in conjunction with the regional Teacher Education Centres and other agencies, have potential to re-shape the landscape of arts in education provision in Ireland to the great benefit of young people throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  School Policies: The Charter envisages that schools, in their school policies and plans, shall incorporate arts in education opportunities as an important aspect of enriching the curriculum and the wider life of the school.  Schools will be assisted by my Department in this aspect of their school planning and self-evaluation.  Making provision for arts in education practice will also be reflected in the design and equipping of school buildings.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has also established reciprocal partnership with the Arts Council in the promotion of the arts in schools, as set out in the Charter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400065#WRG02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport Administration","counter":404,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400065#WRG03000"},{"type":"question","counter":405,"qnumday":205,"qnumall":"[15740\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400065#WRG03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if\u00a0paragraph 11.5 of the 1975\u00a0agreed accounting arrangements for school transport means that either he or Bus &Eacute;ireann can terminate the agreement on 12 months' notice, or earlier by mutual consent, and that he can vary the agreement by mutual consent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":406,"content":"<p>Under section 11.5 of the Summary of Accounting Arrangements relating to the Transport Scheme for Primary and Post-Primary School Children dated 1 January 1975, it is stated that \"the basic charging arrangements for schools transport to continue in force subject to the right of either party to terminate them by giving not less than 12 months notice in writing to this effect.

All discharges to the aquatic environment from sewerage systems owned, managed and operated by Irish Water require a waste water discharge licence or certificate of authorisation from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the authorisation process provides for the EPA to place stringent conditions on the operation of such discharges to ensure that potential effects on the receiving water bodies are strictly limited and controlled.<\/p><p>The EPA is a key statutory body for investigating complaints of pollution and for the enforcement, both directly and through oversight of local authorities, of environmental legislation in Ireland, including compliance in relation to licensed urban waste water discharges.  Details of all prosecutions taken by the EPA for pollution incidents and details of its enforcement activities are published on the EPA&rsquo;s website ().<\/p><p>Referring to the specific issue at Doldrum Bay, I understand that Irish Water has carried out investigative works in order to develop an effective solution to the untreated sewage discharge there.  An initial survey was completed in late 2015 and an options report is now under consideration by Irish Water.  Any long-term solution to the problem is likely to take some years to put in place between design, planning and construction.  The EPA has accordingly asked Irish Water to set out potential measures to be put in place in the interim to address any public health issues arising.<\/p><p>The EPA&rsquo;s Bathing Water Report for 2015 identifies several bathing waters adjacent to urban areas, particularly those in and around Dublin Bay, as being prone to episodic pollution events and being of less than &lsquo;Good&rsquo; water quality status.  These pollution events are generally associated with overflows from pumping stations or storm outfalls as a result of sewer network blockages or following heavy rainfall.  The EPA report highlights the remedial works planned by Irish Water in relation to Loughshinny and Rush and significant infrastructural investment will be required to reduce the likelihood of recurrence of pollution events in these urban areas.<\/p><p>The imposition of bathing prohibitions by local authorities in the event of discharges or following intense localised rainfall is done with regard to public health on a precautionary principle.  All such incidents are reported to the EPA&rsquo;s wastewater enforcement system and are publicised on the SPLASH website at which is the national bathing water information website for identified bathing waters around Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400066#WRH02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management Regulations","counter":478,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400066#WRH02750"},{"type":"question","counter":479,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[15319\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400066#WRH02800","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he is willing to annul statutory instrument no. 24 of 2016 and the recent amendment made to it regarding the pay-by-weight scheme for refuse to allow the new relevant joint Oireachtas committee on the environment to examine the whole issue in detail and its implications for the cost of disposal of refuse in rural communities where there is only one service provider; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":480,"content":"<p>Under the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2007, as amended, there has been a requirement since 1 July 2015 for collectors to weigh household waste collected at kerbside, using approved weighing instruments and to make this information available to the householder.

A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented in line with Government policy.  The introduction of pay-by-weight charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure.<\/p><p>The legislation requires that from 1 July 2016 , the collector will charge for each kilogramme of waste collected.  The Government has set a <i>minimum<\/i>mandatory fee per kilogramme for the different types of household waste: 11c for black bin (residual waste) and 6c for brown bin (food\/organic waste), while a zero cent <i>minimum<\/i>fee per kilogramme may be set for green bins (recyclate).  The per kilogram minimum charge was designed to cover the minimum cost of treating the waste collected after it has been deposited by the collector at their depot or a waste transfer station to its final treatment, whether that be at a landfill, incinerator or other treatment method.  This helps ensure that the polluter pays principle is applied in the pricing structure and that the collector has charged at least enough to cover the cost of treating the waste, thus helping to ensure it will be treated properly.  A service fee may also be charged by the collector.<\/p><p>Under pay-by-weight charging for household waste collection, there is an opportunity for everybody to have more control over their waste charges and to minimise their waste costs by preventing waste and segregating waste through using the food waste and recyclable waste bins properly.  In an open market, it has been, and will continue to be, a matter for the collector to set charges at the level they consider to be competitive, in compliance with the requirements of the legislation.  Excessive pricing by individual companies will offer the opportunity for rival operators to provide their services at a cheaper price.<\/p><p>Finally, the landfill levy has proven to be a huge incentive to divert waste from landfill and to encourage the recycling and recovery of materials.  The current rate of the landfill levy is &euro;75 per tonne which encourages operators to find alternative treatment options for waste, including household waste.  The charge is not paid directly by householders and is not paid by the operator in cases where the waste is recycled or recovered (e.g. incineration with energy recovery).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400067#WRJ00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waste Management Regulations","counter":516,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400067#WRJ01000"},{"type":"question","counter":517,"qnumday":241,"qnumall":"[15530\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400067#WRJ01100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"how he will monitor the compliance of waste companies with the Metrology Act 1996, and with the technical specifications laid out in the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Amendment Regulations 2016; his plans to institute an inspection scheme; how consumers can have confidence that the reported weights of their waste are accurate; and the dispute resolution mechanisms that exist where customers believe they have been overcharged.","asker":"1259","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":518,"content":"<p>The Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2007, as amended, require that the operator makes available to the householder the weight, fee charged and registration number of the vehicle for each collection of waste.<\/p><p>The responsibility for ensuring the accuracy of the weighing instruments for the purposes of pay-by-weight charging for waste collection rests with the National Standards Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s (NSAI&rsquo;s) Legal Metrology inspectors.

A range of measures have already been taken to reduce the monthly repayments of these borrowers.<\/p><p>The\u00a0Index Linked Shared Ownership Scheme which operated from 1999 until 2002 has been revised with regard to the annual indexation of the rental equity balance and rental payments.  The amendments, which came into effect on 1 July 2015, reduce the monthly cost for these borrowers and avoid existing rental equity balances increasing for the\u00a0remaining term.  My Department has issued directions to local authorities outlining the measures and I understand that these changes are being applied to individual loan accounts.<\/p><p>In addition, the Local Authority variable mortgage interest rate was cut by 0.20% and this has helped many Share Ownership borrowers.  The rate cut brought the variable mortgage interest rate charged to local authority borrowers down to 2.55% with effect from 1 July 2015, saving borrowers around\u00a0&euro;17 per month on a typical mortgage of &euro;100,000.  A further rate cut of 0.25% will take effect from 1 July 2016, saving borrowers around\u00a0&euro; 21 per month on a typical mortgage of &euro;100,000.  The variable mortgage interest rate charged to local authority borrowers will then stand at 2. 30 %.<\/p><p>An innovative Shared Ownership Restructuring Option has been available to Shared Ownership borrowers from 1 April 2016.  This new restructuring option involves rolling-up all outstanding debt under a SO arrangement into a single annuity loan &ndash; i.e. the new restructured loan principal will comprise any outstanding annuity loan balance; rental equity balance, plus any arrears &ndash; with an all-sums-owing mortgage charge applying to the property.  The term of the annuity loan will be determined by the amount of the monthly repayment deemed to be affordable and sustainable for each SO borrower.  This restructuring option allows the borrower to have a regularised, restructured repayment solution which is more easily understood.  The restructuring option can lead to full homeownership for the borrower and as such allows for up or down sizing to suit household needs.  This arrangement may be of particular benefit to those SO borrowers who are nearing the end of their annuity term but who have not made sufficient provision for the repayment of their Rental Equity balance.  The feasibility of this new option for each SO borrower will be determined by their local authority, and may not be appropriate in all cases.  Local authorities are currently contacting SO borrowers for whom the restructuring option is deemed appropriate.  In some instances, continuing with the current SO arrangement may be the best option for both the SO borrower and the local authority, or in other cases where the outstanding debt may not be sustainable for the borrower in the long-term, the Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) option might ultimately be the appropriate solution.<\/p><p>Local authority borrowers are encouraged to engage with their local authority at the earliest opportunity if they are having difficulty making the repayments on their Shared Ownership arrangement.

A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented, in line with Government policy.  The introduction of pay-by-weight charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure.<\/p>  <p>  During the period in which local authorities were directly involved in the collection of household waste, a minority of individual Councils offered different levels of discount to selected households, based on different qualification criteria.  As local authorities exited the waste collection market, some required the private operators which took on the Councils&rsquo; customers to provide a level of discount for existing waiver customers only, and even then for a limited time.  The vast majority of such contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired.  In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price.  However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis.  In addition, a very limited number of local authorities make financial contributions towards the cost of, or pay for, the collection of waste from certain households.  Again, the qualification criteria and level of support differ from area to area.  Such expenditure means that these local authorities divert funding from other areas to support these waiver provisions.<\/p>  <p>  With the exception of one or two municipal districts, local authorities no longer collect waste and the market is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged are a matter between service provider and customer and the services offered vary across the country.  In that regard, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a national waiver scheme could not be imposed in the context of an open market for waste collection.<\/p>  <p>  However, under pay-by-weight charging for household waste collection, there is an opportunity for everybody to have more control over their waste charges and to minimise their waste costs by preventing waste and segregating waste through using the food waste and recyclable waste bins properly.  In this regard, a pay-by-weight awareness campaign, launched on 18 May 2016, is being rolled out at national, regional and local levels over the coming weeks and will give invaluable advice to householders on minimising their waste management costs under pay-by-weight charging.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400067#WRJ04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Rents","counter":550,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400067#WRJ04900"},{"type":"question","counter":551,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[15725\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400067#WRJ05000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"the status of the national rents framework and when he will commence and complete the review of differential rent schemes, as mentioned in the current programme for Government.","asker":"1215","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":552,"content":"<p>Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 200, which has not yet been commenced, provides for the introduction of a national differential rents framework that will harmonise local authority rent levels nationally, while retaining some discretion for individual authorities to set rents in their own areas.<\/p><p>While a proposed framework has been prepared, I have asked my Department to review it, including transitional arrangements, in the light of the commitment in this regard in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government<\/i>.

The details of the Scheme are currently being finalised in my Department for roll-out in the coming months.  The Scheme will be an ongoing annual commitment to secure a long term increase in the supply of affordable properties to meet the needs of those households that would struggle to make rental payments under present market conditions.<\/p><p>The pilot Scheme is expected to work on the basis of tenants paying the majority of the rental cost from their own resources, with the State helping to meet the shortfall.  It is intended that the scheme would be made available to employed households on low to moderate incomes, as well as being a possible support option for some households who qualify for social housing support.  A State policy intervention - such as a subsidy - would be applied to bridge the gap between what people can afford, and what the housing market charges.

In this context, the <i>Building Regulations (Part M Amendment) Regulations 2010<\/i>, and the accompanying <i>Technical Guidance Document M &ndash; Access and Use<\/i>(2010), which came into effect on 1 January 2012, set out the minimum statutory requirements applicable to new buildings, and to existing buildings where new works, a material alteration or a material change of use is proposed.<\/p><p>The requirements of Part M aim to ensure that regardless of age, size or disability: <\/p><p>(a)\u00a0new buildings other than dwellings (including multi-unit developments) are accessible and usable; <\/p><p>(b)\u00a0extensions to existing buildings other than dwellings are, where practicable, accessible and useable; <\/p><p>(c)\u00a0material alterations to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable; <\/p><p>(d)\u00a0certain changes of use to existing buildings other than dwellings increase the accessibility and usability of existing buildings, where practicable; and <\/p><p>(e) new dwellings are visitable.<\/p><p>Part M of the Building Regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.

While the latest iteration of Part M of the Building Regulations initially coincided with the general downturn in economic and construction activity, its positive effects on access and use in the built environment will now be seen more widely as economic recovery takes hold and construction activity begins to gather momentum and moves onto a sustainable footing.  Building Regulations, including Part M requirements, are subject to on-going review in the interests of safety and well-being of persons in the built environment and to ensure that due regard is taken of technological progress and innovation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400068#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":585,"content":"<p>Question No. 267 answered with Question No. 240.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":586,"content":"<p>Question No. 268 answered with Question No. 260.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Government Fund","counter":587,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400068#WRK01550"},{"type":"question","counter":588,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[15962\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400068#WRK01600","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will offer compensation from the local government fund in 2017, as was offered in 2016; the amount he will offer, by local authority, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1215","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":589,"content":"<p>I have not yet made any decisions concerning 2017 allocations from the Local Government Fund.

The scheme was discontinued for new applicants from 1 January 2014, with customers availing of this support prior to 1st January 2014 retaining entitlement until the closure of the scheme on 1st January 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The continued payment of mortgage interest supplement does little to assist families in improving the long term difficulty in addressing their mortgage problem.  The most appropriate way in which families experiencing mortgage difficulties can be supported is through on-going engagement with their lender to explore sustainable solutions.<\/p>  <p>  It is expected that over the remaining period existing customers will exit the scheme through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders; securing employment; or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, such as the Mortgage to Rent Scheme.  My Department is also considering referral of cases to the Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS (DMA MABS) service.  This service is focused on post-MARP cases and has been established across 26 locations assisting mortgage holders to assess the extent to which the option on offer from the lender is the best and most sustainable option, and where required, negotiating with the lender on the client&rsquo;s behalf. <\/p>  <p>  Together with the Insolvency Service of Ireland, MABS has established a national network of Court Mentors to attend relevant Courts nationwide, where repossessions hearings are listed, to provide support to distressed borrowers and direct them to the appropriate services which can provide them with the necessary help and assistance. <\/p>  <p>  It is my view that these are appropriate measures to assist people experiencing mortgage arrears on their homes and guidance has recently issued to the Department&rsquo;s staff in the Community Welfare Service to inform persons experiencing financial difficulty of these additional supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400068#WRK03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme","counter":608,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400068#WRK03050"},{"type":"question","counter":609,"qnumday":277,"qnumall":"[15685\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400068#WRK03100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"his plans to recommend the restoration of rent supplement to the Minister for Finance or to the budget oversight committee in the Houses of the Oireachtas.","asker":"1304","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":610,"qnumday":279,"qnumall":"[15687\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400068#WRK03200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"his plans to restore rent supplement in budget 2017.","asker":"1304","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":611,"qnumday":308,"qnumall":"[15694\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400068#WRK03300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the amount his Department has saved since 2014 by transferring those persons in receipt of payments under the rent supplement scheme to the housing assistance payment scheme; and the amount he will save in 2016 and 2017.","asker":"1215","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":612,"qnumday":317,"qnumall":"[15876\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400068#WRK03400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of new recipients under the rent supplement scheme, by county, in 2016 to date, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":613,"qnumday":331,"qnumall":"[15997\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400068#WRK03500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if his Department has had a sufficient input into the development of the strategy to deal with the housing crisis since 2011 to date.","asker":"1261","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":614,"qnumday":332,"qnumall":"[16017\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400068#WRK03600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the cost of increasing the limits under the rent supplement scheme by 10%.

Given the urgency of the housing crisis, this Cabinet Committee is meeting on a weekly basis which I attend.  Officials from my Department are also represented on the Homelessness Policy Implementation Team led by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government (DHPLG) to oversee the implementation of the Homelessness Action Plan.  Department officials at local level are actively engaged with relevant local authorities, Homeless Action Teams, Regional teams and other relevant stakeholders to ensure the necessary supports are provided.  Overall the response to the current extremely difficult housing situation has to be multifaceted and I am satisfied with the input that my Department is providing to the overall housing strategy.  This level of inter-agency participation ensures greater integration between the key agencies involved in the area of homelessness and related services.  <\/p><p>The strategic policy direction of the Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support scheme.  Under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to those with a long-term housing need transfers to local authorities, under the auspices of DHPLG.  HAP is currently operational in 19 local authority areas with payments being made in respect of some 10,180 tenancies.  The funding for the rent supplement scheme in 2015 and 2016 represents a transfer of funding to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for HAP scheme of over &euro;20 million in 2015 and &euro;24 million in 2016 (cumulative transfer of over &euro;64 million during the last 2 years).  Funding arrangements for 2017 will be considered having regard to the costs of rent supplement, rate of roll out of HAP and projected transfers.  Where HAP is in operation this Department will continue to provide rental support, under the rent supplement scheme, to those with a short term need, generally because of a temporary loss of employment.  <\/p><p>My Department is currently examining the rent limits in the context of the Government commitment to provide for an increase taking account of geographic variations in market rents.  It is my intention that increased rent limits will be implemented over the summer months, ahead of budget 2017, subject to agreement by Government.  Analysis shows that increasing rent limits by 10% would result in a full year cost of approximately &euro;32 million. <\/p><p>At this time of constrained supply, the Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach where rents exceed limits.  This ensures that people at risk of homelessness or loss of their tenancy are supported under the rent supplement scheme where increased rental payments are required.  Currently, over 8,540 households are supported through this flexible approach.  A county breakdown of this information is provided in the tabular statement below. <\/p><p>The Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where supply issues are particularly acute.  Following engagement with the relevant agencies this protocol was recently extended to the commuter counties of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow, and to Galway City.  The Programme for a Partnership Government has identified expanding this Protocol nationwide, and the Department will continue to work with colleagues in DHPLG, local authorities and Threshold to support this extension.  <\/p><p>Landlords are continuing to provide accommodation to persons under the rent supplement scheme with over 5,800 tenancies awarded this year.  A breakdown of this information on a county basis is also provided in the following tabular statements.<\/p><p>I would urge that any person experiencing increased rents or facing the threat of the loss of their tenancy under rent supplement to contact my Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service or the Threshold Tenancy Protection service without delay. <\/p><p><b>Tabular Statement: Rent

The long-term unemployment rate peaked at 9.5% in Q1 2012 before falling to 4.7% in Q1 2016.  At the latter date, the long-term unemployed accounted for 56.1% of all those unemployed, down from almost 65% in early 2012.  The number of long term unemployed in Q1 2016 was 100,600; this compares to 156,200 in Q1 2014.<\/p>  <p>  Although the labour market situation is improving considerably as the recovery continues, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate long-term unemployed  people find and sustain employment.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy (published January 2016). <\/p>  <p>  A range of measures were introduced under previous Pathways to Work strategies for  long-term unemployed people.  This included a structured process of engagement with long-term unemployed people being referred to the activation process (Group Engagement followed by regular one-to-one case officer contact); wage subsidies in JobsPlus; the roll-out of a payment-by-results contracted employment services in JobPath, to provide additional capacity in order to engage more systematically with long-term unemployed jobseekers; and reserved places for long-term unemployed jobseekers on a range of Further Education and Training (FET) and public employment programmes.  A core focus of Pathways to Work 2016-2020 is on consolidating and improving the quality and consistency of reforms undertaken in previous strategies, with continued prioritisation of those long-term unemployed.  I am satisfied these measures will continue to contribute to addressing long-term unemployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400068#WRK04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Unemployment Measures","counter":621,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400068#WRK04150"},{"type":"question","counter":622,"qnumday":281,"qnumall":"[16034\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400068#WRK04200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the steps he will take to address the issue of youth unemployment which now stands at 15%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":623,"content":"<p>The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity.<\/p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 15.0% (27,900) in May 2016 (as estimated by CSO), compared to 20.8% (39,100) in April 2015 and a peak of over 31.3% (70,900) in 2012.<\/p>  <p>  Although the labour market situation is improving considerably as the recovery continues, the Government recognises the importance of a continued focus on measures to facilitate the young unemployed back into work.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy (published January 2016) and the Youth Guarantee plan (published January 2014).<\/p>  <p>  As under services such as Intreo, Youthreach, VTOS, PLC programmes, and JobBridge, Ireland already had many of the recommended component parts of a Youth Guarantee as envisaged in the relevant EU Recommendation, the main approach in Ireland is to prioritise access to these existing supports for young people, who become unemployed.  The objective is to ensure that they have an opportunity for employment, further education or work experience within the recommended period of four months as per the EU council recommendation.<\/p>  <p>  The key objective is to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  In this regard there is monthly engagement with young people by case officers to assist young people to prepare, review and, if appropriate, revise personal progression plans.  As part of this process additional supports may be provided, both through reserved places on existing schemes and through youth-specific measures.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s.  Overall, over 19,100 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Pathways to Work 2016-2020 continues to prioritise these measures for the young unemployed and additionally commits to: increasing the share of workplace-based interventions for youth unemployed; ensuring that monthly engagement, at a minimum, is consistently applied and maintained; restructuring the First Steps programme; and implementing the Defence Forces Skills for Life programme.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied these measures will help to address youth unemployment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400068#WRK04250","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Conservation Grant Administration","counter":624,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400068#WRK04275"},{"type":"question","counter":625,"qnumday":282,"qnumall":"[15322\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400068#WRK04300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the cost of administering the 2015 water conservation grant; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":626,"content":"<p>The Department of Social Protection is administering the Water Conservation Grant on behalf of the Department of Environment, Community, and Local Government.

Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness, disability and caring schemes, can take longer to process. Similarly, means-tested payments can also require more detailed investigation and interaction with the applicant, thereby lengthening the decision making process.  Delays can also arise when the application form is not competed fully or supporting documentation is not provided at claim stage or where additional information has been requested from the applicant but remains outstanding.  <\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Intreo service integrates employment and income supports and provides for a streamlined and personalised service to clients in accessing job opportunities and availing of supports to enable them to get back to work at the earliest possible opportunity.  The Intreo centres also include a single integrated decision-making team that integrate and streamline the processes formerly undertaken by the different agencies now amalgamated into my Department.  Already clients are seeing the benefits of the integrated decisions process in the form of shorter decision times and in the reduced recourse to supplementary welfare payments.  In April 2016, the average number of weeks taken to process a jobseeker's allowance application was 2 and a jobseeker's benefit claim was 1.<\/p><p>Disability allowance applications were processed in an average of 10 weeks in April 2016.<\/p><p>Carer&rsquo;s allowance, which is a means-tested schemes, are experiencing delays presently, averaging 20 weeks in April 2016.  Delays are also occurring in domiciliary care allowance, where claims were processed in an average of 13 weeks in April. This primarily is due to an ongoing increase in new claim intake over the past few years to all three of these schemes and the complexity attached to processing of these applications.  In addition, there is sometimes a reluctance on the part of applicants to give full information at application stage thereby slowing down the processing of their application and in some cases necessitating a visit by an Departmental investigative officer.  <\/p><p>The social welfare appeals office has supplied details in tabular form as follows of the processing time across all scheme types in 2016 up to the end of May.<\/p><p>Reducing these waiting times is a priority for my Department.  As part of its programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented by my Department in recent years. Operational processes, procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised. <\/p><p>In addition, staffing needs are regularly reviewed, having regard to workloads and the competing demands arising, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources.  <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p><p><b>Appeal processing times by scheme 01\/01\/2016 &ndash;

One of these actions is a proposal for the Departments of Health and Social Protection to work together to pursue a &ldquo;Fit for Work Programme&rdquo; to support more people with an illness or disability to get back to work through early intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Fit for Work&rdquo; proposal is based on the findings of a pan European study, which examined the impact of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) on an individual&rsquo;s ability to work.  The Irish module of this study was progressed by a coalition of key stakeholders and was led by Arthritis Ireland.  The Irish College of General Practitioners, ICTU, IBEC and the Health and Safety Authority also contributed to the study.<\/p>  <p>  Early interventions and developing return to work practices in the case of people with musculoskeletal incapacities is consistent with my Department&rsquo;s approach to illness\/disability income support, which aims to reduce the number of people progressing to chronic disability and long-term social welfare dependency.  To this end, my Department has in 2015, issued a set of certification guidelines for GPs, which sets out defined periods of recovery for common medical conditions, including MSDs. <\/p>  <p>  The certification guidelines build on the &ldquo;Renaissance project&rdquo;, which is an initiative of my Department since 2003.  This has shown that early intervention reduced the incidence of progression from the acute simple low back pain to chronic disability in 64% of claimants.<\/p>  <p>  While specific proposals for a &ldquo;Fit for Work Programme&rdquo; require further development and examination, I would once again like to assure the Deputy that any such proposals will be in line with the body of evidence which shows that generally employment is good for one&rsquo;s mental and physical health and wellbeing and that, conversely, unemployment is damaging.  <\/p>  <p>  Current assessment procedures provide that any question in respect of eligibility to illness\/disability related schemes is decided by a deciding officer of my Department who may in arriving at a decision, seek and have regard to the opinion of a Medical Assessor.

These welfare payments through post offices are across all of the department&rsquo;s major schemes: state pension, jobseekers, one parent family payments, widow\/ers or survivors pensions, carers payments, disability payments and child benefit.<\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my department is not undertaking any measures which seek to actively influence customer choice in the manner of payment away from cash payments at the Post Office.<\/p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that for the vast majority of my department&rsquo;s schemes the department&rsquo;s customers are given the choice of what payment method they wish to receive their social welfare payment.  The vast majority of new customers choose to have payments made directly into their accounts in financial institutions which reflects a societal trend towards payment by electronic funds transfer.  For example, 83% of new Child Benefit customers and 70% of new State Pension customers chose this option in 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Many of my department&rsquo;s customers are in employment.  My department&rsquo;s focus must be on our customers and to this end my department&rsquo;s policy is to make payments to in-work customers directly to accounts rather than customers being inconvenienced by two separate payment methods.<\/p>  <p>  My department has a cohort of jobseeker customers who are classified as casual jobseekers.  These are in-work customers who can claim a jobseekers payment for 2 to 3 days per week or who work week on\/week-off.  These customers were paid by cheque each week.  Those customers were paid by cheque due to the changing nature of their work\/claiming patterns and the short turn-around time to issue payments.  It is important to note that they were not paid via post offices under the department&rsquo;s existing cash payments contract with An Post.<\/p>  <p>  My department has developed its payment capacity in respect of changing work and claiming patterns and is offering payments direct to accounts in financial institutions for casual Jobseeker customers thereby increasing customer convenience.  This is in line with wider departmental policy where the focus is on ensuring that in-work customers are paid by the most convenient method possible.<\/p>  <p>  My department has written to all of these casual jobseekers offering the option of a payment to an account.  The vast majority have responded and opted for payment to an account.<\/p>  <p>  If customers wish to continue to be paid by cheque they can make their preference known to their local social welfare office which handles their claim.<\/p>  <p>  The recent &ldquo;Kerr Report&rdquo; sets out the challenges that An Post and Postmasters face as they seek to ensure that the post office network remains relevant in the context of the inexorable shift towards electronic payments.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will support the introduction by An Post of a standard bank account through the provision of seed funding to help start the initiative.<\/p>  <p>  My department is engaging as appropriate with the Departments of Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources and Public, Expenditure and Reform in addressing the recommendations of the report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400071#WRN00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":761,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 331 and 332 answered with Question No. 277.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Work Placement Programmes","counter":762,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400071#WRN00950"},{"type":"question","counter":763,"qnumday":333,"qnumall":"[16020\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400071#WRN01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will consider extending the placement period on T&uacute;s &ndash; work placement initiative from 12 to 18 or 24 months for those who wish to continue beyond the set 12 month period; the cost of this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1309","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":772,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 335 to 337, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  International election monitoring missions play an important role in the promotion of democracy and human rights.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade administers a roster of election observers so that Ireland can be represented at an appropriate level in international election observation missions organised, in the main, by the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  The current roster was established in May 2013 for a period of five years following a review of the previous roster and a public call for applicants.<\/p>  <p>  Two assessors external to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with a knowledge of election processes and experience of public service, separately undertook the independent appraisal and scoring of the 263 eligible applications for inclusion in the new roster against the four published criteria, which reflected the broad range of skills required for election observation.  These were: experience of election observation; knowledge of human rights and\/or governance issues; language skills; and experience of challenging environments.<\/p>  <p>  Following the appraisal of all 263 eligible applications, the 200 individuals who achieved the highest scores were selected to serve on the new election observation roster.  A reserve panel of the next ten highest scoring individuals was also established, from which replacements would be drawn should any members leave the roster.  Taking account of members who have left the roster, and those who have been added from the reserve panel, the current roster complement stands at 199 and the reserve panel has been fully utilised.<\/p>  <p>  For each election observation mission, the EU or OSCE set out their specific requirements and, on the basis of the expressions of interest submitted by roster members, the Department draws up a list of nominated observers.  In selecting nominees to be put forward, the specific criteria set by the EU or OSCE, including relevant local and regional experience and language proficiency, form the principal basis for decision-making.  Issues of gender balance and length of time since serving on a mission are also taken into account.  The   EU makes the final selection of observers for EU election observation missions.<\/p>  <p>  Various factors influence the numbers of observers deployed each year.  In 2013, 72 observers were deployed, 53 in 2014, and 46 in 2015.  A total of 15 observers have been deployed to date in 2016 and a further 8 observers are expected to depart in the near future.<\/p>  <p>  The principal reason for the variation in numbers on an annual basis is the number of elections taking place in any given year where the host authorities have extended an invitation to the OSCE or EU to deploy an observation mission.  A further factor can be the postponement of planned elections.  Most recently, for instance, the planned parliamentary elections in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia were postponed.  Ireland had intended to deploy six short term observers to join a long term observer already deployed.

The promotion and protection of human rights is a key priority for Ireland and we condemn unreservedly all attacks and threats against human rights defenders and other campaigners for social justice, wherever they take place.<\/p>  <p>  Agrarian protests involving the blockading of roads have been taking place across Colombia, and three protesters were killed in clashes with the police.  On 9 June, President Santos said that his government wished to establish a dialogue with the protestors to try to resolve the issue.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department met with Colombian social campaigners in Dublin last month to discuss the recent upsurge in violence against environmental and trade union activists.  Colombia faces significant challenges in securing lasting peace and security, particularly in its remote, rural districts.  It is clear that, as the peace process between the Colombian government and the FARC guerrilla group nears its conclusion, there remain elements in Colombian society who oppose peace and who will seek to derail the agreement through violence.<\/p>  <p>  A climate of violence breeds human rights abuses, and only lasting peace can ensure the conditions necessary for the full enjoyment of human rights.  In that context, we must acknowledge the enormous progress that has been made in the peace talks between the Colombian Government and the FARC.  After over 50 years of violence, the talks are approaching a historic conclusion.  Moreover, on 30 March, the country&rsquo;s second-largest leftist guerrilla group, the ELN, announced that it would also participate in formal peace negotiations with the government.  In addition, the third major source of non-state violence, the criminal networks known as BACRIM (Bandas Criminales) which evolved from right-wing paramilitary organisations, are now the target of a major government effort to tackle organised crime and prevent such groups from destabilising the peace process.<\/p>  <p>  Human rights are at the heart of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with Colombia.  To highlight our concern at attacks and threats against human rights defenders, trade unionists and others, officials from our embassy in Mexico, which is accredited to Colombia on a non-residential basis, meet with human rights groups and government officials during their regular visits to Colombia.  In addition, officials from my Department continue to raise our concerns around human rights in Colombia at EU level.<\/p>  <p>  Through the mechanism of the EU-Colombia Human Rights Dialogue, the Union engages with the Colombian authorities in a structured manner across the full range of human rights issues, including as regards human rights defenders and trade unionists, land restitution, economic and environmental issues.  It is our firm belief that this policy of engagement, dialogue and scrutiny, which is ongoing, regular and structured, is the best way to promote human rights in Colombia.<\/p>  <p>  A significant proportion of Ireland&rsquo;s funding to Colombia is focused on supporting human rights initiatives and human rights defenders.  In recent years, this has included funding to Christian Aid, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia, and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400071#WRN03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commemorative Events","counter":801,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400071#WRN03650"},{"type":"question","counter":802,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[15577\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400071#WRN03700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has requested the British Government to permit a commemoration of the centenary of the execution of Roger Casement at Pentoville Prison, London on 3 August 2016.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":803,"content":"<p>As part of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme, State Ceremonial Events have marked the executions of the leaders of the Rising.<\/p>  <p>  Planning is underway for an event to commemorate the execution of Roger Casement on 3 August.

Ministers underlined that the stabilisation of liberated areas is of the utmost importance in Iraq.  On Syria, the necessity of continued support for UN Special Envoy De Mistura was emphasised. Ministers agreed that the regional strategy remains valid, and adopted the related Council Conclusions.<\/p><p>The HRVP briefed Ministers on the ongoing preparation of the new EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy, which she is leading.

The meeting was constructive and proved again that it is an effective framework for cooperation and dialogue with our Eastern neighbours.

My Department is therefore actively engaging with the authorities and key stakeholders in France and Brazil in order that all appropriate measures are taken to ensure that Irish citizens travelling to both Euro 2016 and the Rio Olympic Games are safe.  The primary responsibility, of course, for the security of visitors in these countries lies with local police services, and we know that French and Brazilian authorities are taking security around these major events very seriously.<\/p><p>Detailed travel advice is available on my Department&rsquo;s website &ndash; <i>www.dfa.ie<\/i>&ndash; and the Department&rsquo;s new TravelWise app which was launched on 10 June, and I would encourage all those considering travel to these or any other destinations this summer to study it carefully.<\/p><p>Our advice to Irish citizens travelling to France is that they should exercise a high degree of caution.  In view of the exceptional security situation in France following the terrorist attacks on 13 November, my Department has been developing and implementing a comprehensive action plan to ensure that our Embassy in Paris is equipped to deal with the likely increased consular demand over the coming weeks.  My Department has also been working closely with UEFA and the relevant national and local authorities in France, and with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Football Association of Ireland and travel industry representatives in Ireland on planning and preparation.<\/p><p>The Embassy has been reinforced with an additional five experienced officers redeployed from Headquarters in Dublin. Officials have been present on the ground in Paris and will be present in Bordeaux and Lille around match dates to provide advice and emergency consular assistance to Irish citizens in difficulty.<\/p><p>There is a dedicated Euro 2016 consular phone line operational 7 days a week from 10 June at 00 33 1441 76780.  Specialised consular and emergency response training has been delivered to the staff at the Embassy and additional communications and IT equipment has also been provided in order to enhance our consular capacity.<\/p><p>My Department has also prepared an information campaign targeted at travelling football fans to help them be as well-informed as possible.  I launched this campaign on April 18 highlighting the &ldquo;First Eleven&rdquo; travel tips for fans.  A dedicated microsite has been published in order to relay all of the Department&rsquo;s key information in relation to the tournament: <i>.<\/i><\/p><p>Fifty thousand printed information leaflets, providing travel advice and key emergency contact details, were distributed at the recent friendly matches in Dublin and Cork, and more have been provided to airports, ferry ports, and Irish pubs in France, as well as being available on-line and on social media.  Both the aforementioned Department website and TravelWise app will remain a valuable source of information for Irish citizens abroad, and will be an important communications tool for our Government&rsquo;s consular response in the event of any emergency abroad.<\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s current travel advice for Brazil advises Irish citizens to exercise normal precautions.  Particular risks highlighted include high crime levels, road safety issues and mosquito-borne diseases, including the Zika virus.  In contrast to Euro 2016, the number of Irish citizens expected to travel to Brazil is relatively low, based on estimates from the Olympic Council of Ireland, with whom my Department is in regular contact.  The Embassy of Ireland in Brasilia and Consulate General in S&atilde;o Paulo have been<b><\/b>actively engaging with the Brazilian authorities in relation to all aspects of planning for the tournament, including regarding policing and ensuring that visiting Irish citizens attending Rio 2016 stay safe.  A temporary Consulate will be established in Rio de Janeiro for the duration of the Olympics and Paralympics tournaments.<\/p><p>My Department remains in close and continuous contact with the HSE&rsquo;s Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on the Zika virus and additional health-related concerns.  Travel Advice in response to the Zika Virus outbreak, based on the advice of the HSE and the WHO, is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  This specifically and strongly recommends that pregnant women consider postponing their travel to Zika-affected areas.  We are closely monitoring the situation and will continue to regularly update our travel advice in this regard.<\/p><p>I encourage all citizens travelling to both France and Brazil to pay close attention to updates to the travel advice on the website and TravelWise app, check their passports are in date and arrange comprehensive travel insurance before they depart.  I would also urge all travelling fans to register their details on our Citizens&rsquo; Registration facility, also available through our website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400072#WRO01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"International Agreements","counter":823,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400072#WRO02000"},{"type":"question","counter":824,"qnumday":357,"qnumall":"[15887\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400072#WRO02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of the impact of the EU-Turkey migration deal negotiated in March 2016; the mechanisms that have been put in place to ensure the human rights of refugees returned to Turkey are protected; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":825,"content":"<p>The core intention of the Agreement which emerged from the March European Council is to break the business model of the people smugglers who are profiting from the suffering of the vulnerable.  In particular, it aims to discourage the victims of people smugglers from risking their lives and dangerous sea journeys.  The very significant decline in the number of people attempting to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to the Greek Islands since the agreement entered into force suggests that it is achieving its aims.<\/p>  <p>  The need for the agreement to comply with EU and international law was a key concern for very many EU Member States, including Ireland.  The legal advice of the EU institutions and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office was that the terms of the Agreement were not in breach of EU or International law.<\/p>  <p> The EU and Turkey have agreed that there will be no blanket returns.  Each migrant has the right to apply for international protection in Greece and to have their application assessed on an individual basis in line with international law, including with a right to appeal.  Part of this assessment process includes ascertaining whether Turkey can be considered a safe country given an irregular migrant or asylum seeker&rsquo;s individual circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Turkey has provided formal guarantees as part of the EU-Turkey Agreement that Syrian refugees returned to Turkey will be granted temporary protection upon return.  Non-Syrians in need of international protection who are returned to Turkey, will also be able to apply for and receive protection there.  The European Commission reported on 4 May that Turkey has received all those returned from Greece in accordance with the Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The EU is also committed to assisting Turkey deal with the enormous challenge of hosting some 2.7 million refugees and to improve the situation for these refugees.  To this end, the EU has established a &euro;3 billion Facility for Refugees in Turkey.

These reports are very worrying and will require a full investigation by the Turkish authorities.  While Turkey has a right to secure its border with Syria, all actions on the part of Turkey must be in line with international law.<\/p>  <p>  More broadly, the issue of human rights in Turkey has been raised by the Taoiseach at European Council and continues to form an integral part of the country&rsquo;s enlargement process, which we, along with our European partners keep under close review.

In carrying out these functions, my main focus is to ensure that the victims of the Irish Famine are respectfully and appropriately remembered.  In that context, I also seek to raise awareness of current food security issues worldwide.  I can confirm that the Committee has previously discussed the issue of a fixed date for the commemoration and is of the view that, while we aspire to organise the National Famine Commemoration on the second Sunday in May of each year and do so wherever possible, some degree of flexibility is required around this date.  This flexibility is needed to try to adapt to the demanding schedules faced by the President and An Taoiseach with a view to their leading the official representation at the annual National Famine Commemoration ceremony whenever possible and also to allow for the particular circumstances that may arise around the arrangements, including the choice of site, in any given year.<\/p>  <p>  For example, in 2015 the commemoration was held in September due to organisational matters which arose as a result of the staging of the event for the first time in Northern Ireland.  The event, held in in Newry, Co Down, proved to be a great success with significant cross-community representation.  This year, due to the number of events relating to the centenary of the Easter Rising which took place in March, April and May, it was decided that the National Famine Commemoration should take place in September.  This will allow the ceremony to receive the level of public attention and participation that it warrants as a major national commemorative event.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I am satisfied that the retention of flexibility in relation to the date of the commemoration does not detract from its key aim, which is to have a fitting national ceremony to remember and show respect for all those who died or suffered loss during the Great Famine.  In fact, this flexibility facilitates the commemoration being held in the most appropriate context each year.  In the circumstances, I have no plans to designate a fixed date for the National Famine Commemoration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400073#WRP02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":901,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400073#WRP02550"},{"type":"question","counter":902,"qnumday":383,"qnumall":"[15410\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400073#WRP02600","dept":"Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the amount of money her Department spent on purchasing copies of the Public Sector Times magazine in 2015; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Many of the rivers and low-lying lands affected by the recent flooding are within or near sites that have been designated as SACs or SPAs.  Accordingly, these sites fall within the ambit of the EU Birds and Habitats Directives, which are transposed in Irish legislation through the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 (S.I.

I would also like to clarify the process, as the premise of your question is incorrect, and have set out the factual position below for your information.<\/p><p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. Prior to deciding whether to reimburse a medicine, the HSE considers a range of statutory criteria, including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available. <\/p><p>The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) of pharmaceutical products for the HSE, and can make recommendations on reimbursement to assist the HSE in its decision-making process. The NCPE used a decision framework to systematically assess whether the drug  is cost-effective as a health intervention.<\/p><p>I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of lumacaftor\/ivacaftor (Orkambi). This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.<\/p><p>The NCPE has completed its HTA and submitted it to the HSE. The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the  manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug. The NCPE have confirmed that  all relevant costs were included in the analysis.<\/p><p>A summary of the HTA has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: <i><\/i>.<\/p><p>The HSE will now enter into negotiations with the manufacturer, to seek very significant price reductions.  The HSE will then consider the outcome of these negotiations, together with the NCPE recommendation, in making a final decision on reimbursement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400075#WRR03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":1025,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400075#WRR03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1026,"qnumday":426,"qnumall":"[15557\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400075#WRR03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 60 of 5 May 2016, the status of an application (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18th November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with my full support and the support of my Government colleague Jan O'Sullivan T.D., Minister  for Education and Skills. <\/p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8m is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school settings, as part of the rollout of the new inclusive preschools model.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited and specific cases at local level, disability services have in the past also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing additional supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such additional pre-school supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants, who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.<\/p>  <p>  Within this context and as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case he has raised.

Any manufacture, supply or sale of this product for the purposes of treating a medical condition is illegal. <\/p>  <p>  The HPRA, the competent authority for the implementation of the medicines legislation, has led a number of investigations into the alleged supply of CD Protocol in various parts of Ireland for the alleged treatment of autism.  It is pursuing a number of avenues of enquiry in what continues to be an open investigation into the manufacture, supply and sale of this product. <\/p>  <p>  During its investigations to date, the HPRA has carried out searches at a number of premises assisted, where necessary, by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and has also spoken to a number of individuals.

The overall objective of the National Drugs Strategy is to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.<\/p>  <p>  The nature and scale of drug misuse has changed in recent years, with an increased prevalence of polydrug use which is the problem use of more than one drug, including alcohol.  Polydrug use can make treating the person more difficult and often increases the complexity of the case.  It can also make the treatment of overdose more complicated.  Health Research Board figures indicate that polydrug use is a common issue among those presenting at drug and alcohol treatment services.  Between 2009 and 2013, 63% of those treated for a drug as their main problem substance also reported problem use of other substances, mainly alcohol, benzodiazepines and cannabis. Figures from the Health Research Board for recent years also indicate that the number of polydrug deaths has overtaken the number of single drug deaths.

This initiative was to support the work of the Department&rsquo;s local District Veterinary Offices in dealing with this increased level of work.  Staffing of the CMMS unit at the outset consisted of four teams of 3 Supervisory Agricultural Officers in 4 different locations with 2 District Superintendents having a supervisory role - a total of 14 staff.  While primarily staff at DVOs dealt with identification and tracing matters (among other duties), the CMMS units handled specific and targeted enquiries generally, in particular on repeat offenders and on cases that involved more than one DVO area.  The focus of the group was exclusively on cattle identification and tracing matters wherever such was required and necessary - this could have arisen on farm or at other locations. <\/p><p>For operational purposes, the staff assigned to the CMMS Unit were under the supervision of an Area Superintendent of the then Special Investigation Unit (SIU).  The CMMS unit staff were not part of the SIU which was a separate Unit. <\/p><p>In 2009 a review of the Local Office Structure within my Department was carried out in order to maximise efficiency.  This review led to several significant changes at operational level.  As the volume of discrepancies had decreased significantly and there was, following the local office review, sufficient capacity among local office staff to carry out all such work, it was decided to stand down the CMMS Unit and deploy the staff to other areas of my Department where vacancies existed.  As a result, the CMMS Unit was disbanded in 2011\/2012.  <\/p><p>In Sept 2010, my Department met with the staff side&rsquo;s representatives to discuss the redeployment of the staff that had been assigned to the CMMS unit.  At this time there were eleven technical staff remaining in the Unit.  Following the announcement of the proposed transfers all those eleven staff in the CMMS Unit, lodged similar individual complaints regarding work issues against line management under the Civil Service Grievance Procedure. <\/p><p>Mediation efforts were made on 2 occasions, in July 2012 and again in October 2014.  In the former case, the mediator withdrew from the process as he was of the view that the issues raised were not relevant to the grievance procedure.  In the latter case, the mediator made an offer, to bring closure to the issue and allow the parties to move forward.

This uses an 'ABC 123' structure to reference in the first instance the relevant Post Town, and secondly the 'Block Face' (a grouping of approximately 40 to 50 dwellings); it was, however,\u00a0 recognised at that\u00a0time that\u00a0there were advantages in introducing a postcode based on a\u00a0unique identifier.

The High Speed Broadband Map 2020, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie<\/i>shows the extent of the State Intervention area, which is the subject of procurement.

As part of the procurement process bidders will be asked to propose solutions which meet the NBP service requirements.

The Taskforce will consider what form of public engagement is appropriate and I intend to set a challenging timeline for delivery.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0provision of mobile telephony services is undertaken by telecommunications service providers operating in a fully liberalised market under licences provided by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).

The design of the network is a matter entirely for the operator concerned although operators tend to exceed their minimum coverage requirements for commercial reasons.

These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country although I understand that some temporary disruptions to service have been encountered when upgrades are taking place.

In the normal course, receivers are appointed on foot of a power contained in an instrument such as a debenture.  It is thus a matter for the lender to determine the qualifications of the receiver when making the appointment.  Section 433 of the Companies Act 2014 sets out the categories of persons who are disqualified to act as the receiver of a company e.g. an undischarged bankrupt; an employee or an officer of the company concerned or a person who was such within the period of 12 months before the date of the commencement of the receivership; and certain specified family members of an officer of the company concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Receivership is a remedy that derives from the courts of equity.  The relevant law in relation to receivership is largely made up of rules which the courts have developed by applying general contract law and equitable principles.  Under the Companies Act 2014 a receiver has specific statutory duties under section 439 which provides that: <\/p>  <p>  (i) receivers must achieve the best price reasonably obtainable at the time of sale; and <\/p>  <p>  (ii) the receiver must not sell by private contract a non-cash asset of a company to a person who is or who, within three years prior to the date of appointment of the receiver, has been, an officer of the company unless the Receiver has given 14 days&rsquo; notice of his or her intention to do so to all creditors of the company who are known to him or her or who have been intimated to him or her.  <\/p>  <p>  These statutory duties make it imperative that the receiver obtains expert legal and valuation advice in relation to the sale of property, consistent with the duty &ldquo;to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable&rdquo;.  Breach of a receiver&rsquo;s statutory duties may result in the receiver being held personally liable for any loss incurred.  Conferring statutory powers on receivers is intended to alleviate many of the problems which may arise from poorly drafted debentures.  It should be noted that receivers also have a duty to provide certain information to the Registrar of Companies and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400084#WRAA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Semi-State Bodies Data","counter":1575,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400084#WRAA02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1576,"qnumday":619,"qnumall":"[15677\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400084#WRAA02100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of chief executive officers in Semi-State companies under the aegis of her Department who are employed or who are not employed on a Hay contract.

In addition the Pathways to work Strategy 2016-2020 includes a commitment to increase access to quality and affordable childcare for parents transitioning to employment.

The additional resources provided gives the Agency greater capacity to recruit social workers and other staff and to respond to identified risk and address areas of unmet need.<\/p>  <p>  It is a positive sign that HIQA inspectors found that staff responded to the needs of children and focused on their rights and welfare.  Children were encouraged to take part in decisions on their care, had access to advocates and were helped to keep positive attachments with their families.  Children told inspectors that their lives had improved through contact with child protection social workers.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla will continue its recruitment campaign to recruit the social work and social care staff to support families and to protect vulnerable children.  The majority of HIQA findings related to standards that were deemed to require improvement.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla reports to my Department on the action plans they have put in place following inspections to deal with problems and areas needing quality improvement. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla is engaged in a programme of service reform to ensure that a consistent quality of care is available to children and families across the country.  I am confident that this process and the major recruitment campaign currently underway, will see a significant improvement in all child welfare and protection services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400084#WRAA06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Workers Recruitment","counter":1620,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400084#WRAA06500"},{"type":"question","counter":1621,"qnumday":634,"qnumall":"[15357\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016061400084#WRAA06600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the ratio of social workers to cases by county in each of the years 2013 to 2015; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1622,"content":"<p>Tusla is implementing a national caseload management system which allows management to monitor caseloads in terms of both number and complexity.

Pobal works closely with this Department in implementing these programmes and undertakes a compliance process to verify, through on-site visits, that the conditions of the various programmes are being complied with.  Pobal also carries out audits at the request of the Department. <\/p>  <p>  Following an audit of the West Clare Early Years (WCEY) Group, Pobal submitted a report to West Clare Early Years (WCEY) in November 2015.  This report identified major governance issues and the need for repayment of over-claimed childcare funding.  The Board of WCEY accepted the findings of the report and, at a meeting with Pobal on February 10th, agreed to prepare an action plan to resolve the situation.  However, the Board of WCEY subsequently took a decision on February 13th to liquidate the company and to close the childcare services under its management with immediate effect.  Neither the Department nor Pobal were consulted about the decision to liquidate. <\/p>  <p>  Since that time, Pobal and Clare County Childcare Committee have been working intensively on behalf of my Department to implement sustainable solutions that will restore childcare provision in West Clare.
