I attended a forum on rural development with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, last week and this was one of the biggest issues that arose.  It concerns the blight of derelict sites on rural towns.  Right across the country, we can see that businesses have closed and people have left houses for one reason or another.  In many cases, these buildings have been left to go to rack and ruin.  There is legislation in place, as the Derelict Sites Act has been there for a long number of years.  The theory is that owners are contacted if property is not in good stead and may be required to pay a 3% levy of the value of the property on an annual basis.  As I understand it, that money is supposed to go towards putting the property into a safe and aesthetically favourable state.<\/p> <p>This is one of the biggest bugbears for community groups involved with the Tidy Towns competition and which show pride in their own areas.  These derelict sites continue to be relevant as places will lose points in the SuperValu Tidy Towns competition on an annual basis.  These problems are highlighted almost on an annual basis in some towns but nothing seems to be done.  In my own town, I am sad to say, there are a number of such sites, and some locations are very badly affecting the town aesthetic.  The local community development group in Carrick-on-Suir has taken it upon itself to put a face on some sites by painting them to take the bad look away.  The Minister of State is probably familiar with this as he is only down the road.  The work has been fantastic.<\/p> <p>There is legislation but it does not appear to be used by local authorities.  When we ask about these sites, we get a story about the issue being with the legal department but, frankly, that is not good enough.  We need to start representing rural towns for business and tourists, particularly in areas where we are not strong from a tourism perspective.  We must make it attractive for people to come here.  In areas with strong tourism, such as Killarney, there are very few derelict sites.  Those local authorities seem to know the value of tourism and are active in ensuring that these problems are dealt with.<\/p> <p>It was brought to my attention that one of the biggest offenders in this respect are local authorities, which may own many properties because they have bought them over years.  They are allowed to do this under the legislation.  Who polices the local authority?  The private citizen would pay the 3% levy to the local authority, which is meant to use it wisely to deal with this issue.  If the local authority owns the property, who is looking after the authority?  Will the Minister of State consider this as the urban generation legislation, taking in vacant sites, goes through the Houses of the Oireachtas?  It has started in the D&aacute;il already and the Minister of State might accept an amendment in this House on the matter.  It is a very serious issue and there is no ombudsman to which the local authority must answer.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015061800002#A00700","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1434619800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Landy for raising this matter, in which I have a deep interest.  The Senator is quite correct to bring a focus on derelict sites to the Seanad, as they are a blight on our towns and villages.  Local authorities have a statutory responsibility to deal with them.  From my own knowledge, having been a member of a local authority for several years, there is nothing worse or more frustrating for community groups, such as the Carrick-on-Suir community group the Senator mentioned, which are working hard to improve their towns and the appearance of their community, than to have a derelict site right in the middle of their town or village.  It is unacceptable and local authorities have a statutory role to deal with such sites.<\/p> <p>Section 9 of the Derelict Sites Act 1990 provides that it shall be the duty of every owner and occupier of land, including a statutory body and a State authority, to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the land in question does not become, or does not continue to be, a derelict site.  In this connection, the term \"statutory body\" includes local authorities, harbour authorities, vocational education committees, as well as State boards and bodies established under any statute.  Section 10 of the Act further places a specific obligation on local authorities to take all reasonable steps to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.<\/p> <p>For the purposes of the Act, a derelict site is defined as: any land which detracts, or is likely to detract, to a material degree from the amenity, character or appearance of land in the neighbourhood of the land in question because of the existence on the land in question of structures which are in a ruinous, derelict or dangerous condition, or the neglected, unsightly or objectionable condition of the land or any structures on the land in question, or the presence, deposit or collection on the land in question of any litter, rubbish, debris or waste, except where the presence, deposit or collection of such litter, rubbish, debris or waste results from the exercise of a right conferred by statute or by common law.<\/p> <p>Local authorities have substantial powers under the Act, including powers to establish a register of derelict sites in their functional areas; requiring owners or occupiers of sites to take specific measures which the authority considers necessary to address the dereliction within specified time-frames; to acquire a site by agreement or compulsorily in certain circumstances; and to impose an annual derelict sites levy at a rate of 3% of the market value of a site on registered sites in urban areas or other areas prescribed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to be an urban area for the purposes of the Act.<\/p> <p>As required under section 8(6) of the Derelict Sites Act 1990, my Department requests each local authority to submit, on an annual basis, its derelict sites register in respect of the previous calendar year.  The most recent information held by my Department in this regard covers the year 2013.<\/p> <p>Under section 8(5) of the Derelict Sites Act, a copy of the derelict sites register for any local authority can be inspected at the offices of that authority during office hours.  I would encourage members of the public to look for this register and create awareness in communities, which would put the pressure on local authorities to ensure they are pursuing these derelict sites.<\/p> <p>For the information of the Senator, my Department has compiled a report which I will provide to him, summarising the information returned from local authorities in respect of 2013.  This report addresses, on a county-by-county basis, the number of derelict sites on the records of each local authority; and the amount of levy collected on an individual local authority basis.  By way of summary, the report indicates that nationally there were 1,755 derelict sites on the local authority registers on 1 January 2013; 143 new sites were added to the local authority registers during that year; and 187 sites were removed from the local authority registers during 2013, which left a total number of 1,711 sites nationally on the local authority derelict sites register.<\/p> <p>Information is not held in my Department on the number of sites on the respective local authority registers, which are in the ownership of local authorities, or how these sites are treated under the Derelict Sites Act.  The administration and implementation of the Act at a local level is a matter for the respective local authorities and I have no function in this regard.<\/p> <p>The Senator has made a very pertinent point regarding local authority-owned lands and I share some of his concerns.  Elected members have a mandate to represent communities and I would urge local councillors to ensure that those lands owned by their authorities are put to beneficial use if at all possible.  This is something I feel strongly about in terms of urban regeneration.  The Senator has mentioned that the Bill will be coming before the Seanad shortly, at which time there will be further opportunity to debate these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015061800002#B00100","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1434619800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his very strong and forthright response.

None the less I am extremely disappointed that neither the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, nor the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is here to discuss one of the busiest hospitals in the country, which is effectively at crisis point.  I feel like withdrawing the matter but in deference to the Minister of State, who has given his time, I will not do so, although I will write to the Minister for Health.<\/p> <p>Beaumont Hospital has effectively decided to shut down 33 acute surgical beds and to reallocate them for elderly care.  These surgical beds are for patients undergoing colorectal, heart, orthopaedic and gynaecological surgery, many of whom are acute and cancer patients.  The decision was taken by management without any consultation with staff at the hospital.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Darragh O'Brien:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2178\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is absolutely nuts.  I have read Beaumont Hospital's statement which says its key priority is to utilise the capacity and resources available to all patients, both medical and surgical.  No one will disagree with that.  However, what we are doing here is robbing Peter to pay Paul.<\/p><p>Of course, elderly care is very important, but it is not being funded properly.  This flows from the disaster a number of months ago with the fair deal scheme, elderly care and a lack of places.  The Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, decided to do something about it instead of being merely a commentator, which he is on most health issues.  What is happening now, however, is that the hospitals are being told to come up with the extra beds.  Taking them away from acute surgical care is insane.  The Government will come back and say this is not a big deal and that the number of beds has not been reduced.  I am not a fool and I know the same number of beds are there, but some have been taken away from acute medical care.  The fact that surgical beds are gone will result in the immediate loss of ten high observation beds that the Hardwicke ward provides as well as five single rooms that are used to nurse surgical patients who may require isolation for specific surgical reasons.  That is what is being lost here and it is genuinely shocking.  As a Dubliner and Dublin's spokesperson for my party, it is my local hospital.  The staff cannot understand this.  At least 30 consultants signed a letter which was sent to management and the Minister to say that this was a really bad idea.  The nursing staff only found out informally the night before that this would happen.  There was no consultation with them.  The INMO sat down with representatives of nursing staff and senior management and was told it would be given a detailed report setting out the rationale for these changes.  That was on 5 June.  Today, is 18 June but nothing has been received.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, is always very welcome to the House.  I have outlined the case so far and am interested to get the answer.  I am incredibly disappointed that the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, do not see this issue as important enough to actually come to the House and answer questions on.

While 140 beds spread across four surgical wards had historically been intended for surgical patients, in reality a significant number of these beds have been consistently occupied by medical patients, many of whom are frail and elderly.  In line with national programmes for treating frail and elderly patients and for surgical procedures, a decision has been made to reorganise a number of wards at Beaumont Hospital to provide a more comfortable experience for all patients.  One of these four wards has now been allocated for frail and elderly patients who require medical attention only while the remaining three have been ring-fenced for surgical patients.  This reorganisation will provide a more comfortable setting for elderly patients while also providing greater certainty on bed availability for surgical procedures.  It will also contribute to an improvement in waiting lists.<\/p> <p>Delayed discharges at Beaumont are, of course, a factor in the availability of bed capacity and have no doubt led to a strain on resources.  However, on foot of the ED task force, which the Minister convened in December last year, additional funding of &euro;74 million was provided in 2015 to help ease these types of pressures in acute hospitals.  The funding will increase the number of long-term nursing home care places and reduce waiting times for the funding of such places.  It will also increase the number of transitional care beds and home care packages to provide viable supports for those no longer needing acute hospital care.  Significant progress has been made to date on the overall plan and I am pleased to inform the House that delayed discharges are reducing steadily, with a 23% reduction since November 2014.<\/p> <p>In addition to measures already taken, the HSE has also been working with social care and has developed a frail-elderly project team.  The team is led by a community geriatrician with a focus on the provision of care in day hospitals and nursing homes rather than in hospital emergency departments.  As the Senator said, Beaumont Hospital has one of the busiest emergency departments in Ireland, providing services to over 50,000 patients every year.  Since January there has been an increase in the number of older patients requiring emergency admission.  In addition to working closely with the community, the hospital has undertaken a number of initiatives internally within various teams and departments and externally with the HSE to improve the patient pathway both through the emergency department and the hospital.  Beaumont Hospital's key priority is to utilise the capacity and resources available to provide the best possible treatment to all patients, both medical and surgical.<\/p> <p>I will ensure that the transcript of this debate and the comments of Senator Darragh O'Brien are brought to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015061800002#C00400","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1434619800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for outlining the reply.

When policy underlying the Act was being formulated consideration was given to the matter of expenses, but it was decided at that time that expenses should not be paid as performance of jury service was considered to be a basic civic duty which arose relatively infrequently as far as the individual is concerned.  That policy has been retained by successive Governments.<\/p><p>Section 29 of the 1976 Act, however, makes provision for employees to be paid by their employers, as the Senator pointed out, while on jury service.  Under section 9 of the 1976 Act, a county registrar may excuse any person whom he or she has summoned as a juror from attendance during the whole, or any part, of the sittings in question if that person shows to the county registrar's satisfaction that there is good reason he or she should be so excused - for example, if a person is self-employed and works alone and where his or her attendance at jury service may mean he or she cannot earn a living, he or she may qualify for excusal from jury service.  This is entirely a matter for the county registrar concerned and the Minister for Justice and Equality has no function in this regard.<\/p><p>Under current legislative provisions, jurors are not reimbursed for their time or travel expenses and employers are obliged to continue to pay employees while they serve on a jury.  The Courts Service, however, provide meals and other refreshments to jurors when serving on a jury.  <\/p><p>The Law Reform Commission report on jury service which was published in April 2013 contains 56 recommendations covering a broad range of issues relating to jury service.  On the issue we are debating today, chapter 9 of this report covers recommendations on jury compensation and expenses, including an introduction of a modest flat rate daily payment to cover the cost of transport and other incidentals involved in jury service, and these issues are being fully considered by the Department.  Some of the recommendations in the Law Reform Commission's report have cost implications and these recommendations require careful evaluation in the current economic climate.  They are currently being considered in the context of a juries Bill which is included in the Government's legislation programme and will be brought forward in due course.<\/p><p>The Government has already taken steps in regard to the recommendation concerning additional jurors for lengthy criminal trials.  Part 5 of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 provides for the appointment of up to three additional jurors to deal with lengthy criminal trials.  The issue of jury selection is a matter for the Courts Service.  The Courts Service has informed the Minister that it is engaged in a process of making the administration of jury service summonses and notices more streamlined and centralised.<\/p><p>The Department and Government are currently giving consideration to the Law Reform Commission report on jury service.  Chapter 9 relates to the issues which have been raised by Senator Burke.  They will be considered by the Government and considered one way or the other in the context of a juries Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015061800002#C00800","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434619800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

T&aacute; m&eacute; thar a bheith s&aacute;sta gur &iacute; f&eacute;in at&aacute; anseo, mar Aire sinsearach sa Roinn Oideachais, leis an gceist seo a ghlacadh.

Tigh Nan Dooley is a special school located in Carraroe, County Galway.  It provides an education to pupils with special educational needs, including moderate, severe and profound general learning difficulties and autistic spectrum disorder.  It is under the patronage of Ability West.  The school received permanent recognition from the Department of Education and Skills in 2010, operates through the medium of Irish and is the only school of its type in the country.  It covers the area from Barna to Inisboffin in County Galway.  We are very proud of the school and it is a very important resource in the area.  <\/p><p>I note the whole school evaluation that was done in the school recently gave it a glowing report.  It said the main strengths<b><\/b>of the work of the school are that the school staff works in a very effective and unified manner to meet the needs of each pupil, it has a highly effective principal who works diligently to provide a holistic and relevant education for the pupils, exemplary links have been established with local national schools to promote the ongoing and progressive inclusion of pupils, where relevant, the quality of pupil management is excellent, the quality of teaching and learning in all subject areas is of a very high standard, the curriculum is differentiated effectively to address pupils' learning needs and it has a very open ethos and friendly atmosphere. <\/p><p>The daily whole school assemblies greatly enhance staff collegiality and the very strong relationships between teachers and pupils promote a sense of community.  The report makes one recommendation on the ongoing investment in curriculum-related materials and resources being used to maximise the engagement of individual pupils.  A refurbishment was done a number of years ago which was not fully completed.  I understand there are currently no family or assessment rooms in the building.  There is space for two classrooms in the upstairs of the building.  The area has been plumbed, windows are in place and electrical work has been completed, and it has been passed for special needs assessment needs.  There is an issue with a lift in terms of making the space accessible to the pupils. <\/p><p>It is very difficult for the staff, who are exemplary, to be able to deliver the necessary curriculum properly until the space is accessible and made available to them.  When will the Department see fit to upgrade the available space and ensure that the staff can give these very special children all of the attention they need and as good a chance as possible to further their education in this very special setting?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015061800002#D00400","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1434619800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I wish to clarify the current position on the school in Carraroe, County Galway.  The Senator will be aware of the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years.  Primary enrolments, which have already risen substantially in recent years, are projected to rise by over 36,000 pupils by 2016 and are set to continue to rise, with a likely peak at around 574,000 pupils to be catered for in 2018.  This compares with 526,422 pupils enrolled in primary schools for the 2012-2013 school year.  It is vital that there is sufficient school accommodation to cope with these pupil enrolments.<\/p><p>In order to meet the needs of our growing population of school going children, my Department's priority is to establish new schools as well as extending or replacing a number of existing schools in areas where demographic growth has been identified.  The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will continue to be the main focus for investment by my Department in the coming years.  <\/p><p>However, regarding the school at Tigh Nan Dooley in Carraroe, County Galway, what will be of more interest to the Senator is that this school was transferred to my Department from the Health Service Executive in 2007.It has eight pupils enrolled in the 2014-2015 academic year and has a staffing of a principal and one special class teacher.  I understand that the school is accommodated in a purpose built development centre owned by the school's patron, Ability West.  The school applied for permanent recognition, which was granted by my Department in 2010.  I can confirm that the school submitted an application for funding in 2012.  The project was<i><\/i>not progressed at that time due to the need to prioritise essential mainstream accommodation to meet demographic needs and the school was advised of the outcome.<\/p><p>However, my Department would be prepared to consider an application for funding to meet an immediate accommodation requirement, including works to address accessibility issues in respect of the school in question.  Officials from my Department will be in contact with the school authorities to discuss the accommodation issues at the school in the coming days.  I again thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline the position regarding Tigh Nan Dooley, Carraroe, County Galway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015061800002#D00500","speaker":"1061"},{"type":"speech","time":1434619800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>It is very good news that the Minister is willing to accept the application and I thank her very much.

This morning I tabled a very important matter with regard to the removal and reconfiguration of 33 acute surgical beds from Beaumont Hospital.  The Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, is a decent guy and I have a lot of regard for him.  He is a very good attender at this House.  He is the junior Minister at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, who comes in and reads a statement on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, relating to the second busiest hospital in the country, a hospital in crisis, where 33 acute surgical beds for cancer patients have been removed.  The Minister could not even be bothered to come to the House to take the debate.  It is not just he who could not be bothered; the junior Minister at the Department of Health could not be bothered either.  Instead, they have sent in the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, who read out a stock reply from the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.

The figures from Women's Aid released today in its 2014 impact report also emphasise the need to have a debate on this.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, will be introducing legislation dealing with sexual offences and offences of domestic violence later this year, but the Women's Aid figures make for chilling reading.  Its discloses that 13,655 contacts were made during 2014 with Women's Aid direct services and reminds us also in the report that since 1996, some 207 women have been murdered in Ireland, 54% of those by a partner or ex-partner.  This is a serious matter.  Women's Aid state, of the contacts made with it, that 16,464 disclosures of domestic violence against women were made last year and they conclude that one in five women experience domestic violence in Ireland.  This is a serious and pressing issue, and we need to look again at it.

When one considers that half of the creatures of the Earth have disappeared since 1990, in China life expectancy has reduced by five years because of air pollution and the US Army has stated that it is a more serious threat than terrorism, that is the level of threat the planet faces at this time.  I ask that we have this debate.  It is not about being optimistic or pessimistic, but about being determined.  There is a UN conference coming up in Paris in the near future and many of the experts in the field of climate change have stated that those who will decide the outcome in Paris will decide who lives and who dies.  That is how serious climate change is for the planet.

Michael O'Leary instanced the fact that there were 3,000 flight cancellations this year which affected 600,000 passengers.  It is something we should consider.  In the case of essential services we should be able to ensure certain strikes do not happen.<\/p><p>A point of interest is that Prime Minister Tsipras of Greece told us today that his wife threatened to leave him if he gave way on the economic front.  It seems to me this is a powerful method.  He said he not going to give way solely because his wife would leave him.  Perhaps it is something we should take into account.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015061800002#H01800","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1434619800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>He wants the drachma back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015061800002#J00200","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1434619800,"counter":64,"content":"<p>We should discuss quite soon the challenge to us if Britain leaves the European Union.

I remind <i>The New York Times<\/i>that what followed was a 23 year ban and boycott of <i>The Sun<\/i>newspaper in Liverpool.

As I have said on previous occasions, a whole generation of Irish people are unlikely to own their own homes and will live in private rented accommodation for many decades, partly because they will be unable to access a bank loan to enable them to purchase and, partly, because it will take a considerable time to have the social housing necessary for people who will not be able to afford their own homes.  The reality is that the private rented sector is not fit for purpose.  There are spiralling rents, a chronic shortage of supply, a lack of real security for tenants and substandard accommodation.  Yesterday I commended the remarks of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, who said at a Threshold conference earlier in the week that he would bring rent certainty measures to Cabinet.  I call on him, in light of the best information we currently have which is being published today, to bring it to his Cabinet colleagues next week.  This cannot wait.  People are losing their homes and becoming homeless because they cannot afford to pay rent increases.  I ask for an urgent debate on the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015061800002#J00400","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1434619800,"counter":66,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom leas&uacute; ar Riar na hOibre a mholadh ar maidin.

It was added to the agenda on Tuesday and was not signalled to us last week.  The Bill was not available until 10 a.m.  I acknowledge that we got a note or a memorandum from officials but that is not sufficient for us to scrutinise legislation properly.  The directive is a 40 page document, published on 12 June 2013.  The sudden rush to push the legislation through is unacceptable.  We do our best and we are not perfect, but to ask us to scrutinise the legislation, to match it against the directive and debate it today on Second Stage is unacceptable and makes a mockery of the House.  I call on the Leader to amend the Order of Business so that at the very least we have the weekend to study it.  While the Bill may well be benign and may be badly needed, as legislators we cannot stand over it and we should not be asked to do so.  I propose it be deferred at least until next week so we can give it proper and due consideration and do our job properly.  <\/p> <p>There are people who would be concerned.

I certainly would not want the Leader to be called on to do that or to be accused of taking part in that type of process because that is not his style.

Why was this power delegated to the National Gallery of Ireland, the director of which is Mr. Sean Rainbird and who is also a trustee of the Sir Alfred Beit- Russborough House collection?  I commend An Taisce and Mr. Ian Lumley on taking this matter to the High Court, represented by Tim Smith of law firm, Phelim O'Neill.  They were granted permission in the High Court by Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns to challenge the granting of an export licence for the artworks.  The case will come before the High Court on 3 July when the sale is proposed for 9 July.<br\/><br\/>The interesting point is An Taisce also has a representative on the Beit Foundation, namely, Consuelo O&rsquo;Connor.  This is an intriguing situation.  I believe the Minister is negligent in her responsibilities in this regard.

As the Senator pointed out, the airlines are not responsible.<\/p><p>I also note Senator Quinn's points in relation to the proposed British referendum on the EU.  I am sure that will be the subject of the conversations between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister which are taking place today.<\/p><p>I do not know what I can say in response to Senator Quinn's assertion that the Greek Prime Minister's wife intends to leave him if the Greek Government accepts certain terms.  I think that is a matter for the Prime Minister.  I am sure we all hope some resolution can be found in that matter.<\/p><p>Senators Hayden and Craughwell and others commended the former President, Mary McAleese, on her letter regarding a deeply upsetting article in <i>The New York Times<\/i>about students on J1 visas.  I agree that Irish-Americans should consider their attitude towards <i>The New York Times<\/i>as a result of this scurrilous article, which has rightly been condemned by the Government and by former President McAleese.<\/p><p>Senators Hayden and Moloney spoke about the private rented sector and rent caps.  They called on the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to take action immediately to provide certainty for tenants.  The Minister had indicated that he would be bringing this matter to the Cabinet.  I am sure that will happen soon.  I hope he will come to this House as soon as that is done to explain the position in this regard.<\/p><p>Senator Leyden spoke about the Russborough House issue, which was raised yesterday by a number of Senators.  I gave a reply on that occasion and I can do so again today.  It is worth noting that the foundation did not consult the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in advance of deciding to sell nine paintings from the Beit collection.  The Minister was informed after the decision was taken and after an export licence was granted by the National Gallery.  This is a devolved function to the National Gallery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015061800002#L00900","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1434619800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>Not legally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2015061800002#L01000","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1434619800,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Therefore, the sale of the paintings was presented to the Minister as a <i>fait accompli<\/i>.
