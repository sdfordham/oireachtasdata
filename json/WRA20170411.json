These include programmes such as Community Employment (CE) and T&uacute;s.<\/p>  <p>  These schemes provide part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping-stone back to employment.  However, it is important to note that these placements are not full-time sustainable jobs.  Instead, they are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities of returning to the labour market or getting a job for the first time.  This has to be the ultimate aim.  <\/p>  <p>  While the live register is falling, the level of support for work programmes has been maintained.  The number of participants on work programmes rose from 25,000 in 2010 and, at the end of December 2016, was just over 32,000.  The OECD has noted previously that Ireland was slow to reduce numbers on work programmes when unemployment fell and employment grew. <\/p>  <p>  It is in this context that the Department undertook a comprehensive review of CE and other employment schemes.  Overall, it is planned to maintain the overall number of scheme places available in 2017 at 32,000 and CE will account for the bulk of these places.  In addition, the changes to be made over the coming months will widen the range of people who can take part in CE and this will improve the availability of people for the schemes which should help to address problems with filling vacancies.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, participants can remain on T&uacute;s for 1 year and I have no plans to change this.  <\/p>  <p>The Government is very mindful of the large number of places involved in service delivery and other valuable services around the country.

This includes situations where an individual, who would otherwise be an employee, establishes a company to provide his or her services to an employer but who, though classified as self-employed, is dependent on, and under the control of, a single employer.  It has been suggested that in some cases these type of arrangements may suit both the employer and the worker concerned but that in other cases employers use the arrangements to the detriment of workers.  In both cases, if the arrangement does in fact constitute bogus self-employment, it results in reduced income tax and social insurance contributions.  This is something that neither I nor the Minister for Finance are prepared to allow to continue.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that it also has to be recognised that new, and legitimate, forms of working arrangements are emerging as the labour markets adapt to the opportunities presented by digitalisation, broadband communications and globalisation.  This includes the emergence of more freelance type working arrangements - known as the gig economy - as well as new forms of trading - known as the sharing economy.  While it is important that policy adapts to provide social protection for workers in these new and emerging forms of work it is equally important that it does not unnecessarily stifle social innovation.  We have to be careful therefore in the steps that we take to tackle the issues that are arising and it is for this reason that we held the public consultation - to gather views of interested parties and stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  The consultation received 23 submissions from interested parties, including employers, trade unions, professional bodies and individuals.

In recognition of this, and to continue to encourage this ethos, CIB plans to set up Local Advisory Groups.  In addition, current local board members will be able to go forward for selection as members of the new regional boards.<\/p>  <p>  The reduced company model will better support direct engagement with and by CIB, to implement new initiatives consistently, and facilitate greater interaction with fewer boards.

Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate SWA rate towards their accommodation costs to ensure that the payments under the scheme target those most in need of assistance. <\/p>  <p>  The rent supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or income increase.  Income from employment and family income supplement (FIS) in excess of the standard SWA weekly rate of payment attract an additional income disregard and are assessed as follows; the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 can be disregarded for means assessment purposes. For rent supplement, maintenance payments of up to &euro;95.23 per week are assessed in determining the appropriate rate payable (vouched weekly rent or mortgage costs of up to this amount are disregarded in establishing the rate of one-parent family payment payable). Where a person has weekly maintenance payments of more than &euro;95.23, it is assessed under rent supplement using the formula as outlined.<\/p>  <p>  Any changes to the conditions of the rent supplement scheme can only be considered in a budgetary context.  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputies.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100059#WRA03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Code","counter":40,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100059#WRA03900"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":59,"qnumall":"[10497\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100059#WRA04000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"his plans for a basic income as outlined in the speech of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":42,"content":"<p>The speech referred to was made, not by me, but by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Pascal O&rsquo;Donohue.<\/p><p>In his speech, Minister Donohue did not outline plans for a basic income.<\/p><p>Rather, speaking in the context of <i>possible<\/i>total displacement of labour from large parts of the economy (by advances in robotics), the Minister included the concept of a basic income as one of a number of ideas that might need to be explored as a response to such a development. <\/p><p>Displacement of human work on this scale is not certain to occur at any stage, and there is certainly no indication that it is likely to occur in the near future.

An Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund is currently being carried out, which will assess the financial \"health\" of the Fund in the coming years, and this will inform decisions on expenditure relating to the Fund.  It should be remembered that the fund does not just finance pensions, but also includes a range of payments for people of working age.<\/p>  <p>  The current rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced from September 2012, replacing the previous bands which had been in place since 2000.  They more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person, and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions. <\/p>  <p>  Entitlement is banded based on the average yearly contributions made during a working life.  Those with a yearly average of 48+ contributions receive a 100% pension, where, for example, those with only a yearly average of 20 contributions receive an 85% pension (not means-tested). <\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that reverting the contributory pension rate bands, to the percentages effective from 2000-2012, would cost over &euro;60 million next year, and this annual cost would rise at a rate of approximately &euro;10 million per annum.  If such a change was introduced, it would mainly benefit pensioners with additional income above the State pension, and not those solely dependent upon it.  It would also significantly reduce the funds available for across-the-board pension increases, which were instead introduced in the 2016 and 2017 Budgets, and which benefit all pensioners, including those most at risk of poverty. <\/p>  <p>  Reforms and increases in the pension age have safeguarded the pension system and its core rates, despite huge demographic pressures and the economic crisis.

The project aims to provide all public bodies with a substantial level of assurance as to the identity of customers that present and to provide customers with a simple, easy-to-use, secure means of verifying their identity to public bodies.  In this way customers should have a consistent way of proving who they are and not have to repeat laborious identity verification processes each time they avail of a public service.<\/p>  <p>  The SAFE project was initially developed by an interdepartmental committee in the early-mid 2000s.  While at that juncture it was envisaged that the project would be rolled out by 2013, a range of factors impacted on this in the mid-late 2000s.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly, arising from the economic downturn from 2008 onwards, my Department experienced a rapid and unprecedented increase in demand for services and customer numbers.

SAFE registration, based primarily on a face-to-face engagement, is the most robust identity registration process in the State and consequently provides a substantial assurance of a person&rsquo;s identity.  Successful registration leads to a verification of a person&rsquo;s Public Services Identity (PSI) data (which includes elements such as a person&rsquo;s PPS number, name, address, date of birth, place of birth, nationality, photograph, signature, etc.).  It also results in the issue of a Public Services Card (PSC) incorporating the person&rsquo;s photograph and signature.  Accordingly, possession of a PSC gives significant assurance as to the identity of the cardholder.   The PSC was introduced to assist people in accessing a range of Government services.  This card was designed to replace the free travel pass and the social services card of my Department and to enable other providers of public services to verify the identity of their customers.<\/p>  <p>  Built on top of the PSC infrastructure, a new online identity service called MyGovID provides an easy-to-use, safe and consistent way to securely access online Government services.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to Social Welfare schemes, SAFE registration is now a requirement for both first time adult passport applicants in the state and for citizenship applicants.  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has also started making SAFE a requirement for some of its services.  Later this year SAFE will be required for Driver Theory Test applicants and adult passport renewals in the state.  In 2018 the requirement will roll out to Driving Licence Applicants and applicants for Student Universal Support Ireland.  Other public bodies are also examining how they may be able to use the SAFE infrastructure for their identity requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Section 262 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides the legal basis for the administration and exchange of PSI data.  Persons are required by section 262(4) to provide their PPS Number to Specified Bodies for the purpose of a transaction.

In addition all organisations provided with access must nominate a Compliance Officer.

In doing this I sought to balance the improvements to social welfare payments with measures designed to make sure that the system also works for people who are in employment, including self-employed people.<\/p><p>On Budget Day, I announced the first general increase in all weekly rates of payment since 2009.  A &euro;5 increase in the maximum weekly rates of payment for all social welfare payments took effect in March, with proportionate increases for qualified adults and those on reduced rates of payment.  Approximately 1.5 million people are benefitting from this increase.<\/p><p>I am also extending social insurance benefits for the self-employed.  Since last month, self-employed contributors can now avail of the Treatment Benefit scheme, which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearing aids and contact lenses.<\/p><p>I also introduced changes to improve the financial benefit of work for lone parents who take up some employment.  The income disregards for the One Parent Family Payment and Jobseekers&rsquo; Transition payment increased by &euro;20, from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, reversing, in part, previous reductions.  This change improves the level of take-home earnings of lone parents.  For example lone parents earning &euro;110 per week or more, saw their take-home income rise by up to &euro;15 per week from January 2017.<\/p><p>A number of Budget 2017 measures will take effect from later this year, most significantly, from December, self-employed contributors will be eligible for the Invalidity Pension.  For the first time, this will give self-employed people access to the safety net of a guaranteed income support if they have the misfortune of experiencing a debilitating illness or injury that prevents them from working.  <\/p><p>Treatment benefit entitlements will also be extended from October 2017 so as to provide further dental and optical benefits to both employees and people who are self-employed. <\/p><p>In addition from the commencement of the next academic year in September, a &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance will be made available to Back to Education Allowance participants with children.  This will help parents, including lone parents, to return to and remain in, education.<\/p><p>Also from September, young jobseekers under age 25 will be entitled to receive the full maximum rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s payment of &euro;193 per week when they engage in educational activity under the Back to Education Allowance scheme.  This is an increase of &euro;33 or 21% on the current level of payment. <\/p><p>Finally, also from September, Budget 2017 provides for the inclusion in the School Meals scheme of an additional 80 schools not currently part of DEIS but deemed to require this support following the recently launched <i>DEIS Plan 2017<\/i>by my colleague, the Minister of Education and Skills.

It would not be lawful or appropriate for me, as Minister, to seek to intervene in such a decision, taken by the Board.  Furthermore, the Office of the Attorney General has confirmed that Section 9 of the Citizens Information Act, 2007 does not give me such power.<\/p>  <p>  CIB has not taken this operational decision lightly.  It follows almost 5 years of extensive analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders on the need for a more streamlined governance model.  The new arrangements are being implemented at local company board level only.  The valuable work carried out by the employees and volunteers working in CIS services and the employees of MABS services will continue as heretofore.  <\/p>  <p>  The decision reduces the number of individual local CIS and MABS company boards from ninety three (93) to sixteen (16).  A new regional board structure will be put in place, which will comprise eight (8) CIS boards and eight (8) MABS boards.  <\/p>  <p>  The changes will bring the CIS and MABS organisations more into line with modern public service governance guidelines and requirements where significant State funding is involved.  The reduced company structure will better assist CIB in the fulfilment of its statutory obligations, its compliance with the Code of Practise for Governance of State Bodies, and implementation of recommendations of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. <\/p>  <p>  In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services (including &euro;13.1 million to the 42 local Citizens Information Services, &euro;1.2 million to Citizens Information Phone services and, the balance, &euro;0.7 million to central and other supports), and &euro;24.6 million is allocated to the network of MABS services (including &euro;15.4 million to the 51 local MABS, &euro;0.3m to National Traveller MABS, &euro;2.0 million to MABS National Development Company, &euro;3.3million to the MABS Dedicated Mortgage Arrears initiative, &euro;3.5 million to the Abhaile service, and the remaining &euro;0.1m to MABS central supports).<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may already be aware, the Board of CIB is made up of people who represent people with a sense of community ethos, people with physical and mental disabilities, victims of abuse and those with advocacy needs.

Accordingly, there can be no question of differential treatment for particular categories of ratepayers.  The outcome for each ratepayer, whether an SME or a large company, depends on the particular circumstances of their property.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Commissioner of Valuation, who has statutory responsibility for the revaluation programme and is independent in the operation of his statutory functions, that the revaluation in County Kildare has now reached the stage where Proposed Valuation Certificates have issued to each ratepayer.  Each ratepayer has a statutory right to make representations to the Commissioner within 40 days of issue of the certificates.  At this stage, the revaluation process is a work in progress and is confidential between each occupier of rateable property and the Valuation Office.  Anticipated reductions or increases in rates are not finalised at this stage.  When all representations have been considered by the Valuation Office and various adjustments made to individual valuations, as may be merited by the evidence available to the Valuation Office, each ratepayer will receive a Final Valuation Certificate in September 2017, in relation to which they will have a right of appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal, within 28 days.  On 15 September 2017, the Commissioner will publish the new valuation list for the Kildare County Council rating authority area containing the finalised valuations upon which rates for 2018 will be levied.  The actual amount levied in 2018 on each ratepayer will be the Net Annual Value (finalised by the Valuation Office for that particular property) multiplied by the actual Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) set by the elected members of Kildare County Council at its budgetary meeting in late 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Revaluation is a nationwide programme and the results from the local authorities completed to date (Dublin City, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County, Fingal County, Limerick City and County, South Dublin County and Waterford City and County) have shown a general trend whereby approximately 60% of ratepayers received a reduction in rates and approximately 40% of ratepayers have received an increase.

It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his\/her Division.<\/p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Garda Commissioner that Tubbercurry Garda Station forms part of the Sligo\/Leitrim Division and that the Garda strength of the Sligo\/Leitrim Division on the 28 February 2017, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 301 members of whom 9 were assigned to Tubbercurry Garda Station.  There are also 21 Garda Reserves and 25 civilians attached to the Sligo\/Leitrim Division.  In addition, support is provided by the Divisional Traffic Corp, Regional Support Unit, Divisional Drugs Unit and Detective Units which are regularly detailed for duty in the area concerned.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.<\/p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, 839 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, 13 of whom have been assigned to the Sligo\/Leitrim Division.  I am also informed by the Commissioner that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end, an increase of 500 from the end of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.

Once completed, the results will be published on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s website.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the statutory position regarding the monitoring of the implementation of recommendations made in Inspectorate reports has changed.  Section 117(A) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act provides for a role for the Policing Authority in monitoring the measures taken by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement the recommendations contained in reports prepared by the Inspectorate.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner published her Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 in June 2016.  This Programme includes recommendations from the various Garda Inspectorate Reports, including the two most recent Inspectorate Reports referred to above.  Key reforms being implemented include the replacement of the current District model of policing with a Divisional model where responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis.  This will be subject to modifications to ensure the close relationship with communities is maintained in large rural Divisions.  In line with international norms, a medium term target of 20% civilians to be achieved by 2021 has been set.<\/p><p>The implementation of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme is primarily a matter for the Commissioner.  However, the Government decided that the Policing Authority should be requested to monitor the implementation of the agreed recommendations in 'Changing Policing in Ireland' and to report to me at regular intervals.  I have received the first such progress report from the Policing Authority.  Their next progress report is due by the end of April.<\/p><p>In July, the Government approved a Five Year Reform and High Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This Plan marries the agreed recommendations in 'Changing Policing in Ireland' with a major investment programme that will increase the number of garda&iacute; to 15,000; double the number of civilians to 4,000; and more than double the number of reserves members to 2,000.  This investment in human capital is supported by a &euro;300 million capital plan that will deliver leading-edge technology and other capital infrastructure to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The 2017 Estimates reflect this commitment by providing the resources to recruit 800 garda&iacute;, 500 civilians and 300 reserves in 2017.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that at the Government meeting last week I received approval to begin the process of establishing a Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  I expect that the Commission will have regard to appropriate structures for oversight and accountability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100062#WRD02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Regulations","counter":182,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100062#WRD02800"},{"type":"question","counter":183,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[17527\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100062#WRD02900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will report on preparations for the introduction of the general data protection regulations in 2018; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":184,"content":"<p>The position is that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has direct legal effect and does not require to be transposed into national law.  It does however contain a number of Articles which provide Member States with a limited margin of flexibility, mainly in respect of the public sector.  Work is ongoing in the Department of Justice and Equality on the development of a General Scheme of a Bill to give further effect to the GDPR and also to transpose the Data Protection Directive (Directive (EU) 670\/2016) which deals with the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences and the execution of criminal penalties.  The GDPR will come into effect on 25 May 2018 and the Directive must be transposed into Irish law by May 2018.  The Department of Justice and Equality has been in regular consultations with other Departments and public bodies and agencies in the course of preparation of the draft legislation and awareness has been raised significantly through this process.<\/p><p>  The GDPR encompasses a 'risk-based' approach which means that individual data controllers and data processors are required to put appropriate technical and organisational measures in place in order to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing of personal data, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals, is in compliance with the GDPR.  The GDPR provides for the establishment of supervisory authorities at national level with a wide range of functions and powers, including the promoting the awareness of controllers and processors of their data protection obligations.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, which has already been in existence for almost 30 years, is the supervisory authority in this jurisdiction.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner that promoting and building awareness of the GDPR is a top priority for 2017 and beyond, using a broad range of communications channels, techniques and platforms.  These include conferences and speaking events; engagement with the media and social media; GDPR guidance; and information awareness raising campaigns.  The Commissioner, Deputy Commissioners and other senior staff are engaged as speakers at a number high-level, high-impact events in 2017, focusing on GDPR awareness and circulating guidance through representative bodies.<\/p><p>  The Data Protection Commissioner issued an information document about the GDPR at the end of 2016 entitled &quot;The GDPR and You&quot;.

Preparations for the GDPR and increasing awareness of data protection among the broader population are two key areas of focus for the Forum for the year ahead.  The centrepiece of the Forum&rsquo;s activities for this year is the Data Summit that will take place on 15 and 16 June in the Convention Centre in Dublin.  Preparations for the GDPR will be a core theme for the Summit with a series of presentations and practical &lsquo;how to&rsquo; sessions integrated throughout the programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100062#WRD03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1282"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Valuation Office","counter":185,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100062#WRD03100"},{"type":"question","counter":186,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[17536\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100062#WRD03200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the details of the administration cost of the revaluations process to date; and the estimated final cost when the first round of rolling revaluations is completed.","asker":"1217","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":187,"content":"<p>The Valuation Office is currently undertaking a systematic national programme of revaluing, for rates purposes, all industrial and commercial properties in the State on a rating authority basis.  This is one of the main statutory functions of the Commissioner of Valuation who is completely independent in the operation of his statutory functions.  The revaluation programme is the first of its kind since the mid-nineteenth century and has been a policy objective of successive governments for several decades.  The programme has gained momentum following the enactment of the Valuation (Amendment) Act which was initiated by the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and passed into law by both Houses of the Oireachtas in 2015.  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers.  Following this revaluation, subsequent revaluations of each rating authority area will then be carried out on a cyclical basis no sooner than five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation, in accordance with Section 25 of the Valuation Act 2001.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his functions.  I am informed by the Commissioner that the costs incurred in the period 2005 to 2014 in respect of the revaluation programme was &euro;33 million.  The costs incurred for 2015 and 2016 (taking into account the 2015 Act) are of the order of &euro;8 million in total.  I am advised that these costs are apportioned on a pro-rata basis for the ongoing statutory and non-statutory work carried out by the Office and that these estimates are derived from the overall expenditure incurred in running the Valuation Office, taking account of staffing and other relevant costs.  As the Deputy will be aware, the staffing costs of an organisation such as the Valuation Office would typically account for 75 - 80% of the total cost of running the organisation.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 Act has enabled the Valuation Office to adopt a series of new approaches to revaluation not supported by the previous legislation, including the outsourcing of work, the use of \"self assessment\" principles known as 'Occupier Assisted Valuation' and more extensive use of statistical analysis.  These are being piloted during the REVAL 2017 phase of the overall programme.  Accordingly, the costs for the period from 2017 to the anticipated completion of the first revaluation programme in 2021 are likely to be significantly determined by the success or otherwise of these pilot projects and the Valuation Office is not in a position to provide an estimate of such costs until the outcome of these pilot projects is apparent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100062#WRD03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100062#WRD03400"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[17548\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100062#WRD03500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of incidents which were initially entered on the Garda PULSE system as a crime and subsequently reclassified as attention and complaints in January 2017 and February 2017 for each Garda district, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as the national statistical agency, is responsible for the publication of recorded crime statistics.

A monthly schedule has been agreed with the Greek authorities which will sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its commitments to Greece within the time frame envisaged by the Programme.<\/p><p>Ireland has agreed to take up to 20 UAMs under the IRPP. \u00a0Fundamentally, Ireland's capacity to take UAMs is determined by Tusla, the child and family agency. 6 UAMs (by the Irish definition) have arrived in Ireland from Greece under the programme. However, relatively few UAMs appear to be available within the cohort eligible for relocation and efforts continue to seek further transfers within this cohort. \u00a0All UAMs that have arrived to date are in the care of Tusla.\u00a0<\/p><p>As regards Italy, the relocation mechanism from Italy has yet to commence for many countries, including Ireland, due to issues with the Italian authorities surrounding the security assessment of migrants assigned to other Member States. Intensive efforts are ongoing to resolve this, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level, including through the European Commission and it is hoped that a resolution can be found in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>  The total target for relocation EU-wide in the two Council Decisions for relocation also includes an allocated portion which in the case of Ireland amounts to \u00a0910 persons. These numbers have not yet been allocated as between Greece and Italy.\u00a0\u00a0It is understood that the European Commission are examining allocating this &quot;unassigned&quot; portion and if they do Ireland will immediately work towards relocating them.\u00a0<\/p><p>Table 3 sets out the position regarding the assignment of the 4,000. <\/p><p>Table 3: Table of Total Numbers under Government Decision<table><tr><th>Relocation Strand<\/th><th>Numbers<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Council Decision 2015\/1523<\/td><td>600<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Council Decision 2015\/1601<\/td><td>2,022<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Relocation<\/td><td>2,622<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Resettlement Strand<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Government Decision 09\/06\/15<\/td><td>520<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Government Decision 06\/07\/16<\/td><td>260<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Government Decision 29\/11\/16<\/td><td>260<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Resettlement<\/td><td>1,040<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Unaccompanied Minors Calais (Government Decision 10\/11\/16)<\/td><td>200 (up to)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mechanism as yet undecided<\/td><td>138<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Grand Total<\/td><td>4000<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100063#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Residency Permits","counter":213,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100063#WRE00750"},{"type":"question","counter":214,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[17708\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100063#WRE00800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the case of a person (details supplied) who has been having difficulties obtaining the relevant stamps to remain here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":215,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the person concerned made an application for Long Term Residency on 19 December 2016.

This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention. <\/p><p>It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations that it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland. Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.<\/p><p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has reformed Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights. <\/p><p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and completed Second Stage in February January 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible. <\/p><p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it will take for this Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement both of Deprivation of Liberty provisions, which will be included in the Bill at Committee Stage, and of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.<\/p><p>The Convention creates no new rights, but rather requires that people with disabilities be treated on an equal basis with others.  I should make the point that service standards and funding are subject to what the Convention describes as &lsquo;progressive realisation&rsquo; and are subject to the budgetary decisions of the Government of the day.  Issues around the allocation of resources are matters for each annual Budget and are for the individual Departments involved.  Insofar as the Department of Justice and Equality is concerned, there are no cost implications from ratification of the Convention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100063#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Traffic Offences Data","counter":222,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100063#WRE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":223,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[17764\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100063#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 33 of 16 February 2017 and 61 of 30 March 2017, the number of convictions resulting from each of these prosecutions\u00a0commenced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2016 and to date in 2017; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":224,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service and I have no role in the matter.

This plan contains a significant volume of\u00a0responses to the current housing crisis, of which the HTB incentive is just one.\u00a0The comprehensive Action Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector. While the primary focus of the Action Plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time-bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector.<\/p>  <p>  It is in this context that the Help-to-Buy (HTB) scheme should be considered. Its role is to complement the other measures in the Action Plan. The extent to which the scheme could lead to an increase in residential property prices will very much depend on the speed and efficiency with which structural supply constraints are eliminated and residential building activity increases. Therefore, the impact of the HTB\u00a0incentive on property prices should not\u00a0be considered in isolation from the impact of other measures contained in the Action Plan, which are primarily designed to increase supply. In my view, it is the lack of supply that is primarily responsible for driving house prices higher and I would point out that increases in\u00a0house prices\u00a0prevailed long before the introduction of the\u00a0Help to Buy incentive. I would also point out that the HTB is targeted towards new build homes only, and to first-time buyers only, and it would be simplistic to designate this\u00a0incentive as being the sole or\u00a0the major contributor to\u00a0house price increases.\u00a0Furthermore, the incentive is designed to help first-time buyers obtain the deposit required to facilitate the purchase of a home.

The CcyB is a time varying capital requirement and is designed to make the banking system more resilient and less pro-cyclical; essentially the CCyB will increase the capital requirement of banks when credit growth is \"excessive\".<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank's framework for macro prudential policy elaborates the aims of such policies, which are to: <\/p>  <p>  -  strengthen the resilience of the financial system so that it can withstand adverse movements in credit and property cycles or the impact of other economic shocks; <\/p>  <p>  -  reduce the potential for vulnerabilities that could lead to the accumulation of financial distress. (Many of the vulnerabilities arise through the pro-cyclicality of the credit cycle). <\/p>  <p>  Both of these aims are key priorities of the Central Bank in its dual mission to 'safeguard stability and protect consumers'. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank keeps credit conditions in the Irish economy and it macro prudential policy instruments under review, and calibrates them as considered appropriate.  The Central Bank reviews its mortgage lending measures on an annual basis (details are available at www.centralbank.ie\/financial-system\/financial-stability\/macro-prudential-policy\/mortgage-measures and the most recent changes to the lending rules came into effect from the start of this year) and it calibrates its CCyB on a quarterly basis (its quarterly assessments are available at www.centralbank.ie\/financial-system\/financial-stability\/macro-prudential-policy\/countercyclical-capital-buffer).<\/p>  <p>  These measures are also complementary to existing micro prudential supervision, and to lenders' own risk management practices. The introduction of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in November 2014 brought about a fundamental change to the supervision of banking in Ireland and in other participating Member States.  The SSM approach to supervision is risk-based. It takes into account both the degree of damage which the failure of an institution could cause to financial stability and the likelihood of such a failure occurring. Where the SSM judges that there are increased risks to a credit institution or group of credit institutions, those credit institutions will be supervised more intensively until the relevant risks decrease to an adequate level. The SSM approach to supervision is based on qualitative and quantitative approaches, and involves judgment and forward-looking critical assessment. In this context it can be noted that credit risk is a key priority for the SSM in 2017. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100065#WRG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":300,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100065#WRG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":301,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[18177\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100065#WRG00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if capital gains tax is payable on the surplus compared with the original cost of land that would have been purchased in 1989 in circumstances (details supplied); the rate of capital gains tax that would be payable for such a transaction in 2017; if relief is available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1216","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":302,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that capital gains tax (CGT) is chargeable on the increase in the value of an asset from the time it was acquired to the time of its disposal.

The income is then taxed at the level of the investor rather than the fund, as is standard international practice.  The broad rationale for exempting such funds from direct taxation is to facilitate individuals to invest collectively, without suffering double taxation (that is, taxation both within the fund and in the hands of the investor on distribution) as the investor will pay tax as appropriate in the investor's country of residence or establishment.  Most OECD countries now have a tax system that provides for neutrality between direct investments and investments through a Collective Investment Vehicle or Fund.  <\/p>  <p>  The essence of the regime is that there is no tax on the income and gains accruing to the fund but that an exit charge is imposed on chargeable events, i.e. payments to certain unitholders as distributions of income\/capital gains and on gains realised by them on disposal of their units.  In order to ensure that the appropriate tax is collected from Irish investors, funds are obliged to operate an exit tax regime and remit the tax deducted in this manner to Revenue.  This charge to tax does not apply in the case of unit holders who are non-resident. In the case of non-resident investors, their liability to tax on gains from the fund will be determined in their home jurisdiction.  Where the investor is not resident\/ordinarily resident in Ireland no exit tax should be deducted provided appropriate declarations are in place.<\/p>  <p>  Irish resident investors subject to the exit tax are also subject to an 8 year deemed disposal rule.  If an Irish resident investor has invested in a fund, then every 8 years exit tax arises in respect of that investor.  This prevents open ended funds rolling-up their profits indefinitely and ensures that the tax deferral cannot be indefinite.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to state that Ireland's corporate tax policies are designed to attract real and substantive operations to Ireland.  We only want real and substantive FDI, the kind that brings real jobs and investment.  Ireland has not been and will never be a brass plate location. <\/p>  <p>  The OECD has made a series of recommendations, as part of the BEPS process, which are designed to give tax authorities the tools necessary to ensure that profits are correctly attributed to the country where the economic activity which generates them takes place.  The BEPS recommendations will greatly enhance the ability of participating countries to ensure the correct alignment of tax and substance and Ireland is playing its part in the implementation of these recommendations.  Ireland has been a strong supporter of the BEPS project and I believe it is the best approach for dealing with aggressive tax planning. Ireland will now play an active part in the work to implement the BEPS recommendations globally.  The post-BEPS environment will see companies seek to better align the amount of tax that they pay with their substantive operations.  The alignment of substance with a competitive rate of tax has long been the cornerstone of our corporation tax policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100065#WRG02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":323,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[18269\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100065#WRG02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the consideration that has been given to the introduction of a levy on funds based on the Luxembourg model; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":324,"content":"<p>The normal tax treatment afforded to Irish collective investment funds is that the funds invested are allowed to grow on a tax-free basis within the fund.

By deciding to reject the Lansdowne Road Agreement, the ASTI has placed its members outside that Agreement and has decided that the Agreement&rsquo;s benefits and protections will not apply to its members.  The protection from compulsory redundancy that public servants have arises from commitments given by the Government under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.

The process of identifying staff surpluses takes place in the first half of each year and takes effect from the start of the following school year. The process operates and deals with any surplus for the following school year.  <\/p>  <p>  The process for the 2017\/18 school year is currently under way in the Department. 60 secondary schools were identified as possible surplus schools for the 2017\/18 school year.

This represents the total number of schools where potential surpluses could arise. <\/p>  <p>  However, at this stage of the process it is too early to say what the final position as regards the level of surplus will be, either generally or in particular schools.  The level of surplus is influenced by many factors including retirements, career breaks, job-sharing etc. and additional allocations for the forthcoming year in respect of demographics.  This continues to evolve as new information is received from relevant schools.  Given that Budgets 2016 and 2017 did not negatively impact on teacher allocations, it would not be surprising that the level of redeployment would be lower than in recent years.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department expects to know the final position in relation to the number of surplus teachers shortly.

Since then, at the request of the Teaching Council, the Inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills has operated probationary inspections arrangements for newly qualified teachers.  This was agreed in order to allow the Teaching Council time to develop, trial and put in place more appropriate induction\/probation arrangements to enable teachers gain full registration with the Council.<\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Teaching Council has established standards for post-qualification professional practice, as set out in Droichead, the new model of induction and probation for newly qualified primary and post-primary teachers.  The Droichead programme promotes ongoing, sustained professional development through an initial period of in-school induction and mentoring and gives effect to one of the Teaching Council&rsquo;s primary functions &ndash; that of peer regulation and setting the standards of entry into the profession and registration as a teacher. <\/p>  <p>  The Droichead programme was the subject of a three-year pilot before it was approved by the Council in March 2016.  The programme is being introduced on a phased basis since last September.  Inherent to this policy is a structure to support the growth and development of Droichead over a number of years, whereby the availability of the traditional Inspectorate route to gaining full registration with the Council (known as probation) will be phased-out in favour of the new Droichead path for the early professional development of teachers and their induction into the profession.  The growth and development phase of the Teaching Council&rsquo;s Droichead policy has identified teachers employed in a special education or restricted setting to be the first cohort of teachers for whom Droichead would be the only route available to achieve full registration with the Council during the 2016-17 school year.  The traditional probation route, therefore, is not available to these teachers during this initial and in subsequent phases of Droichead.<\/p>  <p>  While a new policy on teacher probation was adopted by the Teaching Council in December 2016, this does not change the requirement for teachers in a special education setting to avail of Droichead in order to gain full registration with the Teaching Council during the current school year.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is considering the impact of the new policy adopted by the Council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100066#WRH04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100066#WRH04400"},{"type":"question","counter":387,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[17568\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100066#WRH04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the provision of a new community school in the Mungret area; the current stage it is at; when he expects the school to be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":388,"content":"<p>I can confirm to you Deputy that a project for the school in question was included in the Department's 6 Year Capital Programme announced in November 2015 to proceed to the tender and construction stages in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  A suitable site has been identified and Department officials are working to advance its acquisition.

GMIT is also represented on the Atlantic Economic Corridor Steering Group, which is a key part of the Action Plan on Rural Development. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HEA recognise the particular challenges attached to multi-campus provision in both GMIT and other institutes of technology.  A major review of the funding allocation model of higher education has commenced and the review will look at how the future model can take account of the additional costs associated with these arrangements.

The recent Budget contained measures to deliver on this. <\/p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO in September will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4,600 and &euro;6,700) for new entrant teachers.\u00a0\u00a0The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.\u00a0 The pay increases for new teachers were also available to ASTI members under the proposals which members recently balloted on. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The agreements have\u00a0restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.\u00a0 This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A\u00a0broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay across the Public Service will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. <\/p>  <p>  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of future public service pay talks.  Indeed, negotiations on a successor agreement to Lansdowne Road will shortly get under way. <\/p>  <p>  The new Junior Cycle has been developed over several years and is now in the process of being implemented.  The new Framework for Junior Cycle gives students the opportunity to develop a wider range of knowledge and skills &ndash; to equip them for further learning, for work, for responsible and active citizenship, and for healthy living.  It gives students better learning opportunities, and rewards and recognises non-academic performance and achievements, with a central focus on the student&rsquo;s quality of life, wellbeing and mental health.  Third year students will sit the new Junior Cycle English examination in June of this year, which is the first new subject specification to be introduced under the Framework for Junior Cycle. <\/p>  <p>  I welcomed the guidance from the State Exams Commission which was issued to schools earlier this month.  It provided an important reassurance for Junior Cycle students and their parents that all students sitting their final examinations this year will have access to the full 100% of marks available for their English examination.\u00a0 An ASTI statement provided further reassurance in this regard. Schools have been notified of a second calendar window in the 2016\/17 school year to allow for the completion and submission of the Junior Cycle English Assessment Task by students who were prevented from meeting the initial deadline.  This Assessment Task is externally assessed (which was always the case) and forms part of the final examination marked by the State Examinations Commission (SEC). <\/p>  <p>  The Croke Park hours are part of wider productivity measures introduced under the Public Service Agreements that require all public servants to work additional time for no additional payment. <\/p>  <p>  The Croke Park hours represent a real reform with significant benefits for parents and children.  In schools, the Croke Park hours are 33 additional hours a year at post primary (36 hours at primary) worked by teachers.  They are a valuable resource within the school system which allow certain essential activities involving the entire teaching staff or groups of teachers to take place.  These include staff meetings, parent-teacher meetings, school planning, subject planning and mandated Continuous Professional Development.<\/p>  <p>  Before the Croke Park hours were introduced, these activities ate into tuition time.  This meant that schools closed for full days or half days in order to carry them out, causing interruption to tuition and significant inconvenience for parents, as well as child care costs &ndash; particularly for primary parents.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that many public servants committed significantly more hours than this under the public service agreements.  Across the public services &ndash; education, health, local authorities, civil service etc. - the additional time being provided represents about 450,000 additional hours per annum or the equivalent of between 12,000 and 13,000 public service posts.  That is a serious productivity benefit for the Exchequer.  Replacing those hours would cost hundreds of millions of euro.<\/p>  <p>  In response to concerns expressed by teacher trade unions regarding the use of the Croke Park hours, my Department agreed with TUI and INTO to carry out a review of their usage under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  This review, which also involves the school management bodies is now under way and will have regard to teacher professional judgement, system and school requirements and experience to date of best practice in the use of the hours.<\/p>  <p>  The review provides for an up-front increase in the quantum of time allowed for planning and development work on other than a whole-school basis.  The original Croke Park Agreement provided that all Croke Park hours (36 for primary and 33 for post-primary annually) would be worked on a whole-school basis.  The Haddington Road Agreement provided that up to 5 of the hours could be worked on a less than whole-school basis (e.g. small groups of subject teachers).  The recent agreement increases this maximum to 8 hours in September 2016 and 10 hours in September 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100067#WRJ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":408,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100067#WRJ01150"},{"type":"question","counter":409,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[17733\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100067#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the developments to date on the proposed new school at a location (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1329","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":410,"content":"<p>The project to which the Deputy refers has reached an advanced stage of architectural planning, Stage 2(b), which involves securing the statutory approvals and the preparation of tender documents.<\/p><p>The\u00a0Stage 2(b) submission has recently been submitted to my Department. \u00a0Upon review of the submission my Department will revert to the Board of Management\u00a0with regard to the further progression of the project to tender and construction.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100067#WRJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation Provision","counter":411,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100067#WRJ01350"},{"type":"question","counter":412,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[17736\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100067#WRJ01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will expedite the provision of a school project (details supplied).","asker":"1278","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":413,"content":"<p>I wish to advise\u00a0the Deputy that my Department is not in receipt of a recent application from the school referred to in respect of its accommodation needs.<\/p>  <p>  It is open to\u00a0any school to submit an application to my Department\u00a0if they have identified a deficit of classroom accommodation to meet increasing enrolments or to accommodate an additional teacher appointment.

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers. <\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. <\/p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO in September will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4,600 and &euro;6,700) for new entrant teachers.\u00a0\u00a0The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.\u00a0 The pay increases for new teachers were also available to ASTI members under the proposals which members recently balloted on. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The agreements have\u00a0restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.\u00a0 This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated cost would be between &euro;65 and &euro;70 million per annum.\u00a0 Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  Further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A\u00a0broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay across the public service will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. <\/p>  <p>  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of future public service pay talks.  Indeed, negotiations on a successor agreement to Lansdowne Road will shortly get under way. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100068#WRK03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reports","counter":485,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100068#WRK03150"},{"type":"question","counter":486,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[17821\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100068#WRK03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated cost of the implementation of the Ward and Cush reports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":487,"content":"<p>The Haddington Road Agreement provided for the establishment of Expert Groups to consider and report on the level of fixed-term and part-time employment in teaching and third-level lecturing, having regard to the importance for staff of employment stability and security and taking account of system and employer needs and Teaching Council registration requirements.<\/p>  <p>  The Ward Report in relation to teachers was published in September 2014 and the Cush Report in relation to lecturers was published in May 2016.

In schools, the Croke Park hours are 33 additional hours a year at post primary (36 hours at primary) worked by teachers.

These include staff meetings, parent-teacher meetings, school planning, subject planning and mandated Continuous Professional Development.<\/p>  <p>  Before the Croke Park hours were introduced, these activities ate into tuition time.  This meant that schools closed for full days or half days in order to carry them out, causing interruption to tuition and significant inconvenience for parents, as well as child care costs &ndash; particularly for primary parents.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that many public servants committed significantly more hours than this under the public service agreements.

That is a serious productivity benefit for the Exchequer.

These improvements are improved retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and also the improved appointment and retention thresholds for one-teacher schools situated 8 km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and\/or language of instruction.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Budget 2016 announced a 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule.  The improved staffing schedule which is available on the Department website has been implemented for the 2016\/17 school year.<\/p>  <p>  Following a review of the staffing allocation for\u00a0Small Primary Schools, Budget 2017 announced two adjustments in relation to one teacher schools.  Where the school is the sole primary school on an island the school will be able to appoint a second teacher.\u00a0 In relation to single teacher schools generally with an enrolment of 15 or more pupils the school can apply to the staffing appeal board for a second post where the single teacher\u00a0has children across 6 or more class groups.\u00a0 The detailed arrangements have been set out in the staffing schedule circular for the 2017\/18 school year.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The cost of restoring the 2011\/12 staffing schedule for small schools would be approximately &euro;7.5m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100069#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":507,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100069#WRL01700"},{"type":"question","counter":508,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[17794\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100069#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated cost of providing 100 additional English as additional language posts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":509,"content":"<p>The average cost of a primary EAL teacher is &euro;60,000 while the average cost of a post primary EAL teacher is &euro;63,000.<\/p>  <p>  The level of extra teaching support provided in respect of language support to schools is determined by the numbers of eligible pupils enrolled and the associated levels of those pupils' language proficiency.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I\u00a0announced that a new model for allocating Special Education Teaching Resources to mainstream primary and post primary schools will be introduced from September 2017.

There will be a role for the existing patron\/landowner in consulting with local community and school interests and taking into account proposals from different prospective multi-denominational patrons.\u00a0 It is envisaged that transfers will largely be by way of voluntary transfer of live schools by existing patrons.<\/p>  <p>  This new process for supporting transfers of schools to multi-denominational patrons in response to the wishes of local families is based around principles of transparency and cooperation.  Therefore, there will be a very substantial level of consultation of local communities in the process, both with the ETBs&rsquo; in the initial phase to establish evidence of demand by consulting pre-school parents and subsequently through the requirement for the existing patron to consult with local community and school interests in proposing to transfer patronage of an existing school to an alternative patron body. \u00a0In that process, the existing patron will also take into account proposals from all prospective multi-denominational patrons that wish to be considered. \u00a0The reconfiguration process for primary school patronage will be open to application from all patrons offering multi-denominational or non-denominational school models.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to acknowledge the voluntary nature of these transfers, given that the current patron is in most cases the owner of the land on which the school stands.\u00a0 My Department will develop protocols on patronage transfer with existing patrons to ensure that school and local communities and prospective patrons are fully consulted before a decision is made.\u00a0 I am confident that this process will respect the views of all parties - parents, local schools and communities and patrons.<\/p>  <p>  While these new structures are being introduced, my Department will continue to work with the main stakeholders to progress delivery of diversity in areas already identified, in 2017 and beyond.\u00a0 I would point out that the previous model of divestment yielded only a very limited number of schools for transfer to multi-denominational patrons.\u00a0 I believe that the reconfiguration for diversity process has the potential to significantly increase patron diversity in our school system. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100070#WRM02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"UN Committees","counter":574,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100070#WRM02300"},{"type":"question","counter":575,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[17873\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100070#WRM02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if he will implement the recommendations of the United Nations committee on the elimination of discrimination against women (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1434","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":576,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland recently appeared before the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and my Department was represented on the Irish delegation at official level.

Post primary schools must timetable\u00a0one period per week for SPHE and five to\u00a0six\u00a0timetabled periods for SPHE in the year should be assigned to RSE.

The latest residential commencements and completions data show that house-building activity is continuing to strengthen.  Completions for the 12-month period to end January 2017 stood at 15,256 homes, an 18% increase year on year.  Likewise, commencement notices for 13,334 new homes were submitted in the twelve month period to end January 2017, up 44% year on year.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Importantly,\u00a0at the end of 2016, there\u00a0were 144 active sites in the Dublin region, which will deliver approximately 5,500 new homes.  My expectation is that\u00a0some\u00a018,000 homes will be completed nationally this year.<\/p><p>While increasing supply, we also want to increase choice for all segments of the housing system including, inter alia, first-time buyers, renters, students, older people and indeed expanding families wishing to trade up.  The various housing segments are of course interlinked and interactive. <\/p><p>An important feature of the new supply is the development of key State-owned sites in the major urban areas, where demand is greatest.  The Dublin local authorities are all well advanced in bringing large-scale sites forward for mixed tenure housing with projects advancing that can deliver circa 3,000 mixed tenure homes in Dublin.  The final model for each site is the subject of careful consideration by the local authority concerned, the elected members included, who are best placed to know and provide for the housing need in their area. <\/p><p>In bringing proposals forward, local authorities are cognisant of the need to provide housing across the spectrum.  In this regard, in providing more choice for older people, perhaps living alone, to trade down to a more manageable sized home, this should provide more opportunities for those families seeking to trade up to larger homes.  My Department is actively engaging with local authorities bringing forward such proposals.<\/p><p>Identification and development of key sites in the major urban areas where demand is greatest and the recent announcement of &euro;226 million of enabling infrastructure investment to facilitate construction of some 23,000 homes by 2021 are further initiatives that will significantly boost supply.<\/p><p>In addition, to reduce the risk and impact of future housing cycles, under Pillar 4 of Rebuilding Ireland I published the Strategy for the Rental Sector (December 2016) to promote a well-developed rental market as a genuine alternative to ownership.  While many households may continue to strive to buy rather than rent,\u00a0I want to ensure\u00a0that\u00a0a\u00a0real option\u00a0to rent\u00a0exists.  A more developed rental market will also help moderate the property cycle and reduce household exposure to house price fluctuations.<\/p><p>The Government has also taken a\u00a0number of steps to\u00a0assist homeowners who wish to 'up-size' from the starter home they purchased but find themselves in negative equity. In appropriate cases, the Central Bank is allowing banks to provide new mortgages to people to move home, even if the homeowner is currently experiencing negative equity.  In addition, housing loans for borrowers in negative equity, who wish to obtain a mortgage for a new property, are not included within the scope of the LTV limits. <\/p><p>Through the\u00a0range of actions currently being progressed through Rebuilding Ireland to increase the supply of homes across all tenures,\u00a0the Government\u00a0has created the conditions required for the restoration of a more sustainable and normally functioning housing market, capable of providing\u00a0homes, at affordable price points to buy or rent, where and when they are needed for all segments of the housing system. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100073#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Data","counter":685,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100073#WRP00750"},{"type":"question","counter":686,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[17516\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100073#WRP00800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of applicants for social housing, per dwelling type, for the four Dublin local authorities; the average waiting times to be housed; if this information will be included in the statistics section of his Department's website; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":687,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[17517\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100073#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of applicants on the social housing transfer list, per dwelling type, for the four Dublin local authorities; the average waiting times to be transferred; if this information will be included in the statistics section of his Department's website; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":688,"qnumday":288,"qnumall":"[17518\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100073#WRP01000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of applicants with priority for social housing, per dwelling type, for the four Dublin local authorities; the average waiting times to be housed; if this information will be included in the statistics section of his Department's website; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":689,"content":"<p>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 286 to 288, inclusive, together. <\/p><p>The results of the statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments carried out as at\u00a021\u00a0September 2016 provide details on the number of households qualified for social housing support in each housing authority and whose housing need was not being met on that date. \u00a0<\/p><p>The 2016 results provide a breakdown by each housing authority across a range of categories, including by household composition and length of time spent by households on the record of qualified households.

Nos. 314 to 322, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The Water Services Strategic Plan is a statutory requirement under section 33 of the Water Services (No 2) Act 2013.  The plan sets out the strategic objectives for the delivery of water services by Irish Water over the 25 year period up to 2040.  It details current and future challenges which affect the provision of water services and identifies the priorities to be tackled by Irish Water in both the short and medium term.<\/p><p>The plan includes a number of key targets and indicators so that implementation of the plan can be monitored.  These include targets for achieving compliance with drinking water quality standards, targets for addressing legacy failings in relation to urban waste water treatment, targets for reduced leakage rates and lead management as well as targets for improving operational and capital efficiencies identified by the Commission for Energy Regulation.<\/p><p>The Water Services Strategic Plan was approved by the then Minister in October 2015.  It provides the first real opportunity to take a long-term view of water services investment at a national level, to ensure that investment is strategically targeted towards priority needs and to put in place an asset management approach towards investment in water services that gives the optimum balance between capital and operational spend to ensure the required service delivery to the people of Ireland over time, and at least cost.  The Irish Water Business Plan <i>Transforming Water Services in Ireland to 2021<\/i>was also published in 2015.  It outlines Irish Water&rsquo;s planned investment and financial targets for the 7-year period to 2021 and provides the basis by which Irish Water will implement the first phase of the Water Services Strategic Plan.<\/p><p>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has produced a framework to monitor Irish Water's performance over time. Performance metrics cover the areas of customer service, environmental performance, quality of service for water supply security of supply and sewerage service.  In addition, Ervia's Annual Report and Accounts and Irish Water's Financial statements are submitted to me each year and are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  These publications enable further assessment of the progress made by Irish Water towards delivering the Water Services Strategic Plan and Business Plan targets.<\/p><p>Delivering the targets set out in the Water Services Strategic Plan will however be dependent upon ensuring the required levels of funding identified in the Irish Water Business Plan to 2021 and ongoing commitment to the required funding levels beyond then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100074#WRQ03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authority Housing Data","counter":770,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100075#WRR00150"},{"type":"question","counter":771,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[18162\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100075#WRR00200","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of fire and safety inspections that have been carried out in each local authority, in tabular form, on new builds in each local authority area; and if these inspections have passed approved regulations.","asker":"1276","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":772,"qnumday":329,"qnumall":"[18242\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100075#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of enforcement notices served by local authorities on construction projects entered into the building control management software since 1 March 2014, by local authority, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1357","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":773,"qnumday":330,"qnumall":"[18243\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100075#WRR00400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of legal proceedings instigated by local authorities on construction projects entered onto the building control management software since 1 March 2014, by local authority, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1357","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":774,"qnumday":331,"qnumall":"[18244\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100075#WRR00500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"the number of High Court injunctions sought for non compliance in events of a considerable and serious danger to the public by local authorities on construction projects entered into the building control management software since 1 March 2014, by local authority, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1357","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":775,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 323, 329, 330 and 331 together.<\/p><p>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s request, these are matters for local authorities, who are independent in the use of their statutory powers under the Building Control Acts 1990 &ndash; 2014.<\/p><p>In relation to inspections, the Local Government Management Agency collected data on inspections carried out on buildings and published it in the\u00a0Service Indicators in Local Authorities reports from 2005 to 2013.

I expect to be in a position to make a statement on the matter in the coming weeks, outlining the timelines for implementation of the various elements. <\/p><p>As part of the overall review, and having regard to a recent ECJ Judgement in Case C-290\/15 on the Belgian\/Wallonian wind energy regulatory order, it is proposed to undertake a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) of the proposed revised Wind Energy Development Guidelines before they come into effect. This assessment will be in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001\/24\/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment.<\/p><p>SEA is a process by which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process. <\/p><p>The SEA process comprises a number of stages including: screening, scoping, environmental assessment, public consultation and implementation.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Screening is a process which considers whether a particular plan or programme, other than those for which SEA is mandatory, would be likely to have significant environmental effects, and would thus warrant SEA.\u00a0\u00a0Scoping is the procedure whereby the range of environmental issues and the level of detail to be included in the SEA Environmental Report are decided upon, in consultation with the prescribed environmental authorities.\u00a0 The environmental assessment stage identifies, describes and evaluates any likely significant effects on the environment of implementing the proposed plan or programme.\u00a0 Following this, the SEA Environmental Report and draft Plan (i.e. the Draft Revisions to the\u00a0Wind Energy Development Guidelines) are put out to public consultation,\u00a0which is likely to be for\u00a0a period of 6 to 8 weeks in this case.\u00a0 The outcome of the public consultation must then be taken into account, together with the integration of environmental considerations, prior to the plan or being finalised and adopted.\u00a0In the case of the Wind Energy Development Guidelines, a\u00a0SEA Statement (Information on Decision)\u00a0will then be published by\u00a0my Department when the plan is formally adopted.<\/p><p>It is currently estimated that the SEA process in relation to the proposed revisions to the Wind Energy Development Guidelines will take approximately 6 months.<\/p><p>There have been a number of SEAs recently carried out on national-level plans and programmes across a number of sectors, such as the SEA conducted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine for the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2014-2020, as well as the SEAs that my Department is presently undertaking in relation to the proposed National Planning Framework: Ireland 2040 - Our Plan and the Draft River Basin Management Plan for Ireland (2018-2021).\u00a0 <\/p><p>In line with the requirements of the Office of Government Procurement (OGP), any procurement undertaken by my Department in respect of the SEA process on the Wind Energy Development Guidelines will comply with national and EU procurement rules and procedures as advised on the OGP website , and in accordance with associated guidelines provided on the eTenders website , which is managed by the OGP.\u00a0 It is expected that it will take approximately 3 months to complete the tender process in this regard.<\/p><p>In light of the\u00a0these requirements, which\u00a0it is\u00a0estimated will take approximately 9 months in total, it is likely that while the draft proposals for revised Guidelines will be available shortly, the Guidelines themselves will not be finalised and come into effect until the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100076#WRS00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Commercial Rates","counter":782,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100077#WRT00200"},{"type":"question","counter":783,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[18209\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100077#WRT00300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will consider introducing a reduction in commercial rates as an incentive for new businesses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1318","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":784,"content":"<p>Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation pursuant to the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015.

The additional capacity was and is essential, to facilitate meaningful engagement with all those who are unemployed &ndash; in particular the long-term unemployed (who need more intensive levels of engagement).<\/p>  <p>  Given the nature of the resourcing requirement, that contracted service provision is common practice in EU\/OECD countries and given that the use of contracted service provision was suggested by the NESC and OECD, among others, and given the constraints on Exchequer finances, it was concluded that a contracted, payment by results model, was the most appropriate approach. <\/p>  <p>  In November 2012, following a public procurement competition, the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion (&lsquo;CESI&rsquo; a UK based leading not-for-profit company dedicated to tackling disadvantage and promoting social inclusion in the labour market) was appointed to provide the Department with expert advice and assistance relating to the design and delivery of an employment service model (&ldquo;JobPath&rdquo;) <\/p>  <p>  Based on its knowledge of the operation of contracted employment services in other States, CESI provided advice with regard to the design of the JobPath model including detailed financial modelling of a payment by results approach in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The JobPath contract model was designed over an extended period taking account of advice from Irish and international experts on contracting of employment services and inputs received following a number of public stakeholder consultations\/briefings. <\/p>  <p>  On 12 December 2013, the Department published a contract notice inviting tenders for the provision of JobPath services.  The Tender documentation was published on www.etenders.gov.ie  while information on JobPath was published and continues to be available on www.welfare.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The Request for Tenders (RFT) details all aspects of the JobPath Service, including the fact that it is intended to function as a payment by results model.  This means that all initial outlay expenditure, such as costs of premises, staff recruitment and training, etc.  are borne by the  provider companies.<\/p>  <p>  The RFT advised that the successful tenderers must have the ability to satisfy the Service Contract requirements in terms of scale and duration, and were therefore required to demonstrate a cash generation sufficient to undertake the provision of the JobPath Service, and be in a sufficiently robust position to service debt obligations and contingencies or other liabilities which may arise over the term of the Agreement.  Potential tenderers were advised that they may rely on the financial resources of other entities for the purposes of demonstrating their economic and financial standing, but they must demonstrate that they had the capacity to raise the finance required to deliver the service.<\/p>  <p>  In line with Government policy, participation by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the procurement exercise was specifically referenced in the introduction to the RFT.  Per paragraph 1.5 on page 5 of the RFT it is stated that SMEs who believed that the scope of the procurement was beyond their technical or business capacity were encouraged to explore the possibilities of forming relationships with other SMEs or with larger enterprises.  Through such relationships they would be enabled to participate in and contribute to the successful implementation of any contracts, agreements or arrangements arising from the competition.  In addition, larger enterprises were also encouraged to consider the practical ways that SMEs could be involved in their proposals to maximise the social and economic benefits of the contracts  resulting from this particular public procurement competition.<\/p>  <p>  The RFT did not, therefore, preclude the submission of tenders by any company, or amalgamation of companies, and it is not the case that the intention was to award contracts exclusively to large private companies. <\/p>  <p>  Contracts were awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender based on the following criteria (i) cost, (ii) implementation of services, (iii) delivery of services and (iv) contract management and governance.  Full details of the JobPath procurement requirements and evaluation criteria used during the tender process are set out in the &ldquo;Request for Tenders for the Provision of Employment Services (JobPath)&rdquo;, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.welfare.ie\/en\/Pages\/JobPath.aspx. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the two companies can and do engaged with a range of other companies for the provision of various services and they employ some 600 people either themselves or through sub-contracted relationships.<\/p>  <p>  Finally as in previous years, for 2017 the department has contracts in place with in excess of 60 companies for the provision of the Local Employment Service (LES) and Job Clubs.  In addition, the Department also contracts with other companies for the delivery of community employment schemes and community service programmes.  The Department therefore has and continues to have contracts for the provision of services with a wide variety of organisations.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100079#WRV01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":885,"content":"<p>Question No. 363 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Benefit Eligibility","counter":886,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100079#WRV01300"},{"type":"question","counter":887,"qnumday":364,"qnumall":"[17731\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100079#WRV01400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"if he will change the guidelines of the child benefit payment to include 18 year olds that are still in school to be in receipt of the payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":888,"content":"<p>Child Benefit is a monthly payment made to families with children in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years.

At present, entitlement to the contributory pension is determined by means of a &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life (i.e. the period between when they first entered insurable employment and the year of pension age).  The yearly average test has been in existence since 1961 when contributory pensions were first introduced.  Payment rates are banded, e.g., someone with a yearly average of 48 or more contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20-29 will qualify for a pension at the 85% rate. <\/p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.  My Department has estimated that the annual cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost some &euro;290m in 2017, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the rate of the overall cost of State pensions.  This is a significant cost.  The main beneficiaries would be people who already have significant household means, and who don&rsquo;t therefore qualify for a means-tested payment.<\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a State pension (non-contributory), which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  While this payment is subject to a household means-test, there are very significant disregards which mean that over 70% of such pensioners qualify at the full rate.<\/p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform<\/p>  <p>  The forthcoming independent Actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund will provide data that will allow officials to accurately cost and project various options available under the Total Contributions Approach currently being developed.  Following the analysis of that data, it is intended to have a public consultation, in mid-2017, and following this, proposals on the final details of the scheme will be made by the Government to the Oireachtas before the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100080#WRW04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":960,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100081#WRX00150"},{"type":"question","counter":961,"qnumday":392,"qnumall":"[18308\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100081#WRX00200","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of an application for a carer's allowance by a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":962,"content":"<p>Carer&rsquo;s allowance was awarded to the person concerned on 5 April 2017 and the first payment is due to issue to their nominated post office on 13 April 2017.<\/p><p>Arrears of allowance due from 15 December 2016 to 12 April 2017 will also issue to the post office.<\/p><p>The person concerned was notified of these details on 5 April 2017.<\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100081#WRX00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":963,"content":"<p>Question No. 393 answered with Question No. 341.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Appeals Delays","counter":964,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100081#WRX00450"},{"type":"question","counter":965,"qnumday":394,"qnumall":"[18334\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100081#WRX00500","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the current backlog in respect of appeals for means tested payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":966,"content":"<p>The average processing times to date in 2017 for appeals relating to means-tested payments are set out in the table below. <\/p><p>Appeal processing times are kept under constant scrutiny by the Chief Appeals Officer.

The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.<\/p>  <p>  People claiming supports under the SWA scheme generally only interact with the Department on an occasional basis, for example, when seeking an exceptional needs payment (ENP) or in claiming additional supports such as rent supplement.  The availability of the Community Welfare Service (CWS) during normal office hours is therefore sufficient for general day to day requirements.  However, in response to emergency situations such as those caused by severe weather events, local management assesses the response required to ensure that supports are provided to those affected as swiftly as possible.  This may include provision of emergency or out of hours services and may be supplemented by facilitating clients with individual appointments and making house calls.<\/p>  <p>  My Department may provide an ENP to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  An urgent needs payment (UNP) can be paid as a once-off payment made to persons who would not normally qualify for SWA but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or an alternative is not available at that time, for example in the aftermath of a domestic fire or other event where the people affected have an immediate need for support.  The Government has provided &euro;31.5 million for ENPs and UNPs in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  There is no automatic entitlement to an ENP, it is payable at the discretion of the Department&rsquo;s representative, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  An application can be made under the ENP scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses where there is an inability to pay these costs, in part or in full, by the family of the deceased person without causing hardship.<\/p>  <p>  Statistics are maintained relating to payments under the ENP scheme, however they are not maintained on the number of applications or the outcome of those applications.  Some 2,900 ENPs for assistance with funeral and burial costs issued in 2016 at a total cost of approximately &euro;5 million.

The combination of the means test and awarding differentiated rates of payment is premised on ensuring that social welfare payments are paid to those most in need and reflects the position that persons with reasonable amounts of income, capital and property are in a position to use that resource to support themselves.<\/p>  <p>  The rent supplement scheme is supporting some 44,800 tenants for which the Government has provided &euro;253 million for in 2017.  The scheme is generally available to people whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and do not have alternative accommodation available.  Rent supplement&rsquo;s means test is calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay.  The standard weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;40 for coupled households.  Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are required, subject to income disregards, to contribute a proportion of assessable means towards their accommodation costs.  As part of this means test, a capital assessment is completed which includes savings, investments, property (other than the family home) and would include any monies realised following a settlement outlined by the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has no role in financial and other settlements made between couples on separation, divorce or otherwise.

The rate of payment to a person is related to the number of contributions made over the years into the Social Insurance Fund by the person.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension (contributory), all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  Entitlement levels are calculated by means of a &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life.  Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20 will qualify for a pension at 85% of the full rate.<\/p>  <p>  The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect for periods from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has estimated that the annual cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost some &euro;290m in 2017, and this figure would rise at a faster rate than the rate of the overall cost of State pensions.  This is a very significant cost, and the main beneficiaries would be people who already have significant household means, and who do not therefore qualify for a means-tested payment.<\/p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a State pension (non-contributory), which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.  While this payment is subject to a household means-test, there are very significant disregards which mean that over 70% of such pensioners qualify at the full rate.<\/p>  <p>  Following on from the proposal in the National Pensions Framework (2010) that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020, officials of my Department are currently working on its detailed development, with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100082#WRY00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":983,"qnumday":400,"qnumall":"[18340\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100082#WRY00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which he can address the anomalies of the situation whereby persons with a mixture of PAYE and self-employed contributions may find themselves entitled to only a reduced rate of pension arising from the 1988 Act which now apparently does not enable the applicant to choose the most beneficial basis on which to claim a pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":984,"content":"<p><b><\/b>All applications for state pension (contributory) must be assessed under the eligibility conditions set out in social welfare legislation.

This was the case in some 35% of favourable appeal outcomes in 2015 and some 37% of favourable appeal outcomes in 2016.  Where the decision is not revised in the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds.  In addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at oral hearing which may also influence the outcome of the appeal.<\/p><p>Social Welfare legislation provides that an Appeals Officer may determine an appeal without an oral hearing where s\/he is of the opinion that it can be determined fairly on the basis of the documentary evidence provided.  In general, where there is a conflict in the documentary evidence presented, an Appeals Officer will convene an oral hearing in order to explore the evidence and seek to resolve any conflict.<\/p><p>In addition, where an appellant requests an oral hearing, the request is generally granted unless the Appeals Officer is of the opinion that the appeal can be allowed on a summary basis, or where there is clearly nothing to be gained by granting an oral hearing.  An example of this would be where the appeal question relates to PRSI contribution conditions or means and the underlying PRSI contribution figures or means are not disputed.<\/p><p>I trust this

twofold.First, through policies set out in the Action Plan for Jobs, to create an environment in which business can succeed and create jobs; and second, through Pathways to Work, to ensure that as many as possible of these new jobs and other vacancies that arise in our economy are filled by people taken from the Live Register, including young people. <\/p><p>Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall with a rate of 13.9% (29,700 persons) in March 2017 estimated by CSO, as compared to 17.3% (33,700 persons) in March 2016 and a peak of over 31% (70,600 persons) in 2012.<\/p><p>While systemised data is not readily available on employment outcomes for all programmes, some indicative figures are available for people aged under 25 at a national level.  For example:<\/p><p>- The evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon (report published October 2016), shows on the basis of self-reported survey results that 61% of interns aged 20 to 24 years (and 53.8% of those aged 15-19) were currently in employment at the time of the survey. Overall, individuals similar to those who participated in JobBridge had a 36.6% probability of securing employment within one year, whereas the JobBridge interns&rsquo; probability of securing employment within one year increased to 48.4% (an 11.8 percentage point difference and a 32% increase in the probability of becoming employed).<\/p><p>- JobsPlus provides subsidies to employers for the full-time employment of those formerly long-term unemployed on the Live Register.  In October 2016 there were 4,323 participants benefiting from JobsPlus, 765 (17.7%) of whom were under 25.<\/p><p>- In 2015 the level of satisfaction among under 25 year old Intreo clients with getting on to course, training or getting a job was very high at 4.27, out of a possible maximum of 5.  Results from the 2016 Customer Satisfaction Survey will be published shortly and show a similar high level of satisfaction among under 25 year old Intreo clients with getting on to course, training or getting a job.<\/p><p>Under the Government&rsquo;s policies to support the young unemployed, the first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  There is monthly engagement with all young jobseekers by a case officer, and a Personal Progression Plan is developed to chart the steps to be taken to facilitate a return to employment, which may include further education and training or other opportunities. <\/p><p>For those who do not find employment, through the process just described, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes\/workplace based interventions such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s and First Steps; or in subsidies to employers, through JobsPlus Youth. Long-term unemployed jobseekers under 25 are also referred to JobPath, a contracted, payment-by-results employment services that provides additional resources and supports to those long-term unemployed.<\/p><p>The strategy document<i>Pathways to Work 2016 to 2020<\/i>includes some additional actions in relation to addressing youth unemployment:<\/p><p>1) increase the relative share of workplace-based interventions (Gateway, T&Uacute;S, Positive to Work etc.) for youth unemployed;<\/p><p>2) ensure the frequency of engagement with all young unemployed people is a minimum of one case officer meeting per month;<\/p><p>3) restructure the First Steps programme for young unemployed people to improve take-up by offering a higher level of support to jobseekers and employers<\/p><p>4) implement the Defence Forces Skills for Life employment support programme.  <\/p><p>Each of these actions is either ongoing or has been completed.<\/p><p>I am satisfied that these policy measures, together with an improving labour market, will continue to address youth unemployment and support further improvements in the labour market situation for young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100083#WRZ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits Eligibility","counter":992,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100083#WRZ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":993,"qnumday":403,"qnumall":"[18343\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100083#WRZ00600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the extent to which the self-employed can qualify for various social welfare supports now and in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":994,"content":"<p>Self-employed people who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year, are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum annual payment of &euro;500.<\/p>  <p>  This provides them with access to the following benefits: State pension (contributory) and widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory), maternity benefit and adoptive benefit and, since September 2016, the newly introduced paternity benefit.<\/p>  <p>  Core to the Programme for Government is improving the position of the self-employed generally, including the commitment to introduce an enhanced PRSI scheme for the self-employed.<\/p>  <p>  Making progress on this commitment has been one of my key priorities since becoming Minister in this Department.

Reports about this man&rsquo;s health are a matter of the utmost concern to the Government.  In light if these concerns the Government took the unprecedented step last month of making arrangements for an Irish doctor, nominated by the Chief Medical Officer, to visit him in prison and to make an assessment of his health.<\/p>  <p>  While the doctor&rsquo;s findings are, of course, a private and confidential matter, I can confirm that the Irish doctor shared his assessment and recommendations with the prison authorities who have a clear responsibility to ensure this man&rsquo;s welfare while he remains within the Egyptian prison system. The Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have consistently underlined our concerns in all contacts with Egyptian interlocutors and made clear that we expect them to fulfil their responsibilities in relation to this man&rsquo;s welfare and well-being.  Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Cairo is continuing to follow up on these matters.<\/p>  <p>  I have been concerned by persistent reports that the citizen in question is pursuing a hunger strike.  The Government has consistently stressed to him and to his family that he should not pursue such a course of action, which will only be damaging to his well-being and his cause, and that he should look after his health by eating properly and cooperating with medical tests and investigations that are arranged on his behalf.  <\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has in recent days renewed the Government&rsquo;s appeal to the Egyptian President to release this Irish citizen and return him to Ireland without delay.

My EU counterparts and I also met with the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States, Ahmed Abou El Gheit.  The conflict in Syria is causing untold suffering and displacement of civilians on the ground. At the Council meeting, I and my EU counterparts condemned once again the continued systematic, widespread and gross violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by all parties, especially the Syrian regime.  We made clear that the Syrian regime has the primary responsibility for the protection of the Syrian population, and call upon the regime and its allies, notably Russia, to undertake all efforts to ensure a full cessation of hostilities; the lifting of sieges; and full unhindered sustainable country-wide humanitarian access.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's humanitarian assistance to the victims of the Syria crisis reached &euro;76 million as of March 2017, and we pledged a further &euro;25 million at the recent conference on &ldquo;Supporting the future of Syria and the region&rdquo; which was held in Brussels on Wednesday 5 April.  This is Irish Aid's largest response to a single crisis in recent years, which is indicative of the level of priority we attach to the issue. <\/p>  <p>  EU Foreign Ministers also discussed the severe humanitarian crisis in Yemen, which is also of grave concern.  I have previously discussed Yemen with my counterparts in the Gulf region, and raised concerns about the humanitarian situation and attacks which have directly impacted on civilians.  I and my EU colleagues reiterated our strong support for the efforts of the UN Secretary General and the UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed to achieve a resumption of negotiations and called on all parties to urgently agree on a cessation of hostilities to be monitored by the UN as a first step towards the resumption of peace talks under UN leadership. Ireland has provided almost &euro;6 million in humanitarian aid to Yemen since the conflict began and will maintain our support in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  The Council also discussed the political situation in Libya, and the urgent need for a political solution that would unite the country under the Libyan Peace Agreement.<\/p>  <p>  This was the first meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council since the UK formally triggered Article 50 on 29 March and the circulation of the draft negotiation guidelines on 31 March.

I was horrified to learn of the apparent chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun last week which killed scores of civilians and seriously injured many more.  The attack was simply barbaric, and my thoughts are with the victims and their families. I condemn unreservedly the attack and those responsible.<\/p>  <p>  I am also aware of course of the US missile strikes on Shayrat Airfield in Syria.

Both Governments agreed on the need for intensive engagement to address outstanding issues and commitments to ensure the early establishment of an Executive.  As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, both Governments have a role to play in supporting the effective operation of the devolved institutions, and in upholding both the letter and the spirit of the Agreement as a whole, in the interests of all in Northern Ireland.  In this context I am representing the Government in the ongoing intensive talks in Belfast.  The talks have two objectives. Firstly, to allow the political parties to reach an agreement on the formation of a new Executive.  Secondly, to address the implementation of outstanding issues from previous Agreements.  These current discussions structured around a shared approach put forward by both Governments follow on from talks last month where it did not prove possible for the political parties in Northern Ireland to reach agreement on the establishment of a power-sharing Executive before the statutory deadline of 27 March.<\/p>  <p>  Overall there is encouraging progress being made in this renewed phase but I am under no illusions about the challenge of resolving the core issues that remain outstanding.  Serious issues remain to be resolved - including those which were to the fore before the collapse of the last Executive and during the election campaign.  However with resolve and determination from all the parties, and support and encouragement from the two Governments, I believe a successful outcome is possible.<\/p>  <p>  As part of my engagement with the Secretary of State and with each of the parties in the discussions in recent days, I have strongly emphasised the critical importance of forming a new Executive so that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s interests can be effectively represented, as part of the process of the EU-UK negotiations which are about to commence.  I very much hope that the new Executive will be in place as soon as possible so that it can directly represent the interests of the people of Northern Ireland in these negotiations which are of major significance.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to participate in the discussions in Belfast this week as required, working with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties to see the power-sharing Assembly and Executive restored to effective and harmonious operation.  As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement the Government is determined to uphold the principles of the Agreement and protect its institutions.<\/p>  <p>  While time is extremely tight, I remain hopeful of a positive outcome to the discussions, and strongly urge all parties to work intensively and cooperatively, to secure the power-sharing institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, and ensure effective devolved government, as was so evidently voted for by the people in Northern Ireland in the recent election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100083#WRZ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":1018,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100083#WRZ03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1019,"qnumday":413,"qnumall":"[17734\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100083#WRZ03200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will address concerns with regard to the passport express service (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1020,"content":"<p>The Passport Service aims to process passport renewal applications submitted through Passport Express within 15 working days of receipt, assuming that all documentation is in order.

These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the bombings.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-Party D&aacute;il motions, and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government.  The Taoiseach has raised the issue with Prime Minister May, including at their meeting in Dublin on 30 January, emphasising the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the D&aacute;il motions.  I have also raised the matter on a number of occasions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire.<\/p><p>In our discussions, I have advised Secretary of State Brokenshire that the D&aacute;il motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin Monaghan atrocities.  I have also underlined to the Secretary of State that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House, and emphasised the urgent need for a response from the British Government. Secretary of State Brokenshire has acknowledged the importance that the Government and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann attach to this case, but indicated that the British Government is still considering how it could respond in a way which would adequately address the motions and be consistent with its obligations.<\/p><p>The Government is continuing to pursue this matter with the British Government, urging them to provide a satisfactory response to the motions that have been adopted by this House.  The Taoiseach and I will also continue our engagement with party leaders in the Oireachtas on the issue.<\/p><p>In relation to the Kingsmill massacre, I understand that the inquest hearings into the deaths will shortly resume, following the decision of the Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland in February not to proceed with a prosecution.  That there will not be a prosecution is a further disappointment to the families of the victims who died in this atrocity, and the sole survivor, who have waited so long for justice.<\/p><p>The Government has committed to full co-operation within the law with the Kingsmill inquest.  Further to this commitment, the Garda Authorities have worked with the Northern Ireland Coroner, and transfers of the relevant material, in accordance with the law, have taken place to the Coroner in support of the inquest.  The Irish Authorities remain in direct contact with the Northern Ireland Coroner, as part of an ongoing legal process of cooperation, to identify ways in which any further support or assistance can be given to the Inquest, in accordance with the law.<\/p><p>Regarding the case of the late Pat Finucane, I was glad to accept an invitation to deliver the annual Pat Finucane Memorial Lecture in Belfast on 23 February last.  In doing so, I reaffirmed the firm view and position of the Government that a satisfactory outcome will best be achieved through a full public inquiry into the appalling murder of Mr. Finucane, honouring the commitment made by both Governments at Weston Park in 2001.  We have made this position clear to the British Government on a number of occasions, including in recent discussions between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, and will continue to do so.<\/p><p>Also, the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers decided in December 2015, at Ireland&rsquo;s request, to consider a re-opening of measures in the case of Pat Finucane, when the domestic proceedings in Belfast have concluded.  This decision of the Committee of Minister was reaffirmed in December 2016 and the matter will next be considered by the Committee of Ministers in June as part of the review of the <i>McKerr<\/i>group of cases.  I am informed that the recent decision of the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal in this case may be the subject of a further appeal.<\/p><p>There are many families across all communities on these islands, and beyond, who continue to deal with the awful pain of losing a loved one, as well as with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events.

In these discussions, I have been very clear on the urgent need to achieve progress, so that the institutions can be established and start working to meet the needs of victims and survivors and to support broader societal healing and reconciliation.  I have also emphasised in discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the political parties, the need to ensure that legacy inquests are properly resourced, and urged all with responsibilities in relation to the legacy inquests to move forward as quickly as possible to implement the helpful proposals of the Lord Chief Justice.<\/p><p>The Government will continue its intensive engagement with all parties to move forward with the Stormont House legacy framework, and I hope that this can be achieved in the very near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100084#WRAA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"North-South Ministerial Council","counter":1055,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100084#WRAA01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1056,"qnumday":425,"qnumall":"[10421\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100084#WRAA01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he will report on the North-South Ministerial Council and ensure that the treaties and agreements between Ireland and the UK will be fully implemented.","asker":"1224","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1057,"content":"<p>At the most recent Plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) on 18 November 2016 in Armagh the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed on a number of important common principles for dealing with the United Kingdom&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union on an all-island basis.

As a co-guarantor of the Agreement, the Government is also determined to uphold its principles and protect its institutions.  To this end I will continue my engagement in the ongoing discussions with the British Government and the political parties in Northern Ireland, to see the see devolved institutions restored and working effectively in the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  In the event of a future referendum within the consent provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government would make all necessary preparations in accordance with the terms of the Constitution and the principles and procedures of the Agreement.  The Deputy will appreciate that the prospect of any such referendum in the future would be a most significant step for the Government and for the country and the necessary scoping work could only proceed on the basis of extensive preparation and appropriate consultation.<\/p>  <p>  There are of course aspects of this constitutional issue which relate to my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work. In the context of Brexit, the Government has made clear its determination to ensure respect for all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, including those relating to a possible change in constitutional status for Northern Ireland, regardless of the UK&rsquo;s status within the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100084#WRAA03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"White Papers Publication","counter":1070,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100084#WRAA03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1071,"qnumday":430,"qnumall":"[12043\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100084#WRAA03300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the publication of the European Commission's\u00a0White Paper on the Future of Europe\u00a0published on\u00a01 March 2017.","asker":"1330","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1072,"content":"<p>I welcome the publication of the Commission's White Paper on the Future of Europe.

It takes an open and non-prescriptive approach and is presented as an initial contribution to a Europe-wide discussion and debate.  This approach is welcome and is in keeping with the need to renew the EU's contract with its citizens.  The promised publication later this year of more detailed papers on a range of specific issues will also contribute to the Europe-wide discussions that this White Paper seeks to initiate.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that all member States, national parliaments and citizens across Europe are involved in this discussion in the period ahead.  In the first instance, I would suggest that it might be appropriate for the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to take up consideration of the White Paper.<\/p>  <p>  The White Paper should also be seen in the light of the Declaration of twenty-seven Heads of State or Government, which issued in Rome to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the signature of the Treaty of Rome.

The flood maps were developed, making use of the information available at the time, including information on the event of November 2009, which was the most extreme on record by a significant margin.  The subsequent flood event of the Winter of 2015-2016 was exceptionally severe, more extreme even than the Shannon flood of November 2009.  The area had hence suffered two particularly extreme floods in recent years.  Based on this and information that was collated and provided over the months after the flood, the OPW decided to undertake a review of the flood maps.<\/p>  <p>  The OPW accordingly commissioned its consultants to undertake a review in the Autumn 2016.  The outcome of this review has been a slight increase in the design flood levels in the lower Shannon in this area.  The assessment of options in this area has therefore also been reviewed to determine if potentially viable options for flood risk management measures might be available.  This work has involved re-examining the flood damages, the possible options and the economic justification for the options. <\/p>  <p>  A potentially viable option for flood risk management has been found, based principally on flood defences, with some pumping required to remove rainwater falling behind the defences during times of flood.  The proposed option has a standard of protection of a 1000-yr flood, a 0.1% annual exceedence probability, which is above the normal standard and so offers a very robust level of protection.  The measure will protect the homes in the area that are prone to flooding, and also the road providing access to the properties that are elevated above the past flood levels such that access and egress to these properties would be maintained during times of flood once the flood protection measures are in place.<\/p>  <p>  The revised maps and the proposed option for managing the flood risk in Clonlara as described above were presented to the public for consultation at a local Public Consultation Day held on Thursday 23 March.  A large number of people from the community attended, with a generally positive response.<\/p>  <p>  The responses and feedback from the consultation will now be reviewed by the OPW and its consultants, and a proposed measure will be set out in the final flood risk management plans.  Once the plans are approved, the measures set out in the plans may be progressed through detailed design and the relevant planning and approval processes on towards construction.<\/p>  <p>  The current position regarding the CFRAM Programme is that the flood risk management plans are now being finalised and this process is near completion.

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin but can occasionally be more severe and highly debilitating. Lyme disease is the commonest cause of tick-borne infection in Europe.  <\/p><p>In general, it is accepted clinical practice in Ireland, the UK, Europe and North America that laboratory confirmation is unnecessary for a confidently-made, clinical diagnosis of erythema migrans (the initial primary skin lesion of Lyme borreliosis).  However, this only affects about &frac34; of patients.  For later presentation Lyme borreliosis, the two-tier system is necessary to ensure that false-positive diagnosis (i.e. the test incorrectly indicates a patient has Lyme disease when, in fact, they do not have the disease) are kept to a minimum.  Serological testing for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi is the mainstay of diagnostic testing.<\/p><p>There have been significant improvements in antibody testing in recent years, making diagnosis more certain than in the past.  Testing for Lyme borreliosis is currently undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage process and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA &ndash; a test to detect proteins found in the Borrelia bacterium) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions (i.e. leading to over diagnosis) in the presence of other infections such as syphilis, and certain, common viral infections including glandular fever.  In addition, false-positive results can also occur in patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions including, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, diabetes or ulcerative colitis.  Samples giving reactive or equivocal results in Initial screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage, confirmatory immunoblot (such as Western blot) test.  Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity (i.e. it reduces the likelihood of these false positive results).  Using this two stage approach gives a considerably greater degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme.  All clinical (and other) laboratories in Ireland, must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the laboratory tests they provide is maintained at conform to the highest internationally-accepted standards of microbiological excellence.  <\/p><p>As testing for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland there is no requirement for people to travel to other EU Member States to access this service.

It is also important to ensure that prescribing policies are evidence based thereby ensuring safe use of these medicines.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that all medicines have side effects.  However before being made available to the public a medicine undergoes an authorisation process where the medicine&rsquo;s safety, quality and efficacy is assessed, based on the results of clinical trials.  It is only when the risk benefit analysis is positive, i.e. that the potential benefits to the patient outweigh the potential risks that the medicine receives an authorisation.  <\/p>  <p>  Once available a medicine is then subject to ongoing monitoring and evaluation through a process of pharmacocovigilance which operates at EU wide level to monitor the use of the medicines in large numbers of patients and manage and analyse information on suspected adverse reactions to medicines.  <\/p>  <p>  European reviews of certain antipsychotics, antidepressants, stimulants and opioids have resulted in updates to product information in order to support better informed prescribing and use of these medicines in various patient groups including children.  Important safety updates are communicated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) to healthcare professionals via their Drug Safety Newsletter.  The HPRA, in conjunction with its European counterparts continues to review the safety of authorised medicines and take appropriate regulatory action when necessary.  <\/p>  <p>  In Ireland there are a number of sources of prescribing guidelines.  More recent guidelines include a Consensus Statement issued by the College of Psychiatry on the use of benzodiazepines in specialist mental health services (2012), Guidance issued by the Irish College of General Practitioners on Child and Adolescent Mental Health: Diagnosis and Management (2013), and the Medical Council Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners 2016.  Section 42 of the Medical Council Guide states for example that doctors should keep up to date with developments in medication safety and seek independent, evidence-based sources of information on the benefits and risk of the medicine.  It also states that doctors should be aware of the dangers of drug dependency when prescribing benzodiazepines, opiates and other drugs with addictive potential and should take reasonable steps to make sure they are not inappropriately obtaining drugs from multiple sources. <\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has also been actively involved in ensuring appropriate prescribing of psychotropic drugs.  Reports are sent to GPs on a regular basis setting out the number of benzodiazepine and &lsquo;z&rsquo; drug prescriptions dispensed to their patients and these reports allow GPs to compare their prescribing patterns to their peers.  The reports also highlight where patients are on these medications for longer than the recommended period.  The HSE Medicines Management Programme has also written to hospital consultants recommending that where a patient is not being treated with benzodiazepines or z drugs on entering hospital that the discharge summary should not contain such medication. <\/p>  <p>   The Misuse of Drugs legislation imposes tight controls on all controlled drugs.  A number of changes to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations are due to be implemented shortly.  One of the most significant effects of the new Regulation in relation to benzodiazepines and z drugs is that the restrictions in place on the possession of controlled drugs will now apply to these medicines.  A form of controlled drug prescription will now be required for these medicines. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100089#WRGG04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1307"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":1298,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100089#WRGG04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1299,"qnumday":510,"qnumall":"[17653\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100089#WRGG04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 414 of 7 February 2017, if the decision to be made in quarter 1 of 2017 to go to tender to build the new permanent ambulance base on the Merlin Park site has been taken; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1316","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1300,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100089#WRGG04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Nurses","counter":1302,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100090#WRHH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1303,"qnumday":511,"qnumall":"[17655\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100090#WRHH00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that nurses were removed from the active register within two weeks of receipt of a final reminder notice to pay their annual retention fee, ARF, albeit that the reminder notice stated no action would be taken for 28 days following the date of issue from that final reminder; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1304,"qnumday":512,"qnumall":"[17656\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100090#WRHH00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of nurses that have been removed from the active register before the 28 day period from their final reminder notice date of 8 March 2017 had been reached; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1305,"qnumday":513,"qnumall":"[17657\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100090#WRHH00500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if nurses who had been removed from the active register within 28 days of their final reminder notice are now reinstated; if those who were removed before the expiry of the 28-day period but not yet reinstated will be reinstated without penalty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1306,"qnumday":514,"qnumall":"[17658\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100090#WRHH00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if those nurses who were forced to pay an additional &euro;250 to be reinstated before the 28-day period of notice from their final reminder letter will be refunded the additional cost they were forced to incur to be reregistered","asker":"1284","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1307,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 511 to 514, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this matter.<\/p>  <p>  Section 38 of the Nurses and Midwives Act, 2011 enables the Board of the NMBI to charge such fees as may, from time to time, be determined by the Board - this includes a fee for the restoration of a person's name to the register.  Section 77 of the 2011 Act allows the Board to remove a person's name from the register for non-payment of the annual retention fee (ARF). In that regard, this Section indicates that the Board may, not earlier than 28 days after the reminder has been sent, remove the nurse&rsquo;s or midwife&rsquo;s registration.<\/p>  <p>  The NMBI have advised that a renewal notice and a reminder notice were issued to registrants on 6 November 2016 and 15 February 2017 respectively.  Consideration of removal of names from the register is not considered by the Board until at least 28 days has elapsed from the date of the reminder notice. In addition, a final reminder was sent to registrants on 8 March 2017.  The Board decided on 21 March 2017 that 2,258 people who had not paid their ARF would be removed from the register.  The NMBI have advised that the final reminder which issued on 8th March 2017 indicated that the Board would consider removals from the register at its meeting on 21 March.  Registrants were informed that the fee must be paid with immediate effect to avoid removal. <\/p>  <p>The Board has also confirmed that anyone who has been removed from the register must complete the restoration form and pay the restoration fee of &euro;250.

The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is responsible for monitoring the safety and quality of all medicines that are licensed in Ireland.  The HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in Europe continually monitor adverse events to vaccination. The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA have been consistent with the expected pattern of short term adverse side effects for the vaccine, as described in the product information. The most frequently reported side effects are local redness and \/or swelling at the point of injection and fever.  These are usually mild and temporary reactions to any kind of vaccination.  Fainting has occurred after vaccination with Gardasil, especially in adolescents. <\/p>  <p>  The EMA completed a detailed scientific review in November 2015 of the evidence surrounding reports of two conditions: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).  The Agency&rsquo;s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use concurred that the available evidence does not support that CRPS and POTS are caused by HPV vaccines.  It therefore did not recommend any changes to the terms of licensing or the product information for these medicines. On 12 January 2016 the European Commission endorsed the conclusions of the European Medicines Agency, that there is no change to the way HPV vaccines are used, or to amend the current product information.  This final outcome by the Commission is now binding in all members states.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women. An illness that occurs around the time a vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply the vaccine caused the problem.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition.  It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The diverse nature of these symptoms, which can have both physical and psychological causes, are shared by many conditions which has implications for both diagnostic and treatment services.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the HSE are currently working to put in place clinical care pathways appropriate to the differing medical needs of this group.  \tAs there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes long term illnesses, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for these illnesses. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to counter misinformation in relation to the safety of vaccines, and to increase the uptake rates of all vaccines in the State&rsquo;s immunisation programmes.  The scientific evidence is clear and misinformation is causing real harm to those unvaccinated children and adults who develop vaccine preventable diseases, and to people who seek inappropriate treatments for real conditions that are not caused by vaccines.  The benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh the known side effects.  The safety of these vaccines, as with all medicines, will continue to be carefully monitored and will take into account any future new evidence of side effects that becomes available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100091#WRJJ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Homes Support Scheme","counter":1356,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100091#WRJJ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1357,"qnumday":532,"qnumall":"[17762\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100091#WRJJ01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the interdepartmental group which is currently reviewing the fair deal scheme is expected to conclude its review; when will the findings be brought before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; if this review will give some relief to farm families; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1313","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1358,"content":"<p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) is a system of financial support for those in need of long-term nursing home care.

The overall claims experience is influenced by a number of factors such as the cost of claims, the cost of care, the age profile of those holding private health insurance and ongoing medical innovations. Each of these are contributors to the cost of premiums payable. <\/p>  <p>  A community-rated health insurance market depends on inter-generational solidarity and requires a constant influx of young healthy members to support the older, less healthy members. In 2015 two policy measures were introduced to ensure the ongoing viability of community rating - Lifetime Community Rating and Young Adult rates. Lifetime Community Rating was designed to encourage people to take out health insurance at a younger age and to retain it. Young Adult rates are based on a sliding scale of maximum chargeable rates up to age 26. This approach ensures the phasing-in of full adult rates and eases the effect of the dramatic price increases when student rates no longer apply. Without these measures, there would be a continued deterioration in the age profile of the insured population, which in turn would contribute to claims inflation and result in higher insurance premiums.<\/p>  <p>  The positive impact of these initiatives on the market is now evident, as the number of people holding private health insurance has increased to 2.152 million, or 46% of the population (end-December 2016). Critically, these figures include a total of 240,025 insured lives in the age cohort 25-35 years (an increase of 13,785 compared to end-December 2015), which contributes positively to keeping health insurance affordable for those who wish to avail of it.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the Lifetime Community Rating Regulations, after 30 April 2017, is provided for in the legislation.  The independent regulator, the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), has already completed its public consultation process as a first phase of its review.  Members of the public were invited to submit their views before the deadline of 3 March 2017. The HIA are now in the process of considering all of the submissions received and will submit its report and recommendations to me in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100091#WRJJ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Respite Care Services Provision","counter":1368,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100091#WRJJ02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1369,"qnumday":536,"qnumall":"[17869\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100091#WRJJ02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that respite beds offered by an organisation (details supplied) have been greatly reduced in the past ten years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1370,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[17870\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100091#WRJJ02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the lack of respite facilities for children with disabilities on the north side of Dublin (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1371,"qnumday":538,"qnumall":"[17871\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100091#WRJJ02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that an organisation (details supplied) has had to utilise its last remaining respite house as a permanent residential care home; if alternative respite facilities will be made available for those affected families.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1372,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 536 to 538, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.<\/p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;<\/p><p>- Bed and board;<\/p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and<\/p><p>- Laundry service.<\/p><p>The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme.  The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis. The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State. In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:<\/p><p>- Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;<\/p><p>- Price(s) previously charged;<\/p><p>- Local market price; and<\/p><p>- Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.<\/p><p>When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years. The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. A number of issues have been identified for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanisms by the NTPF, with a view to:<\/p><p>- Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;<\/p><p>- Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and<\/p><p>- Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.<\/p><p>A Steering Committee has been established to oversee the review of the pricing system for private long-term residential care facilities. This Steering Committee is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the NTPF, and work in this area is well advanced.<\/p><p>In relation to the cost of care in public residential facilities, Section 33(2) of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009 provides for the HSE to charge for the cost of care in long-term residential care settings.  The components that make up the cost of care are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p><p>There are a number of reasons why the costs of public facilities are generally higher than those in the private sector, including a higher nurse staffing ratio and the impact of public service rates of pay and conditions of employment.<\/p><p>The geographical spread of residential placements is also a factor. In some rural areas long stay beds are provided for geographical reasons in smaller centres which would not be profitable for a private provider to supply, e.g. Achill Island and Donegal.<\/p><p>With that said, it is important that public facilities operate as efficiently and economically as possible and deliver the best possible value for money.  Towards that end the HSE is already engaged in a comprehensive exercise to review and streamline the operation and cost structures of public facilities. Differences in the comparative cost of public and private long-term residential care will also be the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review which will be commenced by the Department of Health in 2017 to assess reasons for and components of current cost differentials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100092#WRKK03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Nursing Home Services","counter":1445,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100093#WRLL00250"},{"type":"question","counter":1446,"qnumday":563,"qnumall":"[17946\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100093#WRLL00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to provide extra bed capacity in nursing homes going forward in view of the fact the State has an ageing population (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1220","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1447,"content":"<p>Residential care in Ireland is provided through a mix of public, voluntary and private provision.  It is worth highlighting that the net budget for long-term residential care in 2017 is &euro;940m and the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will support 23,603 clients by the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  Public Nursing Units are an essential part of our national nursing home infrastructure.  They provide 5,000 long stay residential care beds i.e. approximately 20% of the total stock of nursing home beds.  They also provide about 2,000 short stay beds.  Many public units are housed in buildings that are less than ideal in the modern context, but notwithstanding this, the standard of care delivered to residents is generally of a very high standard.  It is important therefore that we consolidate our existing stock and this is the aim of the 5 year Capital programme for Community Nursing Units which was announced last year.  This provides the framework to allow for an enhanced programme to replace, upgrade and refurbish these care facilities which will consolidate our existing public stock and is expected to provide 250 additional beds.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to private facilities, in Budget 2016 the Minister for Finance announced changes to the Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme to allow for investment in the expansion, management and operation of nursing homes.

It aims to ensure that appropriate care pathways are in place in order that mothers, babies and families get the right care, at the right time, by the right team and in the right place.  Similarly, it recognises that, while all pregnant women need a certain level of support, some will require more specialised care.

The model consists of three care pathways - Supported, Assisted and Specialised.

This work will also include the identification of both capital and revenue funding requirements, which will in turn inform the annual Estimates process over the lifetime of the Strategy.  The Strategy states that intrapartum guidelines will be developed through the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC) process.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.<\/p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;<\/p><p>- Bed and board;<\/p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and<\/p><p>- Laundry service.<\/p><p>A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice.  For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.<\/p><p>Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income.  The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).  An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.<\/p><p>Part 7 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 stipulates that the registered provider of the nursing home must agree a contract in writing with each resident on their admission to the nursing home. This contract must include details of the services to be provided to that resident and the fees to be charged. Residents should never be charged fees which are not set out in the contract.  The Department of Health and the HSE are not a party to such contracts which are concluded between each resident and their nursing home.<\/p><p>Registered providers of nursing home care are obliged to provide an accessible and effective complaints procedure.  Concerns about additional charges should in the first instance be taken up with the nursing home provider.  The Office of the Ombudsman can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes. The Office of the Ombudsman normally only deals with a complaint once the individual has already gone through the complaints procedure of the private nursing home concerned.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100094#WRMM01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1337"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":1497,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100094#WRMM01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1498,"qnumday":581,"qnumall":"[18016\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100094#WRMM01300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a decision will be made in respect of a medical card application for a person (details supplied) in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1499,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Funding of &euro;180,000 was provided to IKA in 2016 by the Health Service Executive and further funding is being made available this year.

It is envisaged that this Bill will provide for an opt-out system of consent for organ donation.

The Department of Health activated the National Plan for pandemic influenza.  The plan was accompanied by guidance that had been developed by the Pandemic Influenza Expert Group (PIEG) which was updated regularly during the pandemic.  On Thursday, 11 June, following consideration by its Emergency Committee, the WHO raised the Influenza alert phase to Pandemic level 6 which officially declares a pandemic. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland moved from the containment to the mitigation phase on 16 July 2009.  The aim of the mitigation strategy was to limit the impact of the virus in the population.  This was achieved by a combination of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures. Non-pharmaceutical measures included emphasising via media campaigns the importance of personal measures to limit spread, such as isolation if sick, covering mouth with tissues when coughing or sneezing and hygiene measures such as washing hands. <\/p>  <p>  Pharmaceutical measures included treating those at risk of more severe disease with antivirals and vaccinating when the vaccine became available.  The HSE had contracts in place for the provision of pandemic vaccine with Baxter for 4.25 million doses and GSK for 3.45 million doses. Approximately 3 million doses of Pandemic vaccine were delivered to Ireland &ndash; 600,000 Baxter and 2.4 million GSK. <\/p>  <p>  Based on the advices of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; groups were defined and prioritised for vaccination commencing in October 2009.  Over 1.1 million pandemic vaccinations were recorded, giving a 25% uptake for the total population.  The vaccine uptakes among the priority groups were 50% for those medically at risk, 32% for pregnant women (was 45% during early part of programme), 31% for health care workers, 60% for children aged 6 months to 4 years, 39% for children aged 5-14 years and 25% for those aged 65 years and older.  The public pandemic vaccination campaign ended on 31 March 2010.  However, following a full assessment of the situation at that time the vaccine continued to be made available free of charge to the &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; groups through General Practice and Maternity Units until September 2010.<\/p>  <p>  The first reports concerning a possible link between pandemic influenza vaccination and narcolepsy came to international notice in the second half of 2010.  In August 2010, the Swedish pharmacovigilance authority reported that it was investigating six cases of narcolepsy reported by health care professionals as a possible adverse event following the use of Pandemrix vaccine, used during the H1N1 2009 pandemic.  This was followed later that month by reports from the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) noting there had been a more than expected number of cases of narcolepsy in children and adolescents that year.  The Irish Medicines Board (now the HPRA) received reports of two confirmed cases of narcolepsy following vaccination with pandemic vaccines by the end of March 2011.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100095#WRNN04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":1586,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100096#WROO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1587,"qnumday":612,"qnumall":"[18170\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100096#WROO00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when the meningitis B vaccine catch-up programme will be rolled out to older children (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1261","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1588,"content":"<p>The HSE Service Plan included additional funding of &euro;2.5 million for the expansion of the Primary Childhood Immunisation Programme in 2016.

Therefore I was pleased to announce the launch of the &ldquo;Agriculture Cashflow Support Loan Scheme&rdquo; on 31st January.  The Scheme, which was developed by my Department in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), makes &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%.  Distributed and administered through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, it provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.<\/p>  <p>  The loans are available to all livestock farmers, tillage farmers, horticulture producers and others involved in primary agricultural production.  My Department is contributing &euro;25million in total, which includes &euro;11 million from the EU&rsquo;s &lsquo;exceptional adjustment aid for milk and other livestock farmers&rsquo; and &euro;14 million in national funding. SBCI uses the &euro;25 million of public funding provided by my Department to leverage the total amount of &euro;150 million and, along with the European Investment Fund&rsquo;s &lsquo;COSME&rsquo; (the EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and SMEs), is providing the guarantee required to underpin the loan&rsquo;s flexibility and lower the cost of the loans.<\/p>  <p>  The banks will report on progress to the SBCI on a regular basis.  Although no official returns have been made to my Department as yet, the banks have confirmed that they have applications up to the amounts available under the Scheme.  There may be some residual availability but this will only emerge as applications are processed and loans drawn down.<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased at the very positive reaction by farmers to the Scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low-cost flexible finance.  I hope that the commercial banks will respond positively to this demand by reducing interest rates and providing more flexible terms for cash flow loans in the future.

In general terms an eligible hectare is one that is used for an agricultural activity or, where the area is also used for a non-agricultural activity, is predominantly used for such activities.  An area is predominantly used for agricultural activity if that activity can be exercised without being significantly hampered by the intensity, nature, duration and timing of the non-agricultural activity.<\/p>  <p>  While cases involving solar panels will be examined on an individual basis, it is currently envisaged that the area covered by the solar panels will be deemed ineligible for the purposes of claiming BPS. Furthermore, in line with the Department&rsquo;s current approach on land eligibility, where the area of a parcel covered by solar panels is 70% or greater of the overall parcel, that parcel will be wholly ineligible.  If less than 70% is covered by solar panels and the agricultural activity is not hampered by the presence of the solar panels, the area not covered by solar panels may be eligible. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to entitlements it is important to note that a farmer must use all entitlements every 2 years.  Therefore if the land is deemed ineligible for BPS the farmer would lose the entitlements after 2 years unless he (a) got more land (b) leased out his entitlements or (c) sold the entitlements.<\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that all agricultural land used to claim BPS must be owned\/leased, used and managed by the applicant. If the applicant is not the owner of the land, they must have a lease or rental agreement in place with the owner of the land.  There must be independent and suitable access for animals and\/or machinery for the farming enterprise being conducted.

This is the first time such action had been taken by this Department, and was based on the increasing threat of introduction of avian influenza, following the confirmation of cases in wild birds in Great Britain (in particular in Wales). <\/p><p>On 8 March the decision was taken that the Regulations would remain in place until 30 April.  This announcement was made in order to give the poultry industry some certainty on the issue, to allow companies to plan for adjustments necessary to comply with marketing requirements.<\/p><p>The decision to maintain the period of confinement to 30 April was made after taking account of:<\/p><p>- the epidemiological situation in Ireland - 12 cases of the H5N8 strain of avian influenza were confirmed in 4 different wild bird species in 10 locations in 6 counties over the period 30 December 2016 to 24 February 2017<\/p><p>- advice from ornithologists with regard to migratory patterns of the affected wild bird species,<\/p><p>- the ability of the virus to survive in the environment.<\/p><p>One of the objectives is to protect poultry flocks from the introduction of avian influenza, and thus maintain the OIE Avian Influenza free status of Ireland.  This will ensure Ireland&rsquo;s continued access to third country markets for poultry and poultry products. <\/p><p>The decision reflects a careful assessment and evaluation of the information and data specific to Ireland and is in the best interests of the poultry industry in Ireland. <\/p><p>In relation to confining birds during high-risk periods, it is up to the Competent Authority in each Member State to assess the risks in their country.  It is not a decision made on a European-wide basis.<\/p><p>My Department has not been made aware of any significant reported decrease in egg sales as a result of the current Avian Influenza restrictions, but is monitoring the situation and will consider all options available.

In order to maximise the number of young farmers for eligibility under the 2015 National Reserve and Young Farmers schemes, it was decided that any person who meets the other qualifying requirements and commenced a relevant agricultural course anytime up to and including September 2016 would be accepted under the National Reserve and Young Farmers Scheme in 2015.  The increased flexibility would ensure that the benefits of the &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; and &lsquo;new entrant&rsquo; categories would be widely available even to those who were unable to complete their agricultural course by 2015. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland was required to notify the EU Commission of the additional educational eligibility criteria being applied to the National Reserve and Young Farmers Scheme, and the increased flexibility in relation to same.  The EU Commission subsequently advised Ireland that the flexible arrangements that would allow an applicant to commence their agricultural education after the date of submission of an application under the National Reserve and\/or Young Farmers Scheme did not fit with the &lsquo;annual logic of the Direct Payments&rsquo; and was a risk of non-compliance with requirements. <\/p>  <p>  In order to ensure that no young farmer would be disadvantaged by this ruling and in order to comply with the notification from the EU Commission thus avoiding\u00a0the risk of a financial correction for Ireland, extensive efforts were put in place by the Department and Teagasc at the end of 2015.  This resulted in applicants to the 2015 National Reserve and Young Farmers Scheme being provided with a placement on an agricultural education course prior to 31st December 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100101#WRTT04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Scheme Administration","counter":1836,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100101#WRTT04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1837,"qnumday":704,"qnumall":"[18322\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100101#WRTT04200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if participants under the national reserve who receive a top-up of entitlements on land for which they hold no entitlements can keep these increased entitlements after the scheme ends; the timeframe for these entitlements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1244","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1838,"content":"<p>The National Reserve provides for a permanent allocation of entitlements to successful applicants on land for which they hold no entitlements and\/or a top up to the value of existing entitlements held by them, where such entitlements have a value below the National Reserve National Average. <\/p>  <p>  The allocation of new entitlements is on the basis of one entitlement for one hectare of eligible land declared on the Basic Payment Scheme application for which the applicant holds no entitlements.

Analysis is on-going on the types of technologies to be included such as biomass, offshore and onshore wind, waste, and combined heat and power.  This analysis also includes an assessment of the cost of supporting Solar Photovoltaics (PV) - both rooftop and ground-mounted.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to facilitate the development of solar energy projects in Ireland.  This builds on the 2015 Energy White Paper and recognises that solar has the potential to provide a community dividend, thereby also enhancing citizen participation in Ireland's energy future.<\/p>  <p>  The new scheme design requires detailed economic analysis on the viability and cost effectiveness of supporting several renewable technologies at various scales.  Once this analysis is complete, my Department will publish a\u00a0public consultation on the design of the new support scheme.  There will be many decisions to be made on this scheme with regard to scale, technologies and &ndash; in particular &ndash; how communities will have a greater involvement than in previous schemes.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.<\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.<\/p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint.<\/p><p>On the 4 April, I\u00a0signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to their plans to provide broadband to \u00a0an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis.  Eir\u00a0has committed to doing this work over the next 90 weeks, an average of 500 premises passed per day.  My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that they meet their obligations under the Agreement.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website www.dccae.gov.ie.<\/p><p>On the same day I\u00a0published\u00a0 an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. which\u00a0finalises the\u00a0State Intervention area.  The\u00a0updated Map shows\u00a0the following categories of areas for delivery of broadband:<\/p><p>-  The BLUE areas represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have\u00a0indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,<\/p><p>-  The AMBER areas on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the areas that will require\u00a0State Intervention and are the subject of the current procurement process.<\/p><p>It is intended that all premises will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.<\/p><p>There are c.60,000 premises in County Louth, of which approximately 8,700 premises are located in the AMBER area on the Map, and will require State Intervention.  The remaining 51,300 premises are located in the BLUE area and will \u00a0be served by commercial operators.  Of the 51,300 premises, some 7,700 premises fall within eir&rsquo;s plans to deliver high speed broadband by end of 2018.  Further information of eir's planned rural deployment is available at <font color=\"#1F497D\">a <\/font>.<\/p><p>Individuals can themselves check whether their premises is in a BLUE\u00a0or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode at www.broadband.gov.ie.<\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.

The\u00a0report of the Task Force was published in December and\u00a0is\u00a0 available at the following link:.<\/p><p>In producing this report, the Task Force worked with Departments, local authorities,\u00a0ComReg, State agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the implementation programme on mobile phone and broadband access identifies 19 of these\u00a0actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Departments and State agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.<\/p><p>The work of the Task Force will also assist\u00a0local authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contracts are in place.<\/p><p>In order to maintain momentum, I, together with my colleague Minister Humphreys, have established an Implementation Group, which met for the first time on 8 March.  This group will drive and monitor the implementation of the actions in the Task Force report, bringing together all key stakeholders identified in the Task Force report with responsibility for delivery of actions.  This group will formally report every 90 days on\u00a0progress made on all actions to both myself and Minister Humphreys.  I am expecting the first such quarterly report in April, following the end of this quarter.<\/p><p>In addition, I have\u00a0signed regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with a 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6 GHz radio spectrum band.  This will\u00a0provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services.<\/p><p>In my Department's Estimates for 2017, I have secured an &euro;8 million provision for RTE to allow it to free up the 700 MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate\u00a0this spectrum to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage.  The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.<\/p><p>These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland and particularly in rural Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100102#WRUU04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":1901,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100103#WRVV00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1902,"qnumday":727,"qnumall":"[18723\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100103#WRVV00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the amount spent across his Department in the past five years on maintaining vacant or unused State-owned properties, including security arrangements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1352","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1903,"content":"<p>All property occupied by my Department is either leased by or owned by the Office of Public Works.<\/p><p>No expenditure has been incurred for security or maintenance of vacant or unused properties over the last five years as no property allocated by the OPW for use by my Department has been either vacant or unused during that period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100103#WRVV00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":1905,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100103#WRVV00600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":1904,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100103#WRVV00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1905,"qnumday":728,"qnumall":"[17514\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100103#WRVV00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if actions by his Department could be considered with regard to assisting persons that are living abroad who lose their driving licenses in view of the fact that the current situation of having to travel home for a replacement is causing difficulties for persons living in the United States of America; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1906,"content":"<p>I am pleased to advise that what the Deputy is asking can already be done.<\/p>  <p>  In most circumstances, where a person is applying for a driving licence including a replacement for a lost or stolen licence, they would be expected to appear in person at a centre of the National Driver Licensing Centre.

My Department secured an extra &euro;52 million in Capital funding, a 10% increase, to support further job creation, innovation and support Irish companies to respond to the challenges and opportunities from Brexit.

Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Brexit strategy is to sustain and grow exports to the UK but also to support their clients to diversify into new markets outside the UK.  A key focus is improving client capability around competitiveness, markets, marketing skills, innovation, risk management and strategic financial skills.<\/p><p>Local Enterprise Offices capital grants are up by &euro;4m (+22%) in 2017 to a total of &euro;22.5 million.  This is the largest ever capital allocation to the LEOs (or their predecessors CEBs).

This funding will enable the Department and its Agencies to recruit an additional 40 to 50 staff to supplement existing staffing numbers for Brexit planning and contingency.  This funding will enable Enterprise Ireland to recruit 39 extra staff for overseas offices and the Ireland-based team to support exporting companies in the context of Brexit.  Staff will be assigned to:  <\/p><p>- Markets that are growing and have scale (including China, India, Latin America, Africa); <\/p><p>- Markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth (including UK, France, Benelux, Germany, US, Nordics).<\/p><p>Specifically, these 39 posts include:  <\/p><p>- 17 new posts in overseas offices, <\/p><p>- 22 Irish based posts which includes; <\/p><p>- 17 to support internationalisation activities, <\/p><p>- 10 to support competitiveness and sectoral growth,  <\/p><p>- 3 to strengthen the LEOs ability to respond locally to help micro-enterprises and<\/p><p>- 2 to Horizon 2020 Support Network which works with researchers and companies to maximise participation in Horizon 2020.<\/p><p><b>Hedging against Foreign Currency Fluctuations<\/b><\/p><p>Sterling currency fluctuations have created challenges for Irish business. My department is working with Agencies and stakeholders to develop appropriate evidence based response\/intervention for firms with an exposure to the UK market which will be fully aligned with state aid rules. <\/p><p>Managing currency risk by means of hedging is an immediate issue for exporters to the UK.\u00a0 For an exporter to hedge its currency risk, in the first instance, it must first have a foreign exchange line of credit from the bank.\u00a0 This must be formally sought in advance prior to its use and, from the bank&rsquo;s perspective, it is the equivalent of making a loan application, i.e. it requires credit approval.<\/p><p>The advantage of this instrument is that an exporter can bring certainty to the amount of euro that it will receive in return for a specified amount of sterling at this stated future date.\u00a0 The primary disadvantage is that there is no opportunity to share in an upside in currency movement.<\/p><p>Most banks will have a maximum time period for which they will sell forward contracts to their customers.\u00a0 In general, most banks will not provide forward contracts for periods beyond 12 months.\u00a0 In some cases, the banks may require security to be provided in the form of charges over assets or guarantees.<\/p><p>A final point to note in hedging foreign currency risk is that there are non-bank providers of such services who tend to be less prescriptive in their dealings.\u00a0 However, many borrowing agreements now specify that the borrower may only conduct foreign currency transactions with the lender.<\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland is providing important advice to client companies regarding managing currency risks.\u00a0 Many have taken this advice and hedged to late 2017.\u00a0 Others are naturally hedged by having operations in both Irish and UK markets.\u00a0 I would point out, however, that pragmatic and forward looking firms should be looking into the feasibility of hedging in the current situation.  While not for everyone it is something that growth oriented exporters to the UK should be examining in detail to see if it has the potential to mitigate the potential damage that might be done to their business by exchange rate fluctuations.<\/p><p><b>Export Finance Initiative <\/b><\/p><p>The proposed Export Finance Initiative, which is being led by the Department of Finance, will support the working capital needs of Irish exporters.\u00a0\u00a0It is proposed that this Initiative will enable exporting SMEs to obtain necessary working capital that they would be unable to access without a guarantee.  This will allow exporting SMEs to secure competitive financing, safeguard their exports, and win new export orders and markets. <\/p><p>My Department, along with other Government Departments and agencies are working closely to ensure that the initiative is made available to SMEs as quickly as possible.\u00a0 It is expected that the initiative will be rolled out by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) in the first half of this year.\u00a0 The planned mechanism includes delivery through commercial finance providers. <\/p><p><b>APJ 2017<\/b><\/p><p>Responding to Brexit has been prioritised in Action Plan for Jobs 2017, which sets out 20 specific actions aimed at growing and diversifying markets for Irish exports and maximise opportunities in foreign direct investment and research and innovation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100105#WRXX03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":2020,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100105#WRXX03300"},{"type":"question","counter":2021,"qnumday":769,"qnumall":"[17643\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100105#WRXX03400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the member states that have representatives on the EU&rsquo;s advisory committee on state aid; if she made any representations since the UK&rsquo;s Brexit referendum to the committee to consider increasing current minimum state aid rules for enterprises in sectors that will be adversely impacted by a hard Brexit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":2022,"content":"<p>In accordance with Council Regulation No 2015\/1588 of 13 July 2015 on the application of Articles 107 and 108 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to certain categories of horizontal State aid (codification) the Advisory Committee on State Aid is a consultative forum.

That General Scheme was published in 2007. <\/p>  <p>  Given the significant changes that the Companies Act 2014 as whole introduced, the Act provided for a general transitional period of 18 months from the date of its commencement.  This was to allow for companies to adapt, for example to convert to the new company forms, if necessary, and to change the company name as a result. Once the transitional period ended, companies must comply fully with the provisions of the Companies Act 2014. <\/p>  <p>  The Companies Act 2014 was commenced on 1 June 2015 and the general transitional period ended on 30 November 2016.  Most companies were able to make any necessary adaptations within that 18 month period. <\/p>  <p>  As the Companies Act 2014 was being enacted (it was the Companies Bill 2012), representations were made by some companies, including in the pharmaceutical industry, and by their legal representatives.\u00a0 They stated that the 18 month transitional period would not be sufficient time for the necessary organisational changes due to the nature of their businesses.  They asked for an extension of time beyond the 18 month period.<\/p>  <p>  In response, the Oireachtas gave the Minister a power in section 1237(5) to consider applications from unlimited companies for longer adaptation periods where special circumstances exist.  This was enacted as section 1237(5) and was intended as a temporary measure to facilitate those unlimited companies that found that they needed more than the general transition period of 18 months. <\/p>  <p>  During the general transition period some unlimited companies did assess that they would need longer, and applied for an extension under section 1237(5).  Extensions were granted to just over 100 companies, some within the same groups as each other, for a period of 5 years in addition to the 18 months of the general transitional period.  A few of these companies are in the pharmaceutical sector.  These extensions are due to end on 1 December 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Now that the general transition period is over, unlimited companies are legally obliged to comply with the requirements of section 1237(1) unless they have been granted an extension of additional time.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Section 3(1)(j) of the Companies (Accounting) Bill 2016 deletes section 1237(5) of the Companies Act 2014 because the need for section 1237(5) no longer exists.\u00a0 Maintaining section 1237(5) on the Statute Book could give rise to confusion.  Companies that are forming for the first time have made applications to me under section 1237(5). This is clearly contrary to the policy of section 1237(1). <\/p>  <p>  One of the main principles underpinning the Companies Act 2014 is the principle of transparency.  Also, the Act provides for 5 main company types and the rules for each type are different in some respects.  For example, unlimited companies are not obliged to file financial statements with their Annual Return in the Companies Registration Office.

These supports all help companies to develop new and improved products and services which serve as the basis for sustainable economic growth. <\/p><p>Enterprise Ireland works with researchers across the HEI sector to assist in maximising the commercial return from publicly-funded research.  The Enterprise Ireland Commercialisation Fund provides supports for academic researchers to take research outputs with commercial potential and bring them to a point where they can either be transferred into industry or spun out into a new start-up company.  In this way, the Commercialisation Fund helps to ensure that there is an avenue for ongoing research to be translated into industry relevant outputs which can drive company creation and growth.  The programme funds the development of innovations at all stages of the commercial pipeline to the point where they can be commercialised as new products, services and companies. <\/p><p>The Commercialisation Fund, combined with Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s Technology Transfer Supports, facilitates the creation of 25 to 30 new spinout companies per annum (26 for 2016), approximately 15 of which become High Potential Start-Ups each year. \u00a0They also generate\u00a0more than 160\u00a0new commercially relevant technologies per annum (186 in 2016) that can be transferred to industry where they can achieve economic impact for companies. <\/p><p>1,518\u00a0Commercialisation Fund projects were approved in the period 2006-2016 of which 823 were\u00a0Feasibility\/Proof of Concept projects.

My Department is working with the sector to explore how we can improve retention rates.

This can be as a result of abuse and\/or neglect and their parents' inability to care for them due to a combination of difficulties in their own lives.  At the end of January 2017, there were 6,323 children in care of whom over 92% (5,844) were in foster care, either with relatives or with general foster carers.  There are 2 weekly rates of Foster Care Allowance - &euro;325 for children aged 0 - 12 years and &euro;352 for children aged 12 years and over which is paid to the foster family.  Foster care allowances are provided in order to allow foster carers meet all of the child&rsquo;s daily living needs, e.g. food, clothing, school uniform, school books, extra-curricular activities, school trips, pocket money (depending on the age of the child), and treats such as toys, games or holidays.  <\/p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that Departmental policy which Tusla operates is in accordance with the National Standards for Foster Care.  The Standards recommend that no more than two unrelated children be placed in any one foster family in recognition of the challenges involved in meeting their needs.  Exceptions are made for sibling groups, where approval will be sought from the Principal Social Worker prior to placement and notification sent to the Foster Care Committee.  <\/p>  <p>  Prospective general foster care applicants undergo a comprehensive and rigorous assessment before they are formally approved by a Foster Care Committee and any child is placed with them.  Relative foster carers may, in accordance with Regulations, have a child placed with them in an emergency, following initial checks, but before a full assessment and appraisal is carried out.  Foster carers are selected on the basis of their ability to meet the needs of the individual child.  Social work support is also provided for foster carers in the form of a link worker.  The link worker is a professionally qualified social worker and meets regularly with foster carers to provide training, information and whatever other support that may be required.  <\/p>  <p>  The use of private foster placements, in approximately 6% of total foster placements, is a necessary part of ensuring that the service is available at all times and that Tusla has access to specialised placements.  The private foster placements includes services for emergency placements when Garda&iacute; have to intervene and remove a child to a place of safety.  All foster care, whether recruited directly by Tusla or sourced through private sector providers, operate using the same model of care.  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) carries out independent inspections of all foster care services in Ireland against the National Standards for Foster Care. <\/p>  <p>  The latest figures from Tusla indicate at the end of  January, 2017, there were 6,323 children in care.

The degree of support provided through AIM depends on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school service.  One of the supports offered under AIM - Level 7 - is additional capitation.  Where approval for additional capitation has been agreed, and in circumstances where the maximum capitation has been approved, it can be used in one of two ways.  It can be used to reduce the adult to child ratio in the pre-school room, from 1 adult and 11 children down to 1 adult and 8 children, without any financial loss to the pre-school provider.  Alternatively, it can be used to buy in additional assistance to the pre-school room. <\/p>  <p>  Applicants who intend to use additional capitation provided under AIM Level 7 to employ an additional person for the pre-school room or increase hours for existing staff must ensure that such staff have a Level 5 major award in early childhood care and education.<\/p>  <p>  The Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) (Amendment) Regulations 2016 allow for an exemption to the qualification requirements for an employee of a registered childcare provider receiving funding under Level 7 of AIM where it has deemed that specialised health support, for example nursing care, is required.  In limited circumstances, an exemption may be granted by Pobal where it has considered that such specialist support is required and is critical to the child's meaningful participation in the ECCE programme. Such exemptions will primarily be for children with medically complex needs.  The service would need to request an exemption during the appraisal process or once funding has been approved prior to recruitment.<\/p>  <p>  When the Early Years Quality Agenda was introduced in 2013 to further improve quality in early years services, one of the items to be progressed was the introduction of a requirement that all staff working with children in pre-school services must hold the Level 5 major award in early childhood care and education.  The new qualification requirement is based on international evidence demonstrating that increasing the qualification levels of staff in childcare increases the quality of the service and therefore improves the outcomes for children using the service.<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans to review this qualification requirement as it relates to AIM at the present time.  However, this matter can be brought to the attention  of the Cross-Sectoral Implementation Group to consider.  It can also be considered in the context of planned reviews of AIM, the first of which will take place end 2017 with a full formal evaluation planned for 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100108#WRAAA01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Capitation Grants","counter":2101,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100108#WRAAA01350"},{"type":"question","counter":2102,"qnumday":797,"qnumall":"[17575\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017041100108#WRAAA01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the estimated cost of increasing the capitation grant for the free preschool year by &euro;5 per week per child for both existing lower and higher capitation rates.

I secured additional funding for this purpose in 2017, and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is now in the second year of a 3-year plan to ensure the allocation of a social worker to all children and young people who need one.  The Deputy should note that all urgent and emergency cases notified to Tusla are dealt with immediately.  Urgent and emergency cases could involve cases of abandonment, allegations of physical and sexual abuse, parental ill health and the need to find an immediate placement, or threat to the safety or life of a child by a third party. <\/p><p>At the end of January 2017 (the latest data available), there was a total of 25,189 open child welfare and protection cases nationwide.  An open case is one which is assessed as needing a dedicated (allocated) social work service.  Of the 25,189 open cases, 80% (20,173) had an allocated social worker and 5,016 were waiting to be allocated a social worker.  Of the children awaiting allocation to a social worker at the end of January, 2017 their priority levels were as follows:<table><tr><th>Level of Priority<\/th><th>Number<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Low Priority<\/td><td>1,287<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Medium Priority<\/td><td>2,886<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>High Priority<\/td><td>843<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Information on the length of time a child has been awaiting allocation to a social worker is available in respect of the high priority cases.

Cases that are unallocated are closely monitored, supported and managed by the duty social work team under the supervision of the principal social worker.  Cases to be allocated to a social worker include children who have already received services from Tusla whose social worker is no longer available to them, as well as children waiting to be allocated for the first time.  All unallocated cases are assessed and prioritised according to risk.  <\/p><p>It is a continuing priority of Tusla to address the problem of unallocated cases in 2017.  Tusla currently has 1,467 WTE social workers and an end of 2017 target of 1,520 WTE.  This target is short of the target set in Survival to Sustainability by approximately 100 WTE and reflects the constraints of the social work labour supply.  Funding is in place to address the issue of unallocated cases, however, the recruitment environment for social workers is very challenging.  Tusla is also focusing on intervening at an early stage of a family difficulty through social care and family supports.<\/p><p>My Department will continue to closely monitor progress in this regard.
