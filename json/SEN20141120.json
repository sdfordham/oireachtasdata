The condition of Irish people's dental health in the 1950s has been summed up by Dr. Joe Mullen, principal dental surgeon at the HSE, as being dreadful and an absolute emergency that needed to be addressed.  This is endorsed by Professor Denis O'Mullane, former chief dental officer at the Department of Health in the 1950s and former professor of dentistry in UCC in the 1990s.<\/p><p>In 1964, then Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy and Minister for Health, Sean McEntee, made the courageous decision to introduce water fluoridation in Ireland in the interests of the dental health of Irish children.  Mr. McEntee, a feisty northerner who had courageously fought for Irish people's freedom in the 1916 Rising at the GPO, was fearless in pursuing a cause in which he believed.  The fluoridation of Irish water has now been in effect here for 50 years.  The battle to introduce it in Ireland was fought out in the High Court and subsequently in the Supreme Court and it therefore has constitutional accord in our country.<\/p> <p> Despite the fact that numerous scientific reviews have demonstrated that water fluoridation has greatly benefited the dental health of people over the timespan of its use, sadly, it has consistently been the subject of disinformation and distortion of evidence.  On an issue that provokes such strong feelings, it is crucial to have responsible and measured debate based solely on facts.  In 2002, the forum on water fluoridation published a report which found that water fluoridation has been very effective in combating tooth decay.  There is no valid evidence of any negative health effects from fluoridation at the maximum permitted level.<\/p><p>The expert body on fluorides and health was established in 2004 to advise the Minister for Health on all matters relating to water fluoridation.  It continues to meet and discharge its responsibilities under the chairmanship of Dr. Seamus O&rsquo;Hickey, a fellow of the International College of Dentists.  The expert body has found the only side effect from fluoridation is dental fluorosis, a superficial staining of the teeth which can be easily removed.<\/p><p>Across the world, many health organisations have conducted similar reviews.  In the US, the National Research Council did a study on fluoride in drinking water in 2006.  In 2007, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council published its findings on the safety of fluoridation in water.  In 2009, Health Canada published expert panel guidelines in 2009 for Canadian drinking water quality.  In 2014, Public Health England 2014 provided a water fluoridation health monitoring report.  Not one of these reports established any basis for considering that artificially fluoridated water supplies could pose any health risk.<\/p><p>Water fluoridation is a cost-effective measure, costing &euro;3.86 million a year, while preventing tooth decay which is painful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000002#A00500","speaker":"1156","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416479400,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Is the Senator seeking a debate on this issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000003#B00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1416479400,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Yes.

It is a relief on this side of the House to hear someone from the other side commend some aspect of our water supply.  I agree with Senator White on the water fluoridation issue.  There have been many debates on it in the House with some heated exchanges.  I thank her for putting so many of the factual aspects of fluoridation on the record.<\/p><p>I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s announcement of the new water charges package from the Government.  It is welcome that we are seeing affordability as a key principle in the new measures with a much fairer, simpler and more straightforward way to charge people, along with delays in the charges taking effect.

Senators Power, van Turnhout and Healy Eames did this House a great service and were ably supported on the Government side by Senators Burke, Maloney, Brennan and others.  I did detect, however, a distinct lack of enthusiasm by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  I hope Members on the Government side will ensure this Bill comes back to the House.  The last Private Members&rsquo; Bill we had on prohibiting smoking in cars with young people disappeared for two and a half years before it appeared back in the House in much the same form as it was presented in the first instance by Senators Crown and Quinn.<\/p><p>I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s changes to the water charges.  However, we still have the problems highlighted in the report of the local government efficiency review group, headed by Mr. Pat McLoughlin, as well as the fact Irish Water is seriously overmanned.  The McLoughlin report called for 30% fewer county managers, 15% fewer city managers, 10% fewer planning staff, 15% fewer directors of services and 10% fewer of corporate services staff.  All of these staff were put into Irish Water, however, which has burdened it with costs which the people said they could not afford in their demonstrations.<\/p><p>There is also no evidence of economies of scale.  The one big organisation argument does not hold up.  Leitrim has a much lower rate of wastewater than larger counties.  The Government&rsquo;s fascination with doing things off the balance sheet is economic hocus-pocus.  The next time an accountant says this in Government Buildings, he should be shown the door.<\/p><p>At yesterday&rsquo;s transport and communications committee, what has been called the next Irish Water, postcodes, was discussed.  Up to 98% of post in this country is delivered the next day by An Post, a remarkable achievement on which I compliment the organisation.  The independent postal providers used Sat Nav.  A postcode system is being considered which has risen in costs from &euro;15 million last year to &euro;24 million in April and to &euro;27 million yesterday.  The prospect of a &euro;50 million cost has been raised with some believing it could head to &euro;80 million.  It does not seem to do anything and there has been no cost-benefit analysis.  Members of all parties on the transport committee are seriously concerned that this is an out-of-control project.  What are the benefits if 98% of post is delivered the following day?  What does one get for expending these large amounts of money?

I would like an urgent debate on Irish Water, which is still not acceptable.  People have a big problem with this huge umbrella organisation.  Yesterday, I gave the analogy that it is like establishing McAlpine to build a tree house.  This day two years ago local authorities provided water, albeit in a flawed state in certain areas, for a particular cost.  Now, two years later, nothing has improved except it will cost of hundreds of millions more.  The model is fundamentally wrong and I have a major problem paying for water to support a grand superstructure umbrella organisation of well-heeled individuals used to the luxury of spending other people's money.  It is wrong and needs to be dealt with.  People will not accept it.  I realise the Minister has tried very hard in recent weeks to come up with a plan which people will accept, but sadly I am afraid he has failed.  It is required that this organisation be abandoned and the Government, through central capital expenditure, build an infrastructure worthy of a 21st century nation and provide water to all parts of it.  This is the responsibility of the Government, not to finance through bribery of the people with their own money this superstructure of an organisation.<\/p><p>The Government seeks to turn the landlords into agents of the Revenue Commissioners and the Collector General, which is fundamentally wrong and doomed to failure.  As somebody who must declare an interest, as an auctioneer who knows about collecting deposits and rents from tenants, not a landlord in the country has not experienced a tenant who is moving out stating he or she will not pay the last month's rent as the deposit will go against it.  The Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, is an unmitigated disaster.  While it does good work at times in representing and protecting tenants, I give the example of a tenant who refused to pay rent but continued to live in a property for three and a half years, who was eventually evicted having paid no rent and owing approximately &euro;27,000, and who wrecked the house and walked into a local authority house the next day.  The Government is expecting a great amount from landlords to do this work, and putting the onus on them to collect this is doomed to failure.  I confidently predict there will be no collection of water rates through landlords because it is impossible and unenforceable.  I appeal to the Government to go back to the drawing board.  It has been an unmitigated disaster and a mistake but it should move on, get rid of the big super quango, return to the local authority model for now, and invest in capital infrastructure to get the standards in Roscommon and other counties without good water up to the quality to which people are entitled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000004#C00300","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1416480000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I second Senator Coghlan's proposal on the minute's silence in memory of all the women who lost their-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000004#C00400","speaker":"1124"},{"type":"speech","time":1416480000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>Only the Leader can make such a proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000004#C00500","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1416480000,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I welcome the announcement by Irish Water.

This is a very good deal and the people must accept it and at long last put it to bed.  We must remember those in rural Ireland have been paying for water.  Those involved in group schemes have made an investment, whether in private group schemes or buying water from local authority schemes.  It brings home to us the point of water harvesting, and it is important we ensure every assistance is given to people who want to harvest water for farm use.

They were armed with guns, a meat cleaver and knives.  It was a seven minute killing spree resulting in four worshippers killed and eight wounded, including the police officer who died later in hospital.  The rabbis who died were men of peace and faith.  It was the deadliest attack on Israeli civilians in more than three years.  President Mahmoud Abbas rightly condemned the attack but the killings were praised by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.  This is a serious departure and it is only right and proper that we should show solidarity with the people of Israel after this gruesome attack on a synagogue.<\/p><p>There was another recent incident in which Palestinians murdered Israeli civilians.  The Israeli response was to demolish the home of the family of those responsible for the murder.  Would it be acceptable in any other civilised country for the government to demolish the home of a family linked to, or responsible for, the death of an individual?  The response is provocative and will cause more bloodshed.  Furthermore, the Israelis continue to build in the occupied territories.  The situation will get worse.  I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss this next week, or soon, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, who is taking a strong line on this.

We have created more than 70,000 jobs since we came to power and are creating around 1,200 new jobs per week.  We have brought stability to this country.  We are also making sure we have a sufficient amount of tax coming in to pay for social welfare and all the services that are provided in this country.

If Sinn F&eacute;in wants power then it must be prepared to make decisions.<\/p><p>I wish to respond to a colleague in Opposition who mentioned meters.  I pay a commercial rate of &euro;7,000 per annum for 1,500 sq. ft. in office space and I am sick and tired of listening to people who want services but do not wish to pay for them.  I pay for water charges for my commercial office as well.  Yes, meters were put in which led to huge savings for people in the commercial sector.  People also became far more careful about the way they used water and made sure there was no wastage.  That is what the metering system is about - making sure we can identify where problems lie.  One of the examples of usage given to us was that 22 houses use 1 million litres of water due to leaks.  Perhaps the Leader might be able to explain the matter a bit more.  Metering is about making sure we get value for money.<\/p><p>I wish to raise another issue.  It is very sad that an hotel in Cork had to cancel an event to be held tonight due to security risks posed to the Taoiseach who was due to attend.  It is outrageous to have reached the stage that there are risks to security simply because a political meeting is being held.  I have no difficulty with people holding a peaceful protest outside a meeting.  However, the level of abuse and threats made to people has been outrageous.  It has reached the dangerous stage where a commercial enterprise chose to cancel an event and move it to another centre.

Senator Barrett was very quick to point out in my presence that this now means the cost of introducing the Eircode system is in excess of &euro;50 million.  The questions he has raised are legitimate.  The information is coming from a committee of the two Houses and it is in this context that I share and support the Senator's view that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, should outline in the House exactly what is happening regarding the provision of area codes.<\/p><p>Let me make a final point to reinforce my request.

In that regard, we had a minute's silence this morning &mdash; very appropriately on this day &mdash; to show concern over violence against women.

Ireland has a low rate of divorce by comparison with other states, and it is important that we preserve that.  It is important that we do so in the interest of the children.  Many couples who find their relationship in difficulty stay together until the children reach a certain age in order to protect them.  Others go to great lengths to ensure the children are at least cushioned from the psychological effects of separation.<\/p><p>I came across a survey carried out in Sweden in recent years.  Sweden has had divorce for much longer than Ireland.  The researchers studied middle-aged and older women who divorced 30, 40 or 50 years ago and found that there was a much higher incidence of mental illness among women whose parents had divorced while they were children.  We should be conscious of that.  I would like a full debate in the House on this.  We have had divorce for 20 years in Ireland.  I acknowledge we are not good at doing scientific research on the social implications of such matters but believe there should be some debate on the no-fault divorce and whether it needs to be examined in light of our experience.<\/p><p>The rights of fathers in this matter should be paramount.  Many fathers are deprived of access to their children when their relationship breaks down.  This is not in the interest of the children in the vast majority of cases, and that needs to be examined.

We are appreciative of that but I would like to make one more suggestion.  It happens fairly frequently that there is no legislation available.  We have been seeing a few gaps in the schedule lately.  While I understand important matters can be raised for discussion through statements or motions without necessarily having a legislative endpoint, I wonder whether we could examine procedures to work out whether we could facilitate additional Private Members' time.<\/p> <p>I for one have several Bills I would like to try to introduce for debate in the lifetime of the current Seanad.  I have one coming up in a week or ten days' time dealing with the issue of defamation charges by public bodies but there are other issues that I and others would like to raise.  Would it be possible to have a system in place whereby we knew, with a few days' notice, that there was likely to be a gap in the schedule?  Then we could try to advance the next Stage of a Bill or afford an opportunity for Second Stage readings of other Bills if they have gone through First Stage.  <\/p><p>Turning to another issue which may be described as troubling, although that is too strong a word as one should never sound alarmist, this is a very safe country in which to have a child from the point of view of maternal mortality compared to other countries.  It is not, as we have been told, the safest.  I am afraid it is no longer in the top few.  When dealing with maternal mortality, which is thankfully rare, statistical blips can come about.  There can, sadly, be a bit of bad luck where two or three cases occur in one year and might not occur in another year.  This has the effect of distorting the statistics.  However, despite this, the record of this country in this area has been knocked down a couple of pegs from the place that we held.  Maternal mortality is desperately rare, and when it occurs it is an unbelievable tragedy so we should always have zero tolerance for it.<\/p><p>In this regard - I apologise for sounding like a broken record - there is something seriously wrong when we have so few consultant-level obstetricians in the country in general.  They are very unevenly spread and some of the hospitals are desperately low.  In the entire western region of the HSE, there is perhaps the lowest number of obstetricians per head of population of any identifiable region in the OECD.  Maybe not having enough doctors does not affect the maternal mortality rate and maybe it does.  We certainly should not allow ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of complacency that we are in some kind of obstetrical nirvana where things do not go wrong.  We have amazingly good midwives and nurses and incredibly well-trained obstetricians but we do not have enough of them.  It is critically important that we look at this, perhaps in a debate in the House on maternity services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000007#F00500","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416482400,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Senator White spoke at length on water fluoridation in Ireland and the benefits which have accrued to people as a result of it.

It has been discovered that in 22 houses, 1 million litres of water a day were being lost.  That is enough water to supply the town of Gorey for a day.  It was discovered when the meters were put in and that is the reason it is necessary to have them.  We need to ascertain where these leaks are occurring.  Some people have said that installing meters is a waste of time but that is not the case.  <\/p><p>Senator Burke spoke on the achievements of Government in job creation and the economy and alluded to the dreadful situation whereby a hotel in Cork was forced to cancel a Fine Gael function that the Taoiseach was going to attend this evening because of security concerns and threats.  This has been mentioned by Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill and Mooney and others.  It is a dreadful step.  Democracy is certainly a fragile flower which we should cherish.

We thank him and his officials for the offer of a briefing during the week, which was appreciated, but, unfortunately, as other colleagues said also, we did not have time this week.  That is the way these things work and we apologise.<br\/>I say all of this without prejudice to what my colleagues in the D&aacute;il might say but as far as I am concerned, amendment No. 24 proposed by the Minister of State deals with and gets to the nub of the issue.  It deals with the issue from the point of view of fairness for the community organisations and for any competitors which may be running commercial organisations.  From what I can see, there is a good balance there.  We are not worried now about clubs renting out their all-weather pitches or gyms to local groups.  If they are doing it on a commercial basis, with maybe a manager, and they are competing with a local gym, that is different and we accept that.  <br\/>I thank my colleague, Deputy Cowen, who first brought this issue to our attention.  It must be said that a number of clubs in County Meath, in particular, brought this to his attention, including Ratoath GAA and Ashbourne GAA.  I thank the chairman of the Meath county board, Mr. Conor Tormey, with whom I consulted in regard to this Bill.  These clubs have played a key role, as have all the clubs in Meath which are affected.  I also spoke to Mr. Pat O'Brien of the Meath and district soccer league and asked for advice and input.<br\/>The Minister of State has listened and has come a long way and, in fairness to him, I will certainly not press my amendments.

I have tried to explore and discuss it rationally.  The issue of profitability and how it interacts with the rates system was discussed on Committee Stage.  I made the point that it is the job of the Valuation Office to attach a value to a building.  It is then through other agency interactions that the amount to be paid is arrived at.  I also flagged my concerns about linking this process to profitability.<br\/>The proposed amendment would allow for a valuation to be altered or revised downwards between revaluations where a decrease in profitability has occurred as evidenced by company records.  The legislation currently provides for the maintenance of valuation lists through the revision process and by way of revaluation.  Revision is the mechanism whereby physical changes to rateable properties are reflected in the valuation lists, while revaluation takes account of economic factors or the relative change in values between property locations or uses over time.  The revision process, by its nature, is ongoing whereas revaluation is periodic.<br\/>The legislation provides for regular revaluations no sooner than five years and no later than ten years.  This model of revaluation cycles is common in jurisdictions with annual charges on a business property similar to commercial rates.  A change in profitability of a particular occupier of a property could arise for several reasons and may in no way reflect a change in the value or the relative value of that property <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>other rateable properties in that rating authority area.  Downward revisions of rateable values of certain properties to reflect decreases in the profitability of the occupiers of those properties would advantage or disadvantage other ratepayers over time and undermine the degree of equity and uniformity inherent in the rateable valuation system.<br\/>I understand the spirit of the amendment but I do not feel it fits in with the job of the Valuation Office in attaching a value to a building.

The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland has highlighted this point too.  A business value can change very quickly.  For example, a petrol station which may get much business could lose it overnight if a bypass is opened on its route.  It does not get a revaluation, however.  A notable example of this occurred in Urlingford, County Kilkenny.  Businesses need to be able to avail of some flexibility and realism when faced with such a situation.<br\/>We had a system for revaluations in such cases until 2001 which worked very well.  In the United Kingdom, businesses are still allowed to seek such reviews.  It is a sensible proposal and would contribute to a pro-business environment.  Like upward-only rent reviews, I do not agree businesses should be locked into unrealistic rates or rents.  Flexibility in business needs to be shown, especially in these tough times.<br\/>One only has to look at all the vacant retail units up and down the country, a point referred to earlier by Senator Barrett.  Rates are a significant cost in business.  If they were lowered and brought to more realistic levels, more businesses could start up.  Footfall in our towns and cities would be increased as there would be a much more diverse array of shops to attract shoppers.  The viability of vacant retail properties would be increased too.  It is a win-win situation.  Rates are not likely to be paid if a company cannot even afford to pay them due to poor trade.  The amendment will feed into this process by allowing businesses to get more realistic rates that reflect their current circumstances, not rates that correspond to factors in the past.  We need to bring back the principle of fairness.  This amendment will bring in the principle of a non-restricted right to rate reviews.  We had this before and it worked well.  I hope the Minister of State can be open to this sensible amendment in some shape or form.  It has the potential to set the foundations for more businesses to open up or for existing businesses just to survive.

There are units in Tallaght shopping centre, which is in my constituency of Dublin South-West, that have been empty for years.  South Dublin County Council was one of the first rateable areas to be subject to revaluation during the boom.  The current valuations do not remotely reflect the value of the businesses or the properties.  Business people are not taking them up and they are lying vacant.  We need to correct this because everybody is losing out.  The State is losing out on tax.  Small businesses and property owners are losing out as well.  The ambience of these centres suffers when units lie empty.  They will not be taken up unless the current system of rateable valuation is changed.  The provision relating to \"material change of circumstances\" is much too tight.  If one knocks a wall here or adds a bit there, it could be said to be a material change.  It does not make sense.  I suggest that the relevant section of the Act should be amended to refer to a property that has experienced a \"change in economic circumstances\" which would reflect the net value.  Realistically, what affects business?  It is economics.  It is not knocking a wall here or knocking a wall there that will affect building and expansion or whatever.  Having it only confined to that is much too close.  It has to be looked at.  The five-year valuation is another thing as well.  It is going to be more than five years.  I think it should be mandatory to revalue after five years.  Otherwise, it can be kicked down the road to ten years.  With this one it could be 15 years.  Where will Tallaght be if it does not have the mandatory - I hope it is mandatory - five years that is in the legislation?  If the Minister of State can do something about the provision that relates to having a discretionary change of economic circumstances within five years, it would be appreciated.  It is not working.  Everybody is losing out on it at the moment.  I will come in again on another section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000013#M00200","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1416484800,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I would like to pick up on what Senator Keane had to say.  Am I right in my understanding that there is discretion within the local authority regarding start-ups?  I was led to believe this was the case some time ago when action was taken in a section of a town in the south of Ireland that was commercially dead.  Nothing was happening in that section of the town.  I applauded the town manager at the time because he introduced an incentive whereby businesses had to pay half-rates for the first two years.  Was that initiative taken by himself or was it allowable under regulation or legislation?  He showed great initiative to try to regenerate that section of the town, where many premises which had been closed and boarded up were becoming unsightly.  There was a certain degree of take-up on that.  Is that in the legislation?  That is the question I am asking, or the message I want to get out, on behalf of people who might be considering starting a small business or a new business.  Would the local authority be amenable to the possibility of providing for some concession like that?  Some people say that if small businesses cannot pay its rates, it should not be in business.  The first two years are the toughest years for small businesses.  In many cases, the rates bill is the final bill that cannot be overcome.  If an incentive could be provided, that would give discretion to the local authority, regardless of whether such an initiative is currently in place.  It would stimulate investment and bring lifeblood back into areas in certain towns where business is not being carried out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000013#M00300","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1416484800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I thank all Senators for their contributions.  I thank Senators Quinn and Barrett for proposing this amendment.  I will begin by reading the formal response.  An occupier already has the right under section 27 of the Valuation Act 2001 to seek a review or a revision of the rateable value of his or her property.  A rating authority may also apply to the valuation commissioner for a revision of a valuation, as may another interest holder in the subject property or an occupier of another property that appears on the valuation list.  The legislation currently provides for the maintenance of valuation lists by way of the revision process and revaluation.  Revision is the mechanism whereby physical changes to rateable properties are reflected in the valuation lists, while revaluation takes account of economic factors or the relative change in values between property locations and-or other uses over time.<\/p><p>As I said earlier, the revision process is by its nature an ongoing one, whereas revaluation is periodic.  The legislation provides for regular interventions to take place no sooner than five years and no later than ten years.  It cannot take 15 years.  It will happen after five to ten years, as opposed to 15 years.  Changes in the value of an existing property arising from structural alterations, the subdivision of a property into two or more separate properties or the amalgamation of that property with one or more rateable properties are provided for in section 28 in the Valuation Act 2001.  This is the revision process.<\/p><p>I do not want to be disingenuous.  I take the point that this does not encompass all of what Senator Quinn has raised in his amendment.  Changes in value arising from economic factors are captured using the revaluation process.  I made the point on Committee Stage that the Valuation Bill cannot address all the issues and challenges.  Obviously, some issues are valuation issues, some are commercial rates issues and some fall within the remit of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities.  Our job in a valuation sense is to attach a value to the building.<\/p><p>While some of the suggestions are interesting, they could have unintended consequences.  I will give an example that relates to South Dublin County Council, which was mentioned by my colleague, Senator Keane.  Obviously, there has been a significant change in value.  One would imagine the same thing applies to all properties in that rating authority area.  If we were to revalue all of South Dublin County Council, the actual rate in euro could end up increasing.  If we reduce our valuation due to economic circumstances, it will end up transferring to the existing business.  The Senator is right.  We could reduce the valuation to try to get somebody into an empty unit, but the pie would stay the same for South Dublin County Council.  Ultimately, an existing rate payer would end up paying more.  Every time somebody wins, somebody else loses.  That is the balancing act we are trying to perfect.<\/p><p>As I said in response to the previous amendment, this Government's efforts to get rid of back rates under the Local Government Act have been a help.  Until quite recently, if someone tried to occupy the properties in Tallaght mentioned by Senator Keane, not only would they have had to pay the rates, they could have been left with the back rates from the previous occupier as well.  That has been repealed since 24 March last.<\/p><p>We do not have a role in the area about which my colleague, Senator Sheahan, asked.  I am not placed to answer the Senator's question other than by clarifying that this area is not covered by this legislation.  I imagine it is a matter for the local authority.  I can raise it with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It is an important point to raise.  It is clear that this is an issue of concern for Senators, Deputies and the Government.  I just do not feel we are best placed to deal with it in the context of the Valuation Bill.  I will certainly pass on to my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, the concerns of Senators on all sides about what happens when there is a sudden change in the viability or profitability of a business.<\/p><p>I would like to make a final point.  I think Senators used the same example I used, which relates to what happens when a filling station is bypassed.  It is important to note that I introduced a new amendment on Committee Stage - it was amendment No. 45 at the time - to include a new section 29A in the Valuation Act 2001.  This measure will give the commissioner additional authority to address anomalies on the valuation list.  It provides for exceptional circumstances where a decision by a revision manager not to change a valuation could lead to inequity.  That could happen if one were operating a busy filling station that was bypassed and, all of sudden, people were not passing one's business any more.  There are extra provisions in this legislation that have not previously existed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000013#M00400","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416484800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I understand the point the Minister of State makes.

It is a typical example and is very easily understood.<\/p> <p>The difficulty is that reviews of any kind do not happen quickly enough and by that time the business is gone out of business.

In the context of the valuation rating system, an interest-holder in a commercial property is more meaningful and conveys a degree of ownership, whereas an interested party may be someone who is just interested and in no way affected by the rates liability of that property.  I see what the Senators are trying to do, but we do not want unintended consequences where there is confusion as to who is an interested person as opposed to an interest holder.

There should be a provision to allow all circumstances to be taken on board when seeking a rates review.

At the outset, I accept it is the job of Members in Parliament to get into the nitty-gritty of legislation and I am pleased we are doing that but the overarching aim of the Bill is to modernise the valuation process and to speed it up.  The enabling of outsourcing will be a really significant step forward in speeding things up and collectively, all Members are correct that it is taking too long to carry out revaluations.  This is a significant bugbear of business people and indeed of the Government.  While I do not wish to repeat myself, some of these issues are crossing over, in that there is a theme and a thread to the amendments tabled by Senator Quinn and for good reason.  However, the current legislation, that is, the Valuation Act 2001, provides for the rate of valuations of all rateable properties within a rating authority to be reviewed periodically to reflect changes in value arising from economic factors.  The resultant valuations are all published on the same date and become effective for rating purposes at the same time.  As Members are aware, this process is called revaluation and as I have outlined, the legislation provides for the valuations to take place between five years and no later than ten years after the first revaluation has taken place.  This model of revaluation cycles is common in jurisdictions with an annual property tax similar to rates.  I have already outlined a separate process called revision.<\/p><p>The proposed amendment envisages a review of a valuation of an individual property arising from a change in economic circumstances that would not be in keeping with the principle of valuation in this and other jurisdictions in which provision is only made for changes in the value of the property arising from alterations to the property.  I fear that any alternative would introduce significant volatility in the rating system.  It is important to note this system yields the astonishing figure of &euro;1.3 billion annually in funding to local authorities.  The amendment could also delay further the national revaluation programme, would be challenging to implement and more than likely would result in the introduction of an economic valuation system no longer based on property valuations but that would be a type of audit of the economic business sector that would be totally unsuitable for application as the base for local government funding.<\/p><p>I accept that some Senators might put forward a compelling case for moving to such a model but I am outlining my view that it would be a significant shift from the purpose of a valuation model.  It is imperative to maintain certainty and predictability for ratepayers, for local authorities trying to plan the provision of local services, as well as for other stakeholders between revaluations, which is a fundamental principle of the rating system.  Fluctuations in the economic performance of a company or other entity in the occupation of a property would not be measurable in a real estate context and would prove almost impossible to implement in a fair and equitable way.  The physical characteristics and features of a property are the only criteria that actually can be surveyed and quantified on a uniform basis in arriving at rates.  This is also a fair point because if one gets into the profitability level, how does one compare a butcher's premises with that of a jeweller, rather than just looking at physical characteristics?  The use of business values and buoyancy may be used for the assessment of other taxes, such as VAT and corporation tax, but not for a local valuation-based property tax.<\/p><p>Arising from what I see in my own constituency, I strongly believe we must get better at revaluing and doing so efficiently.  The overarching aim of this Bill and the provision of outsourcing will arrive at that point.  I contend that Members should allow the legislation to pass, the outsourcing to bed down and the process of revaluation to be examined.  Members should then examine the timeframes, that is, the five to ten years, at another time.

I have heard from Senators on all sides of the House about this matter.  Senator Keane has taken a particular interest in this area and has spoken to me about it.  Senator van Turnhout also raised the issue on Committee Stage as, I think, did Senator Byrne.  I acknowledge the calls from Senators on Committee Stage for a more favourable rates treatment of child care providers.  Since the conclusion of Committee Stage I and the Department officials have considered the valuation and rateability of child care in detail.  I have been determined to try to do something.  It has not been easy to get this right but what we are doing today is a very constructive step forward for the child care sector.  This is not the first time this issue has been considered but it was the subject of a comprehensive review, including consultation with relevant stakeholders.<\/p><p>In this Bill we are dealing mainly with technical amendments to facilitate the acceleration of the national revaluation programme and to make changes to correct deficiencies identified since the Valuation Act 2001 came into force.  We have to respect sound valuation and rating principles, one of which is that occupiers of a property who operate with the intention of making a profit are rateable.  I am therefore working within tight constraints.  That is the purpose of valuation.  If one operates to make a profit one is rateable.  Therefore, the flexibility for exemption from rates is limited.  The rate system cannot be seen as a means of support for a particular sector.  As has been said in the past, where the State wants to, and can, support a sector it can do so in many policy ways.  This is what the State does in giving substantial and quite correct direct supports to the child care sector.  It may not be sufficient.  One would argue it never is but any meaningful response is not to be found in a rates exemption.  That would make only a minor contribution to the sector but would involve breaking fundamental valuation and rating principles.<\/p><p>I have put significant work into this with the officials and stakeholders and I propose to extend the exemptions for child care to those that operate on a not-for-profit basis.  I hope this will be welcomed on all sides of the House.  I am doing this to bring greater equity and clarity to the not-for-profit sub-set of the child care sector.  The application of the rates system by local authorities regarding not-for-profit child care is inconsistent and the distinction between charitable providers who are exempt and not-for-profit providers can be a subtle one that wastes the resources of not-for-profits, which are already busy providing vital community services, by challenging their status before the valuation tribunal.  This is an improvement to the system.<\/p><p>I recognise that it does not go as far as those who argue for an exemption for the whole child care sector would like, and I can understand that argument.  For the reasons I have outlined, however, I cannot acquiesce to that.  I think my proposals today are a welcome and positive step forward.  My understanding is that there could be up to 1,000 not-for-profit child care providers in the country and if this amendment is passed I hope it will bring consistency to their treatment and make absolutely clear that they are exempt from rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000016#P00600","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"speech","time":1416486600,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I wholeheartedly welcome this change in the legislation for the not-for-profit sector, particularly because it serves many people who cannot afford to pay for early childhood care and education.  The State has provided only one free pre-school year, which is educational.  Education should be provided from the womb to the tomb, but particularly between the ages of three and six, as it is in every other European country.  I welcome the amendment which helps the people who really need the early childhood pre-school care and education because they cannot afford it.<\/p><p>The sector could be divided between the for-profit part, which covers the ages from four to six and the early childhood part, the cr&egrave;ches, which do not make a profit.  One could say the people who work there do so voluntarily to provide what the State should provide as other states in Europe do.  Sweden provides 33%.  Those providers should get some recognition.  If the for-profit providers were analysed it would be found that the care for three to six year olds makes a profit but the care for nought to three year olds does not.  A specific recommendation from the troika this year was to ensure that Ireland had more child care.  This is one of the ways we must go about it.  Let me not do down the good announcement for the not-for-profit sector but there is more to do. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000016#P00700","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1416486600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Senator Keane makes a very compelling argument.  The provision of child care is a policy objective on which we have to do better, which I think is agreed by all parties.<\/p><p>The valuation element has a very small role.  When I had an opportunity in this Bill to engage with Senators on all sides of the House I was asked to find out how much one could do.  This was not originally envisaged when the Bill was published.  We have managed to rectify an anomaly whereby councils interpreted not-for-profit differently.  This caused considerable stress.  I met some of the not-for-profits who, as Senator Keane rightly says, provide child care for families which are often under financial pressure.  They have better things to do than be stressed out by local authorities considering their not-for-profit role.  We have already had an exemption for charitable child care providers and for the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme only.  I saw the not-for-profit sector as the next obvious grouping.<\/p><p>While I am not unsympathetic to the argument or the difficulties and challenges in the child care sector, extending a rates exemption to those who provide a service, or aspire to provide a service, for profit would be seen as inequitable by other rate payers.  If a business is set up for the purpose of making a profit, regardless of whether it makes a profit, is it right for the State to intervene and decide which profitable or potentially profitable business is more worthy of an exemption?  That would be quite a move away from the valuation system.  I have no doubt that this debate will continue and I hope this amendment brings welcome relief to approximately 1,000 child care providers around the country who give a very important service on a not-for-profit basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000016#P00800","speaker":"1106"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416486600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416486600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 25: \r\nIn page 28, line 26, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo;.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416486600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416486600,"counter":172,"content":"<p>Government amendment No. 26: \r\nIn page 28, to delete line 29 and substitute the following:&ldquo; &ldquo;Exchequer&rdquo;, and\r\n(d) by inserting the following after paragraph 20 (inserted by the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Act 2014):&ldquo;21.

For the record, I will go through what happened with this Bill.  It was published in 2012 and nothing happened for a year.  Just before the referendum on the Seanad in September last year, it came to the House for Second Stage.  Serious concerns were raised across all sides of the House.  Senator Coghlan, being in industry and business himself, was also heavily involved on the Fine Gael side, as well as the spokespersons.  We raised serious constitutional concerns at that stage in the Seanad.  At that time, it is fair to say, the Government looked at it again, spoke to the stakeholders, and came back on Committee Stage.  Deputy Harris had just that day been appointed Minister of State and he came into the Seanad.  Perhaps he would have benefited from a little bit more time before that.  However, we were not satisfied on Committee Stage and we called many votes to indicate our displeasure with what was being put forward.  In fairness, on Report Stage, it is clear that the Minister of State's officials and the stakeholders have had a significant input into this Bill.<\/p><p>I have been critical of the pre-legislative discussion by committees, describing it as a waste of time on occasion.  However, it would have been hugely beneficial in this case.  The discussions that took place between the various interest groups which were to the benefit of the Bill should have taken place in the open at a committee.  In future, that is where this type of discussion should happen.  I am not imputing anything.  I worked with all these people myself and discussed things with them.  However, it would have worked better in that forum.  I am not sure the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform would have had the time to deal with pre-legislative scrutiny of this sort of legislation.  However, it would have been of benefit because these issues would have come out into the open, been discussed, and other organisations who did not do anything about this Bill but whose members would be affected by it may have got involved.  In truth, very few organisations representing members came forward to give suggestions and they spent money getting legal opinions on this that will, as it happened, benefit many other businesses whose representative bodies did not make any contact with me, for one.  I do not know if they contacted the Government.<\/p><p>That is the process we have gone through.  We have a better Bill, although it still has to go to the D&aacute;il.  This was a Seanad Bill, and in talking about the Seanad, not many second houses of parliament can initiate legislation let alone amend it significantly in the way we have done here.  It has shown what Parliament can do, but the system can be improved further.  I support this Bill as it goes forward.  It is acceptable.  It changes the system a bit.  I thank the chairman of the Meath county board, Mr. Conor Tormey, Mr. Pat O'Brien from Duleek soccer club and the Meath and district league soccer club, with whom I consulted on the amendment on Committee Stage relating to sports clubs.  They came back with feedback.

Very often controlled filtering, or Internet blocking, lies outside the control of the public policy process.  We have seen that Internet filtering policies have become more common where states cannot exercise their authority to reach criminals for prosecution or where Internet service providers outside their jurisdiction reject or ignore requests for take down.  Given that, the function of Internet filtering is often carried out by third party actors who are external to public authorities.  Issues of transparency, accountability and legitimacy are very much called into question and that, in itself, brings into the fold issues of freedom of expression, which is an area of contention.  This is particularly relevant where filtering policies are not prescribed in law, when they do not adhere to due process principles and when administrative bodies have responsibility for the content and the sites being blocked.<\/p><p>When one looks at the issue of Internet filtering, it becomes clear that rarely are explicit laws designed to establish a technical filtering regime but rather there is a framework for restricting certain kinds of content online and banning certain online activities.  Very often legal regulation which empowers filtering and surveillance is very vague and is not explicitly stated, if it is, in itself, stated.  There are three main critiques of Internet filtering and blocking.  First, it is the technical capacity of filtering and that it does not prevent under-blocking or over-blocking, which then has consequences for civil liberties.  Second, there are the human rights concerns, such as freedom of expression, and that they are implicated by Internet filtering.  Finally, filtering would not be conducive to positive developments ICT can facilitate, such as innovation.<\/p><p>In 2008, the Committee of Ministers called on member states to ensure that where filtering or blocking is used, it is only done if the conditions of Article 10.2 of the European Convention on Human Rights are met and that it should only occur if it concerns specific and clearly identifiable content and that a competent national authority has taken a decision on illegality and the decision can be reviewed by an independent and impartial tribunal or regulatory body.  Academics and commentators have noted that while the regulation of specific illegal content, such as child abuse content - we saw this recently with the decision of UPC - is commonplace in many countries, the areas of contention and controversy are not the regulation of such material, which I must state explicitly, but the ease with which other types of content could be blocked as a result.  Non-transparent regulation systems are very difficult to reconcile with freedom of expression, so that is why the need for categories of prohibited content to be clearly and precisely defined is critical for the prevention of excessive application of filtering and to ensure there proportionality.<\/p><p>I would like to raise the issue of mission creep and curbing administrative discretion to extend filtering into other areas.  If there is not a precise and detailed specification of the criteria for censorship, the censor, which, as I said, is very often a third party administrative body, essentially can have the power to exercise expansive discretion to restrict speech.  It is important that there are three procedural safeguards which countries implementing filtering systems should provide, including the ability of Internet users to challenge the decision to filter before an independent judicial body, notice to affected users that Internet content was filtered and a definition of the categories of speech subject to filtering.  <\/p><p>I raise this issue in light of the UPC decision and to ensure that now it is being implemented by UPC, it will not be contested on the basis of any of these issues.  It should be underpinned by law and there should be a role for the State.  It should be transparent and proportionate, and capable of being challenged before an independent judicial body and not just at the discretion of a third party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000018#R01000","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1416487800,"counter":208,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank Senator Reilly for raising this very important matter.<\/p><p>The Internet is a vital tool and contributes to education, communication, commerce and the gathering of knowledge among its many uses.  However, we are increasingly aware that there are dangers inherent in the use of the Internet, in particular for children and young people.  Blocking is just one of the tools available to ensure the safer use of this vital resource.  As the Senator may be aware, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, attended the announcement of a new Garda initiative on the blocking of Internet child pornography on Monday, 10 November 2014.  On that day, a great deal of hard work on the part of the Garda and of the company UPC led to the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Garda and an Internet service provider company, UPC.<\/p><p>Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding, the company agrees to block illegal child pornography on its Internet network in Ireland in accordance with a list which is to be provided by the Garda.  Under the new initiative, when a person attempts to access the illegal content, they will instead see a stop page.  The stop page informs the person that the content that they are attempting to access is illegal.  It also gives contact information if the person wishes to complain that the content is incorrectly blocked.  No details of the person requesting the illegal content will be retained.   The Garda is engaging with other companies with a view to signing further memorandums of understanding.<\/p> <p>A review of the memorandum of understanding with UPC will be carried out by the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda after it has been in operation for a period of six months.  This new Garda initiative, along with the existing work of the <i>hotline.ie<\/i>service, together fulfil Article 25 of EU Directive 2011\/93 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.<br\/>There are various technical means of carrying out blocking and also filtering on the Internet, but the result is that the end user does not receive the requested material from the Internet.  The technique which will be used in the new Garda initiative is called &quot;domain name system, DNS, poisoning&quot;.  Other techniques include Internet protocol address blocking, uniform resource locator blocking and packet inspection.<br\/>Different techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages but some techniques may have the effect of slowing down interface with the Internet to the extent that it would impede efficient use.  There are packages which are made commercially available to the public and which carry out filtering on a basis chosen by the purchaser.  Such packages can be useful to parents or others who wish to protect children or young persons from certain online content.  Of course, it must be said that there are no guarantees that all unwanted items will be captured by blocking or filtering systems.<br\/>The question of the voluntary or involuntary nature of filtering and blocking comes up for discussion.  General wholesale blocking of Internet content is not desirable as the Internet should be a resource available to all.  However, when it is a question of illegal content such as child pornography, then it is justifiable to have the means to block such content.  Under the new Garda initiative, once a high enough proportion of the ISPs engage in the new Garda initiative there should be less inadvertent viewing of illegal content.  This should free up Garda resources to pursue those who deliberately collect and even trade in child pornography.<br\/>Child abuse is a horrendous crime and its depiction on the Internet compounds the offence.  The Minister recently attended the ministerial meeting of the EU and US Global Alliance against Child Sexual Abuse Online.  That conference brought home yet again that these dreadful crimes against children are completely unacceptable.  I look forward to hearing the Senator's views, which I will bring back to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000018#R01100","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416488400,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister of State to communicate this to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Minister of State stated that as part of the new UPC blocking, the system gives contact information if the person wishes to complain that the content is incorrectly blocked.  This goes back to a point I made.  Any Internet blocking system should have a process whereby Internet users can challenge the decision to filter before an independent judicial body.  Who will oversee any complaints that are made and who will make a judgment on any appeal on that?<\/p><p>There have been judgments from the European Court of Human Rights on over-blocking.  The Minister of State said, &quot;there are no guarantees that all unwanted items will be captured by blocking or filtering systems&quot;.  There is also a danger, as I mentioned in my comments, of over-blocking of sites that might have some kind of link or image but where these are not child abuse images.  In Britain, the Internet Watch Foundation blocked Wikipedia at one stage because of an album cover that was hosted on one of its sites, so there is an issue with over-blocking.

According to what I read, the person in question was refusing to seek work and felt that the state should still be obliged to pay her unemployment benefit.  The European Court of Justice, the highest court in the European Union, has found in favour of Germany, which has implications.  The original reaction to the European Court of Justice decision predictably enough came from the Tory party in Britain and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, MP, who welcomed it on the basis that it was common sense.  It also raises the spectre of a continuing campaign to change the fundamental law of the European Union regarding the free movement of persons across the European Union, which UKIP in particular wants to see changed and which the British Conservative Party will press in the context of - as it puts it - reform of the European Union.<\/p><p>Given our close proximity to the United Kingdom and our growing closeness across a range of areas, it was inevitable that this question would come up.  If the UK Government were to introduce legislation on foot of the European Court of Justice ruling, as I understand Germany and some other countries will do, it will have implications for immigration policy in general.  It will also obviously have an impact on how social welfare in the United Kingdom is paid.<\/p><p>Given the close links between us and because of the close co-operation between the British and Irish social security systems, I was naturally anxious to get some clarity as to the response of the Government and in particular that of the Department of Social Protection.  How will the Government respond?  Will it involve legislation similar to the proposed UK model?  In general, will it affect the payment of unemployment benefit or other social welfare payments to those from other parts of the European Union coming to this country to live?<\/p><p>On a related matter, does the Minister of State believe welfare tourism is an issue?  The perception seems to be that it is an issue in the United Kingdom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000019#S00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1416488400,"counter":214,"content":"<p>The freedom to move and reside freely within the territory of the member states of the EU is a fundamental right guaranteed under the EU treaties to all citizens and this can bring great benefits to those who exercise those rights and to the countries to which they move.  However, it is important that those availing of these freedoms do so for the right reasons and are not intent on abusing the welfare systems of other counties.<\/p><p>The right of residence afforded to citizens from other EU countries is not unconditional and is governed by the terms of the residence directive 2004\/38.  Under that directive, EU citizens from other countries have an unqualified right of residence for up to three months.  With limited exceptions, during that initial period, there is no obligation on a member state to provide assistance to the person or their family.  Thereafter, the right of residence of people who are not in employment or self-employment depends on them having sufficient resources for themselves and their family so as not to become an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system.<\/p><p>The judgment in the Dano case is very welcome as it clarifies the relationship between the equality provisions of the regulations on the co-ordination of social security systems and the right of residence under the residence directive.  Ms Dano had argued that she was entitled to benefits on the basis the former.  The court concluded that if non-active persons, who do not have a right of residence, could claim social assistance under the same conditions as nationals of the host member state, it would undermine an objective of the directive which is to prevent nationals of other member states from becoming an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system of the host member state.<\/p><p>Figures on the number of persons that the Senator refers to as &quot;welfare tourists&quot; claiming benefits here are not available though it is considered that the number involved is relatively small compared with the overall numbers claiming benefits.  The majority of nationals from other member states who are claiming payments have worked here at some stage, paid taxes and PRSI, and are entitled to receive benefits when the need arises.<\/p><p>The Senator mentioned the United Kingdom and the measures it introduced to limit the number of people coming to reside there.  As the Senator mentioned, UKIP was responding to those, but it has not been a major issue in Ireland.<\/p> <p>While this matter needs to be monitored closely, we do not see any evidence of a real problem at present.  However, the Senator is quite right to raise it at this stage as an early warning signal.  He mentioned open borders.  I can very much understand why the Senator raised this.<\/p><p>As the Senator may know, access to social assistance payments in Ireland is subject to a habitual residence condition, which means that those in receipt of such payments are considered to have established their centre of interest in Ireland and to have significant contacts with this country.  As well as satisfying this condition, the person must also meet all other criteria for the particular scheme.  For example, a person claiming jobseeker's allowance must be available for and genuinely seeking full-time employment.<\/p><p>The statistics which are available suggest that foreign nationals are not over-represented in the numbers claiming benefits, which broadly reflect the number of migrants in the overall population and the workforce.  Apart from the waste of scarce resources, unjustified claiming of benefits brings the system of welfare co-ordination provided under EU regulations into disrepute.  This not only has an impact on migrants who are genuinely claiming benefits here, but also on Irish citizens in a similar position in other member states.  In this regard, the decision in the Dano case is an important milestone in clarifying EU law in this area and its implications are being considered by my Department to see if it can further assist our action to minimise the abuse of our social welfare system.  The key point is that we have responsibility in all areas to ensure the integrity of the social welfare system is upheld and that we limit abuses where possible.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000019#S00500","speaker":"1033","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416489000,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I am very grateful to the Minister of State for clarifying the matter.  The devil is in the detail.  The detail is contained in the last paragraph and it includes the fact that the Department is considering the legal implications.  It is a very serious matter for the Department to draft legislation that might further limit those who have entered the country who are genuinely seeking unemployment assistance or social welfare assistance and who are complying with the EU directive.  I appreciate the flexibility that the Department affords through the habitual residence scheme in regard to Irish nationals who have decided to return here for a short period because of family and other considerations.  This was of major concern to members of the Irish diaspora in the United Kingdom some years ago but the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, was very sympathetic to their view.  The Minister of State will be very aware of the importance of ensuring Irish nationals are not denied unnecessarily.  There is generous sentiment within the Minister of State's Department when dealing with cases of this nature.  While the habitual residence directive is slightly separate from the issue I raised, it obviously has an impact on what we are discussing.  It is for this reason that I am putting these points on the record.<\/p><p>I would be grateful if, at this early stage, the Minister of State could give any indication as to whether Department might be considering seriously the drafting of legislation, especially in light of the promise in the United Kingdom to introduce legislation in respect of the Dano case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000020#T00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1416489000,"counter":217,"content":"<p>I pay tribute to the Senator for expressing an interest in people who had to emigrate over a long period.

It is clear from the many occasions that mental health has been raised in both Houses in recent times that there is widespread agreement in the Oireachtas that we should put in place services designed for the needs of service users today, rather than those considered adequate in the past.  We have, therefore, continued to prioritise programme for Government commitments to enhance mental health services towards community-based care, while developing a more integrated, person-centred and recovery-based service overall.<\/p><p>The recent budget announcement of a further &euro;35 million for next year brings to &euro;125 million the funding ring-fenced by the Government since 2012 to improve mental health and suicide prevention services in line with best practice nationally and internationally.  Despite overall financial pressures, and increasing demands across our care system, the HSE mental health budget increased from around &euro;711 million in 2012 to &euro;766 million this year, with the 2015 position currently being finalised in the context of agreeing a new annual service plan for the HSE.<\/p><p>In light of the reforms of mental health services now taking place generally, and to provide the most efficient and effective combination of services in each region, the HSE is amalgamating acute psychiatric inpatient beds between Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, and St. Brigid's Hospital, Ardee, to the campus of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.<\/p><p>A Vision for Change supports provision of high-quality acute inpatient units based at major general hospitals as an important element of community-based mental health provision.  The new building in Drogheda is at present under construction, and the opening is scheduled for the second quarter of 2015.  The development will be a major improvement to the quality of the environment within which acute mental health services are currently delivered for the Louth&ndash;Meath area.<\/p><p>Discussions are ongoing on a proposal to use the existing inpatient unit in Navan as a day hospital for the wider hinterland.  This would cater for clients who are acutely ill but who do not need 24-hour care.  Day hospitals offer an alternative to inpatient admission for at least a proportion of service users.  There is strong evidence that acute day hospital facilities are suitable for a quarter to one third of service users, who would otherwise be admitted to hospital.<\/p><p>The HSE is also making progress in Louth and Meath on the provision of fully staffed community mental health teams, involving reconfiguration as guided by A Vision for Change.  Over the past two years, many new multi-disciplinary staff have been allocated to such teams, including social workers and occupational therapists.  Community mental health teams are central to a modern mental health service, thus supporting clients to remain in the community.  The development of the day hospital model across Louth and Meath would further realise this objective.<\/p><p>Community supports are also provided by the HSE via the home-based treatment team, and assertive outreach teams, in Louth and Meath.  These are geared towards early intervention and avoiding admission to inpatient facilities.<\/p><p>As a day hospital, supported by appropriate community services, the unit in Navan will continue to be an integral part of mental health services in County Meath.  The day hospital model is also progressing in Dundalk, Drogheda and Ashbourne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014112000020#T00800","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1416489000,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is away and cannot be here.

That conditional mood is used further in some of the other paragraphs.

I would urge the Government to let people know what is happening.  Too much is being leaked and given out mar dhea with phrases like \"this might happen\" or \"that would happen\".
