The damage has been extensive throughout the country, affecting coastal communities, in particular along the west coast, and inland areas.

Will the Leader extend the time for that debate or, if the Minister is indisposed, could it be rescheduled to recommence at some stage next week?<\/p><p>What contact has the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Kehoe, had with the Leader in regard to the establishment of a banking inquiry?  According to media reports, the D&aacute;il Committee on Procedure and Privileges met yesterday evening to agree the composition of and terms of reference for the banking inquiry committee.  I welcome the banking inquiry but disagree on the manner in which it is to be set up.  A Leveson-style inquiry would be a better idea but having said that, we welcome and will participate in an inquiry.  However, from what I have heard, it appears this House will be left out of that inquiry.<\/p><p>The Government and the Taoiseach hold this House in contempt, as does the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Kehoe, which he has proved over the past two years.  I remind the Government Chief Whip that the people voted to retain this House, in whatever form, in the recent referendum, and we have discussed reform.  This is a constituted House of the Oireachtas.  Has the Government Chief Whip been in touch with the Leader?  What are the plans in Government to include the Seanad in that banking inquiry, if any?  If the Government Chief Whip has not been in touch, can we convene a meeting of the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges to put our case to the D&aacute;il Committee on Procedure and Privileges?  I think colleagues on both sides would agree the Seanad has much experience.  Senator Barrett has great experience in the financial area.  We have a right and the ability to participate in this inquiry.<\/p><p>This weekend marks the anniversary of the despicable murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe.  It will be a very difficult weekend for his family, friends, community and his colleagues.  It is a disappointment to me and my colleagues that no one has been brought to justice for this despicable crime of capital murder.  On behalf of my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il, I urge those with information on this despicable murder of a very committed garda, carrying out his duties on behalf of the State and protecting the citizens of the State, to come forward with it.  Will the Leader convey our concern to the Minister for Justice and Equality, who must provide the Garda with the support required and the resources to bring the perpetrators of this brutal murder to justice swiftly?   One year has passed and I know the investigation is ongoing but on my behalf and that of my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il, I put on record that we are thinking of his family, colleagues, friends and community in County Louth.  We earnestly hope those who perpetrated this despicable murder are brought to justice without further delay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300003#B00400","speaker":"1139"},{"type":"speech","time":1390473000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I agree with my colleague, Senator Darragh O'Brien, that it would be absurd if there was a banking inquiry excluding representation from the Seanad.  The finance spokespeople in the Seanad and others who have expertise in that area should be included in any newly constituted committee to inquire into the banking fiasco.<\/p><p>I hate to say &quot;We told you so&quot; but for two years, Members on both sides of the House have been warning that it would only take one serious issue in the charity sector, or one bad egg, to do untold reputational damage to the entire sector, which is crucial.  Unfortunately, it seems we have more than one bad egg and may have dozens of them.  What is unfolding across the charity sector appears to be only the tip of the iceberg.  People are using charities to line their own pockets, to provide themselves with gilt-edged salaries and golden handshakes and to set up companies to provide consultancy services at a premium.  This is doing untold damage to the entire charity sector.  There are 8,500 registered charities, which is an extraordinary number, and they have resources of between &euro;6 billion and &euro;8 billion annually at their disposal.  This issue has been raised in the House time and again and we cautioned that we should proceed without delay in the appointment of a charities regulator, so that we could have full accountability and transparency.  This situation is doing untold damage to volunteers, to people doing tremendous work, to service providers and to those who require those services.  In many cases, we have seen cutbacks in service provision in organisations whose CEOs are paid more than the Taoiseach, who runs the country.  It is unacceptable.  Will the Leader bring some clarity as to whether the Government can expedite the establishment of a regulatory office for charities?<\/p><p>Will the Leader arrange a debate, at the earliest possible opportunity, on our energy policy and strategy?  Yesterday, the European Commission scrapped renewable energy targets so the basis of our entire energy policy is in tatters.  The grounds on which it was predicated in 2006-2007, when it was devised, are no longer in place.  Britain, Germany and France are moving away from wind energy as it is too costly, heavily subsidised and is driving energy prices off the charts for consumers and industry.  We cannot put our heads in the sand and say it has nothing to do with us and we are going to plough ahead.  What is a no-brainer is that we cannot proceed with our current energy policy.  We must change course because we will not be the tail that wags the dog.  We must take into account what is happening on world markets in terms of the price of oil and gas and what bigger players like Britain and Germany are doing in this sector.  It would be foolhardy for this House not to feed into that debate and for us not to revisit our energy policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300003#B00500","speaker":"1143"},{"type":"speech","time":1390473000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I support what Senator Darragh O'Brien said about the anniversary of the murder of Garda Adrian Donohoe.  I extend our sympathies to the people of Lordship and Ballymascanlon and to the Garda and hope people will come forward to the Garda and the PSNI, because it is a joint investigation, to bring the perpetrators to justice.<\/p> <p> I wish to express concern over the banking inquiry.  As reported by Stephen Collins yesterday it is understood that one of the key elements of the Standing Orders will be that no member of the committee should have made any public comment about the banking crisis that could be regarded as biased.  Is it a requirement that all Members of the Oireachtas should have been dumb when &euro;64 billion walked out of the country's Exchequer?  Would we require that somebody investigating the Great Depression in the United States should not have even known it happened?  People have read dozens of books and thousands of articles about this affair.  It would be a bad sign if people who had said nothing about the banking crisis were put on the committee.  I do not know what the legal advice has in mind - perhaps senator Robinson Crusoe and deputy Man Friday on some desert island who, coming to the topic of the collapse of the Irish economy without knowing anything about it, would be suitable to serve on the committee.<\/p><p>This is on legal advice.  There were many lawyers in Government Buildings on the night the &euro;64 billion walked out the door and they should be questioned.  There were no Senators, Deputies or economists there as far as I know.  If there are objections by the banks, their accountants and bank regulators, let them do it openly as lawyers do in court when they can object to members of the jury.  Doing it behind the scenes to try to reduce the level of expertise available to the committee is not appropriate.  We have seen the fine work of Deputies Ciaran Lynch and McGuinness on these committees.  It should not be restrained by this legal advice, given that the legal advice got us into this trouble in the first instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300003#B00600","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390473600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I welcome this morning's announcement of &euro;332 million for roads.

The local people there can make a contribution of up to 20% to have that good work carried out.<\/p><p>We will discuss the recent storm damage later and there has already been considerable discussion on the matter.  A lot of damage has been done in north County Sligo.  Rosses Point golf course has been badly damaged and there is great danger that some of the golf course might be washed away.  The local people brought this to our attention some time ago.  In 2006, I visited Rosses Point and was shown the danger that the sea was presenting to the golf course.  We would like to see some work done on it.<\/p><p>A lot of damage has been done to Lissadell beach in north County Sligo.

It seems foolish in the extreme that we cannot have the appropriate people on these committees.  I would say that legal advice is coming from one of those big firms - we all know their names - between the two canals here in Dublin.  They were responsible for all the legal advice that got us into the crisis and it now seems they will be responsible for all the legal advice on examining their own poor legal advice back in the day.<\/p><p>While we all welcome a banking inquiry and look forward to the public getting answers for the questions which they deserve, apart at all from the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas who will make up the committee I have a concern over whom they will be allowed to question.  For example, it has been suggested that we will not be allowed to examine people from IBRC, the former Anglo Irish Bank, or any matters that may be before the courts.  If that is the case, whom will we question?  What will we find out?  I do not want to be part of a superficial inquiry that examines nothing, concludes nothing, costs a lot of money and supplies easy copy for lazy journalists.  I ask the Leader to take that on board when talking to the Government Chief Whip.<\/p><p>I wish to raise a matter that this House and the other House are sick of raising, which is the matter of mortgage arrears.  Regardless of how often we put forward the facts and regardless of how often we warned in advance of the crisis what would happen, it has all been ignored.  It has now been reported that more than half of the people who borrowed from the four or five lenders in the sub-prime sector are in arrears.  According to the ESRI these are the people most impacted by the recession.  We are talking about the lower working-class community who had struggled with financial issues in the past and had managed to secure mortgages from sub-prime lenders.  Now those sub-prime lenders are not affording the full suite of solutions to those borrowers.  I am acting directly as a go-between on behalf of some people who are threatened with the loss of their homes.<\/p><p>The Government stands idly by while nothing is being done.  As has been said previously here and in the other House, the fox maintains control of the henhouse and the people suffer.  While we all celebrate the relatively good news from Europe and the ESRI, along with party leaders' national addresses, the reality on the ground is that nothing is being done for the people.  I implore the Leader to raise this issue with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and ask him to come forward with tangible measures to put the people in charge of the henhouse and not the foxes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300004#C00300","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1390473600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I support Senator Whelan's call for a charities regulator to be put in place as soon as possible.

I had predicted yesterday's announcement that the targets were no longer legally binding.  I ask the Government and the civil servants to desist now from blaming Europe.

The reality is that personal insolvency practitioners will take on cases where - to paraphrase an expert - there is meat on the bone, in other words something in it for them.

We need transparency and we need to ensure that the public is aware of our political affiliations when we are making statements in public.  I seek the Leader's views on the matter.  It is incumbent on everyone to make it clear when making statements.  If a person is party to a third-party group or an NGO, etc., and speaking on its behalf, and if that person is the Whip of a Government party, then the person should make that known.  This is relevant to the debate and people need to see where we are coming from politically on these issues.  I content that Government policies are causing the problems to which the Senator referred.  I call for a debate on homelessness.  It is long overdue and I do not disagree with the points the Senator was making.  I agree with Senator Kelly on many of these issues but we need to see that Government policy is part of the problem rather than the solution.<\/p><p>I wish to draw attention to the chaos in the ambulance services in the west.  Last week or the week before, five ambulances were stuck in the accident and emergency department at University Hospital Galway at the same time due to delays in the hospital.  The average waiting time for the ambulance waiting crews was from two to three hours and they were unavailable to respond to emergency calls, regardless of how serious.<\/p><p>I am told a stabbing incident took place on the Headford Road in Galway and there was no ambulance available in the city.  The person involved had to be brought to the hospital in a Garda regional support unit car because the nearest ambulance was 20 minutes away.  A new base was opened in Tuam last year but the base is empty 98% of the time.  There is no cover for sick leave or holiday leave during the day.  Therefore, when a person gets sick there is no one to cover for him that day and there are no new paramedics coming in.<\/p><p>The ambulance services are in chaos.  People's lives are being put in jeopardy.  The issue gets kicked to touch any time we raise it.  We need a serious debate on the matter.  Lives are at stake.  People who are working in the services and trying to make ends meet are being put under pressure.  This is a tragedy waiting to happen.  We need an urgent debate on the state of our ambulance services.  It should cover how they can be reinforced, how more resources can be put in place to ensure that everyone, no matter where they live geographically, has access to the services and how ambulances are being held up in the way I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300004#C00700","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390474200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I, too, agree with calls to urgently establish the office of the regulator of charities.

They are organised by charities with good intentions.  They promote healthy lifestyles as well as raising money for good causes.  Unfortunately, it has been brought to my attention that a small number of these mini-marathons, walks and 10 km events are being operated by companies for their own good reasons and causes.  What happens is that a 10 km event is organised and a small donation is made to a charity for the use of the charity's name.

I, too, call on the Leader to seek further reassurances from the Minister for Justice and Equality that the appointment of the charity regulator will be in place before Easter, as announced last week.  I fully agree with Senator Martin Conway that money raised for charities in the name of charities should be totally given to charities.  It should be likewise with services where the money is given for that charity or service.  The money should go exactly to the people who need it most.  We are looking at cutbacks, cuts in services and long waiting lists.  Yet the top executives are getting the money.  It is an issue I have raised continuously in the past two years.  I remarked on Tuesday that this is opening another can of worms.  In the past two years I have highlighted continuously the reluctance I have found having made inquiries and sought information from services.  We need full transparency.  This is our opportunity to get the matter in order and to have open and transparent accounts of what is taking place.<\/p><p>I extend my sincere sympathies yet again to Caroline Donohoe and her children, Amy and Niall, as we approach the first anniversary of the death of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe, who was brutally murdered on 25 January last year.<\/p> <p>I understand that tomorrow evening, 24 January, a memorial service, a candlelight vigil and moment of silence will take place outside Lordship credit union where the brutal murder took place.  I commend the Garda in the area and throughout the country on its dignity and diligence in the pursuit of justice following the brutal murder of Detective Garda Detective Adrian Donohoe.  I am aware from speaking to members of the Garda and friends of Adrian Donohoe throughout the year that the dignity and courage they have shown has been outstanding.  I too urge that all resources that can be made available should be made available to apprehend the culprits for this heinous crime as soon as possible.  This murder rocked the country to the core.  I will never forget the air of stillness at his funeral last year among every member of the Garda and Dundalk community far and wide.  I was reminded this morning while listening to a radio interview by the chairperson of St. Pat's of the community spirit felt in the clubrooms at the time.  The Garda has been relentless throughout the year in exploring every avenue and has given up all its spare time and overtime.  I welcome the fact that progress has been made, although it is slow.  I understand that when these people are apprehended, they will be punished as the case is watertight.  However, more information is needed for the perpetrators to be brought forward.  There are people out there who know what happened but who have not come forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300005#D02600","speaker":"1174","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390474800,"counter":47,"content":"<p>The Senator is well over her time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300006#E00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1390474800,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I urge them to come forward as it is still not too late.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300006#E00300","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1390474800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Having listened to the speakers, I am reminded of the anniversary of that terrible tragedy which took place last year and the fact that we are the worst users of cash and cheques in Europe.  We do not use modern technology in regard to financial transactions of various kinds.  No other country in Europe still uses cheques to the extent that we use them or require the same amount of protection in regard to cash being stolen from banks and elsewhere.  Let me give one example.  France is introducing a &euro;5 coin rather than a &euro;5 note.  That appears to make sense given that it costs the State a huge amount of money to issue notes that have to be replaced now and then whereas the coins do not have to be replaced.  A great experiment took place in Wexford to remove one cent and two cent coins from currency because they are generally not used to any extent as people do not value them on that basis.  I have not heard the result of that experiment.  We are not using technology in the manner that we could.  I mentioned yesterday that Britain is no longer issuing a car tax disc because it has found a more modern way.  Perhaps we could find time for a debate on modern technology and what is happening around the world from which we can learn, and not only in regard to the instances I have given.  However, they are examples of what we can do to save the State money and also to avoid some of the other problems that they create.<\/p><p>I welcome the opportunity to draw attention to the aviation conference which is taking place in Dublin.  The figures being presented are huge.  Ireland is one of the two largest aviation centres in the world.  A little country like Ireland has a tradition of aviation ever since Alcock and Brown crossed the Atlantic for the first time from west to east.  These are the issues that have established Ireland as a centre of aviation authority.  The conference has attracted people from all over the world who are talking about very successful developments.  A company called Avalon produced a film last night showing the tradition of aviation in Ireland and how successful it has been.  It will be shown on RTE next month.  I mention it because it is a reminder of the success stories in Ireland, some of which we hide and do not shout about.  It is probably worthy of a debate at some point in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300006#E00400","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1390474800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Senator Darragh O'Brien made some very interesting points this morning on the proposed banking inquiry, followed by Senators Whelan, Barrett and MacSharry who also made interesting points, particularly on the possible exclusion of the Seanad.

I commend the Garda on its work and the success it has had and I hope the perpetrators will be brought to justice in the not too distant future.<\/p><p>I welcome the revised code of practice for the design, construction equipment and operation of small fishing vessels for fishing boats less than 15 m.  The new code of practice will come into operation on 3 March 2014.  Small fishing boats are currently required to carry emergency position indicating radio beacons.  This revised code will require them to carry automatic float-free emergency position location beacons.  Also, all fishermen on board will be obligated to wear personal locator beacons.<\/p> <p> Every small fishing boat must be in compliance with the new requirements.  Those requirements are in line with the safety initiative for Irish fishing industry vessels that was launched six or seven months ago by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, at Union Hall in the Leas-Chathaoirleach's native county of Cork.  On the same day, the Ministers announced a new enhanced safety equipment grant aid scheme to help with the cost of installing the new equipment, which will undoubtedly prove valuable in accelerating response times.  As a person who hails from a seaside fishing lough, I have witnessed several tragedies at sea.  The new equipment will help crew members who get into difficulty and thereby help to reduce the number of tragedies off our coasts in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300006#E01100","speaker":"1138","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390475400,"counter":58,"content":"<p>If the Senator did not finish when he did, I would have been obliged to call him ashore.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300007#F00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1390475400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>The Leas-Chathaoirleach would have had to reel him in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300007#F00300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1390475400,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I support colleagues' comments in regard to the proposed banking inquiry.

That body must be established without delay, and I hope it will be done next month, as indicated by the Minister.  I have referred before in this House to the damage done by recent revelations to the public perception of the charities sector.  The introduction of a quality standard mark similar to the Q mark for Irish products might be useful in terms of assuring the public that a particular charity adheres to certain standards, such as publishing annual accounts, using a fixed amount of donations to pay for administration and ensuring all salaries are transparent.<\/p><p>Like Senator Martin Conway, it is my experience that for every substandard charity there are 100 good ones.  However, after rugby matches and other events in Dublin, one often sees people engaged in dubious collections.  We all must be prepared to request identification in such instances.  The provision of a quality mark would offer reassurance to the public that moneys given are going to the designated charity.  The issue Senator Conway raises in this regard is important.  I have participated in several 10 km runs and so on, and one does wonder where the money that is raised actually goes.  In raising these concerns I do not seek the deny that there are many charities making a positive and worthwhile contribution.  The introduction of a regulator will be very welcome.

I do not believe it will be possible to find a person in the country who has not made a remark about the banks - and rightly so - in the past five or ten years.  While the legal advice might be to exclude people who made comments on banks, I believe common sense should apply.  What the people need at this stage is common sense rather than legal jargon.  The people want us to get to the bottom of what happened.  We need the right people who are best qualified to sit on that committee of inquiry.

This is the third day this week that it has been raised in the House and rightly so.  It was also raised last week.  The recent revelations about certain organisations in the charity sector have understandably damaged public trust and confidence as alluded to by a number of Members this morning.  The commencement of the key measures in the Charities Act will provide the increased transparency and accountability to allow trust to be rebuilt.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, will issue a call next week for expressions of interest from suitably qualified persons who wish to be considered for appointment to the board of the new charities regulatory authority with a view to making appointments before Easter to allow the authority to come into operation at that time.  Arrangements are also being made to fill the post of CEO of the new authority on an interim basis by the end of February.  I hope that updates all the Members who were seeking that this would happen as a matter of urgency.  I can assure them the Minister is acting accordingly.<\/p><p> Senators Whelan and Kelly spoke about the changes in the EU energy policy announced by the Commission.  They called for a debate and a review of the Government's position on the matter.  I will invite the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resource, Deputy Rabbitte, to come to the House to discuss the effects the European Commission's proposed changes will have on Government policy.<\/p><p> Senator Barrett made comments on the banking inquiry and I have dealt with that matter.

It provides for the election of 11 MEPs for Ireland arising from the European Council decision of 28 June 2013.  In that decision the number of Members of the European Parliament to be elected for the 2014-19 parliamentary term in each member state is set.  The Bill also provides for the implementation of the recommendations of the report on European Parliament constituencies 2013 which was presented to the Ceann Comhairle on 25 September 2013.<\/p><p>The Bill has four sections.  Section 1 provides that the principal Act referred to in the Bill is the European Parliament Elections Act 1997.  It is that Act that is being amended.  Section 2 provides, by amending section 15 of the principal Act, that the counties and cities listed in the new Third Schedule to the Act will be those in existence on 1 January 2013.  Section 3 provides for the substitution of the Third Schedule to the principal Act.  The new Third Schedule sets out the name of each constituency, the counties and cities that each constituency will be comprised of, and the number of Members that will be elected for each constituency in European elections held after 1 January 2014.<\/p><p>The major change from the current configuration is that there will be three constituencies, instead of four.  The reason for this change is that the Electoral Act 1997 specifies that there shall be three, four or five Members in an European Parliament constituency.  Given that 11 Members are to be elected for the 2014-19 parliamentary term, having four constituencies is not a viable option, since it is not possible to allocate 11 seats across four constituencies of three, four or five Members.<\/p><p>I will now set out for the House the configuration of each of the three constituencies.  The three-seat Dublin constituency remains unchanged.  This will be comprised of the counties of Fingal, D&uacute;n-Laoghaire-Rathdown and South Dublin, along with the city of Dublin.  There will be a new four-seat midlands-north-west constituency.  This will be comprised of counties Cavan, Donegal, Galway, Kildare, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo and Westmeath, along with the city of Galway.  In effect, this new constituency consists of the present north-west constituency, along with five counties which were in the former east constituency, but it will not contain County Clare.  The new south constituency will be comprised of the present south constituency along with four counties from the former east constituency and County Clare.  It will consist of counties Carlow, Clare, Cork, Kerry, Kilkenny, Limerick, North Tipperary, South Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow, along with the cities of Cork, Limerick and Waterford.<\/p><p>The population per MEP in the three constituencies ranges from 409,276 to 424,356, which is a very narrow range in terms of the variance of population per MEP.  Thus there is a very fair balance of representation between the three constituencies.  The Dublin constituency will see its representation closely aligned with the other constituencies in the State.<\/p><p>There is a considerable degree of continuity in the arrangement of the constituencies, in spite of the change from four to three.  The new midlands-north-west constituency will subsume the current north-west constituency along with the northern part of the east constituency, while the new south constituency will take in the current south constituency, along with Clare and the southern part of the east constituency.  The Dublin constituency will remain unchanged.<\/p><p>The previous Constituency Commission reported in 2012 and recommended no change to the European constituencies at that time.  In the normal course, constituency commissions were only set up following a national census of population.  However, with the impending accession of Croatia to the European Union, the European Council decided in June 2013 on a new allocation of seats to member states in the European Parliament.  The Electoral, Local Government, Planning and Development Act 2013 provided for the amendment of electoral law to allow for the setting up of a constituency commission in the circumstance that the allocation of seats to the European Parliament had been changed, but a census was not held or due to be held.  The European Parliament Constituency Committee was duly set up and reported on 25 September 2013.  The Bill provides for the implementation of the recommendations in the committee's report.<\/p><p>As I said in my introduction, this is a short Bill.  It has the specific purpose of providing for new constituencies in which 11 MEPs will be elected to represent the State in the European Parliament for the 2014-19 parliamentary term.<\/p><p>In presenting the Bill the Government is continuing the long-established practice of implementing in full the recommendations of independent constituency reviews.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300009#J00800","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1390476600,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, to the House.<\/p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party supports the European Parliament but opposes the legislation which unfairly deprives Ireland of a strong representation in Europe.  The reduction earmarks Ireland for reduction as part of the accession of Croatia as the 28th state in the Union.  The reduction from 12 to 11 seats facilitates the reduction of numbers in the European Parliament and the accommodation of the Croatian delegation at a time when Ireland needs a strong voice in Europe.  The decision to cut numbers was made at intergovernmental level in June 2013, with the Government failing to voice its opposition.  The specific constituency format of large sprawling areas reflects the recommendations of the Constituency Commission under the constraints set by the new seat level.<\/p><p>The Bill introduces a new constituency format for the upcoming European Parliament elections on 23 May 2014, the same day as the local elections.  The total number of Irish seats has been reduced from 12 to 11.  Ireland had already lost one fifth of its representation in the European Parliament, having been gradually cut from 15 to 12 seats, and a further cut of a seat to 11 hits Ireland disproportionately hard.<\/p><p>The European Parliament currently has 754 MEPs, distributed between all 27 member states, but the entry of Croatia to the Union this year which Fianna F&aacute;il fully welcomes combined with the implementation of parts of the Lisbon treaty, which limit the membership to 751, means some countries must lose seats.  On the arbitrary basis that countries with 12 seats must lose, Ireland has suffered a one seat loss.  This must be reviewed in the future.  The more countries that accede to the EU, the fewer seats countries such as Ireland will have, reducing to a maximum of six, if it continues in this light.  That would be grossly unfair.<\/p><p>The reduction of numbers was implemented without any meaningful consultation with the European Parliament's constitutional affairs committee.  This weakens the Irish voice in the Chamber at a time when the Parliament has grown and expanded in powers and influence.  This is particularly important for Ireland as we seek a better deal from Europe on our bank debt and investment to help get the economy going again.<\/p> <p> With only 11 MEPs the workload of the Irish representatives will be even more thinly spread over 20 committees, which is where the majority of work is done in the European Parliament.  Irish voices will be significantly limited in these critical areas.<\/p><p>The general guidelines for the size of Irish constituencies are laid out in the electoral laws dating from 1997 along with the establishment of the Constituency Commission.  The same part of the Act governs how D&aacute;il and European constituencies are set up.  Importantly, it sets the same criteria for each.  This means, as with the D&aacute;il, European constituencies must elect between three and five Members.<\/p><p>The number of MEPs for each country is roughly in proportion to its population.  Under the Lisbon treaty no country can have fewer than six or more than 96 MEPs.  The numbers in the European Parliament were set before the coming into force of the treaty and they will be adjusted for the next mandate of the European Parliament.  For example, the number of MEPs for Germany will be reduced from 99 to 96 while for Malta the number will increase from five to six.  Several other countries will lose seats to accommodate the Croatian delegation to the European Parliament.  Germany will lose three seats while Romania, Greece, Belgium, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Austria, Bulgaria and Lithuania will have one seat less.<\/p><p>The European Parliament constitutional affairs committee was not given the opportunity to make an independent input into the decision-making process for the seat reduction.  All Irish MEPs opposed the decision.  The final decision was made at a Council meeting in June 2013 at which the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, failed to protect Ireland's interests.  The new sprawling constituencies laid out in the Bill reflect the constraints placed on the Constituency Commission by the agreement to reduce the number of seats to 11.<\/p><p>The European Parliament has expanded greatly in influence and power in the past two decades.  It has evolved from what was essentially a talking shop and a consultative body in 1973 to a powerful part of the European machinery.  This renders the number of Irish seats representing the interests of the people even more important.  The replacement of member state contributions by community-owned resources led to the first extension of the parliamentary budget under the powers of the budgetary treaty signed in Luxembourg on 22 April 1970.  A second treaty on the same subject of parliamentary powers was signed in Brussels on 27 July 1975.<\/p><p>The size of areas covered by the new constituencies is daunting to say the least.  Let us consider the western constituency area, in which I live.  The areas included are Cavan, Donegal, Galway, Kildare, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, Westmeath and the city of Galway.  That is an unwieldy constituency for four seats and represents a difficult task for candidates seeking election.  I take this opportunity to wish them every success.  They are taking on a major task to campaign in a rather unwieldy constituency.  The Acting Chairman is aware of the circumstances last time around, but the area has been expanded further, stretching from the coast of Meath to the coast of Mayo.  It is a major and daunting task for any individual to campaign in that region.  Certainly, it would not favour smaller or minority groups.  That is the position.<\/p><p>I put it to the Minister that in future negotiations there should be calls for the size of the European Parliament to be expanded and to factor in that we cannot take any more losses, go down below 11 seats or accept the same number of seats as Malta or Luxembourg.  That would be grossly unfair and the Government should stand up and demand that our position and that of other smaller countries is protected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300009#J00900","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390477200,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He has laid out the objectives of the Bill.  There will now be a reduction overall from 12 to 11 seats.  As the last speaker said, we welcome the accession of smaller countries and more countries to the European Union but cognisance must be taken of the fact that the seat reduction has taken place and was done by the Commission.  The reduction means that Ireland will have one less representative in the European Parliament, which is not in any way ideal, because MEPs must cover a vast area as it stands.  There will be one less voice to represent Irish interests but the reduction is pan-European and therefore every member state is losing MEPs according to size and population.<\/p><p>  This legislation, as well as the legislation on the minimum number of MEPs a country may have, follows from the Electoral, Local Government and Planning and Development Act of 2013, which allowed for the establishment of a committee to examine European Parliament constituencies and make changes to the current nomination requirements for non-Irish or UK nationals standing in European Parliament elections here.  This Bill includes the committee's recommended changes to the constituencies.<\/p><p>  At present, the constituencies are rather large and the Bill proposes changes whereby the constituencies would be larger still with the abolition of the Ireland East constituency.  I do not intend to go into the detail I have before me because the Minister has outlined it in his contribution and I would only be duplicating what he has said.  Instead, I will concentrate on the enlarging of the constituencies.  This will mean vast swathes of the country will have to be covered by each MEP, stretching from Malin Head to Laois, a daunting task for anyone.<\/p><p>  Naturally, MEPs have a different remit to national parliamentarians and county councillors in that the national interest is paramount.  Furthermore, they are charged with meeting constituents and constituency groups in each constituency.  If they do not, they will not be elected.  Therefore, we cannot ignore that they must get around the constituencies.  It is a major job.<\/p><p>  I pay tribute to one of our own who is retiring.  Mr. Gay Mitchell, MEP, has done us great service and has announced his retirement.  He has been in the European Parliament since 2004 and was in the Lower House for 20 years before that.  I imagine we will get other opportunities to pay respect to all the retiring politicians from the European Parliament.  They have given us such service.  Mr. Mitchell is among them but there are others as well.  Since I know Mr. Mitchell I mentioned him in particular and the service he has given for the Dublin region and Dublin South-Central.<\/p><p>  As it stands, MEPs in the Ireland North-West constituency must take into account people living in Kilrush and Moville.  I am unsure whether it is physically possible to cover that territory and engage with constituents.  The matter should be opened up, not at the time of an election but after the European elections, to an academic debate in the Seanad.  There is no better place to have a debate on the European Parliament composition and the population versus that of other countries and so on.  The last speaker referred to small countries and Ireland having the same number of representatives as Malta.  Perhaps there should be a debate about single-seat constituencies or a national list system to get away from these vast constituencies.  That is an academic debate that we should have but not at election time.  We should use the Seanad for a debate afterwards.  MEPs tend to be located in physically different areas and in practice the boundaries might be somewhat smaller when it comes to working out the changes.<\/p><p>  The Constituency Commission report of 2012 recommended that no change be made to the existing constituencies for the election of 12 MEPs.  However, the constituency revision has now been completed and we must operate with one less MEP in advance of the next election in May, bringing down the total number.  Let us compare ourselves with other EU countries.  In terms of population we could not argue because, per head of population and with the loss of one Member, it is not too bad.  Germany has one seat for every 852,539 people and Ireland has a seat for every 416,615 people.  We would lose the argument if it was simply on population, especially if Germany or the larger countries came into the fray.  However, there is a good deal more to put into the argument than simply the matter of population and the large versus the small.<\/p><p>  The legislation passed last year will ensure that the total number of Members of the European Parliament to be elected in the State will be specified.  The Minister and the previous speaker have said enough on that and therefore I will not dwell on it.<\/p><p>  Under the provisions of Article 29 of the Constitution, as recently amended, the Seanad must give prior approval to EU proposals for enhanced co-operation, the <i>Schengen acquis<\/i> and the opt-out for Ireland in respect of EU measures on freedom, security and justice, including the ending of that opt-out.<\/p><p>  As a result of the legislation passed last year, the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 has been amended to transpose changes made by Directive 2013\/1\/EU, which changes the nomination procedures for EU nationals who stand for the European Parliament in a country where they are a resident but not a national.  This is a welcome change as it means that where a resident of one EU country, who is a national of another EU country, wishes to run as a candidate in a European Parliament election, the relevant information available from the home member state must be provided in an appropriate manner within five working days from receipt of the notification or, where possible, within a shorter time.<\/p> <p>The purpose of this is to make the process of running as a candidate in another EU jurisdiction if one is resident in that jurisdiction easier and to give more a more appropriate timeframe for the assessment of the suitability of such a candidate in the adopted country of residence.<\/p><p>The statutory constituency commission carries out periodic reviews of the European Parliament and the D&aacute;il constituencies.  The commission carried out a review in 2012 recommending that the constituencies remain unchanged but as a result of the European Parliament's decision in March 2013 to reduce the overall number of MEPs it had to reconvene last year.  Its role is advisory and its recommendations are not binding but we should take on board its findings given the scrutiny and the independence of the commission as it comprised a variety of individuals.  I compliment the commission on the work it has done.  The commission chose to opt for optimal equality in terms of representation with no breach of county boundaries and allocating four seats to each of the two non-Dublin constituencies but this has been changed.  The changes made to Schedule 3 of the European Parliament Election Act 1997 will change current MEP constituencies.  I wish good luck to all of the candidates and particularly to our own candidates.  All of the people who put themselves up for election in any election must be commended and complimented  I wish them a safe journey on their long road of travel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300010#K00200","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390477800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Senator Sean D.

What we can see is a two-fold development in respect of the European Parliament which is that more and more legislation is before it affecting our lives and impacting on our country in ways that are generally positive and, as Senator Terry Leyden and others have said, the European Parliament itself has more and more power within that process.  There was a time when the European Parliament was largely a body that was consulted but we have moved to a co-decision situation where in more decisions in more areas the European Parliament's assent is required as well as that of the Council of Ministers.  That is now represented as the ordinary legislative procedure.  By and large, that is a good thing, in that the European Parliament represents the citizenry of the European Union whereas the Council of Ministers tends to represent the governments elected by the people.<\/p><p>In one sense we see an increase in direct democracy.  The problem that poses is that within the European Parliament Ireland has a very small number of MEPs.  Compared with the Council of Ministers, it is arguable that the Irish voice within that Chamber will struggle to make itself heard.  It is not in our interests that we have gone from having 12 MEPs to 11.  That means we must have all the more vocal and proactive MEPs and Independents have a particular role to play in that regard.

On the other hand, the downside of the EU is that it sometimes goes beyond its remit and interferes in areas that ought properly to be left to member states.  Only in recent weeks the European Union made a representation to the Romanian Government telling it that the putting down of stray dogs was a matter it ought to be careful about even though that approach was not within the EU's remit.  I sometimes think that some of the Commissioners have too much time on their hands and are interfering excessively.  We see the European Union at its best when it is an institution or a collection of institutions.  When it starts to imagine itself as a new country, to which we must all show some kind of allegiance, then it is at its worst and that is where people least sympathise with its aims.<\/p><p>I am not opposing the Bill.  There would have been an argument for a national list, to which Senator C&aacute;it Keane referred.  Even the naming of the Midlands-North West constituency must have proved a problem.  There may be people in the counties of Louth and Meath who wonder why &quot;North East&quot; was not included in some way in the title of the constituency.<\/p><p>In this disadvantaged situation in which we find ourselves, with 11 MEPs instead of 12 as previously, it is all the more important that we have strong Independent voices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300011#L01200","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1390477800,"counter":98,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and thank and wish Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen well in his endeavours.  It is a pity we are continuing the process of reducing the number of MEPs from Ireland.  We have lost about a third as I understand we had 16 at one time.  The number is being continuously reduced.  We need that representation and support in the European Parliament.  John Bruton, the previous Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael, has pointed out that in the United States small states are looked after better.  Their representation is guaranteed and they have a guaranteed number of Senators compared to the large states, such as New York and California.  We have a question to raise as to why our representation has been reduced so much.  The MEPs have addressed this House, all of whom impressed us, and they found it a very valuable exercise as well.  They said that in no other country they could think of do MEPs come back and address a House of Parliament.  That was major innovation by our Leader, Senator Maurice Cummins, and this House.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen that the constituencies are unwieldy.  From Moneygall to Malin Head is one constituency and from Bray to Mizen Head is one constituency.  I do not think it is possible for people to serve those, which is a pity.  <\/p><p>One of the things about the European Parliament that may account for some of the alienation referred to by Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen is that person A runs for election and then makes a personal gift of his seat to somebody else.  That should end.  Let us have a by-election.  It must discredit the Parliament that it is looking at candidates whom it never heard of.  The reason is that a big name candidate ran in the last election.  Even the House of Lords in the adjoining island, which passes on titles, that is being discredited.  If we are to remove some of the alienation people feel from the European Parliament the personal benefactor practice of handing seats from the person we elected to a person whom he or she chooses must end.  I do not think one could have done it any other way.  One of the comments people have made is that it will be very hard to get the All-Ireland hurling title from anywhere but these constituencies as they include all the hurling counties but we will keep trying.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300011#L01300","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1390477800,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.

It has been very difficult for candidates who wish to contest the election and for the incumbents to see the constituencies altered so radically.  As other Senators said, there is a lack of cohesion in that regard.  Senator Barrett summed it up well when he said one constituency will stretch from Moneygall to Malin Head.

This decision was taken at intergovernmental level in June 2013 and the Taoiseach did not put up a strong case and argue against the reduction of one, which we believe was a major mistake.<\/p><p>The European Parliament elections, as Senator Whelan stated, will take place on 23 May.  He outlined to the House that the constituency in which I live will now stretch from Moneygall to Donegal to Dunboyne, bordering the sprawling Dublin area.  At a time when interest in European Parliament elections has been dwindling, the expansion of the constituencies will not help generate an interest in these elections among the general public.  <\/p><p>As colleagues stated, the European Parliament is gaining more power but our representation is being reduced, which is unacceptable.  I welcome the fact Croatia has become the 28th member of the European Union but I am saddened this has resulted in a reduction in the number of public representatives representing this country in that Parliament.  As Senator Colm Burke, who is a former Member of the European Parliament, has often outlined, the maximum amount of time a Member gets to speak in most debates is one minute.

I agree with speakers who said we need to look at the long-term composition of the European Parliament constituencies.  I contested the European Parliament election and am still paying off some of the loans for that election.  I make no apologies for saying that and have no regrets about the decision I took in contesting it.  If I was asked, I would do so all over again because it is important to have strong representation at European level.  I certainly learned a lot in the two years I spent there but I also made a contribution.  All of our MEPs down through the years have made a substantial contribution.<\/p><p>I am concerned about the size of the constituencies.  In the long-term, we should look at the possibility of 11 one-seat constituencies because candidates will face a financial drain and it will be a problem with which they will have to deal when elected, as will those who do not get elected.  We might have a situation in this election where someone might get more than 100,000 votes but not get elected even though to get elected to this Chamber, one may need as few as 40 votes.  It is a comparison at which we should look.  <\/p><p>In terms of getting strong representation, we need to ensure people are not under financial pressure when trying to do their job as Members of the European Parliament.  The media reports about earnings and expenses are not accurate.  I remember doing an interview with a media person in 2009 and his salary was ten times the salary I earned but we were being hammered left, right and centre about expenses.  Receipts must be produced for all expenses but the media did not buy into that.  <\/p><p>The other issue I have about the European Parliament is the coverage by our national broadcaster.  It is outrageous that it is only given coverage once a month after midnight on a Sunday.  It is an institution which plays a very important part in legislation on which we must follow through here.  We should ask the national broadcaster why it only provides coverage after midnight on a Sunday once a month as it is not good enough.  Even if it was confined to one night a month, then at least have it at a reasonable hour.  We should ensure the 12 Members of the European Parliament get recognition for the work they do because I do not believe they are getting that recognition.<\/p><p>We will now be down to 11 Members of the European Parliament.  Given the number of committees in the Parliament, it will mean there will be some committees on which there will be no representation from Ireland because it would be physically impossible for 11 Members to serve on more than 25 committees, although I am open to correct on that number, or even to monitor them.  That is something which needs to be taken into account in any further discussions on the composition of the European Parliament.<\/p> <p>It also means that as a country we should try to give more support to the Members of the European Parliament who will be elected after May.  We do not give our MEPs sufficient support.<\/p><p>There has been an obvious disconnection from Europe over the past three or four years.  We did not get the message out about the good things done at European level.  Agriculture is the one area that produces a positive message about benefits.  There are many other benefits, such as access to the market and health and safety measures, for example, the toy safety directive.  Many people could not understand that sub-standard products were coming into Europe.  Through the intervention of the European Commissioner, many products were taken off the market.  That applied in other areas, for example, in the health sector.  More co-operation across Europe is reaping benefits for all of us.  We are not selling that positive message.  We need to give more support to the elected Members of the European Parliament, regardless of party or whether they are independent.  That is something we should do after the European elections, for the following five years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300012#M00700","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390479000,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and the publication of the Bill which allows for the holding of the European elections.

I was part of a delegation from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation which travelled to Brussels in January to meet European Commissioners, Secretaries General of some of the directorates and senior civil servants, including Catherine Day.  We met many very interesting people.  It was a very interesting engagement whose purpose was to improve the relationship between our committee and the EU institutions.  One of the things that struck me, including the debate and conversation we had with the Commissioner, is that it is a difficult balancing act to ensure small states are protected from the big states.  We have to ensure the European Union can function and is not gridlocked because every member state can hold back every vote.  There is a strong view that every treaty passed in recent years gives more power to Europe and particularly to the big countries because the veto has been reduced and it has moved to qualified majority voting in most areas.  The number of MEPs has been reduced and there was an attempt to reduce the Commission, which was not in the interests of small states but only in the interests of big states.<\/p><p>While I support the Bill, I hope that if the Minister ends up in the European Commission, he will be mindful of protecting the small states and their interests.  That will convince the people of Europe that the European Union is truly democratic and has the interests of all citizens at heart, that there is no democratic deficit and that big countries cannot control or dominate the small countries.  We have to continue to fight for Ireland&rsquo;s interests and those of all small states.  We have punched above our weight in Europe and we have to continue to do it, but we also have to be mindful of the institutional changes that can work against us at times.

The reduction in numbers is regrettable but blaming the Minister or the Taoiseach, or anyone who represents Ireland in the EU, for that reduction is misguided because it is an unfortunate by-product of enlargement that the MEPs are reduced by one.  It was regrettable but it affected the whole EU and we are not unique.  On a parochial level, I welcome that Dublin has remained one constituency and retains its three MEPs.<\/p><p>I did a survey some months ago on the disconnection between the public and the EU.  My office surveyed more than 300 people, 91% of whom could not name an MEP in Dublin.  One lady thought that Angela Merkel was a Dublin MEP.  She was a very nice lady but that was a source of some amusement in the office.  I concur with Senator Barrett&rsquo;s point about co-options and there are very few people who would refuse a co-option if they were interested in matters European.  It is a factor in the lack of connection.  If people do not vote for a person, it is very difficult for them to know who represents them in the European Parliament.  There is a level of apathy generally in respect of politics but even more so in respect of the EU because people&rsquo;s interaction with the EU is at a very low level.  We must be mindful of that.

To follow the theme that seems to be developing in this debate, the disconnection between the ordinary citizen and the European parliamentary institutions, I suggest that these large unwieldy constituencies will contribute even more to that lack of connection.<\/p> <p>I was a candidate in the 2009 European elections in the constituency that included Connacht, Ulster, Clare, Longford and Westmeath, comprising a total of 11 counties and a very dispersed population.  An additional four counties have been added to that constituency, giving a total of 15.  One of the more positive aspects of the commission's report is that County Clare has been returned to Munster.  I recall canvassing and electioneering in that county, where it soon became apparent that the people living there did not see themselves as anything other than Munster people.  They did not empathise in any way with Connacht-Ulster and did not see themselves as part of that body politic.  When the vote was returned, the local candidate, Michael McNamara -now Deputy McNamara - had obtained the highest proportion of the Clare vote.  That success helped to parachute him into the D&aacute;il.  I wish him nothing but luck as he is a very decent man and a very good public representative.<\/p><p>This was a salutary lesson, however, in how tribalism and parochialism continue to loom large in Irish elections, irrespective of the size or constitution of a particular constituency.  My concern is that this type of parochialism will be evident in the two larger constituencies outside of Dublin, which will make it more difficult for candidates to engage with voters who are located at a significant geographical distance from the candidate.  It is another factor that contributes to the disconnect between voters and their MEPs.  That disconnect is becoming increasingly evident in the findings of opinion polls.  While such surveys in the past showed a very positive view of Europe and European institutions on the part of Irish people,  often suggesting they had more faith in European institutions than in Irish political institutions, there has been a significant change in recent years.  I am sure that is a concern for the Government.<\/p><p>I support Senator Colm Burke's suggestion that a future electoral commission might be directed to consider the creation of one-seat, single Member constituencies.  This would narrow the focus and make the work of MEPs more relevant to particular geographical areas.  It might even help to stimulate a greater level of support for European parliamentary institutions.  Will the Minister outline his view on this idea of single-seat constituencies?  I note that the Constitutional Convention, in its debate on the electoral system, decided not to recommend change.  This was surprising given that it is seen as somewhat more radical than the mainstream political system, representing, as it does, the wider public view.  Perhaps there is an innate conservatism in Irish people, which might have been reflected in the outcome of the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad.  In that instance, people were not prepared to ditch an element of the Constitution simply because the Government of the day proposed it.  That referendum was not the first occasion on which a Government experienced defeat on a proposal for electoral reform.  Many decades ago, Fianna F&aacute;il in government was unsuccessful in this regard on two occasions.<\/p><p>It is vital we look to the future.  We cannot do anything about the current situation, even though it is detrimental to the representational role of MEPs.  As Senator Burke pointed out, it will be impossible, with 11 Members in the Twenty-six Counties and three in the North, to cover between 20 and 25 European Parliament committees.  As a result, Ireland's influence in Europe will be minimised.  The question Senator Wilson asked is very relevant.  Are we facing a situation where Irish representation in the European Parliament will continue to reduce as more countries join the Union, as a consequence of the treaty obligations relating to the cap on the number of MEPs?  That is a very real concern in a context where Ireland has, in the past, always managed to punch way above its weight.<\/p><p>I take this opportunity to congratulate members of the Government on their engagement with the European institutions.  The feedback I have received from MEPs is that Ministers who have attended meetings in Brussels have gone out of their way to ensure there is consultation with the MEPs, an engagement that did not happen under previous Administrations.  This Government has conveyed a respect for and appreciation of the role of MEPs which I hope will continue.  I conclude by echoing the good wishes of colleagues to the Minister in the event that he proves to be the chosen one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300013#N00800","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390479600,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I appreciate his hands are effectively tied in respect of the legislation before us.

I hope, however, that the Minister will take on board the points raised by colleagues today, particularly Senators Colm Burke and Sean Barrett.  It is my hope that in five years time, regardless of the identity of the players on the stage - almost certainly none of us - we will have a different method of electing MEPs.<\/p><p>A year or so ago, I attended a Garret FitzGerald memorial lecture at which Brendan Halligan, a former Member of the Oireachtas and of the European Parliament, delivered a contribution that struck me as very profound.  He observed that in the so-called conservative Ireland of the 1970s, Liam Cosgrave's coalition Government, in establishing the provision for the first directly elected representatives to the European Parliament, came to the conclusion that our existing multi-seat proportional representation system, while admirable in its operation when it came to electing Members to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, was not suitable for electing Members to the European Parliament.  The view of that Government and its advisers in 1973 was that an Irish parliamentary team of 14 or 15 on a European stage of 400 or 500 Members would not be able to play a substantial and constructive role unless it was a substantial and constructive team.  With all due respect to the people standing in the forthcoming elections and those who were previously elected, the view of the then Government was that the quality of candidates seeking to represent this country as part of a small team on a large stage would be higher under a different electoral system.  That Government was succeeded by Jack Lynch's Administration, which opted not to implement the recommendations of its predecessor.<\/p><p>After the forthcoming elections, we will have a team of 11 in a Parliament of almost 800 Members.  In a forum where substantial decisions are being made, we must send forward the best people.  I appreciate that we are facing a done deal in regard to 2014, but the reality is that the electoral system for European elections is probably not fit for purpose.  Senator Burke has proposed 11 single-seat constituencies.  People might have a difficulty with this on the grounds of the proportionality argument.  The smaller parties are of the view - wrongly, in my view - that they would struggle to win seats under such an arrangement.  Consideration should be given to some type of semi-list system, perhaps comprising a national list for the election of five or six MEPs together with five or six single-seat constituencies.  If a party can obtain 7% or 10% of the national vote, it should be entitled to some representation in the European Parliament.  I hope that when it comes to the 2019 elections, whoever is debating the issue in this and the other House, consideration will be given to a different electoral system.  We must ask ourselves whether the people of this State are best represented by the current system.  I am not convinced the answer is &quot;Yes&quot;.<\/p><p>Several Senators referred to a disconnect between citizens and the European Parliament.  We must be honest with ourselves in this regard.  For the majority of people who will go to the polls in May, their primary concerns will be the elections to their local authority.  That is where most of the interest will be.  We will achieve a turnout of 55% or 60% simply because people want to vote in the local elections.  Senator Burke presented me with a very interesting statistic some weeks ago, that in the 2004 elections, more than 30,000 people who voted in the local elections did not bother filling out the European election ballot paper.  As a scholar of politics, the Minister will recall that in 1984, when the European elections were held on their own, the turnout was in the order of 35% or 40%.  Although it is disappointing to acknowledge, the reality is that there is no great public interest in European elections.  It is up to us to seek to turn that around.<\/p> <p>People are going to vote in the local elections and we must try to ensure that they also engage fully with the process relating to the elections to the European Parliament.  The 30,000 to 40,000 people who did not even bother to complete the ballot papers they received when the previous European elections were held should be encouraged to complete them on this occasion.<\/p><p>I hope that in the years to come we will exhibit bravery in the context of European Parliament elections.  I am not suggesting that we should use them as a form of experiment but rather as a way of discovering whether a different electoral system might serve the country better.  Our 11 players on the European Parliament stage - they will also be obliged to operate on the wider international stage - will have to be of premier league status.  I am not sure that the current constituencies, which are made up not just of provinces but of those plus additional areas, offer the best medium for producing representatives of that calibre.  Like Senator Noone, I wish all the candidates well.  They are facing into a daunting and expensive task and I hope those who are successful will serve the country well in the European Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300014#O00200","speaker":"1121","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390480200,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I thank all Senators who contributed to the debate.  As stated at the outset, in this Bill we are continuing the practice of implementing, in full, the recommendations of an independent commission.  I take into account people's concerns with regard to the geography and scale of the territory involved and their suggestions that we should examine the latter in the future.  I have no difficulty doing that in the context of the review that will take place in 2016 of the elections that are due to be held in 2019.<\/p><p>A number of speakers indicated that the Government could have done more to ensure that Ireland would have in excess of 11 seats in the European Parliament.  We previously had 12 seats.  It must be noted that Croatia is going to obtain 11 seats.  In that context, countries with populations that are similar in size to Ireland's ended up with approximately the same number of seats in proportion to their populations.  Denmark, which has a population that is 500,000 greater than that of Ireland, has 13 seats.  Croatia will have 11 and Slovenia is much the same as Ireland.  However, Estonia, Latvia, Cyprus, Malta and a number of other countries will have considerably fewer seats than Ireland.  It is extremely important that the 11 people who will be elected are linked to political groupings within the Parliament that have influence and clout.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party are affiliated to the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists, respectively.  They are the two largest parties in the European Parliament, which is an important consideration.  I do not subscribe to the view put forward by Senator Mullen that an independent Member of the European Parliament will in some way have a huge level of influence on decision making within the European Union.  Independents will plough lone furrows and will not be working with groups such as the liberals, the European People's Party or the Party of European Socialists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300015#P00200","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1390480200,"counter":126,"content":"<p>The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300015#P00300","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1390480200,"counter":127,"content":"<p>I am delighted Fianna F&aacute;il joined a group in recent times because it had been on the fringes for a long period.

Many of the concerns expressed by Senators are not, as Senator Bradford noted, really relevant in the context of the forthcoming elections.  However, those concerns, some of which relate to the task facing any candidate, are genuine.  I considered how we might provide financial assistance to people wishing to stand in the European elections but the in light of the current climate, such assistance would be perceived as giving additional support to politicians at a time when the country is under financial pressure.  That is regrettable but it is representative of the sort of herd mentality with which one must deal.  When that mentality takes over, the common sense debate relating to various issues involved, including the scale of the financial resources required by individuals and parties, goes out the window.  Perhaps on some future occasion, and when times are better financially, we might consider providing additional support - based on 20% or 25% of the quota being reached - in order to foster greater participation in all of the European constituencies.  That would, of course, be if we decide to continue with constituencies of the geographical scale outlined in the independent report.<\/p><p>From time to time there is a disconnect from the European scene.  If, however, difficulties arose in the context of the financial supports for groups in society that are represented by the IFA, IBEC or the social partners, it would not be long before they were brought to our attention in terms of the connectivity required to obtain the necessary resources from the European Union.  Regardless of the nature of any crisis which might arise, one regularly hears public representatives state that a case must be made to Europe.  Making a case to Europe happens on an across-the-board basis.  Had the European Union, its institutions and the IMF not supported us by means of the programme of assistance, we would not have had access to a cheap source of money similar to that which sustained the country in recent times.  Some people wanted to know whether we should have remained in the programme of assistance in view of the fact that we were obtaining money at such a low rate.  We can be the architects of our own problems on those occasions when we do not challenge certain people's dismissive approach to the European Union.  Some might say that the EU does not assist us but massive amounts of money come into our country via the Common Agricultural Policy, the Common Fisheries Policy, the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund and the various rural development programmes.  What we are asked to do is provide funds to match those which continue to be provided to us by the EU despite the fact that Ireland is in a much better place than was the case when it joined the then EEC in 1973.<\/p><p>I will investigate the matter raised by Senator Colm Burke whereby our national broadcaster has decided that it is appropriate to broadcast programmes relating to an entity such as the EU, which has a major influence on Irish affairs, at an hour when they are only seen by those who suffer from insomnia.  The national broadcaster should be made aware of the Senator's view, and that of the House in general, to the effect that there must be greater connectivity between the parliamentary institutions and the Irish people in the context of the work of the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300015#P01100","speaker":"967"},{"type":"vote","time":1390480800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The Seanad divided: T\u00e1, 24; N\u00edl, 12.<\/p><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Senators Paul Coghlan and Aideen Hayden; N\u00edl, Senators Paschal Mooney and Diarmuid Wilson.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300016#Q00100","aye":["1148","1138","1150","1114","1165","1151","1124","1158","1130","1166","1160","1172","1135","1161","1132","1174","1118","1187","1153","1125","1163","1171","1143","1176"],"nay":["1157","1116","1147","1133","1159","1140","1149","1128","1139","1154","1126","1164"]},{"type":"speech","time":1390480800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take the next Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300016#Q00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1390480800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300016#Q00300","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"European Parliament Elections (Amendment) Bill 2013: Committee and Remaining Stages","time":1390481100,"counter":138,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300017#R00100"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1390481100,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Sections 1 to 4, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1390481100,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Title agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1390481100,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Bill reported without amendment and received for final consideration.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1390481100,"counter":142,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &quot;That the Bill do now pass&quot;.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1390481100,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I would like to make the point that we are not opposing the holding of the election on 23 May.

Met &Eacute;ireann, which is under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, provides strong support for the utilities and emergency response community.  Met &Eacute;ireann's new colour-coded severe weather alert and warning system for the public proved appropriate and effective in raising awareness of the weather conditions for the duration of these weather events.<\/p><p>Response to emergencies, including severe weather events such as storms, are managed at local level by the principal response agencies, namely, the local authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE, co-ordinated by the local authorities.  These arrangements operate in accordance with the framework for major emergency management adopted by the Government in 2006 and are well embedded in the relevant organisations.<\/p><p>The Government appreciates very much the co-ordinated response of local authority, utility and emergency services personnel who worked, frequently in difficult circumstances, to maintain the safety of those threatened and to restore services to those affected by the severe forces of nature during the holiday period.  Disruption was experienced during the storms across the full range of transport services including road, rail, ferries and air transport.  The safety of road-users was of primary concern and the Road Safety Authority was very active in issuing advice and warnings to the public.  While normal traffic patterns were disrupted with major routes affected by fallen trees, debris and flooding, at different times, the impacts were not as severe as with previous severe weather events.<\/p><p>Rail services were disrupted due to a number of incidents, including the collapse of the roof at Kent station in Cork.  At other times services were delayed due to fallen trees and debris being blown onto the lines.  In every case Irish Rail put alternative travel arrangements in place to minimise the disruption.  Flights using all three State airports were cancelled, diverted or delayed due to the strength and direction of gusting wind.  Ferry services were severely curtailed, particularly the Swift ferry services.  Disruption over the period was managed effectively by the relevant transport authorities.  The Irish Coastguard Service provided safety information to both the maritime industry and the general public about the risks associated with the storms.  As a result of increased awareness, incident levels in the recreational sector remained normal compared to other years, notwithstanding the severe weather conditions.<\/p><p>Damage was caused to public infrastructure such as roads, bridges and culverts, piers and harbours, coastal tourism infrastructure and coastal protection facilities.  Initial estimates of the order of &euro;65 million for the cost of clean-up, repairs and restoration of public infrastructure were provided to the Government in the interim report.  The cost of repairing roads infrastructure is estimated at some &euro;20 million.  A total of &euro;35 million is estimated under the general heading of coastal works with &euro;10 million for a range of other costs arising such as tourism infrastructure at beaches.  Almost two thirds, &euro;41 million of the total estimate of &euro;65 million arises from two counties Clare, &euro;23 million and Galway, &euro;18 million, reflecting the severe impact of the storms along the west coast.  Local co-ordination and delivery of clean-up and restoration works will be led by the local authorities.  Works are underway to clean up and make immediate necessary repairs in many areas.  At the request of the Government, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has contacted local authorities seeking more detailed reports by 14 February on the envisaged repair works, including related costs.  This will enable the relevant Departments and agencies to support the local authorities in undertaking recovery measures.<\/p><p>The Government is exploring all possible sources of funding to meet the costs which have arisen from the storm damage, including contact with the European Union about a possible application under the EU Solidarity Fund programme.  This fund was established by the European Union to respond to major natural disasters and to express EU solidarity with disaster-stricken regions in Europe.  The fund was created in reaction to the severe floods in Central Europe in the summer of 2002.  A major disaster is defined as damage estimated at over &euro;3 billion or 0.6% of GNI.  In Ireland's case this would amount to &euro;770 million.  The fund provides aid for public emergency operations such as the immediate restoration of infrastructure and plant, the provision of temporary accommodation, the funding of rescue services, the immediate securing of preventative infrastructures and immediate clean-up in disaster-stricken areas.  In exceptional circumstances, however, when the damage is below this threshold, an application may be made but only where a region has suffered an extraordinary natural disaster affecting the major part of its population, with serious and lasting repercussions on the living conditions and the economic viability of the region.  I emphasise that assistance in such exceptional cases is at the rate of 2.5%.  Moreover, while two thirds of applications are made on the basis of exceptional circumstances, most fail.  An additional factor is that for the budgetary period 2014 to 2020, the annual budget for the fund has been halved from &euro;1 billion to &euro;500 million and the European Commission has indicated that future grants are likely to be 50% lower than previously.  In 2009, Ireland made an application to the fund.  On that occasion, however, total damage was estimated at around &euro;520 million.  This resulted in a grant of &euro;13 million from the fund.  Any Government decision on an application to the fund will be made once the full cost of damage has been assessed.<\/p><p>Private property was affected by these storms.  We await information from the insurance industry of the scale of damage to homes and businesses affected.  The Department of Social Protection provides immediate support to households affected by emergencies through it exceptional and urgent needs payments systems.  These payments cover immediate needs such as clothing, food, bedding and emergency accommodation needs.  The Department of Social Protection also has a humanitarian assistance scheme to assist people whose homes are damaged by flooding.  This is means-tested and is intended to assist those who are not in a position to meet costs for essential needs, household items and in some instances structural repair, as a result of the flooding damage.<\/p><p>Once again these storms illustrate the power of nature and the impact it can have on society.  Our co-ordinated response arrangements have developed significantly in recent years and they worked well again on this occasion.  As we are now in the recovery phase, we await more detailed information which will underpin the plans for the funding, co-ordination and delivery of the necessary work programmes, with a view to the timely and effective delivery of a programme to assist the communities worst affected by the storms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300018#S00300","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390481700,"counter":177,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is welcome to the House.  I am disappointed that the Minister or the Minister of State who has responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Brian Hayes, is not here to deal with this matter.  The recent storms were very serious and the Minister of State has outlined how the bulk of the storm damage is on the west coast.  I am here to speak for the east coast because I do not want that part of the country to be forgotten.  The damage to the east coast was not as severe as in County Galway or County Clare but damage was suffered in Dublin and around Portrane in my area in particular.<\/p><p>The funding for emergency restoration work is &euro;45 million.  Applications can be made for up to 90% of the cost to a total of &euro;500,000 with the local authority making up the other 10%.  Those applications must be submitted by 21 February 2014.  We must impress on local authorities the importance of making those applications.  The OPW has produced a restrictive list of allowable repairs such as repairs to build flood defences and coastal protection structures which have been damaged by the recent storms.  This means repairing existing structures.  The borough of Portrane on the east coast has suffered massive coastal erosion over the past year but in particular as a result of the recent storms.  We have been asking for assistance for well over a year and some would say for nearly 20 years.  The borough area of Portrane is close to being breached.<\/p> <p>I have written to the Department on the matter, as have colleagues in the other House.  It seems to me that the minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme that Mr. Gary Grant issued on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, would not allow Fingal to make an application because there are no defences at the location.<\/p><p>I am glad the Minister of State referred to the EU Solidarity Fund.  Obviously his Department, or whichever Department, that supplied his notes are not hopeful of securing funding from the EU.  Areas throughout the country have been designated EU special protection areas or special areas of conservation, such as the borough of Portrane.  That means certain coastal protections cannot be deployed which means there will be nothing left of the area and its dunes.  The same applies to Portmarnock.<\/p><p>Has the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, or the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, met the Commissioner for Regional Development, Mr. Johannes Hahn?   A Fianna F&aacute;il delegation met him last Tuesday to discuss the matter.  We need to work this topic through a bit.  I am sure that the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, will use his departmental contacts to improve things.  It is important we examine the matter with a large degree of urgency because some of the matters I have raised were raised over a year ago.  A high tide is due on 1 February and I hope it will not be accompanied by prevailing winds and heavy rainfall because boundaries have been breached, as Senator Conway mentioned in respect of Clare and others mentioned in respect of areas in Galway.  An exceptional amount of damage has been done and we deserve and need funding to carry out remediation work and to fix the infrastructure.<\/p><p>Roads have been breached in north Dublin, particularly in the areas I have mentioned.  People are worried about their properties.  There are areas throughout the country that are down to between 1 m and 2 m before the properties and dwellings are breached.  I want to see a greater degree of urgency in dealing with the matter.  I know this is not a simple matter and there is no magic wand to fix the problem overnight.  We need more investment.  Even though between &euro;40 million and &euro;45 million has been set aside by the Government, it is not going to be sufficient.  We need a plan to identify areas that are at risk, such as the ones that I have mentioned, and to identify the areas that will be at risk into the future.<\/p><p>I have read a recent report issued by the RPS consultants.  There is a trend among some environmental services to allow the sea do what it will and not build coastal protections.  Obviously I do not want to see that happen.  The closing date for applications is 21 February.  The OPW already funds coastal protection every year through a 90% grant of up to &euro;500,000.  Is the fund separate?  Is the grant available this year?  Is it in addition to the minor flood mitigation work and coastal protection scheme?  A bundle of money is available.  Has the OPW still got money for the regular works that can be applied for in any given year?<\/p><p>I ask the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, to consider specifically the important area of Portrane on the east coast.  I do not want them to forget that the east coast was badly affected by the recent storms and also Clontarf, located in the city of Dublin.  I am sure other Senators will speak for the west coast.  I do not want the east coast to be forgotten because it was not mentioned in the speech made earlier by the Minister of State, Deputy Costello.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300019#T00200","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390482300,"counter":179,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss the matter.  A lot of people have suffered from the recent freak weather conditions and the combination of a high tide and high winds.  The west coast, especially the area I am from, Galway, and Clare, was badly affected.  As the last speaker said, Dublin was affected, which is something we must remember.  Unfortunately, this type of freak weather has left a trail of destruction.  It is not the first time this has happened, although I hope it is the last.  None the less, we should be prepared for a recurrence and install coastal protections.  In January 1839, a major winter storm hit Ireland, and homes, shops and farms were destroyed, a quarter of the houses in Dublin were damaged, and 42 ships were wrecked.  It was a long time ago but weather patterns that result in extreme weather are becoming more of a problem in Ireland.  The event in 1839 was recorded in history as O&iacute;che na Gaoithe.  When the State pension was introduced, in cases where births were not recorded, people were asked whether they could remember the big storm known as O&iacute;che na Gaoithe and their acknowledgement was used as validation of their claim.  I am sure there are many people in Galway, Clare and some parts of Dublin who will remember the recent storm because their lives have been changed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300020#U00300","speaker":"1135"},{"type":"speech","time":1390482300,"counter":180,"content":"<p>Seachtain na gaoithe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300020#U00400","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1390482300,"counter":181,"content":"<p>In the 175 years since the event to which I referred, there have been infrequent storm events in Ireland.  If we allow climate change to continue unchecked in the coming decades, extreme weather events will become more common.  Extremes of heat and cold such as we experienced in 2010 and 2011 will be much more frequent, summers will be hotter and drier, winters will be warmer and wetter and there will be a risk of more frequent and widespread flooding.   There is consensus in the climate science community - climate sceptics have more or less gone by the board - that climate change has caused serious changes in weather patterns and conditions across the globe, and Ireland is no exception.  The Government is conscious of the matter and we have brought forward a climate change Bill.  The matter has been debated by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht and a report has been prepared.  The publication of the Bill is imminent.  The committee carried out a lot of work on the legislation and made recommendations that will be taken into consideration.<\/p><p>Yesterday the European Commission announced the renewable energy targets for Ireland and non-binding targets for energy efficiency.  I was disappointed with the Commission's report and the White Paper.  We must keep an eye on the matter.<\/p><p>The Minister of State mentioned the role played by Met &Eacute;ireann and I compliment the organisation on its work.  Obviously it would be great to have an eye in the sky that could forecast the weather two months in advance.<\/p><p>Coastal protection and tackling coastal erosion is being considered by the Government.  We must ensure action is taken to tackle climate change.<\/p><p>The OPW and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government have policies in place to assist victims of storm and flood damage.  I know the Government's inter-agency emergency response group met two weeks ago to co-ordinate responses to the storms.  I compliment the local authorities, the ESB and emergency response units that responded and went out during stormy weather.  Local authorities have estimated that the damage in Galway and Clare cost &euro;41 million or almost two thirds of the total estimate.  The cost and method of repair is the first question that people ask.  Last week the Minister clarified that the initial estimates made by his Department that cover the cost of the clean-up, repair and restoration of public infrastructure are in the order of &euro;65 million.  He also confirmed that the cost of repairing the road infrastructure is estimated to reach &euro;20 million, with &euro;35 million for coastal work and &euro;10 million for a range of other costs.<\/p><p>The local co-ordination of the clean-up is being led by the local authorities and funding has been allocated by the Office of Public Works.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, is responsible for the assessment, through the OPW, of many of the individual cases of damage.  The OPW is responsible for funding large and small-scale flood defences.  Demands for money to repair the damage are being submitted from all parts of the country.  The sum involved is &euro;250 million over a five year period.  I know that one wall beside the Connemara Golf Club is down.  It existed for years but has been destroyed.  I have also seen houses flooded this time that were not flooded since the 1800s.  Flood defences are another issue to examine. <\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, mentioned the EU Solidarity Fund that amounts to &euro;500 million.  I hope Ireland will qualify for some of the fund because people have suffered hardship as a result of the weather conditions.<\/p><p>Insurance is also an issue.  Some people do not have insurance and it is a big issue for them.  People have attended the environment committee to discuss the matter.  Some people cannot get insurance.  The OPW has done some work to co-ordinate assistance.<\/p> <p>Even people who have put in place flood defences are being refused insurance cover.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, is continuing his good work on this matter.  It is hoped that the Department of Social Protection will look favourably on the requests for assistance from those whose homes have been flooded and have no insurance cover.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300020#U00500","speaker":"1135","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390482900,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I, too, welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the recent storm damage which affected so many parts of the country, in particular the western sea board and including the east coast.  I welcome also that we are having this debate a few weeks after the storms occurred because we have during the intervening time had an opportunity to assess the full extent of the damage caused.  The word \"devastated\" is regularly used in relation to various issues but to say that communities along the west coast were \"devastated\" by the recent storms is appropriate.  I will leave it to Senators from other parts of the country to deal with the counties they know best and I propose to confine my remarks to my own county, which I know best.<\/p><p>The Kerry coastline took a major battering during the storms on St. Stephen's Day and at the turn of the year.  Coastal roads literally crumbled under the force of tidal waves, beaches were torn asunder, beach car parks were rendered inaccessible, power lines were cut and homes and businesses were flooded.  It really had to be seen to be believed.  One caravan park in south Kerry was utterly devastated by the storms, with mobile homes destroyed and facilities flooded.  A new community centre in north Kerry was under water following high tides.  Many Senators may be familiar with Rossbeigh, which is a beautiful beach and was shown on many of the RTE news programmes, but it resembled a scene following an earthquake.  Such was the force of the waves, a community playground was badly undermined and the main access road to the beach was covered in boulders.  The root of the problem at Rossbeigh dates back many years to the collapse of the part of the sand-spit which sticks out into the sea at Castlemaine Harbour.  The spit protected many of the homes furthest along the shore in that it prevented the strongest waves coming beyond it.  However, it is estimated that in 2008 millions of tons of sand collapsed into the sea, yielding to the forces of nature and coastal erosion.  Since then, residents further along the coast have been at risk and, sadly, the worst was realised in recent weeks.<\/p><p>Approximately two years ago, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, allocated funding to some of the areas in Rossbeigh and Cromane to help build up the embankments alongside the homes of those living very close to the sea.  Thankfully, the money invested there appears to have prevented damage as a result of the recent storms.  This suggests that much can be done to protect homes and businesses in vulnerable areas.  A huge amount of damage was done to other parts of Kerry, including Ballylongford, Ballinskelligs, Lispole and Caherdaniel.  The iconic beach in west Kerry where part of &quot;Ryan's Daughter&quot; was filmed no longer exists, and is unlikely to be restored for many years.<\/p><p>Communities in the affected areas are wondering what it will take before real action is taken to protect coastal areas.  I have heard many people say that the forces of nature cannot be stopped and that there is nothing we can do to stop coastal erosion.  I do not accept that.  The people living in coastal communities do not expect enormous barricades to be erected around the entire coast but they do expect the Government and local authorities to make a serious attempt to save them from the worst of what high tides and stormy conditions can bring.<\/p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, mentioned the figures of &euro;23 million and &euro;18 million in the context of Clare and Galway, respectively.  While Kerry County Council estimates that it will require at least &euro;20 million at a meeting this week, council members were told by officials that this is a very conservative estimate.  I understand that councils are currently submitting their estimates to the Local Government Management Agency but it is safe to say that the cost of repairing the damage caused will be the most expensive in living memory.<\/p><p>Everybody knows that protection of our coasts from coastal erosion, particularly where storm damage is most acute, will cost money.  If this funding cannot be provided by the Exchequer, we will have to look elsewhere for it.  I acknowledge that every effort is currently being made by Government to secure as much funding as it can from Europe and I hope it will be successful in that regard.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to and thank the many hundreds of men and women in our local authorities, Eircom and the ESB who left their families over the Christmas period to work day and night in terrible conditions to deal with flooding, broken power lines and structural damage.  <\/p><p>I appeal to the Ministers concerned to take a long-term look at the problem of coastal erosion and the impact it is having on communities along the coast.  I remind everybody that the Wild Atlantic Way will be launched in 2014.  Following on from the success of The Gathering, this has already aroused huge interest from people abroad.  Given that they will be driving along coastal areas, the last thing we want them to see is torn up beaches and coastlines.  It is important the problem is addressed prior to the launch of the Wild Atlantic Way.  What we do not want in the context of addressing this problem is millions of euro spent on consultants' reports and structural assessments, although areas such as Rossbeigh and others need to be properly surveyed.  I ask that the Ministers concerned meet the people affected by the flooding and storms.  They know better than anyone what needs to be done to address this problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300021#V00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1390482900,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, to the House.  While he does fantastic work in his area of responsibility, I would prefer if the Minister directly responsible for this matter was in the House for this debate.  As the Minister of State is, in fairness, busy in his own job, it is a pity he has had to come to the Seanad for this debate.  I know he was in Brussels during the week on important business concerning other more serious disasters.  He would be far better employed dealing with that matter.  I am sure his day has been significantly interrupted in having to come to the House for this debate on an issue which does not come within his area of responsibility.  In saying that, I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State.<\/p><p>  The storms that occurred over the Christmas period were relatively unprecedented and were pretty frightening for many people.  People were frightened during the storms and following them when they saw the damage caused.  People continue to be frightened because they are not sure what, if anything, will happen in terms of repair and replacement.  There was significant flooding on the east coast in areas such as Meath and Louth, particularly the River Boyne area in Drogheda.  I have not heard much in dispatches about that but I presume the local authority has been in touch with Government in regard to flood prevention initiatives in this repeatedly flooded area.  <\/p><p>  In regard to County Meath, the staff of Meath County Council, local garda&iacute; and members of the local fire brigade are worthy of praise in terms of the huge amount of work done by them in unsocial hours during a holiday period when they would rather have been at home with their families.  As a result of the storms, many trees in County Meath, and throughout the country, broke and fell.  The fact that one had no idea or warning of when a tree might fall resulted in dangerous and unpredictable road conditions.  I know that Meath County Council contractors responded at short notice to try to remove fallen trees in dangerous areas.  <\/p><p>  The media also deserves to be thanked for its work in informing people about what was going on at a time when many of its staff were also on holidays.  There was no government agency open at the time which could provide people with information in regard to whether roads and so on were passable.  This need was met not by a command and control centre in Dublin, but by AA Roadwatch, local radio stations, RTE, <i>thejournal.ie<\/i> website and so on.  They took their role seriously and provided a wealth of information, as did many of the main newspapers through their websites.  There was an absence of government at the time.  While I am sure there people connected to the task force on emergency planning were working to resolve problems - I have already mentioned local authority staff and so on - the task force did not meet during the crisis.  There was much criticism a few years ago of the former Minister, Noel Dempsey, being on holidays in Malta during a crisis.  We do not know where any of the Ministers were at the time of this crisis.  There was certainly no sign of any of them until a few days later.  However, that lacuna was filled by the media, local authority staff and the emergency services, to whom I pay tribute at this time.<\/p><p>  In terms of emergency planning, we need to improve.  The Government spent a fortune last year on a leaflet relating to emergency planning.  However, we got no information during the storms on what roads should be avoided and so on.  Even today there is little information in regard to what amount of money will be spent, where it will be spent and what people can look forward to.<\/p> <p> There should have been more central planning and emergency reactions at a time when there was a red alert covering large parts of the country.  Winds reached hurricane force.  Were this America, the media would have been broadcasting live from the scene, the winds were so bad.  However, I am unsure as to whether the situation was taken that seriously by central government at the time in terms of the immediate reaction that was necessary, for example, confidence building and information provision.  A much better job could have been done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300021#V00300","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390483500,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I join others in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, to the Chamber.  Although he represents Dublin, his west of Ireland background equips him to understand the issues that we faced on Friday, 3 January.  My parish of Ennistymon and Lahinch in County Clare were severely affected.  Indeed, &euro;5.8 million worth of damage was done to Lahinch alone, with &euro;23.7 million worth of damage to the Clare coastline.  The infrastructure of my parish and neighbouring parishes were decimated by the freak conditions, which were a combination of high spring tides and stormy weather.<\/p><p>It is difficult to imagine the level of damage done, it was so extensive.  We all fought hard to get Government and other funding for the construction of public infrastructure that was subsequently damaged by the weather.  We raised &euro;100,000 over a two-year period to replace railings on the promenade at Lahinch.  The replacements were imported to ensure they were weather resistant and rust-proof.  Half of them were wiped away and the promenade's streetscape was destroyed.<\/p><p>Other areas that did not receive as much attention, such as the White Strand in Miltown Malbay, Clahane and Liscannor pier, suffered considerable damage.  Most important was the damage done in Quilty, where people are still homeless because of it.  Down the coast, significant damage was done to Kilbaha and Carrigaholt.<\/p><p>I join with others in commending the fantastic effort - I would call it a meitheal - made by local authority workers in conjunction with the emergency services.  For example, when the Coast Guard was called at 6 a.m. to take families from their homes, it responded speedily and, importantly, showed empathy.  I commend the hundreds of people from around the country who saw the damage on television and gave of their time to help with the clean up.  The amount of rubbish in the sea was incredible.  Thousands of bags of rubbish were collected from the promenade, walkways and golf club at Lahinch.<\/p><p>I was disappointed with the initial Government reaction.  I do not understand why the interdepartmental emergency task force could not have met on the Friday.  The severity of the damage was well known through the local authorities and the media.  The meeting should have been held at lunchtime on Friday, not at lunchtime on Monday.  If the task force did not understand the damage on Friday, the meeting should still have been held on Saturday.  Noon on Monday sent out all of the wrong signals.  It seemed to take three or four days to pull an emergency response together.

I walked many places along the sea front where I had not walked for quite a while, for example, down piers, through graveyards, etc., in the days immediately following the storm.  I was shocked by the devastation.  I had never seen anything like it.  I spoke with people who were in their 80s, but they had never seen anything like it either.<\/p><p>I was disappointed with the Government's reaction.  No senior Minister visited Connemara to see the damage, nor did any Minister see the incredible effort invested in the clean-up operation.  Considerable praise must be given to the members of the local services, for example, the fire brigades and councils, as well as to the volunteers who pulled together to ensure that people were safe and the mess could be cleaned up.  A cohesive approach was lacking from the Government, though.<\/p><p>I saw a marked difference between Galway city and county.  I will not point fingers, as this is too big an issue, but the infrastructural damage done at county level is much greater.  For example, more damage has been done to roads, piers, graveyards, houses, slipways, etc.  Much of the flood damage in Galway city is more easily rectifiable.  I am afraid that we have underestimated the storms' cost to rural areas.  County councils' estimates may be too low.<\/p><p>This situation has highlighted a lack of forward planning in many respects.  We cut back on county council staff numbers on the ground during the past ten or 15 years.  For this reason, they have not been able to carry out the same level of drainage or road works as they used to.  We have seen the consequences, for example, flooding in areas that were never so badly affected.  We must learn from this situation and look forward.<\/p> <p>We need more staff on the ground to ensure that drainage culverts are cleared.  I have walked along the shoreline in many different areas.  In my view, more money needs to be invested in tidal erosion measures.  While there was little damage in areas where breakwaters and proper tidal protection walls had been erected, in other areas where these defences had not been built roadways and pathways were washed away.  <\/p><p>I spoke this morning to a lady from Carna, whose local roadway, by which she accesses her home, was washed away.  I understand that the councils have made lists of the priority issues for them.  I have been told that they will not be responsible for repair of roads that are not county council roads.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify if that is the case.  The lady to whom I spoke this morning told me that a temporary road, running through a neighbour's field, has been put in place to enable her to take her children to and from school.  As there is no road by which a tanker can access her home she is unable to get oil and has had no home heating for the last number of weeks and no refuse collection.  This lady has been told by the council that as the road that was washed away was not a county council road, replacing it is not its problem.  She has already paid &euro;8,000 in respect of the temporary access put in place and has been told it will cost at least &euro;22,000 to make it safer and that no new road will be put in place by the council.  Perhaps the Minister of State will outline what will happen in this situation.<\/p><p>The islands of Inishbofin, Inis M&oacute;r, Inis Me&aacute;in and Inis O&iacute;rr were also badly hit.  Of particular note was that it was very hard to get through to the county councils during the days of the storms.  While staff on the ground were very good they were too few and far between.  People have learned in the interim that councils will not engage with them on non-council related issues.  The approach across government is scattered.  While the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the OPW and county councils all have a role to play in this area, there is no joined-up approach or thinking on the matter.  I am also hearing from councils that even though they have already submitted lists of works requiring to be done to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, they have not yet received any response.  <\/p><p>An emergency fund should have been put in place to allow emergency works to be carried out.  In some cases, the walls of graveyards have been washed away and many coffins have been left exposed to the elements.  Fisherman have lost their tackle and boats have been thrown up into fields and destroyed.  We do not yet know if they will be provided with compensation to help them get back to where they were prior to the storms.  Insurance is another concern.  People are worried lest they will be refused future flood insurance cover.  All of this raises the question of where stands the Climate Change Bill, climate change being the broader issue which needs to be addressed in this regard.<\/p><p>There is no sense of urgency on the part of Government in relation to a number of issues.  I wish somebody from the Government had come to see the devastation caused in my area, which is a lot worse than it appeared on television.  Some people remain cut off.  We need a greater response in these types of situations and to ensure that anybody who is out of pocket is compensated and reinstated to the position they were in prior to the storms.  I am not asking for the construction of platinum clad roadways but that facilities be returned to the state they were in prior to the storms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300022#W01500","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390484100,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The storms that ravaged the west have caused more than &euro;19 million worth of damage to Galway city and county.  The preliminary cost for Galway city is &euro;1.282 million.  The four main areas of coastline damage in the city are Silver Strand, Blackrock in Salthill to Birdoo, Blackrock to South Park Claddagh and Ballyloughane beach.  A critical tourism amenity for Galway city is the proposed extension of the promenade in Salthill to Silver Strand beach.  Thousands of people walk the promenade in Salthill on a daily basis.  The estimated damage to the area between Silver Strand and Salthill promenade is &euro;400,000, which includes measures for protecting against coastal erosion.  Galwegians have been calling for years for the protection of this coastline and, in particular, the putting in place of protective buttressing at the Knocknagoneen drumlin which has undergone significant erosion.  It is critical for tourism and the local economy that this funding is provided for the city's beaches and coastline.<\/p><p>The key priority for Galway city and county is that a two-stage coastal protection plan is put in place to deal with immediate and long-term coastal protection works.  Galway County Council in its interim submission has estimated the costs to be &euro;18.32 million.  Many of the coastal areas require more rigorous investigation.  As such, that cost could and will increase.  The two causeways linking Leitir Mor and Gorumna to the mainland have been damaged.  The access road to the graveyard in Ervallagh in Roundstone and a residential access route in Errislannan have been damaged.  How will the OPW and the relevant Departments deal with damage to infrastructure which is not directly the responsibility of the local authority but is critical to the economic sustainability and well being of local communities, including damaged access routes to residential areas, beaches and burial grounds?  There was significant damage to the defence wall on the Inis Me&aacute;in airstrip which is not in public ownership but is critical for tourism and access to the island.  What is the position with regard to funding in that regard?<\/p><p>The OPW has contacted local councils requesting priority lists in regard to flood mitigation and coastal protection works.  However, as already stated in the House earlier, the criteria in this regard is restrictive in that it allows only for repair of sea walls and defence walls that have been damaged.  In Galway, there are numerous examples of damage in areas where there was no wall or protection in place, which means that work does not come within this category.   An example is the roadway washed away in Errislannan near Clifden.  There is need for a co-ordinated approach to ensure particular works do not fall between the cracks with regard to which Department is responsible for funding.  Councils are concerned that significant works will not come under any particular category in terms of funding.  <\/p><p>Significant damage has been caused to tourist infrastructure, facilities and amenities and will require immediate engineering repairs because these areas, such as the promenade in Spiddal, are now even more vulnerable to future storms.  Analysis also needs to be fast-tracked to provide more extensive long term coastal defences.  I believe that recent events are a wake up call of the need to immediately put in place effective and long term, sustainable coastal protections along our western seaboard and the island of Ireland as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300023#X00200","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speech","time":1390484100,"counter":202,"content":"<p>The scale and intensity of the recent storms is a stark reminder to us all of the destructive power of nature and the importance of our never under-estimating it.  Like others, I acknowledge the tremendous efforts of the emergency response teams who put themselves on the front line in often appalling and dangerous conditions and whose dedication and skills so often help to mitigate the very worst affects of storms.  I thank all those who left their families over Christmas and the new year for their work during that time, when many of us where, perhaps, sitting in the comfort of our homes enjoying ourselves.  It is appropriate we thank all of those involved in the emergency services, local authorities, Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ESB.  One can only imagine what it would be like to be at the top of 35 ft. or 40 ft. high pole in high winds and rain, which is what ESB personnel had to do in order to return services to people who badly need them, in particular at Christmas time.  I congratulate all involved.<\/p><p>Many Senators have mentioned the Office of Public Works.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, recently acknowledged his responsibility in this area and said that he would play his part.  The OPW has already written to the local authorities indicating that it will consider applications for funding to assist in the cost of repairs to damaged coastal flood protection structures, including sea walls, rock armour and embankments, including the embankment at Bellurgan in Dundalk which is need of repair.<\/p> <p>It has been threatened twice in the past and houses in the Bellurgan area have been flooded.  Will the Minister give consideration to repairing the damage there?  In Whitestown Shore, Bellurgan, Termonfeckin and Baltray, roads have been washed away and are in urgent need of repair.<\/p><p>We must examine the mistakes that were made which have contributed to the flooding problems we are experiencing.  Much has been done and much progress has been made in tackling flooding problems, with almost &euro;370 million invested from 1995 to date in flood risk management measures which have protected 10,500 properties and delivered benefits to the estimated value of more than &euro;1 billion in terms of damage and losses avoided.  This is a very significant achievement by any measure.  Of course much more work remains to be done, and this Government has prioritised investment in flood risk management by allocating &euro;225 million over the period 2012 to 2017 as part of its infrastructural capital investment programme.  It is hoped to continue this and I believe the task will be undertaken and completed safely in many of the areas liable to flooding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300023#X00300","speaker":"1138","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390484700,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.  I support my colleagues, especially those in Galway West, Senators Naughton and &Oacute; Clochartaigh, and my colleague from Clare, Senator Conway.  These were the two areas that suffered the worst impact of the high winds and storms over Christmas and in early January.  Thankfully, the eastern part of the county, which I represent, escaped relatively unscathed on this occasion.  However, we went close to getting a taste of what occurred in Ballinasloe in 2009, and there was certainly much concern and worry in the Ballinasloe area for a couple of days until the waters began to recede a little.<\/p><p>Of the estimate of more than &euro;18 million made by Galway County Council for the repair of damage, approximately &euro;500,000 of that is required to repair roads in east Galway that have been seriously damaged.  The most significant concern in the eastern part of the county is along the Shannon Callows.  Farmers in that area encounter huge problems every winter trying to pursue their farming activities.  When the emergency is over, there is a need for a broader debate on the issue of drainage works on the River Shannon.  While the OPW is the lead agency, there are so many other organisations involved in that area, including the National Parks and Wildlife Service, fisheries, the ESB and Waterways Ireland, that no action is being taken.  We must give legal authority to the OPW to enable real progress to be made there.

I apologise that I might be considered the wrong Minister to reply to the debate but, unfortunately, neither the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, nor the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Deputy Brian Hayes, could be present.  I assure Senators that all the issues they have raised will be brought to their attention.<\/p><p>The stormy weather and the almost freak nature of the coastal erosion took place between 13 December and 6 January.  Indeed, I remember it quite well because I was in Rosses Point in County Sligo on 2 and 3 January and it certainly sounded as if the roof of the house would be lifted and that there would be a huge amount of damage but, interestingly, there was little damage in County Sligo.  However, much of the west coast, which is more of a promontory into the sea while Sligo is more of an inlet, was extremely damaged from Donegal to the Kerry coast.  The east coast and Dublin, Meath and Louth were affected negatively as well and an amount of damage being done.  I watched the television programme on Portrane and saw the amount of coastal erosion that regularly happens there, but the damage that was done during the storm was substantial.<\/p><p>The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has produced an interim report.  His Department is the lead Department on this issue.  The report was produced within a week of the storms ending, so there was a degree of alacrity in that regard.  According to the report, an allocation of &euro;45 million in funding has been made - the damage is estimated at &euro;65 million - and deadlines for applications have been established.  It is made clear that the report is an interim one.  The expectation is that there will be a substantial amount of other material to be considered.  Specifically, provision is made for the local authorities to provide a further report by 13 February.  Each of the local authorities for the areas affected will no doubt produce their assessments of the damage caused and the costs that will be required.  This is an ongoing issue that is being monitored by both the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Office of Public Works and the two Ministers with responsibility, Deputies Hogan and Brian Hayes.  Indeed, I am informed that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, is visiting the mid-west area at present, so he will see what is happening there.  Obviously the situation will be dealt with when the further reports are produced.<\/p><p>Senator Darragh O'Brien asked what we are going to do about EU funding.  I gave some details about the provisions that apply and the expectation that EU funding would only be provided in the case of an emergency of a very significant nature.  However, that will not stop us from looking at it carefully.  The decision on whether to apply for EU funding will be taken after the Government has considered all the material, when all the information has become available to the Minister.  It is expected the decision will be made by mid-February when the information comes through from the local authorities.  The OPW's minor flood and coastal protection scheme for 2014 has an allocation of &euro;45 million.<\/p><p>With regard to the weather warnings that were mentioned, officials in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government assessed each weather warning and decided if the trigger conditions for activating a national co-ordination group for severe weather were met, but such was not the case.  The national co-ordination group met to review the response, as is standard procedure.<\/p> <p>Throughout the period there was liaison with the transport and energy sectors on the issues arising as well.<\/p><p>With regard to matters of roads, bridges and issues and facilities of that nature, these are really in the charge of local authorities and more detailed information is being awaited from the local authorities in response to those issues.<\/p><p>A number of Senators referred to climate change and the matter is relevant to the situation.  We have the national climate change adaption framework in place and it was published by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in 2012.  There is an expectation that the draft document establishing the principles, and involving an integrated approach with all of the stakeholders, institutions, etc., will be ready by mid-2014.  The intention then will be to finalise a national response on elements of climate change that might be relevant.  Those are largely the issues that were raised.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300024#Y00300","speaker":"1006","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390485300,"counter":207,"content":"<p>There was one specific issue on the existing emergency funds.

The question I pose has come more into the public domain this week due the incarceration of Margaretta D'Arcy.  She is a peace activist, member of Aosd&aacute;na, an artist and film maker.  She has been sent to Limerick Prison for three months on foot of a court decision that her protests at Shannon Airport were illegal.  She contested its decision and was sent to prison due to refusing to sign a bond agreeing not to protest again at Shannon Airport.  I call for release of Margaretta D'Arcy.  She should not have been incarcerated in this manner.  The forces of the State could have been deployed in a better manner rather then imprisoning a 79-year old woman who has cancer and Parkinson's disease.  She has been a lifelong peace activist and for many years has highlighted the illegality of aircraft using Shannon Airport as a stopover.  She is part of the Shannon Watch campaign.  Many other groups have also drawn attention to the fact that aeroplanes land in Shannon with military personnel on board.  Other reports claim that military equipment has been carried on the aeroplanes and there have been rendition flights through Shannon, etc.  <\/p><p>I tabled a motion to draw attention to the issue of the Government allowing foreign armies to use the civilian airport at Shannon as a stopover on their way to wage war and those aeroplanes are suspected of being involved in extraordinary rendition.<\/p><p>In 2006, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, the present T&aacute;naiste, to whom I posed the question, was a member of a Council of Europe committee that examined the issue and reached the conclusion that rendition flights took place at Shannon.  At that stage he said that &quot;not knowing is not good enough.&quot;  He also talked about the fact that he was being told by the Government of the day that there were no inspections and no evidence to prove that this was happening.  There was no evidence because inspections did not take place and the Council of Europe has also said it.  We also had the Wikileaks documents in which the T&aacute;naiste's predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern, admitted he knew about these flights.  We have also seen evidence in a New York court case that indicated that Shannon was used for torture flights.  The Shannon Watch groups has also presented a lot of documentation on the flights that pass through Shannon Airport that point to its misuse.  <\/p><p>We have been given assurances in parliamentary answers that the US Government has assured us that there is nothing untoward going on.  I also note that in February 2008, Ed Miliband had to tell the UK Parliament that, &quot;Contrary to earlier explicit assurances that Diego Garcia had not been used for rendition flights, recent US investigations have now revealed two occasions, both in 2002, when that had in fact occurred&quot;.  The US Government does not have a good track record in telling the truth on these issues.  The matter is within the remit of the T&aacute;naiste and he has campaigned against this happening.  I commend the President's wife, Ms Sabina Higgins, for visiting Margaretta D'Arcy in Limerick Prison.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300025#Z02300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1390485300,"counter":230,"content":"<p>There is often fog at the airport and no way through it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300025#Z02400","speaker":"1138"},{"type":"speech","time":1390485300,"counter":231,"content":"<p>What is the Government's policy on the matter?

The Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952 gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs primary responsibility for the regulation of activity by foreign military aircraft in Ireland.  Permission to land at Irish airports, including Shannon Airport, is subject to the condition that the aircraft are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives, do not engage in intelligence gathering, and that the flights in question do not form any part of military exercises or operations.<\/p><p>The arrangements governing overflights and landing of foreign military aircraft have been continuously in place under successive Governments for more than 50 years.  Under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, as amended in 1989, civilian aircraft are prohibited from carrying weapons or munitions over Ireland or into Irish airports unless they receive an exemption from my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  There are no exceptions to these rules.<\/p><p>In 2013, the Department granted permission for the landing of 541 foreign military aircraft at Shannon Airport.  Permission was granted in all cases subject to the normal conditions that apply.  In the vast majority of cases, military aircraft used the landing facilities at Shannon Airport for the purposes of refuelling and to allow for crew and passenger rest.  In a small number of cases, aircraft landed in Shannon Airport to allow for the transport of dignitaries or other persons participating in visits to Ireland, as a result of medical emergencies on board, for flight crew training and for aircraft maintenance purposes.<\/p><p>The T&aacute;naiste has stated categorically on numerous occasions that the use of Irish airspace and airports for extraordinary rendition operations has not, and will not, be permitted under any circumstances.  The programme for Government states clearly that this Government &quot;will enforce the prohibition of the use of Irish airports and related facilities for purposes not in line with the dictates of international law&quot;.  Ireland does not, and will not, tolerate the use of our airspace or airports for any illegal purpose, including torture, rendition or the unauthorised detention of any individual.<\/p><p>There is no new information or evidence to support any assertion that Ireland has permitted such activity or that any person has ever been subjected to extraordinary rendition through Irish airspace and airports.  It has been made clear by the current Government and previous Governments that such activity would be considered completely unacceptable and illegal by Ireland.  <\/p><p>The assurances the Irish Government has received from the US authorities are specific that prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be without our permission.  These assurances have been confirmed at the highest level.  The assurances are of a clear and categoric nature, relating to facts and circumstances within the full control of the US Government and are the result of inter-agency consultation.  The Irish Government is satisfied that it is entitled under international law to rely on these assurances, which have been repeatedly given to us by the US Government and repeatedly accepted by Governments for more than 50 years.<\/p><p>In this context, it is considered that all reasonable, appropriate and adequate measures have been and are being taken to ensure that Irish airports are not being used for any unlawful activity.  No evidence has ever been produced, nor any concrete allegation made, at any point that any person has ever been subject to extraordinary rendition through Ireland.  If Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh or any other citizen has evidence to this effect, details should be provided to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to allow for a thorough investigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300026#AA00200","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speech","time":1390485900,"counter":234,"content":"<p>This is the verbatim statement given for the past ten to 15 years on this issue and it is simply not acceptable.

The Minister for Social Protection told us the local property tax could be deducted from social welfare payments.

The widow's contributory pension could not be considered a short-term payment.

The Senator will be aware that the local property tax legislation allows for a person who is liable for the local property tax and who is in receipt of certain social protection payments to have local property tax deducted from his or her payments.<\/p> <p>The Revenue Commissioners have agreed with the Department of Social Protection on a facility for the deduction at source of this tax from a large number of schemes.  This includes the widow's, widower's and surviving civil partner's contributory pension.  Deduction of the local property tax, LPT, from Department of Social Protection payments commenced in July 2013.  With effect from 17 January 2014, 19,770 customers are having deductions for local property tax from their payments under social protection schemes.  I can advise the Senator that 4,283 of those are on a widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's contributory pension.  To maintain statutory minimum income and to ensure a customer is left with enough resources to live on, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 provides that deductions from social welfare payments in respect of the local property tax will not breach the statutory minimum income guarantee as set out in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  That rate is currently set at &euro;186 per week.  The maximum personal rate of pension for someone under age 66 on a widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's (contributory) pension is currently &euro;193.50: thus only &euro;7.50 per week can legally be taken from this payment in order not to bring the recipient below the basic social assistance personal rate of &euro;186 per week.  That appears to be the issue.<\/p><p>For those aged 66 and above with a maximum pension of &euro;230.30 per week, the total amount that can be deducted is &euro;44.30.  This amount is calculated after a deduction is made for recovery of any existing court orders or social protection overpayments and is based on the primary personal rate only.  Secondary payments, which cover specific benefits, are not taken into account in determining whether a claimant's scheme payment is greater or less than &euro;186 per week.<\/p><p>There were 16 additional requests for deductions from this particular scheme which were not implemented as to do so would have the customer's welfare payment below the basic social assistance rate.  In these cases the customer would have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners to choose another method of payment.  I would like to assure the Senator that the Revenue Commissioners have advised that no penalties will be applied to those who signed up for the deduction at source facility from their social welfare payments and where the deduction was not accepted.  However, a penalty may apply if an alternative payment arrangement is not made by the customer.  The Minister for Social Protection appreciates the convenience for social welfare recipients of having the deduction facility in place, but her overriding obligation is to have safeguards which ensure a customer is not left without sufficient income.  The Minister is reviewing the implications of allowing customers to have deductions made on a voluntary basis from their welfare payment which has the effect of bringing their payment below the basic rate in some clearly defined instances. <\/p><p>I acknowledge the presence in the Gallery of the delegation from the cross-Border body in Northern Ireland.  I welcome them to the Chamber.<\/p><p>This is a complex area, however, with intertwined policy and legal implications, and it requires careful consideration before any final decision is made in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300026#AA00600","speaker":"1081","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1390486500,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State Deputy Perry for being present but it is a pity the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, was not present because I would have appreciated the opportunity to discuss this issue in more detail with her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300027#BB00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1390486500,"counter":241,"content":"<p>She is considering it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014012300027#BB00300","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speech","time":1390486500,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Yes, but if a person must have a basic income of &euro;186, how can the local property tax be deducted at source as very few people are in receipt of payments at a higher rate?
