Will the Leader confirm that the powers in this regard have been devolved from the Minister for Health to the Minister of State in advance of him coming into the House?  <\/p><p>On the Order of Business yesterday and on numerous occasions in the past year, with other colleagues on both sides of the House, I raised issues in the banking sector, specifically mortgage arrears.  The matter was put as stark as it could be yesterday at the Irish Bankers Federation conference when Ms Fiona Muldoon, head of banking supervision in the Central Bank, lambasted the banks for their inaction on it.  According to her, there are 167,000 mortgages, to a value of \u20ac35 billion, in arrears.  She states a culture of leadership is missing in Irish banks.  We know this, as does the Leader.  It is as plain as the nose on his face.  The mortgage arrears figures are 50% worse than they were this time last year and they are getting progressively worse every day.  When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, were here earlier this term, they both confirmed that by 30 September the Central Bank would be in receipt of mortgage solutions from the mortgage lenders to the problem of distressed mortgages.  I am not talking about the Personal Insolvency Bill which is the nuclear button for people in moving towards bankruptcy; rather, I am talking about those who are struggling.<\/p> <p>The Minister for Finance and the Minister of State both said the banks should submit their solutions for mortgage holders not yet in severe mortgage difficulty but who will be in the future to the Central Bank by 30 September.  Will the Leader confirm that the deadline was met and that the Government is examining the proposed solutions for distressed mortgage holders?  It is very important that we know the stage the process has reached to provide some light at the end of the tunnel for mortgage holders.  Was the deadline of 30 September missed?  <\/p><p>Yesterday a number of Senators on both sides of the House asked for a debate on the issue of mortgage arrears.  It behoves us to have such a debate very quickly.  I am not going to propose an amendment to the Order of Business, but I ask the Leader to ensure that in the next two weeks there will be a specific debate on the problem and solutions to it.  This must happen because if the head of banking supervision in the Central Bank is saying to the Irish Banking Federation what other colleagues and I have been saying for over one year now, there is no reason we cannot allow time in the House to have a proper discussion on how we can help thousands of Irish people.  The Leader must arrange a specific debate on this matter in the next two weeks, not by way of another Bill or an overall discussion on finance issues.  It must be specifically about mortgage arrears and solutions.  Two weeks ago many Senators were outraged at the increase of 0.5% in the variable mortgage interest rate charged to AIB customers, but last week we had confirmation from the Taoiseach that he would do nothing about it.  He said the primary goal of the Government was to make AIB viable again.  There are thousands of mortgage holders who have found they are not viable and cannot continue to repay mortgages at inflated rates.  I, therefore, ask the Leader to arrange in the next two weeks a specific debate on the issue of mortgage arrears and solutions to the problem.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700002#A00500","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350466200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I know the Leader will respond to Senator Darragh O'Brien's request, but I point out that we will be discussing Senator Sean D. Barrett's Bill on mortgage credit during Private Member's time this evening, which will give us an opportunity to discuss this very important issue.  I agree with Senator Darragh O'Brien regarding the comments of Ms Fiona Muldoon, to which other colleagues referred in the House yesterday, including Senator Aideen Hayden.<\/p><p>I call for a debate on prison conditions.  We have sought such a debate in this House before and I know the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is examining the issue.  A debate is called for in the light of the very disturbing report published yesterday on St. Patrick's Institution.  The report by the Inspector of Prisons, Judge Michael Reilly, is an appalling indictment of the conditions and regime in place for young offenders in that institution.  Some of the most worrying and disturbing findings concern serious allegations of intimidation and bullying, serious incidents when young men were stripped and cut by prison officers and situations where children were held in 24-hour lock-up for several months at a time.  It is absolutely appalling, although it comes as no surprise to many of us who have been aware for a long time, following the presentation of other reports, that conditions in St. Patrick's Institution are dreadful.  The Government has already committed to ending the detention in that instution of children, that is, those under 18 years, but I am really glad that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, have now said they will close the institution as a place of detention for those under 21.  That is a very important commitment to make.  The Director General of the Irish Prison Service,  Mr. Michael Donnellan, has said that since the report was prepared, action has been taken and a new governor appointed.  That is all hugely important, but when members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality visited the prison recently, it was an anodyne and cleaned-up version of the institution that was presented to us.  In that context, I am concerned to ensure the abuse of young people in the institution is not continuing.  The point is made in the report that of the 190 prison officers in the institution, only a small number were involved in the aforementioned practices and Mr. Donnellan has said action has been taken against them.  However, it is important that we are assured that the appalling practices in the prison are at an end.  I am very glad that St. Patrick's Institution is finally going to be closed.  It should have been closed a long time ago.<\/p><p>I look forward to a debate, after the referendum, on children's rights more generally, for which the Leader has committed to having the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs present.  We have just come from the launch of the Labour Party referendum campaign, at which we heard articulate and eloquent presentations by two children, both aged around 15 years, who made a very strong case for supporting the referendum proposal.  It is important that those of us on the &quot;Yes&quot; side are not complacent and that we are conscious of the fact that a &quot;No&quot; campaign will be launched.  It will actually be quite helpful in generating debate and ensuring plenty of discussion on the airwaves and in public fora because it will be crucial to have a high turnout on 10 November.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700003#B00200","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1350466200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Sometimes the Seanad is accused of being a talking shop, but this can be very valuable.  I ask for a general debate on the state of the nation and, indeed, the planet.  It seems there is a significant and worrying lack of vision.  In this country we are becoming a divided community.  There is also division among the nations of Europe and globally and there do not seem to be many with an encompassing global vision.  I am worried because several years ago in this House I said I believed financial and climatic problems were going to produce circumstances where catastrophic events would become more frequent, occur closer together and be more disastrous.  Regrettably, these words are coming true, both in the world of finance and in terms of climate change, as today's weather conditions show, although mercifully the threat to Cork has not materialised.<\/p><p>When I speak of a lack of vision, I am thinking of the tragic replication of the problems faced by the country during the Famine when needless suffering and tragedy was caused by the imposition of economic theories from the centre.  These theories were mistaken and caused disaster.  We have the same situation, with the IMF admitting that it was wrong.  It is like the 18th century when doctors bled their aristocratic patients by applying leeches to them because they thought it would cure their sickness, but it actually killed them.  We have the same situation where economic theories are applied and it is then admitted that they are mistaken.  What is being done to rectify this?  The consequences are not negligible but real, in human terms.  As an Irishman, let alone as an elected representative, I am horrified and ashamed to find food poverty is at a level of 10% in this country.  I am horrified that a professional man has to steal \u20ac58 worth of groceries to feed his children; that a garda sergeant's wife says she does not have enough money to feed her children properly and that they have cornflakes days.  This is shocking in the 21st century, especially when there is so much money and wealth.  It is a question of having the vision to put people first, to look at and reorganise financial structures in the interests of the people in order that we will no longer feel shame at the level of food poverty in this country.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Ivana Bacik in her comments on the report on St. Patrick's Institution.  The Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, a wonderful civil servant who has done us proud in standing up for the rights of children, was mocked and derided by officials, right up to the level of Secretary General in the Department of Justice and Equality.  That is frightful and the matter must be examined thoroughly.  We must all work together to protect the rights of children.  <\/p><p>We will have an opportunity to speak on the issue of mortgages later.  If the Seanad ever wished to show it has relevance, it will be able to do so today when a new Senator with a brilliant academic record brings forward legislation.  I know from experience how difficult it is to formulate legislation.  He is doing what many other colleagues have done in the past, including Senators Ron\u00e1n Mullen and Fergal Quinn and former Senator Joe O'Toole, and providing a wonderful opportunity for the House.  He is adapting ideas from elsewhere in Europe and history in the interests of the people to alleviate a crippling problem.  We can be proud of this.  Let us make ourselves proud by having a global debate and showing that in this House we can give a lead and show vision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700003#B00300","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1350466200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Senator Darragh O'Brien has made most of the points I wished to make on the banking conference held in Dublin yesterday.<\/p> <p>One of the bankers said in his opening address that the banks have been humbled.

I ask the Leader to arrange a discussion of the report by the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention, Judge Michael Reilly, on St. Patrick's Institution.  The report was delayed for three months before being released on the night of a soccer match alongside reports on other prisons.  It was a significant report but it was unfair to those prison officers who do an excellent job in difficult circumstances without giving them a right to reply.<\/p><p>On &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; the Minister for Justice and Equality was given plenty of time to reply but he failed to acknowledge the difficult work carried out by the majority of prison officers.  The officers in Oberstown have received no training in dealing with juvenile offenders.  There is a lack of balance both in the presentation of the issues and the Minister's defence of his own staff.  He seems to have no regard for their position and they are being condemned without proper recourse to law.  It is difficult to manage one's defence when the Minister can speak on the radio.  The report is worthwhile, however, and Judge Reilly has been efficient in visiting the prison without advance notice.  I commend the Ombudsman for Children on the position she has taken on the issue and welcome that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has given her powers to meet young offenders.<\/p><p>Fr. Flanagan from Ballymoe on the border of counties Galway and Roscommon founded Boys Town in the USA.  He would turn in his grave if these allegations prove to be truthful.  Bullying and intimidation should not be allowed in any prison in a developed country like Ireland.  A solution will be found, however.

When I made a similar call yesterday I mentioned the comments by Fiona Muldoon at the Irish Banking Federation conference, which had the odd title \"Restoring Confidence, Rebuilding Trust\" but did not include a single speaker who might have represented distressed mortgage holders or organisations like New Beginning.  If the federation really wants to build trust it must consult the people most affected by this disaster.<\/p><p>I join other Senators in calling for further discussion on the report on St. Patrick's Institution.  I am reminded of the comments by Dr. Eoin O'Sullivan in regard to the Magdalene laundries.  He pointed out that the people of Ireland knew about the laundries because every family in this country knew somebody who was affected by them.  The first report calling for the closure of St. Patrick's was written in 1985.  Emily Logan stated that she was patronised and made fun of when she reported on the conditions in the institution and that officials of the Department of Justice and Equality treated the matter with an attitude of indifference because it related to young people who had broken the law.  In a day and age when we are about to hold a referendum on the rights of children, this is not good enough.  The retraining of 60% of the prison officers in St. Patrick's does not - no disrespect intended - go far enough.  We need a full judicial investigation into what happened.  How has 28 years elapsed with collusion by the Department of Justice and Equality - I do not think I can put it any other way - in what happened in St. Patrick's?  It is not good enough and we need to draw a line in the sand before this becomes another Magdalene laundry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700004#C01200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1350466800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>Tugaim faoi deara go raibh d\u00edosp\u00f3ireacht an-mhaith ins an Seomra seo D\u00e9 hAoine seo chaite ar ch\u00farsa\u00ed Thuaidh-Theas, agus f\u00e1ilt\u00edm roimhe sin.  Is maith an rud \u00e9.  On a number of occasions since entering the Seanad I have called for an invitation to be extended to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in the North to address the House.  The Leader has indicated that he is amenable to sending such an invitation.  I ask for an update on the current position of the discussion, which would be useful in the context of the statements that are made from time to time on the economy in the Six Counties.  We could raise these questions directly with the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.<\/p><p>I call for a debate with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on renewable energy and the exploitation of natural resources.  International experts have estimated that 20% of Ireland's energy needs could be met by renewable energy by 2020, a proportion which increases to 80% by 2050, and that 20% of our GDP could be derived from exports of clean energy.  Investment in tidal energy and renewables could lead to a renewables revolution and create thousands of green jobs throughout the country.  Sinn F\u00e9in receives the occasional jibe about what we do in the North but we have delivered on this agenda in the Northern Executive in co-operation with the other parties.  We recently published the offshore renewable energy strategic action plan and attracted significant investment in this area, including an announcement last week of a project in which Bord G\u00e1is and OpenHydro will develop a 100 MW tidal array off Tor Head on the north coast in County Antrim.  Stormont is delivering on renewable energy and our target is to provide 40% of electricity supplies from renewable sources by 2020.<\/p><p>The report by the Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture on our oil and gas licensing regime does not appear to have gone anywhere.  It is imperative that the Minister tells us how he intends to progress the report.  Our licensing regime is more amenable to oil and gas companies than most of the western world and a plethora of wind farms are planned for the west coast, despite extensive local objections.  Senator Kelly brought forward a Bill on wind turbines.  The Leader might indicate when we will take Committee Stage of that Bill.  It appears to be stuck in a departmental quagmire at present.  A debate on these issues would be very useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700004#C01300","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1350466800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Last night Cork experienced heavy rain and flooding and a further 50 mm of rainfall is forecast for today.

We hear about institutional defensiveness in terms of the State's response and its claims that these reports were not to be believed, the general non-belief and attitude of disbelief towards young people who make claims, the further victimisation of young people who have already been abused, which is something we have heard before, and, in particular, the targeting of children who are already vulnerable.<\/p><p>It seems very hard to credit that a State institution could be responsible for such neglect and such blatant cynicism about the welfare of young people, and that this could go on in the 21st century.  It is hard to credit that a judge preparing a report did not believe in the integrity of the statistics about the provision of education and schooling in terms of teacher and prisoner attendances for schooling and, therefore, brought in his own experts to test that.<\/p><p>How can it be that we have a State institution where prison gangs are running riot, where a drug problem is rife and where there is not a basic duty of care or an attitude of care, more importantly, being shown towards young people?  It can only be because there is a cultural lack of sympathy towards these children, these young people, because they are offenders.  That is precisely when we must have high standards.  It is precisely when the people in one's care are hard to love or make life difficult for themselves that we have to have high standards and that we should not be allowed to drop our standards in the way people are treated.

The settling of the fiscal situation is the one issue that is under our control.  I am a critic of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, for his serious failures in that regard.  We should have a debate to focus on the issue.<\/p><p>  The second issue which we should debate on alternate weeks is the banking situation.  I agree with Senators who have called for such debates.  Banks are not lending.  I do not share Senator Paul Coghlan&#8217;s confidence that the comments of the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, which I welcome, will in any way change the <i>modus operandi<\/i> or attitude of the banks.  Unfortunately, we have a situation in the country where banks are not functioning.  There are no flows of credit.  The situation is serious.<\/p><p>  We are four years into the crisis.  We have an insolvency Bill that is still sitting in the Department of Justice and Equality.  Recently, I had occasion to try to ascertain information for a solicitor who made a representation to me on whether a person made bankrupt this year would benefit from the provisions of the new insolvency Bill.  After some time I got confirmation that this person would not benefit.  I was told by an official in the Department that they were too busy to engage with me due to the work on the Bill.  I have never come across that in my 15 to 16 years in this House.  It reflects the attitude of the people from the HSE and the Department of Health who went before the Committee of Public Accounts.  They appeared to be under political duress not to co-operate with the democratic process.  That is appalling.<\/p><p>  When we were in government, those in opposition, in particular the Labour Party, shouted about greater transparency and more freedom of information.  I have never seen a situation closed down to the extent that it is under this Government.  Nothing is transparent and as a consequence we are paying a price for that.  I call for a debate on those issues and the insolvency Bill.  The proposals on the latter are highly deficient.  To have three years when neighbouring jurisdictions have one year will lead to a situation where many people who have been made bankrupt, many of whom will want to get back into business, recreate their wealth and create jobs, will do it to the benefit of other countries not this one.

What went on is appalling and we owe it to the young people who went through that institution to establish some kind of truth commission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700007#F00200","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1350468600,"counter":78,"content":"<p>It took a woman,  Ms Fiona Muldoon, in the lions' den of the bankers' conference yesterday to spell out to the bankers how incompetent they are in dealing with the crisis in mortgage lending.  She also drew an analogy between the treatment by the banks of their customers who are small and medium sized business owners and those who have mortgage difficulties, pointing out that the treatment of both was identical.  She noted the Central Bank found there was a lack of experience in Irish banking:<ul><br \/>Clearly, we were in uncharted territory and we found that the banks' teams were generally too small and insufficiently resourced with the appropriately experienced people.  We pushed on this with all the major institutions: asking for an increased skill set, a bigger shop, a better operational platform and earlier intervention on &quot;pre-arrears&quot;.  Old-fashioned credit collection techniques were largely absent.  <\/ul>  Yesterday, at the same conference, Mr. John Moran, the new supremo in the Department of Finance, was critical of the banks along the same lines.  This week is Enterprise Week for small and medium enterprises.  Mr. Moran stated that banks have to get their act together because small and medium enterprises are needed in this country to curb the scourge of unemployment.  In time, we are going to be looking back at this.  The banks failed us, the regulators failed us.  The banks are again failing to deal with the issues in the economy.  Increasingly, I wonder if we in this country are able to solve our problems in any way.  As Ms Muldoon observed, why do we not solve each problem and each mortgage in a business way, one by one, in an American way?  The failure of our banks means they are the cause of the economic crisis we are in - there is absolutely no doubt about that.

Do we treat them, as it appears from the statement by the Ombudsman for Children, as people who have broken the law, or as people who need assistance, care and attention to be rehabilitated so that they can come back into the world and make their own way there rather than end up on a pathway to crime?  That pathway is often laid out at the beginning and if it is ignored the situation is exacerbated.<\/p><p>I thank the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention for his perseverance in regard to St. Patrick's Institution and for his efforts, especially in going in there at times when he was not expected and in the middle of the night in order to make sure that what he reported would be accurate.

I ask the Leader to write to the Minister for Education and Skills asking for education centres to be brought into the loop, with the rest of the school community, in order to deal with the issue.  Last weekend I attended an event run by the Sligo Education Centre.  It was attended by parents and teachers who were desperate for information on how young people were treated, cyberbullying and how social networks were used in that regard.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the issue.  At 5 p.m. there will be a brief meeting in the AV room to discuss it.

The approach resulted in 12 of them returning to full-time education after they had left prison.  There has been no innovative change in how we deal with people who have been involved in crime once they enter prison.  We have provided for the same mechanisms that have changed very little in the past 20 years.

Wherever young offenders are held - I do not intend to cast aspersions on prison staff in St. Patrick's Institutions - there may have been a lack of training and people may not have known how to deal with young offenders.  Perhaps it is a knee-jerk reaction that the young people concerned got what they deserved because they may have inflicted pain on people on the outside. We must bear in mind that, by and large, prisoners are the most damaged in our society.  Very often they had no opportunities where they lived and did not receive a proper education.  If we inflict inhumane punishment on them, all we are doing is continuing a vicious cycle.  When prisoners return to their communities, it will simply be a question of their getting their own back on people all over again.  I am glad that the topic of prisons was raised in the Chamber because politicians have shied away from it because there are no votes to be gained.

I take the opportunity to bring this House into line with the D\u00e1il.  When a Senator tables a question to a Minister and he or she is dissatisfied with the answer, we should be able to appeal to the Cathaoirleach and have the question immediately asked again.  Such a measure would prove helpful to Senators.  The days of Ministers of State coming here to read a script handed to them should end because that was what happened during the term of office of the last Government.  Unfortunately, the same is happening during the term of this Government and it should quickly come to an end.<\/p><p>I have raised the following matter on a number of occasions.  In the last budget the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair\u00ed Quinn, made a bad decision about DEIS schools.  He subsequently reversed it, which was the correct move.  Because of a legacy issue, a number of schools that have met all of the DEIS programme requirements are still not considered to be in that category.  Not alone do they not benefit from DEIS school pupil-teacher ratios and other benefits, but they are also being forced to accept the same reductions as standard schools.  It means such schools have been abandoned twice, which is a mistake.  I call on the Minister to do what is required when it comes to the arithmetic for the budget.  Not many schools are involved, certainly not hundreds.  Unless we take steps now, we will have to commence regeneration schemes such as those undertaken in certain areas of Limerick.

I ask for an update on the development of a detention school at a site located at Oberstown-Lusk.  We need to ensure that when children are transferred, it is to a good location, as we do not repeat past mistakes.  I listened to the debate.

I agree that we should have a further debate on the issue which I will try to arrange.  As many Senators have stated, the leadership structures in the banking sector must be changed.  I am not aware if proposals on the issue of mortgage arrears have been submitted to the Central Bank.  However, as Senator Paul Coghlan mentioned, workable solutions are required.  There is no doubt that the banks need to cop themselves on and change their culture drastically in order to meet the needs of small businesses and individuals in mortgage arrears.  The Government will press them on the matter, as we need action sooner rather than later.<\/p><p>The vast majority of Members rightly raised the issue of St. Patrick's Institution.  The findings of the report on what happened in the institution are shocking.  The Inspector or Prisons, Mr. Justice Reilly, should be complimented on his report, as many Members said.  He visited the prisons at night and when he was not expected.  He acted above and beyond the call of duty in our interests and those of the public and should be complimented on his efforts.  He was critical of some prison staff in terms of their interaction with prisoners.  He also identified a culture of bullying that involved a minority of prison officers.<\/p> <p>He is also satisfied that a minority of other prison officers engage in bullying and intimidation of other prison officers and staff and refers to the potential to corrupt good prison officers.  These are damning findings.  I agree that a debate is needed on Judge Reilly's report on St. Patrick's Institution and the wider issue of prisons. <\/p><p>The Minister has acted quickly in this matter and new guidelines have already been introduced.  Another matter which cannot be brushed aside is the actions of senior officials in the Department of Justice and Equality and the attitudes they have shown towards the Ombudsman for Children and, as we have heard over the years, many other individuals.  This issue will have to be tackled and I am sure it is one on which the Minister will act.  I was pleased to note the Ombudsman for Children's comment that the current Minister is the first Minister for Justice to listen to what she had to say about senior officials in the Department.<\/p><p>The report addresses a serious issue and must be acted on.

Representatives of the Orange Order appeared before us when they were supposed to come.  Certain protocols are involved in such matters and the Seanad cannot issue invitations until we know the individuals in question are willing to come before us.  I will raise these matters again to reactivate the issue. <\/p><p>Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh asked that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources come before the House to discuss energy issues.  I will make the necessary arrangements.<\/p><p>Senator Clune asked that local authorities and the Office of Public Works liaise with the insurance industry on flooding and inform it of any improvements in this regard.  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, gave an undertaking that this would be done and I do not have any reason to believe otherwise. <\/p><p>Senator Mullins asked that the introduction of drug testing for drivers be expedited by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  I will inquire from the Minister as to the position in this regard.<\/p><p>Requests were made for a debate on mortgage arrears and banking.  We have had three debates on banking issues and, as Senator Walsh noted, we will also have a comprehensive debate on the Personal Insolvency Bill when it comes before the House.

The national substance misuse strategy steering group identified the following four key harms of alcohol.  First, 88 people died every month in 2008 from alcohol.  Second, in 2007 the total estimated cost of alcohol misuse to the health care and justice systems, the economy and from alcohol-related road accidents was \u20ac3.4 billion.  Third, alcohol is a contributory factor in half of all suicides, which means it was a contributory factor in the suicides of 245 people in 2010.  Fourth, the group noted that alcohol was consumed in four in every ten episodes of self-harm in Ireland in 2010 and was a factor in 4,764 episodes of deliberate self-harm in 2011.<\/p> <p>In addition, the 2011 Annual Report of the National Registry of Deliberate Self Harm Ireland declared the following: \"In line with previous years, misuse or abuse of alcohol is one of the factors associated with the higher rate of self-harm presentations on Sundays, Mondays and public holidays around the hours of midnight.\"<\/p><p>I am sure that these kinds of figures on deaths, self-harm and monetary costs register with every Member of this House and make us wonder about the reason we are letting alcohol do that and the reason our legal regime governing the direct and indirect sale of alcohol - in the form of advertising -  is a factor in all of this harm.  If those four harms were not enough there is another series of problems that alcohol is causing according to the National Substance Misuse Strategy Steering Group.  One in four deaths in young men was estimated to be due to alcohol; alcohol increases the risk of more than 60 medical conditions, including many cancers; it is associated with 2,000 beds being occupied every night in Irish acute hospitals; it is associated with a quarter of injuries presenting to emergency departments; it is estimated to be associated with 16% of child abuse cases; it has been reported that alcohol was a trigger in one third of domestic abuse cases in 2005; and it is associated with harms to infants as a result of mothers drinking during pregnancy, and a range of disorders known as foetal alcohol spectrum disorders are caused by mothers drinking alcohol in pregnancy.  This series of harm patterns for alcohol would therefore seem to represent an insurmountable wall of harm, as it were, for a huge number of Irish people.<\/p><p>We cannot deny that alcohol is associated with many aspects of our social and cultural life; that is self-evident.  It is part of our custom for sociability, relaxation and enjoyment.  The pub often plays an important role in community life and it is also an attraction for tourists.  The paradox of alcohol, however, is that its consumption for pleasure and hospitality, along with its economic benefits, is overshadowed by the harm and health problems it causes when it is misused or consumed in a harmful and hazardous way.<\/p><p>Worryingly, Irish adults binge drink more than any other European country; 25% of Irish adults have reported that they binge drink every week.  Irish children are also drinking from a younger age, and drinking more than ever before.  Over half of Irish 16 year old children have been drunk, and one in five is a weekly drinker according to studies that have been prepared.  Ultimately, 1.5 million Irish adults drink in a harmful pattern according to the steering group.  <\/p><p>Senators will be aware that there has been a proliferation of outlets and stores that sell alcohol, and not just in urban areas.  Supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations now sell alcohol.  I suggest it is not unreasonable to link elevated levels of alcohol consumption by the Irish population with this proliferation of availability.  We must do something about that because if we do not, we risk ignoring the body of evidence that is plain for all to see.<\/p><p>The normalisation of alcohol in Irish society has been achieved partly at least by the manner in which it is promoted through various media.  It is almost as if alcohol has become a basic everyday grocery product to be purchased with everyday consumables such as bread, milk and butter.  On the contrary, alcohol is no ordinary commodity, to borrow the title of the World Health Organisation-sponsored study by Babor and others some years ago.  It has major public health implications, and the State has a responsibility to preserve and protect public health and the general well-being of society.  Furthermore, alcohol is a psychoactive substance that can impair motor skills and judgment, and its effects on the individual can occur at various points across a spectrum.  It is a drug of dependence and can act as a gateway to the use of illicit drugs for some people.<\/p><p>It is imperative that we reduce the overall level of alcohol consumed in our society and tackle the problems of alcohol misuse.  As Senators are aware, the report of the National Substance Misuse Strategy Steering Group was published last February.  The steering group's objective was to set out an evidence-based framework which identifies effective policies and actions to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by alcohol use and misuse.<\/p><p>The report made a range of recommendations that focused on key issues in the area of the misuse of alcohol.  These issues include the supply, pricing, availability and marketing of alcohol along with preventive strategies including treatment, rehabilitation, alcohol and substance dependency research and information.<\/p><p>Some of the key recommendations within the report include the following - increase the price of alcohol so that it becomes less affordable; introduce a legislative basis for minimum pricing, along with a social responsibility levy on the drinks industry; commence section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, which deals with structural separation of alcohol from other products in supermarkets and other outlets; introduce legislation and statutory codes to provide for a 9 p.m. watershed for alcohol advertising on television and radio; there could not be that type of advertising prior to 9 p.m.; alcohol advertising in cinemas to be associated with films classified as being suitable for those over 18 only;  prohibition of all outdoor advertising of alcohol; all alcohol advertising in the print media to be subject to stringent codes, enshrined in legislation and independently monitored; phase out drinks industry sponsorship of sport and other large public events by 2016; develop a system to monitor the enforcement of the provisions of intoxicating liquor legislation; establish a clinical directorate to develop the clinical   and organisational governance framework in order to underpin treatment and rehabilitation services; and develop early intervention guidelines for alcohol and substance use across all relevant sectors of the health and social care system.  This will include a national screening and brief intervention protocol for early identification of problem alcohol use.<\/p><p>As stated earlier, the steering group noted that children are drinking sooner and drinking more than ever before.  The group was wholly cognisant of children when framing its recommendations, as Senators will see from the document.  These recommendations are generic and apply to all cohorts of the population, including children.<\/p><p>Members will see from the recommendations that there was a strong public health dimension to the steering group's work in dealing with alcohol misuse.  Our agenda now is to protect and improve the health of Irish people on foot of the recommendations that have been made.  The steering group's report was stark as to public health and protection given that it reported that potentially 1.5 million people in Ireland are drinking in a harmful way.<\/p><p>The burden of alcohol on our society and systems is overwhelming.  This is an evidence-based statement based on what the National Substance Misuse Strategy Steering Group found and reported.  These problems are patently obvious - the burden of hazards and pain that alcohol misuse causes; the trauma it is responsible for; the waste it provokes in the case of lost economic output, absenteeism and more; the adverse effects it has on families and children as a result of a family member misusing alcohol.  It has been estimated that adult alcohol problems are associated with 16% of child abuse and neglect cases, and alcohol has been found to be a trigger in one third of domestic abuse cases.<\/p><p>The steering group covered issues pertinent to children and families where it addressed the treatment and rehabilitation of people due to the misuse of alcohol.  These include addressing gaps in child and adolescent service provision, and developing multi-disciplinary child and adolescent teams, along with developing an approach to addressing the needs of children and families experiencing alcohol dependency problems.<\/p><p>The extent of alcohol misuse warrants strong and effective policies that can address this pervasive threat to Irish public health.  One such policy recommended by the steering group is a regime of minimum pricing.  Minimum pricing is ultimately a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels for alcohol products that must be legally observed by retailers.  The primary function of this measure is to reduce at risk levels of alcohol consumption, especially by those who drink in a harmful and hazardous way.<\/p> <p>It also would have a greater impact on discouraging children to drink.  In turn, this could then diminish the effect the misuse of alcohol and over-consumption would have on a range of social areas, including public services, crimes and public health, together of course with productivity in the economy.  One cannot be ambivalent when it comes to the pattern of alcohol consumption and the harms for which alcohol is responsible.  Ambivalence on alcohol is now inexcusable and the report of the steering group has made sure of that.  The national substance misuse strategy points the way for the future direction of policy to deal with the use and misuse of alcohol.  There are challenges with some of these recommendations and this is both clear and perhaps inevitable.  Nonetheless, my Department is preparing a concrete set of proposals on the basis of the national substance misuse strategy report to which I have alluded.  The intention is to submit these proposals to the Government for consideration and approval as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700009#H00900","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350471000,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him well in his new office.  This is not the first time Members of this House have had a debate on the misuse of alcohol.  In fact, such a debate has been held in virtually all the years I have been a Member.  Over those years, it was usually a knee-jerk reaction to some incident or report after which it seems to have been left at that.  I wonder whether any other Parliament in the world also is discussing the misuse of alcohol.  I doubt it and therefore there are two questions to be asked. Is it the case that they do not have misuse of alcohol or is it because we are more concerned here to try to do something about the effects of the misuse of alcohol?  At the outset, I compliment the Minister of State because this was an absolute breath of fresh air.  On previous occasions when Members debated the misuse of alcohol, the contributions made in this Chamber contained too many \"ifs\" and \"buts\".  Even though everyone on the street knew the truth, Members kept adding riders to their points for various reasons.  Perhaps they were looking over their shoulders at the drinks industry or perhaps they did so out of a fear they might offend people who simply have a social drink every day.  However, this report is an absolute wake-up call.  I will not reiterate the statistics, which are all readily available but it is not simply a matter of drinking to excess.  All the other issues that arise therefrom, including suicides, deaths and child abuse are connected.  Members are aware that whenever the issue of drugs has been discussed in this House in the past, they get very excited about it and rightly so.  They work on legislation and seek more severe action to ensure there will be a clampdown.  However, alcohol is every bit as much a drug and the statistics leave no doubt but there is widespread harm and damage being inflicted.<\/p><p>This morning, Members discussed the issue of St. Patrick's Institution on the Order of Business.  The point again was made, not simply about alcohol, that many of the young people concerned have been damaged by the misuse of alcohol.  For every issue of concern raised in this House, in some way there is a connection back to alcohol itself.  The sad thing is Members are in a position to control the alcohol issue much more easily than is the case with the illegal sale of drugs because an industry exists in respect of the former and it should be possible to interact with that industry.  I do not mean merely with a cosmetic exercise.  We do not even have a health warning in respect of alcohol in the same way as we do in respect of smoking.  There is a certain similarity in that when restrictions were introduced on smoking in public places, there was an outcry but it only lasted a short time.  This was because when the debate took place, it became quite evident that cigarette and tobacco smoking was injurious to health.  Once that message got across, people were prepared to accept highly restrictive measures in respect of smoking.  People do not question it any more and it now is the norm in their lives.  However, if one looks back a few years, it seemed like an immense hurdle to overcome at that time.<\/p><p>At present, drink is freely advertised on television and no matter what one might say, it is not done in a subtle manner.  I note that half of 16-year-olds have admitted to being drunk at some point, which is a frightening statistic.  However, if they are looking at television and the consumption of alcohol is associated with manliness, having a good time or whatever else in some way, the young mind undoubtedly will absorb a certain amount of that.  For instance, I always have been disappointed after games in which a team won a cup that the first thing done was to fill the cup with alcohol and to pass it around to young people.  Hopefully, in years to come when this is corrected, we will look back with horror on the fact we allowed this to happen with young people in local communities and that no one shouted, &quot;Stop&quot;.  Where does most of the action take place in the television programmes &quot;Fair City&quot; and &quot;Coronation Street&quot;?  In the pub.  It must be influencing the viewer when one sees famous actors and actresses on television and sees that drink is part of their lifestyle.  Moreover, this is going out as a message.  One can also look back to the time when the cigarette was in fashion.  When one was being trained in drama groups, the big difficulty one had as an actor was what to do with one's hands on the stage.  The prop that people generally were given was a cigarette.  Even if one looks back at the films of those days, with professional actors and actresses such as Humphrey Bogart or whoever else, one may observe how often a cigarette was used.  This is no longer the case and it gradually is being phased out.  There must be some way to do something similar.  I do not blame RTE, the BBC or anyone else as this is the culture that exists at present.  This is the reason I call this a breath of fresh air.  Members can promulgate this message strongly to the public in respect of the statistics they have not quantified but which they knew were there.  For instance, they could suggest to RTE, in respect of &quot;Fair City&quot;, that it would be wonderful for the station to take the first opportunity in that particular industry to ask whether it would be possible to phase out that type of glamorisation of drink.  This would be absolutely vital.<\/p><p>As I noted, Members have had this debate several times previously but each time I see antisocial behaviour on the streets, I do not get angry towards the young people concerned.  Instead, I feel absolutely sad and sorry for them because they never had the opportunity of developing in the way young people did years ago.  What is happening is that before they are even sufficiently responsible to know what drink is doing, they become absolutely immersed.  I acknowledge it may be peer pressure as well.  I note 16-year-olds are mentioned and refer to a survey conducted five or six years ago that children of 13 years of age were not necessarily becoming drunk but were imbibing hard spirits.  Therefore, is it any wonder that later on in life, they find themselves in difficulties and troubles?  Incidentally, Members should not be criticising the young people but should be criticising themselves, as they had the opportunity to legislate, to put pressure on the drinks industry and to ban advertising.  The big question in respect of this document, the statistics and the report of the steering group will be whether Members have the sense of responsibility to act on it.  If they do, it will be the greatest contribution they will have made, particularly to young people and to families in which there is abuse and in respect of depression and suicide because that is what this is all about.  It all is embraced within that and as far as that is concerned, I can only say, &quot;Well done&quot; to the Minister of State.  I hope Members stick by it and have the courage to follow it to a successful conclusion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700011#K00200","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1350471600,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I thank him for his comprehensive speech on the issue.  The Minister of State provided many figures but one interesting comparison was that in 1960 Irish people were consuming 5 litres of alcohol per adult on average.  I understand this has increased to 11.9 litres per adult per annum, a remarkable increase.  This equates to 482 pints of lager, 125 bottles of wine or 45 bottles of vodka per annum.  This is where we stand now.  During the past 20 years because of the economic progress we have made we have allowed this problem to develop without putting any restrictions in place or without examining the long-term policy in this area.  We have not considered the real net cost.  The Minister of State referred to this in his speech.  There is a frightening cost of more than &#8364;3 billion in real terms associated with health care, loss of time at work, car accidents and all the attendant issues.  We have allowed this to drift and now we must face this problem, deal with it and look to see what we can do.  We should consider where we want to see ourselves in 20 years time.<\/p><p>  I am not criticising anyone in particular but I was in Washington Street in Cork on Arthur's day at 10.30 p.m. and it was frightening.  I do not understand why people cannot go out for a night without this behaviour.  As I walked along one of the streets several people were getting physically sick in front of me.  They were on the street and leaning up against office doors.  They were mainly students who thought this was part of the norm because they were in college.  It is frightening that we have come into this culture.  It reached such an extent that I rang the Garda and asked whether the force would consider closing off Washington Street at 10.30 p.m. or 11 p.m. for health and safety reasons.  It is frightening that we have reached this stage.  I realise people had a good night but we should consider the effects such behaviour has on people's health.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State referred to the effects alcohol abuse can have on family life.  It is interesting to consider the figures.  According to the ESRI, alcohol is a factor in one third of physical abuse cases.  According to the Alcohol Forum in 2011 alcohol abuse was mentioned in 36% of cases as the reason for child protection.<\/p><p>  Earlier I referred to education and early school leaving.  I am involved in a project that is attempting to get 30 people back into the education system.  These people dropped out of school, in some cases when they were as young as 12 years of age.  We are trying to get them back in and we are trying to help them.  They dropped out at an early stage and ended up with literacy and numeracy problems.  It is an uphill battle to try to get the necessary support because they do not fit into the normal education system.  Many of them do not fit in because they started off with alcohol abuse and then proceeded to drug abuse.<\/p><p>  The Department of Health has not addressed the harmful impact of parental drinking, especially during pregnancy.  Recently, I spoke to a nurse about this issue.  She said that one can see the effects on a newborn baby as a direct result of foetal alcohol syndrome.  Symptoms may include distinctive facial features, slow physical growth, before and after birth, vision or hearing problems, poor co-ordination, delayed mental development, abnormal behaviour and heart defects.  These are some of the knock-on effects of a mother drinking while pregnant.  We have not done enough with regard to education in this area and we need to do more.<\/p><p>  Recently in the House I referred to the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin, where on average 40 babies are born who suffer from <i>delirium tremens<\/i> or cold turkey after being born.  Much of this is drug related but there are some cases related to excessive drinking.  It occurs because the supply is suddenly cut off once they are born and they suffer from <i>delirium tremens<\/i> immediately after being born.  There are 20 such cases per annum in the other two hospitals in Dublin.  These are the knock-on effects and we need to produce an education programme in this area as well.<\/p><p>  How do we move forward?  There have been several reports from the Joint Committee on Health and Children and the national substance misuse strategy steering group, which reported on 7 February 2012.  They have set out clear guidelines with regard to the road we should go down.  We need to take certain decisions.  They will not be popular.  An increase in price is one option and the introduction of minimum pricing is another.  We must take certain actions and we cannot put them on the long finger anymore.<\/p><p>  Let us consider the numbers of people in hospital as we speak.  Some 2,000 people are occupying beds in Irish hospitals as a direct result of excessive drinking over several years.  We need to ensure that the problems we have now are dealt and we must plan for the future and for 20 years time.  However, we must make the right decisions now.  The Minister of State may not be popular as a result of some of the decisions he must make but they will be in the best interests of the country.  This is about providing leadership.  Yesterday, we saw leadership with the announcement of the reform of local government.  That area was untouched for 100 years and in real terms this issue has not been touched for 100 years either.  Now is the time to do it.  The Minister of State has my full support with regard to the decisions he intends to make on this matter and I encourage him to arrive at them at an early date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700012#L00100","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1350471600,"counter":109,"content":"<p>Some 16 Senators have indicated that they wish to speak.

I have five specific questions to ask the Minister of State but first I wish to comment briefly on the issue.  I am speaking as a Senator, as a children's rights activist and as a proud Irish citizen.  My first concern relates to the social and cultural acceptability of our excessive alcohol usage.  It disturbs me how frequently and casually excessive drinking and being hungover are spoken about on the national airwaves, in the media and in discourse following sports events and other everyday conversations.  For example, we use such expressions as \"How's the head?\", \"I'm dying\" and \"It is the Irish \"flu\".  This is acceptable discourse for us.  We use these references and they are bandied about all the time.  I am not trying to sound in any way pious and it is not that I have not misused alcohol myself but it is about the way we use these terms in common parlance.  They are acceptable and tolerated.  This is where I have a difficulty.  We are sending mixed messages in our discourse on drinking.  On the one hand there are drink awareness campaigns, especially those targeting young people.  During the debate today I imagine we will refer to the scourge of binge drinking among young people and we will highlight the dangers of excessive drinking.  On the other hand as adults we laugh it off.  We are sending mixed messages.<\/p><p>Our international reputation as a nation of drinkers is seriously undesirable and is becoming increasingly so.<\/p> <p>It is something that we should be working hard to overcome.  While on holiday in the United States over the summer, I was shocked to see a T-shirt being sold in a tourist shop, among a number of T-shirts of a similar vein, depicting Irish yoga as a series of images of an extremely intoxicated man.  I have a fairly healthy sense of humour but I did not find it funny.  In fact, I was extremely embarrassed that this is the depiction, on several different types of T-shirt, of Ireland.  There was nothing positive about that message.<\/p><p>There is an intrinsic link between excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm in Ireland.  The negative impact, as has been testified to by the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, and by my colleagues before me, on individuals, on families and on the Exchequer and society at large can no longer be justified in terms of the revenue the alcohol sector generates in and for Ireland, or how our pub and craic culture attracts tourism.  I grew up with a definition of the idea of craic culture being about music, friendship and great fun, but we seem to have redefined what it means and this is something that we must seriously question.<\/p><p>Alcohol has been identified as a contributory factor in 97% of public order offences and, according to international research, there is a link between increased alcohol consumption and increased levels of public order crime.  Alcohol related crime will cost us \u20ac1.2 billion this year.  All of us here could make a long list of what we would like to spend that \u20ac1.2 billion on, and that figure relates only to crime and not the associated health costs.<\/p><p>I had the honour to write two European reports as a rapporteur for the European Economic and Social Committee on the harmful effects of alcohol.  Often the employers' organisations would row in on the side of the drinks industry but, luckily, I was able to persuade many of my colleagues from the employers' organisations to support me in my work.  The figures, for example, for increased absenteeism, show it costs Ireland \u20ac1.5 billion a year, according to a recent survey by IBEC, the very organisation that supports the drinks manufacturing industry of Ireland.  Employers need to wake up to the cost alcohol imposes.  Alcohol is the primary reason for 4% of short-term absences from work by male employees and 1% by female employees.  On the impact on health, every seven hours someone in Ireland dies from an alcohol-related disease and alcohol is a factor in up to one third of all deaths of unnatural causes.  The figures are quite startling.<\/p><p>The Minister of State mentioned the indirect effects on children.  Between 61,000 and 104,000 children aged under 15 in Ireland were estimated to be living with parents who misuse alcohol, one in 11 children is impacted negatively by parental alcohol problems and one in six cases of child abuse is attributed to alcohol.  We really must wake up.  I am glad the Minister of State said that he will bring back the proposals as soon as possible but there really is need for greater urgency.<\/p><p>I have the following five concluding points.  First, the Minister of State mentioned the national substance misuse strategy.  I draw his attention to the report on the misuse of alcohol and other drugs, which Senator Colm Burke mentioned, published in January last by the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  We came up with 13 recommendations.  They were debated heavily at the committee but the meeting was one of those good days in the Houses where all members were on the same side in trying to work out the best recommendations.  There is cross-party consensus on those recommendations and I would bring the report to the Minister of State's attention.<\/p><p>Second, there have been significant delays in the publication of both the alcohol action plan and the sale of alcohol Bill.  They were expected in September and before the end of 2012, respectively.  Can the Minister of State clarify when these will be published?<\/p><p>Third, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, was due to bring forward the recommendations of the RRAI voluntary code of conduct but he was also supposed to come back, prior to the summer recess, on section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, which the Minister of State mentioned and which deals with the structural separation of alcohol from other products.  The legislation is in place.  It is a bizarre piece of legislation because the Minister has a choice when it comes to implementing it.  I have never seen legislation that gives the Minister the choice.  I think the Minister of State will find this interesting.  I had to reread the legislation several times.  I raised it here in the House with the Minister for Justice and Equality under an Adjournment matter.  It is something that could be put into place now.  We all talk about alcohol products straying into other parts of the supermarket but there is legislation to which we can give effect.<\/p><p>Fourth, given the legal challenge against minimum pricing being put to the Scottish Government, can the Minister of State clarify what changes in alcohol pricing will be introduced in Ireland and if minimum pricing cannot be introduced, will consideration be given to introducing a ban on below-cost selling?<\/p><p>Finally, a significant amount of work has been undertaken in Northern Ireland on alcohol advertising and price promotion.  By the end of 2012, Northern Ireland will introduce additional regulations to ban certain irresponsible drink promotions that encourage excessive drinking and specified pricing practices.  Further restrictions have also been proposed in Northern Ireland and are included in Scotland's licensing law which are intended to prevent supermarkets and off-sale premises advertising school offers anywhere other than within a licensed area of their premises.  The restrictions would also apply to other advertising material, such as newspapers, in-store magazines and leaflets.  Will the Minister of State give consideration to introduce similar measures?  It is my understanding that the legislation currently exists in the form of section 16 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 and these changes could be brought forward fairly quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700012#L00300","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350472200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Well timed, with one second to spare.

I will start by welcoming that he put into the arena here the figure that will give the lie to information that is always being quoted by those who are not in favour of reform around alcohol consumption in Ireland, that is, that \u20ac3.4 billion is the economic alcohol-related cost to the economy.  When one says so, the argument is always that the Government raises more in taxes from selling alcohol than it costs the economy and there is somehow an implication that the Government is complicit in the promotion of alcohol as well.  Our relationship with alcohol consumption is difficult and I do not think anyone here will disagree with that.  Even though the aggregate amount of alcohol has been falling, and has fallen approximately 17% since 2001, drinking patterns have changed as well.<\/p><p>My chief concern relates to alcohol consumption and young people.  It is easy for someone of my age to say that young people drink too much.  Every generation laments and despairs for the generation coming immediately behind it.  It seems that the current generation has developed a different consumption pattern but for a middle-aged man like me to stand up and start finger wagging at young people requires me to put up some information that will corroborate what I am saying.<\/p><p>Some 44% of those who drink alcohol in Ireland consume more than five drinks at any one time, which is classified as binge drinking.  This dangerous intake level, especially among young people, is linked to severe long-term physical and psychological damage.  It is not only physically hazardous and socially damaging, but is also the cause of much personal distress.  We need to know that family, school and social obligations are social obligations are sometimes neglected and risk-taking behaviour increases as the decision-making process is diminished under the effects of alcohol.  We have seen that in some of the figures the Minister of State quoted for public order crime, in self-harm and in suicide, and we also know that one death in four among young men is attributable to alcohol misuse.  Those are the facts.  We could list out any number of statistics to make the point but the one point we know is that alcohol misuse generally is damaging, and particularly so among young people.<\/p><p>The patterns of behaviour that are laid down when we are young tend to stay with us for the rest of our days and it need be no surprise for us to hear that age is significant when we talk about when people start drinking.  The lifetime alcohol dependence rate for those who start drinking before the age of 14 is four times higher than that for those who do not start drinking until they are 20.<\/p><p>The challenge facing society is significant and needs to be approached in a strategic and multi-stranded manner.  We need to take steps to have immediate impact on drinking patterns but we also need to keep a close eye on those initiatives which will do something that will work in the long term.<\/p><p>There is no immediate magic bullet.  Minimum pricing has been shown to reduce alcohol consumption and sales, at least in other jurisdictions, and the abolition of alcohol advertising associated with sports events will make some difference, but we need to be conscious of the big-picture issues.  Although politically expedient and, therefore, attractive to us as policy makers, they will not, on their own, change our unhealthy relationship with alcohol.<\/p> <p>The report of the steering committee and its recommendations are very welcome but we must try to achieve a cultural change in our behaviour and this will not be done by finger wagging at young people.  It will only be done by hard work and by people taking personal responsibility for their own drinking habits.  We must stop normalising heavy drinking by using alcohol to celebrate, commiserate or commemorate at virtually every social occasion or event that comes our way.  One thing that is particularly insidious and perplexingly foolish is the way that we celebrated \"Arthur's Day\" recently.  It was a triumph of marketing over common sense, which enticed people to participate in a contrived celebration for the gullible.  The insidiousness of this was portrayed by its promoters saying that it was only a bit of craic or a bit of harmless fun and indeed, for many people, that is what it was.  However, the harmless fun was visible in the accident and emergency departments of our hospitals that night, to the garda\u00ed, who were called to the scene of multiple public order offences on the streets and to business and home owners who had to sweep away the detritus the following morning.  It was not harmless fun for a great number of people and the data provided earlier by the Minister of State concerning alcohol-related harm confirms that fact.  <\/p><p>The visits of both President Obama and the Queen of England were hosted around the marketing of alcohol.  We saw the President in a pub, holding up a pint and the Queen was brought to a well-known landmark in Dublin, closely associated with alcohol.  As Senator van Turnhout pointed out, our cultural identity and reputation is closely bound up with the promotion of alcohol.  We are confronted, of course, with a very powerful drinks industry in this country, which is forever dismissing those who raise concerns about the dangerous levels of drinking here as cranks or kill-joys.  Representatives of the drinks industry appeared before the Joint Committee on Health and Children recently and put forward a most reasonable and benign case for the industry, which presented drinking in Ireland as fairly harmless.  The representatives acknowledged that in a small number of cases, there were problems but argued that these problems primarily affected individuals and required interventions only at an individual level.  The argument was plausible at first sight and was presented in a slick and professional manner and could lead to a certain level of forbearance in this area.  There was no recognition at all by the drinks industry of the societal harm and the damage to the social fabric caused by heavy drinking.  Nor was there a recognition of the fact that one person's drinking has effects outside the orbit of that individual or of the cost to society in economic and social terms.  <\/p><p>We seem, as a society, to have lost our way in relation to drink but this is not a new phenomenon.  Social commentators from pre-Famine times were preoccupied with the heavy level of drinking here and described Ireland as a society in despair.  Of course, society cannot be the best judge of its own position on the historic continuum but I wonder, in the context of the consumption of 11.5 litres of alcohol per adult, whether at some time in the future today's society will be looked at as one that lost its way regarding alcohol and one that is in despair.  <\/p><p>Drinks industry representatives tell us that alcohol advertising is not aimed at increasing alcohol sales and that the main aim is to capture market share from rival brands.  However, I do not see advertisements with images of men sitting in a public park, slobbering over a bottle of wine.  That is not the way alcohol is portrayed.  It is portrayed as a product for cool young people in the company of other cool young people, having great fun and the message is very clear.  Alcohol advertising targets young people.<\/p><p>I am glad the Minister for State is continuing the work of his predecessor on alcohol and his address to the House today was very good.  I have worked in the mental health services for many years and have seen the harm that alcohol does.  It is one of the most significant challenges facing our society and one that the Government must prioritise, without being paternalistic.  An enormous level of personal responsibility is also required but the Government, and the Department of Health in particular, can devise the roadmap by which we can find our way in tackling the enormous challenge facing us.  I look forward to supporting the initiatives of the Minister of State and congratulate him on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700013#M00300","speaker":"1117","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350472800,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I will try to be brief as I know many Senators wish to speak on this issue.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House.<\/p><p>  There are certain dangers inherent in this debate and we must be careful in our use of data.  The Minister of State made reference to certain data but I drew the attention of the House to data last November which indicate that drink consumption is falling in Ireland, not rising.  Our three friends trying to balance the books, namely, the Minister of Finance, Deputy Noonan, Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, will confirm that to the Minister of State.  I am sensing an air of panic around this issue.  <\/p><p>  By international standards, drink consumption in Ireland is actually low.  It is lower than in several countries referred to here today.   According to the <i>The Economist<\/i> index, we are not in the top 22 countries for beer drinking, while for wine, we consume 41% of that consumed in Switzerland, but I do not recall the Swiss being pilloried for being drunk and falling about the place.  In terms of alcohol consumption as a whole, we consume 64% of the amount consumed in Germany, so there are quite prosperous and thriving countries which seem to cope with alcohol much better than we do.  <\/p><p>  The price of alcohol is not falling.  All consumer prices have fallen in Ireland but the belief that the country is drowning in a sea of cheap drink is not backed up by the CSO, which is in charge of measuring such transactions.  While there is evidence in Garda reports of drink-fuelled crime by adolescents, it is important to state that probably 99% of youngsters do not get involved in alcohol related crime.   <\/p><p>  The danger in what we are engaged in here is that some parts of the drinks industry will use it to increase their income through minimum pricing.  It is fantastic, really.  They are saying, &quot;I would like to sell my product for X but I will persuade the Minister of State and his colleagues to set a minimum price of 2X&quot;.  That happened before when, in 1903, a Liberal Party Government was convinced by publicans to limit the number of people who could sell alcohol on the basis that it would make the Irish more sober but all it did was make the publicans a lot richer.  All that has happened in recent times is that by around 2003, approximately 100 years later, young people began to buy their drink in places other than public houses.  The overall level of consumption is falling.  I do not believe that we can say, &quot;Person X was drunk but because he bought his alcohol in an expensive hotel or in a golf club bar, that is okay, so let's pick on the teenagers because they paid less for their drink.&quot; <\/p><p>  I welcome the fact that drink consumption is falling in Ireland.  If we need to intervene, it should be through increasing tax on alcohol and I am sure the three gentlemen I mentioned earlier would be delighted with that.  We should not introduce minimum pricing.  If we do that, we enrich the industry and that is not something with which I want to be associated.  I wonder whether the publicising of a view of Ireland as a drunken country, when the figures internationally do not support that, is part of a campaign by some parts of the drinks industry, who do not like losing market share to others, to get the Department of Health to intervene on their behalf.  That is the kind of contest in which one should not get involved.  <\/p><p>  We must check the data.  If the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform need the money, then let us increase the tax on alcohol in the budget.  I urge the Minister of State to beware of some parts of the industry campaigning against other parts on the basis that those other parts are, in some mysterious way, serving seriously cheap drink that causes riots in the streets.  If they were allowed, they would only serve expensive drink and keep the money themselves, enjoying an increase in profits brought about by a Government intervention which never started out with the intention of enriching the drinks trade.  I do not share that objective either.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700014#N00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1350472800,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and wish him well in his post.<\/p><p>We know about the serious problem of alcohol abuse in this country.  Approximately 60% of alcohol sales are off-trade now, and gone are the days when people drank in a controlled environment, that is, the pub.  If one entered a pub having had too much to drink, one was not served.  If one had too much to drink in a pub, one was asked to leave.  Generally speaking publicans, and I am one myself, run very good houses.  The problem now with alcohol abuse is the availability and the price.<\/p> <p> Alcohol is available in too many places, including supermarkets, small shops and petrol stations.  I do not know, however, if we can change this.  Every week, particularly on Sunday, advertisements in the newspapers promote cheap alcohol.  We all know that a bottle of beer is cheaper than a bottle of water.  In January the Joint Committee on Health and Children was shown pictures of selection boxes sitting on top of slabs of beer in a certain supermarket.  I recall a campaign which promoted cheap alcohol for First Holy Communion celebrations.  Some young people purchase alcohol in the local supermarket and get tanked up at home before going to the pub.  This often leads to anti-social behaviour and, in some cases, publicans are wrongly blamed.  The joint committee spent several months investigating this issue and our report has been submitted to the Minister of State.  I ask him to ensure it is not allowed to gather dust on the shelf, which is the fate of too many reports.<\/p><p>I have spoken previously about educating young people about the harmful effects of alcohol.  The north-west alcohol forum runs a very good education programme in counties Sligo, Donegal and Leitrim.  I would love to see this programme being expanded throughout the country.  Earlier this week I heard an individual who lives in Denmark speak on radio.  He stated that even though alcohol was more widely available and cheaper in Denmark, it did not give rise to the problems experienced in Ireland.  We need to educate our young people while they are in national school.<\/p><p>I have spoken on many occasions about minimum prices.  The reality is that such policies will not work.  Scotland has run into difficulties with European competition law in trying to implement a policy on minimum pricing and had to delay its plans by up to three years.  We are in the same position.  <\/p><p>The code of practice is not adhered to and section 9 of the legislation should have been implemented a long time ago.  Alcohol should be stored in a segregated area with a separate cash register manned by a mature person.  Senators have argued that small shops cannot afford to implement such changes, but when the smoking ban was introduced, publicans made the case that it would be too expensive to provide a proper smoking area.  That was a health issue and this is the same.<\/p><p>We recently discussed the gathering with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  He wants pubs to get involved.  Pubs provide good food and are places where visitors can hear traditional music.  However, our trade has almost died.  Senators may think I am biased, but I feel strongly about the issue of alcohol abuse.  I hope the Minister of State will deal with the issue urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700014#N00300","speaker":"1152","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350473400,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I wish the Minister of State luck in his responsibility for primary care services.

I like a glass of wine, but I take personal responsibility for my behaviour because otherwise I would not be able to come into work or could feel depressed.  There is something radically wrong in the Irish character if people let themselves go to hell by overindulging.<\/p><p>In 2008 I wrote a policy paper on what we could do in dealing with the issue of suicide.  I identified three ways by which it was possible to reduce the suicide rate.  One suggestion was cutting alcohol consumption, which had been internationally proved to be a factor in reducing suicide rates.  The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 was debated in this House while the Minister of State was still a Senator.  Has that Act been implemented?  We fail to implement many of the laws we introduce.  My policy paper recommended that the Garda vigorously use the powers granted under the 2008 Act to carry out test purchases of alcohol by under-age youths in off-licence premises.

My own generation and the one before us were more likely to drink and drive in a way that young people of today would not dream about.<\/p> <p>We must have some perspective on this.<\/p><p>That said, I do not disagree with Senator Barrett with regard to the cost of alcohol.  I remember when I started university, \u00a31 would get a person two and a half pints or 50 cigarettes.  At the time, I would get \u00a32.50 for a night's baby-sitting.  Therefore, it is not necessarily true to say that drink has become as cheap as chips.  The fact is that nowadays our children have a lot more money than we had when we were growing up.  We need to accept this calmly.  The reality for our children is that they can buy and consume alcohol at pocket money prices.  We must deal with this.  Consider, for example, the cost of the average weekly risk free consumption limit for a woman or a man, \u20ac7 for a woman and \u20ac10 for a man.  Price, therefore, is a problem, whether we consider the individual price of what is being purchased or whether wider issues in society do not simply relate to the price of alcohol.<\/p><p>As Labour Party spokesperson for children and youth affairs, it is important for me to reiterate the cost to society, and to young people in particular, due to the use of alcohol.  Apart from the psychological impact, depression in particular - which is almost a national epidemic - there is neuro-scientific evidence of long-term damage to children and their health, in particular with regard to brain chemistry and to establishing addictive patterns at a young age.  This is an issue we need to take seriously.<\/p><p>I would like to address a particular issue to which Senator Henry alluded, namely, the issue of product placement.  From a very young age, children are sitting in shopping trolleys surrounded by milk, juice, water and wine.  I understand what Senator Henry said, but in my local supermarket, which used confine alcohol to a side aisle, alcohol is now part of the mainstream area in the middle of the store.  Therefore, I believe the only way we can get around this is to limit the availability of alcohol.

People talk about the weather, they talk about football and they talk about how much they had to drink at the weekend or the night before.  We are currently campaigning for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote in the referendum on the rights of children, but we have a duty of care to children who cry themselves to sleep at night.  We have a duty of care to women who are used as punchbags by drunks and we have a duty of care to men who consider ending their lives following alcohol abuse.  It is important we continue to consider the issues along these lines.<\/p><p>I do not agree that drink has not got any cheaper.  It has.  One can now buy a bottle of beer for the price of a bar of chocolate.  I know as a non-drinker that if one buys a pint of beer in pubs, it is cheaper than buying a mineral.  What does this say to young people going out to pubs or night clubs?  It says that it is cheaper to drink beer than to drink a mineral.  Therefore, we are not doing anything to discourage our young people from drinking.  We must look at this.  People are drinking a lot more at home and we cannot blame them.  The drink driving laws and the price of drink in pubs mean it is easier for people to drink at home.  Therefore, it is natural for people to buy alcohol in supermarkets and local shops. <\/p><p>We must keep a watch on the price of alcohol, because we are making it very easy for people to drink.  Perhaps I should not mention it, but one can buy a whole slab of 25 large cans for \u20ac25.  This is exceptionally cheap.  One day when I went into the supermarket I saw a man with a trolley full to the top with alcohol and wondered whether it was for his own consumption or whether he was buying it cheap to sell it in a pub.

Previous speakers have made many of the points I wished to make so I will go straight to a point that has not been made which I would like everybody here to consider seriously.<\/p><p>We have all become very exacting consumers.  We like to know what we are going to eat and value our health above anything else in this world.  Thus the food industry has become very transparent and food labelling has become an onerous task for food manufacturers.  I am a manufacturer and I welcome this, because my product is a natural one.  However, I am amazed that in 2012, no food labelling is required for whiskey, cider, beer or wine.  EU regulations do not force our alcohol producers to label their products. <\/p><p>I would like to read some items of interest.  EU regulations allow for more than 50 different flavourings, additives, preservatives and agents to be added to wine.  Only sulphites, which are used as preservatives and have a possible causal link to asthma, must be listed on wine labels.  I cannot pronounce the names of half the additives and flavourings, etc., allowed - which sound terrifying - but I believe that if I read them out, the Minister of State will never touch wine again.<\/p><p>Isinglass is something that comes from the bladder of a fish.  Others include copper sulphate, diammonium phosphate, thiamine hydrochloride, lysozyme, dimethyl dicarbonate, bentonite and potassium ferrocyanide.  I did not make this up.  Why are we not asking the drinks industry to put labels on wine.  I bet that one of us in here is coeliac.  There are 12,000 coeliacs in Ireland.  God help those who are coeliacs, because people who are coeliac cannot drink beer, lager, stout or ale, because they all contain various amounts of gluten.  However, if one is obese or overweight, one can have cider, wine, sherry, spirits, port and liqueurs.  How many calories are in a bottle of wine?  I do not have a clue and I am sure the Minister of State does not know either. <\/p><p>Deputy Martin made a profound statement with regard to stopping us smoking.  Please let us be the first country in Europe to put labelling on alcohol.  This might add something to the costs for suppliers, but it will certainly provide a much better choice to consumers, because some very unhealthy additives are being added to many products.<\/p> <p>I apologise for being so unprofessional and standing up again, but I would like to make a quick final point that is of relevance in the run-up to the children's referendum.  We know the children's allowance is going to be changed.  I implore the Minister, Deputy Burton, to turn the children's allowance into food and clothes stamps.  Some children's allowance moneys are being spent as if they were alcohol stamps.  We all know that is happening.  I ask the Minister of State to write that one down.  It is an easy win.  We need to make sure our children's money is being spent on food and clothes for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700016#P01100","speaker":"1169","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350474600,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I would like to make two points.  I have made them before.  I welcome the Minister of State's speech.  I was interested in a point he made about the \"proliferation of outlets and stores that sell alcohol\".  We know that, as he said, \"supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations now sell alcohol\".  I agree with him entirely that \"it is not unreasonable to link elevated levels of alcohol consumption by the Irish population\" with this phenomenon.<\/p><p>I would like the Minister of State to examine something I have encountered on a number of occasions in Cork.  I know it is happening around the country.  When local communities, with the support of local garda\u00ed, object to the provision of an off-licence, their objection might be upheld at local District Court level, but that decision is usually overturned at a higher court or by An Bord Plean\u00e1la.  I agree with what has been said about examining the number of outlets.  This issue was raised time and again during the years I spent as a member of a local authority.  Many reports called for a reduction in the number of outlets.  However, we are powerless to do that when the planning process gets under way.  We need to consider this matter.  I have direct experience of three operations.  I take this issue very seriously.  Over the summer, local garda\u00ed went to court to object to a new outlet on the basis of the number of existing outlets in the local area and the level of anti-social behaviour they have to deal with, for example, by arresting minors for over-consumption of alcohol.  If the garda\u00ed who are dealing with this issue on the ground do not want an additional outlet in an area, we should take that seriously and help them with the job they are doing.  It is fine to make provision in this area, but it needs to be translated into planning laws.<\/p><p>The National Off-Licence Association has proposed the mandatory training of all those who sell alcohol in off-licences.  We know that publicans and those working with them are trained well in judging how much alcohol to sell and serve.  I am sure many off-licences have a similar approach.  It is important for those working in off-licences, including younger members of staff and those from other jurisdictions who might not be familiar with the impact of the sale of large volumes of alcohol, to have the confidence to ask for ID when dealing with young people.  There are many factors to be considered.  The National Off-Licence Association has made an important recommendation.  I urge the Government to examine this simple idea and to take it up.  Such a move would be welcomed by the association.  It would go a long way to reduce irresponsible behaviour.  If one sees persons of 18 or 20 years of age trying to buy a large volume of alcohol, one should ask what they are planning to do with it.  I suggest that in many cases, they are intending to sell it on to under age drinkers.  These two practical suggestions will go a long way in helping the Minister of State to do the job he has to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700017#Q00200","speaker":"1114"},{"type":"speech","time":1350474600,"counter":139,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I look forward to working with him in the years to come.  I have a particular interest in health issues.  I do not think the Government's thinking, as set out in its strategy, goes far enough.  It is time for a little radicalism in its approach.  Like most people in this Chamber, I am speaking with the internal conflict of someone who culturally grandfathered himself into the drinking culture of which he is a member.  We would all like to think things could be done differently.<\/p><p>I remind Senators that alcohol is an addictive, cancer-causing toxin.  That is what it is.  I ask them to imagine what would happen if everyone in Ireland stopped drinking alcohol completely tomorrow.  It would be a better place.  We would have a colossal decrease in the prevalence of cancer of the head, neck, oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, breast, colorectum and the liver.  Chronic liver disease would become rather uncommon.  Obesity and diabetes, and all the complications associated with them, would decline dramatically.  We would have a colossal decrease in violent crime, domestic violence, violence against women and rape.  We would have a colossal decrease in road traffic accidents and some decrease in traffic deaths.  We would have a major decrease in the use of our accident and emergency departments.  We would have a major shortening of the waiting lists for our health facilities.  There would be a decrease in absenteeism at work.<\/p><p>Another side of this issue that is not often commented on is the opportunity cost of alcohol consumption.  The opportunity cost to society of alcohol consumption is colossal.  The money spent by families on alcohol could be spent on food, clothes and education for their children.  If the amount of time parents spend drinking were spent parenting, it would have a beneficial impact on educational outcomes and on many of the indices of social decay in our society.  There is a colossal opportunity cost for our health service.  If we were spending less money on alcohol-related ill-health, we would not have to discuss whether we can afford expensive cancer drugs and expensive drugs for multiple sclerosis.<\/p><p>Several of my colleagues have seemed to suggest that we are somehow in a healthy place in the international alcohol consumption league table.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700017#Q00300","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1350474600,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Ridiculous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700017#Q00400","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1350474600,"counter":141,"content":"<p>I must correct Senator Barrett, who is normally very numerate and statistically astute.  He is incorrect in this regard.  The reality is that Ireland is placed approximately third in the global league table for the documented consumption of raw alcohol, as measured in terms of litres consumed per head of population.  The figures referred to by Senator Barrett related to litres of alcoholic drink.  In that league table, a litre of beer, which might be 4% alcohol, would count the same as a litre of whiskey.  That is the problem we have there.<\/p><p>The reality is that Ireland's consumption of pure alcohol, per head of population, increased from approximately three or four litres in the 1960s to approximately 17 or 18 litres at the height of the Celtic tiger before dropping slightly to approximately 14 litres in recent years due to recessionary pressures and, perhaps, some issues relating to health consciousness.  If one tries to convince the few citizens who are aware of what is discussed in this Chamber that we are somehow in a healthy place in the international alcohol league table, or if one tries to make that point outside this Chamber, one will be incorrect.<\/p><p>I would like to make it clear, with deference to my colleagues, that publicans are not social workers.  It has been suggested in this House and at the Joint Committee on Health and Children that alcohol is somehow healthier when it is supervised and administered by friendly apron-wearing publicans who care for one when one enters the premises, who make sure one does not over-consume and who see one safely home.  That is not the case.  I am sure there are individual publicans who are deeply dug into their communities and are highly responsible people.  The alcohol industry collectively exists for the sole purpose of selling alcohol.  The governmental public health process is diametrically opposed to the entire apparatus of the alcohol industry, from the friendly local publican to the member of the board of a major international drinks conglomerate.  We are adversaries.  We are trying to do different things.  They want more people to drink more alcohol.  We want fewer people to drink less alcohol.  This is the exact reality.  We should not engage with them other than to rein them in and discipline them.  It is insane to see them as partners in a process of reducing alcohol consumption.<\/p><p>A comparison can be made with the new codes of practice that are developing around the issue of tobacco.  There is a worldwide movement to have no contact between politicians and those representing the tobacco industry.  The same thing should happen in the case of the alcohol industry.  We should be trying to rein in its activities.  We should set our noses into the wind as we strive to accomplish our goal of decreasing this country's alcohol consumption dramatically - perhaps to a level one half, one quarter or one third of what it is now.  On the way to that nirvana, we should set a goal of having zero advertising of alcohol.  I remind the House again that it is an addictive, cancer-causing toxin.  Who should be allowed to advertise the sale of an addictive, cancer-causing toxin?  I suggest that this prohibition should extend beyond the classic paid or for-profit advertising that is administered by the advertising sector.  We should have no more pictures of Taoisigh, Presidents or Ministers using wine, beer or other types of alcohol as the centrepiece of their welcome to dignitaries who are visiting Ireland.  It is no longer appropriate.  I am sure they can be socially photographed with a glass of wine in front of them if they are at a dinner.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister of State well.  He has taken on a tough job in a big tough macro-health-economic situation.  I believe we can afford to make changes in this area.  We cannot afford not to make them.<\/p> <p>I would say to him to be bold, brave and revolutionary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700017#Q00500","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Business of Seanad","time":1350475200,"counter":143,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700018#R00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1350475200,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I have a note from the Leader's office that we would adjourn at 1.45 p.m and resume the debate at a time suitable to the Minister of State.

Many of my colleagues have made reference to the national substance misuse strategy report and I will not go through all of that again.  However, one cannot read it without being shocked and horrified at some of the statistics it contains.  In particular, I wish to refer to the statistics relating to young people, whereby more than half of 16 year olds have been drunk and one in five drink weekly.  As a mother of a 16 year old and as a former teacher, having had four children go through leaving certificate and also having gone to collect them after junior certificate teenage discos, I have been absolutely horrified to see students, who I would know as being fantastic and well behaved in class, out of it from the effects of drink at 16 years of age.  It is horrific and would be horrific to their parents if they knew it was going on.<\/p><p>I have been a teetotaller all my life.  Very often, having spoken afterwards to students in class, they would ask me &quot;Oh, but do you not drink?&quot;, as if there was something radically wrong with a person if they do not drink.  Even at 18, they can be remorseful for drinking and for having started to drink at 16.<\/p><p>This is an area where we need to be more forceful.  We have alcohol strategies in schools and alcohol projects and so on.  Perhaps we could go one step further and highlight the ill health that is associated with alcohol.  Another suggestion I would throw out is to perhaps raise the legal age for drinking from 18 to 21, when people are more adult and can make better decisions for themselves.  Perhaps that would do something and I would certainly be in favour of it.<\/p><p>We need to be more forceful in highlighting just how much a young person's life can be adversely affected by alcohol.  What the World Health Organization considers to be risky or binge drinking is taking 75 g of alcohol on a single drinking occasion, at least once a month, which is four pints of beer, seven pub measures of spirits or a bottle of wine.  I know there are many young people who would be shocked to hear they are being classed as binge drinkers every time they go out, or even stay in.<\/p><p>The teenage years are considered to be a time when lifestyle patterns are established.  Starting to drink at an early age increases the person's chance of developing problems with alcohol use in later life.  This is again where I would like to call into question Senator Barrett's statistics.  According to the European school project on alcohol and drugs, Irish children report being drunk more often than those in most other European countries - some 26% in the last month in Ireland in comparison to a European average of 18%.<\/p><p>The question of targeting the marketing of alcohol is another huge area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700018#R00900","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1350475200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>I must ask the Senator to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700018#R01000","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1350475200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Excuse me, will the Minister of State reply today or in the next session?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700018#R01100","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1350475200,"counter":152,"content":"<p>The Minister of State will respond to the contributions that have been made today in the time allotted to him, rather than in a closing statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700018#R01200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1350475200,"counter":153,"content":"<p>The Minister of State will come in again and he will reply again on the day we resume this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700018#R01300","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1350475200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>Thank you.

Children and young people are bombarded with positive images of alcohol through marketing of the product, as was referred to earlier.  In effect, the alcohol industry is the child\u2019s primary educator on alcohol.  A recent report by a leading youth organisation in Ireland revealed that young people were highly aware of alcohol marketing and had noticed marketing on television, in magazines, on the Internet and in on-street flyers.  Senator Leyden referred to television, and \"Coronation Street\" and even Irish soaps such as \"Fair City\" suggest everything takes place in the pub - I sometimes think they drink, eat and sleep in the pub.<\/p><p>To say that children and young people are not influenced by alcohol marketing is equivalent to saying that they suddenly wake up and begin to see and hear on their 18th birthday.  They are constantly absorbing information and are the primary users of new media.  In Ireland, there is no statutory regulation of alcohol marketing, just a voluntary code, and this code does not include the marketing of alcohol through digital media.<\/p><p>Besides advertising, children are target-marketed through sponsorship of sporting and music events, promotions and offers of alcohol brand-related merchandise and product placement in popular entertainment.  Perhaps this would be a good place to start.  There has already been plenty of reaction from the drinks industry to the calls from the national substance misuse strategy report for an extensive range of prohibitions and restrictions on the advertising of alcohol products.<\/p><p>I highly commend the recommendations within the report and I fully support the Minister of State in his work in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700018#R01700","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1350475200,"counter":158,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I was a member of the sub-group of the Joint Committee on Health that put together the report which the former Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, worked on with the joint committee.  One of the things that struck me about the work not just of the sub-committee but of the committee itself, which signed off on the report, was that there was cross-party support for initiatives which we all want to see the Government take.  Across most of the areas, with the exception of minimum pricing but including the areas of advertising, the presentation of alcohol and in terms of the hierarchy of wanting to ensure that prevention, intervention and education are the No. 1 priority, this cross-party support was important, although, of course, the other issues are also important.<\/p><p>One of the areas where there was not cross-party support and where my party was not in a position to give consent in terms of the document was in regard to minimum pricing because we do not believe it will work.  If pricing is to be used as an instrument to reduce consumption, we need to look at what is the best way to do that.  I believe the best way is to increase taxes and excise duty on alcohol, where the money raised comes back to the Exchequer and any extra revenue is ring-fenced for the prevention, intervention and education options which we all want to see happen.  While I would want the Minister of State to tease out whether the Government is considering how to make this work in practice, if this was to be the case, we would simply enrich the profits of the people who sell the alcohol, whereas the intention behind the initiative is to prevent and reduce consumption.  I have a very real concern about minimum pricing, although we maintain the whole area of below-cost selling should be dealt with.<\/p><p>What was very interesting was that part of the committee's work was to have all of the so-called players, including the drinks industry, come before the committee.  Like Senator Crown, the phrase &quot;lies, damned lies and statistics&quot; comes to mind, as conflicting reports came from different people who represent different sectors of the industry.  The reality is that the people who produce and sell alcohol had a very real vested interest in making sure that alcohol consumption was not reduced, and we have to be very clear about and conscious of that.<\/p> <p>Our responsibility is to protect people's health and well-being and reduce consumption.  The drinks industry should not be partners in the process.  We must be clear about that.  We have to take decisions based on reduction.  The advertising of alcohol should be banned completely.  The distribution of flyers by some of the leading multiples advertising cheap alcohol must end.  It is wrong also to allow flyers advertising ringing one\u2019s local off-licence to get alcohol delivered to one\u2019s door.  We must be adult and mature in what we do.  I agree with a watershed of 9 p.m. for radio and television advertising.  We are not seeking to ban alcohol.  Some might see that as an option but I do not.<\/p><p>No reference was made to advertising in the Minister of State\u2019s speech but much reference was made in the committee to social media and the fact that Diageo, for example, and some of the big alcohol companies use Facebook and social media to target young people.  It is a difficult area given that social media are global but we must be conscious that when we look at the advertising of alcohol it is not sufficient to focus on the traditional methods of advertising such as radio, television and the print media as social media now exist, which are hugely important and much more difficult to regulate.  One of the recommendations made by the joint committee was that we would also examine the regulation of social media.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, the best of luck in his efforts to reduce the abuse of alcohol.  I hope he is bold and radical but at the same time sensible and pragmatic about what is possible.  We would all like to arrive at the utopia outlined by Senator Crown, but we must do it in stages.  We must be bold in the initial steps we take on the basis of the reports before the Minister of State currently that were commissioned by the previous Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700018#R01800","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350475800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I wish to share my time with Senator Healy Eames, four minutes and one minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700019#S00200","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1350475800,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Alastair Campbell spoke at it.  The conference was an eyeopener for many who attended.  The statistic that alcohol is involved in half of all suicides is shocking.  When one hears it first it can easily pass one by as a statistic but if one were to replace it with practically any other substance then one could be guaranteed that we would make a greater effort to curb its use and influence on society.  It seems that there is an endemic acceptance of alcohol and its effect on the way we behave in this country.<\/p><p>I welcome the work of the steering group and the recommendations.  Its report is a roadmap for future policy direction on the use and misuse of alcohol.  I agree with Senator Crown that we must take a radical, holistic approach to the issue.  Alcohol encompasses many strands of society and education is fundamental.  The point was made that young people do not drink and drive now, which is fantastic, but it has come about through education and cultural change.  The issue must be tackled from the top down and the bottom up - from every angle - in order that we realise how unusual our relationship with alcohol is in this country.  The key recommendations of the group have been discussed and are worthy of debate but I do not propose to go into them as other speakers have dealt extensively with them.  Any measure, such as minimum pricing, that could help to reduce the overall consumption of alcohol is to be welcomed.<\/p><p>The commencement of section 9, in addition to further advertising restrictions, is vital and must be enacted in parallel with minimum pricing legislation.  I disagree with Senator Mary White's proclamations about Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s great success in this area.  I accept a code of conduct was put in place but it called for certain measures to be introduced \u201cas far as possible\u201d but they are not being introduced and the code is not being adhered to or policed.  Section 9 was never enacted.  The previous Government was lobbied heavily by the big supermarkets, which is why the section was not enacted.  Let us call it as it is.  I hope we as a Government will have the strength and courage to stand up to such lobbying and to implement the provisions of the legislation.<\/p><p>Pubs are a fundamental part of Irish culture and, but for the excesses, it would be a perfectly acceptable culture.  We must come up with creative ways to get people into pubs who do not want to drink.  I do not want to drink all the time when I am in a pub.  I rarely do so.  I asked for peppermint tea recently in a pub and the look I got suggested I had not ten but 20 heads.  We must come up with creative ways across the board to deal with alcohol.  Publicans and those who are trying to survive in a market concerned with the sale of alcohol must come up with creative ways to deal with the problems.  I had a million other things to say but, unfortunately, the time is short.

That is very welcome.  I also welcome the work done by the steering group, in particular the work done by the former Minister of State, Deputy Shortall.<\/p><p>In his summary the Minister of State said that ambivalence is now inexcusable.  I agree with that.  Reference was made to the prospect of increasing the price of alcohol and perhaps reducing advertising.  They are the two big picture issues.  A brand of vodka is now spending millions on advertising.  It is making it look really attractive.  It has beautiful colouring and what looks like balloons on the bottles.  It looks like something one wants to have.  I do not even drink vodka but I cannot help but be struck by the beauty of the advertising.  I do not know what the proposals are on smoking but it is clear that branding and packaging considerations must also apply to alcohol because there is a big advertising campaign afoot, as was the case with alcopops, the sweetened alcoholic drink.  That is one area to which I wish to draw the Minister of State\u2019s attention.<\/p><p>The Minister of State is aware that young people now engage in a habit known as pre-drinking.  That is what happens when we start to lower or increase the age for the consumption of alcohol.  One drives them indoors.  They buy cheaper and cheaper alcohol.  It is gut-rot stuff.<\/p> <p>They are having four or five very stiff drinks before they even leave the house because drink is so expensive.  I appreciate the dilemma we and the Minister of State are in as we try to work out which bit to correct.  If we correct one bit, we will upset another.  People bring cheap drink to weddings and other social occasions in their bags because they cannot afford to buy it at the bar.  They drink it from under the table.  I appreciate the pricing mechanism issue is not that simple, as one cannot just raise prices because there is a knock-on effect further down the line.<\/p><p>I draw the Minister of State's attention to the fact that when the Seanad Public Consultation Committee met in June, one of the many speakers was Dr. Trina McCarthy of the National Cancer Control Programme.  She mentioned specifically that 1,200 cases of cancer diagnosed each year were caused by alcohol and that 25% of all alcohol-related deaths were due to alcohol-associated cancers, a very high figure.<\/p><p>Representatives of the North West Alcohol Forum also spoke at the committee.   Mr. Eamon O'Kane is the man in charge of the forum which is trying hard to bring about the change in society about which several Senators spoke.  Senator Catherine Noone mentioned the problem of drink driving.  We have obviously done some good in persuading young people to become more interested in how their parents behave.  They can be very good at telling their parents to stop smoking.  We have done a lot in tackling the problem of smoking, although we have not won the battle.  However, we really need to look at how we can address the issue among much younger children.  Can we be brave and admit we must start this conversation much earlier?  Clearly, 15 and 16 year olds are drinking.  I know of others aged 12 and 13 years and if we do not engage with them until much later in the debate, the damage will have been done and the patterns set at a much younger age.<\/p><p>The North West Alcohol Forum is holding a major conference on the issue in November and specifically seeking to find ways by which it can engage with local leaders in voluntary and community groups, the Garda, the HSE, psychology services, public representatives and so on.  There must be something to be said for that model which is different from banning or taxing in that it deals with the much wider challenge we face.  As every speaker has noted, this is about Irish society which has always had a warped relationship with alcohol.  Part of our responsibility is to try to change this by raising the issues to do with alcohol with children at an earlier age.  That is a brave thing to say because it will be said we cannot talk to children about drink.  However, if we do not talk to them about it, they will talk to each other.  They know which drinks to mix, which plastic bag will hold alcohol without breaking and how to smuggle it into discos.  They know what they are doing and are leaving us to one side because we are not part of the conversation with them.  I urge the Minister of State to find a way to start such a conversation, perhaps in tandem with the Minister for Education and Skills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700019#S01400","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350476400,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Senator Michael Mullins has only two minutes.

There are a number of points the Minister of State may need to keep in mind when he submits the report.  We must start to educate young people at a much earlier age, perhaps in primary school, on the harm caused by alcohol.  I am old enough to remember the time when the primary schoolteacher really hammered into us the dangers of abusing alcohol.<\/p><p>There is the issue of the availability of cheap drink.  The Minister of State should be brave and tax alcohol heavily.  There is an opportunity for the Government to raise revenue and help in reducing consumption.  The easy availability of alcohol was mentioned by many speakers.  It should be difficult to purchase it in every large supermarket and off-licence premises.

It was very interesting to listen to the various views expressed and insights given by every speaker.  The great value of a debate such as this lies in the numbers who come to listen and respond to others, which is always important in a debate.<\/p><p>The issue is not as clear-cut as we would like it to be, as serving politicians, as we observe the problem.  I speak not only as a public representative but also as a parent who can see on a weekly, if not daily, basis what is happening in the country and the suburbs I know best.  There has definitely been a change in the pattern of drinking, in how and where people drink and how often they do so.  I agree with those who say we should rely to a large extent on evidence in what we do as politicians, but particularly as a Government.  We should look to see what the evidence is for the policy proposals we intend to bring forward because there is always a risk in a debate such as this that we can be drawn along not only by anecdotal evidence but also by the evidence of what we see and feel.  We observe terrible things happening as a consequence of the use and misuse of alcohol, but we should only bring forward a proposal if we think it will have an impact.  Sometimes that may be difficult for us to accept.  <\/p><p>I have been considering this issue for a few weeks.  Senator John Crown in a very striking intervention in the debate gave a list of the consequences if no alcohol was consumed in the country.  He was being realistic, as he always is, and not carrying his point through to advocate a ban on alcohol.  None of us believes that would be possible to achieve and many of us think it might not necessarily be desirable to have a ban on alcohol.  There are many examples where it was banned, not only here but also elsewhere and there can be unintended consequences of such a policy approach.  I do not make this point as an excuse for not doing as much we should.  We should do the maximum we can achieve in this round of policy making, but we should also be realistic.  We should be able to defend the policy proposals we bring forward and point to their likely impact.  Neither do I believe we should see the set of proposals we will introduce and implement as being the end of the road but as an important part of what we want to achieve.  It is not necessarily the first step.  In fairness, this is not the first Government to address the issue.  It is true that there were inadequacies in some of the policy responses in the past, something that was shown as much by experience as much as anything else.  That may have been the case because of certain influences and vested interests in bringing to bear their viewpoints.  On occasion, in some cases, their power was inordinate.  We must contend with this fact.  However, let us not see this set of proposals as the end of the road but as the next step, one which I hope will prove very robust in addressing the misuse and abuse of alcohol.<\/p> <p>I thank all of the Senators for their comments which were full of insight and experience.  We had a very good debate.  <\/p><p>One or two things have occurred to me following comments made by various colleagues.  Senator Gilroy, and his sentiments have been echoed by others, talked about us looking to ourselves.  He suggested that we should not take this as an opportunity to engage in finger wagging at young people and Senator Hayden made the same point.  His comments are true.  Every one of us must look at our own behaviour and conduct.  Some people do not drink which is admirable but people make that choice for their own reasons.  Most of us consume alcohol.  Many of us are parents and we are concerned about what the next generation is doing.  As Senator Gilroy has said, let us examine the pattern of our own behaviour and ask those questions to give us perspective but do not use it as an excuse for inaction.   <\/p><p>Various Senators referred to the report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I have seen it but I have not had an opportunity to read it in great depth.  I will consider it as part of deliberations that will take place in the coming weeks.  <\/p><p>Other colleagues asked about proposals but I cannot indicate exactly when they will be brought forward.  I see it in terms of weeks, not months.  I hope that it will be a short period of weeks.<\/p><p>I know that we are tight for time so I cannot respond to each contribution individually.  I shall make an attempt to do so on the next occasion that I close the debate.  <\/p><p>Senator Barrett made a point about patterns and changes in alcohol consumption.  Senator Crown, in his response, was right about the trajectory of the consumption pattern in the past few years.  He correctly pointed out that there was a huge increase in consumption.  Senator Colm Burke stated some figures which were right.  Recently there has been a small decrease for the precise reasons outlined by Senator Crown but that is not the end of the story.  So what?  The number has decreased a little but the issue still needs to be addressed.  Even if it is not a question about the quantity of alcohol being consumed there is definitely an issue when it comes to the pattern, location, type and in what circumstances people drink.<\/p><p>A Senator made the point that it is hard to predict the impact and effects of concentrated alcohol products and there is a lot of education needed.  Senator O'Keeffe touched on the need for responsibility when it comes to the marketing and packaging of such products.  She wondered if people knew what they are buying and drinking.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett, as the good and insightful economist he is, asked for us to be careful not to make policy decisions that will favour a particular economic unit and interest in society.  It is inevitable that some areas of society or interests will be favoured by a policy change but one does not make a policy change to favour them.<\/p><p>Let us take the point made by Senator Henry and others that wherever drink is found it is still harmful.  A compelling argument was made for people to drink in a controlled environment.  Without sounding overly nannyish, a case can be made for a controlled environment that allows people to gather together at a particular time.  I hope that they look after one another afterwards and have an interest in how and where they are going and how they get home.  There is a case to be made for policy instruments that favour that approach to drinking rather than the chaos that is often associated with drinking, particularly by young people.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700020#T00900","speaker":"1024","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350477000,"counter":183,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has one minute remaining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700021#U00200","speaker":"1132"},{"type":"speech","time":1350477000,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I agree with the point made by Senator Mary Ann O'Brien that there is a complete absence of labelling on alcohol products.

There are three parts to the amendment, the first of which provides for regular reporting between the Ombudsman and Oireachtas, with the relevant committee being the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.  It is envisaged that the joint committee will be a formal channel of consultation and collaboration between the Oireachtas and Ombudsman for receiving and debating her annual reports and special reports to ensure her criticisms, observations and recommendations are acted on speedily.  It is also envisaged that the committee may propose possible topics for the Ombudsman to examine in future, consistent with her statutory remit.<\/p><p>The second part of the amendment provides for the retention, in amendment form, of the power to make a ministerial order to make a public entity, including a reviewable agency, exempt in whole or in part.  It provides a new power to make, by ministerial order, an exempt public entity reviewable and, where a public entity is reviewable in part, the power to amend those elements of the entity that are reviewable.  A positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas approving the draft orders will be required for the order to be made.

On the suggestion that recommendations of the Ombudsman should have statutory effect and should be binding, that is something the Department has discussed with the Ombudsman and it is her view that they should not be.  There is an excellent record of compliance with the Ombudsman's recommendations.  I understand that since the Ombudsman's office was established, refusals by public bodies to implement recommendations have been a very rare exception.  A decision of a public body to reject a recommendation has happened only twice, believe it or not, since the Ombudsman's office was established and those refusals are reported to the Oireachtas in the annual report.<\/p><p>The reasoning behind the view I have taken and the view that is supported by the Ombudsman is that currently public bodies engage with the Ombudsman's office in an open and transparent way.  If her recommendations had legal impact immediately the view is that they would be much more defensive in the way they deal with her office and would be much more likely to resort to litigation in defence of a position.

She had grave concerns about some of the issues relating to those agencies that have come to light over the years but she does not want this Bill delayed in the future.  She wants it to be enacted as quickly as possible and she believes that if she were to push for those agencies to be included at this stage it might delay it further.  My understanding is that she will try to take what she can get at this stage and go back to the drawing board on those other issues.  She was very clear, however, that she wants to keep that on the agenda and that she wants them included.  That is important.  I believe the Minister would like to have those agencies included also.  I know from statements he has made previously that he would wish to have them included.<\/p><p>A week is a long time in politics and that was outlined this morning with the publication of the report on St. Patrick's Institution.

It should not be exempted from this legislation, as is envisaged in this section.  Members must review that amendment, as this Bill would be totally flawed, were such an exemption to be included.  It would be blatant hypocrisy for such agencies to be left out and were Government Senators to vote to have them excluded, having jumped up and down this morning while expressing their concern about this issue in the Prison Service.

I again call on the Minister to re-address this issue.  I believe the Minister wants to have these institutions included and that the Department of Justice and Equality has been applying pressure to keep them off the list and to have them exempted.  What do these institutions have to hide?  If they have nothing to hide, they should have no fears about being on the list.  This was quite obvious from the comments of the Ombudsman when she spoke to the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions last Wednesday.  She stated she is not investigating anyone but is looking at whether investigations have been completed properly and is reviewing all the information that has been put forward to make sure that everyone has had a fair crack of the whip and that it has been done properly.  Consequently, I again call on the Minister.  I believe he is on the same wavelength as me but his hands might have been tied.  While I believe the pressure has come from the Department of Justice and Equality, he must stand up to it and do the right thing on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700024#X00700","speaker":"1122"},{"type":"speech","time":1350478800,"counter":225,"content":"<p>As is my normal style, I will address the issue directly.  First, the Senator puts the position of the Ombudsman very fairly.  We have had dialogue and in our discussions and communications, she would prefer to have every public body under her remit.  This is groundbreaking legislation and the Ombudsman is very supportive of it and wants it to be enacted.  It encompasses a huge swathe of new authorities and agencies that would come within her remit.  It will be highly demanding for her and for her staff and as the Senator is aware, rationalisations are also being made in respect of back-office support in the Office of the Ombudsman by agreement with her.  This is important legislation that goes a long way.  Consequently, the net issue is whether the Prison Service should be part of the Ombudsman's remit.  We debated that issue fairly last week.  I would need to hear a compelling reason to exclude anyone from it and for that reason, my Department has been in dialogue with the Department of Justice and Equality, as well as every other line Departments in respect of each agency that either has been brought in or excluded and I note there are very few exclusions.  On the last occasion, I explained the reason the Prison Service and the prisons are excluded and I will do so again briefly.  However, I also wish to mention the report because I am as shocked as I believe was everyone else regarding the report on St. Patrick's Institution.  It is quite shocking but is a testament to the effectiveness of the prisons inspectorate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700024#X00800","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1350478800,"counter":226,"content":"<p>He is a good man.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700024#X00900","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1350478800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>Judge Reilly is a superb inspector.  His perseverance ensured that this report was made and that these shocking wrongdoings were brought into the public light of day.  As I explained, the Minister for Justice and Equality intends having a much more robust inspectorate system.  As I also listened to \"Morning Ireland\" with shock this morning, I rang him immediately to discuss this particular matter.  As the Senator is aware, the Minister has extended the remit of the Ombudsman for Children to include St. Patrick's Institution in respect of children.  That is one of the steps he took last July.  Consequently, in respect of children, the Ombudsman for Children is capable of and does review St Patrick's Institution.<\/p><p>The logical question then is why the prisons in general would not come under the remit of the State Ombudsman and it is a fair question to ask.  As I explained on the last occasion, the Minister for Justice and Equality has asked that he be allowed to put in place a robust complaints system by way of statute and he is working on that legislation, which will be brought before this House before too long.  Not only will it require detailed reports but I note some of the visiting committee reports have been suppressed in the past and never saw the light of day.  This no longer will be allowable under the new legislation, nor will it be possible to bury the full reports of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention.  The Minister intends that such reports will be brought to the Houses of the Oireachtas at the latest three months after they are submitted to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Obviously, they must go to the Government and so on before that but at a maximum, three months after their submission.  That will be a robust mechanism.<\/p><p>No one would deny the current prisons inspectorate, that is, Judge Michael Reilly, is anything but an excellent Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention.  However, as I indicated on the last occasion, notwithstanding having a robust complaints mechanism, if it is felt that it ultimately proves to be insufficiently robust, I have stated it would be a matter for the joint committee of which Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh is a member to make recommendations.  Notwithstanding this mechanism, it can bring in and examine the Prison Service and if the aforementioned joint committee makes recommendations to that effect, I would be very minded to accept any such recommendations.  This is what I am saying to the Senator now.<\/p><p>As for doing this immediately, one job I have is to avoid duplication.  For example, a state of affairs in which someone like Judge Reilly is investigating a complaint, calling in the prison staff and demanding the paperwork and access to the data, while at the same time, the Ombudsman is conducting an inquiry into the very same matter, gathering the same documentation, interviewing the same people, is a duplication and a potential clash.  Consequently, we must bed down an effective system first and then ascertain whether another layer must be added on top of that.  However, my honest belief is that the system that is envisaged, as I understand it from the Minister for Justice and Equality, will prove to be highly robust.  I hope the Senator will accept my bona fides in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700024#X01000","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1350478800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister's bona fides and that he is doing his utmost on this issue.

Consequently, even if this system has been set up under the Department of Justice and Equality, my point is the independent viewpoint of the likes of the Ombudsman is needed as the last bastion of transparency and to ensure that people get their rights.  It is important to note the report stated:<ul><br \/>In a significant number of cases, having made a complaint, prisoners then signed a form stating that they did not wish to proceed further with the complaint.

If that has occurred in St. Patrick's Institution, can we be certain that is not happening in other institutions?  I am arguing vehemently because I agree that the creation of an independent prisons complaints service would be a good and positive move to deal with day-to-day issues, as the Minister noted last week.  However, there may be cases in which people are not happy with the redress they receive through that service.  This is the type of role the Ombudsman plays in our broader society.  I do not understand how it could be a duplication because the Ombudsman would only review the process gone through by the service.  It would represent another stop-gap to ensure transparency and fair play and to ensure everyone gets their rights.  I hold strong views on this issue.  If the Ombudsman were given the choice, she would have these agencies included in the legislation and it is remiss of us not to include them at this stage.  I have referred to the prisons but it applies to direct provision scenarios as well.  I have said it before but I will say it again, a State scandal is happening on our watch and we must do something about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700024#X01900","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350479400,"counter":238,"content":"<p>The Senator is obviously passionate but he is undermining his own case.  He is quoting from the inspector's report which highlights the things he claims are being suppressed.

It will be strengthened and it will be put on a structured, statutory basis with timelines such that nothing can be suppressed.<\/p><p>We have a different Minister for Justice and Equality now who has acted by empowering the Ombudsman for Children in respect of St. Patrick's Institution.  The Minister has promised reforming legislation in both the areas to which Senator \u00d3 Clochartaigh has referred.  I call on him to take on his role as a member of the oversight committee, examine the legislation, including the immigration and naturalisation Bill and the prisons oversight Bill when they come before the Houses.  Ultimately if that legislation is not robust enough we will address the matter again.  I am not keen on a situation in which by popular acceptance, the office of the inspector of prisons could investigate complaints when there is another body empowered to do the same business.  The Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na Ombudsman Commission and the Ombudsman do not carry out the same job.  We do not have two people carrying out the same set of investigations at the same time.  That is the logic of the argument put to me and it is compelling.  We should let the office of the inspector of prisons which is manifestly effective, do the job, rearmed and reinvigorated by more forceful legislation.

If we put this in place now these people would have access to a redress system to which they do not have access at the moment.  Their voices are not being heard.  The Irish Refugee Council report claims there may be situations of child abuse occurring on our watch.  I would prefer to err on the side of caution and at least include this form of redress such that the people in that situation have a voice.  The Prison Service is one thing but the refugee and naturalisation service is altogether different.  We do not know how long the legislation will take.  It is years behind the expected enactment and I do not see it on the books for us to discuss in the near future.  I am afraid that it will get kicked to touch for another year or so.

The view put forward was that there have been only two occasions, since the inception of the Ombudsman, where its recommendations were not implemented and that the office would have much more passive co-operation if there was not a statutory requirement to implement its recommendations.  There is, of course, a huge moral suasion to implement recommendations and that is underscored by the fact that it was done in all but two cases.  One of those cases was the notorious one we talked about where the last Administration determined not to do it.

It also requires public bodies to publish certain core documents simultaneously in Irish and English, including annual reports, financial statements and statements of strategy.  The Office of the Ombudsman and the Office of the Information Commissioner have jointly prepared a scheme under section 11 of the Act relating to their commitments to provide additional Irish language services.  I do not know whether the Senator has had an opportunity to peruse the scheme.  In these circumstances, the imposition of a specific statutory requirement under this Bill in respect of competency in the Irish language could have the unintended consequence of restricting the ability of the Office of the Ombudsman to ensure it is resourced sufficiently to effectively discharge its important functions.  We must disaggregate the two issues, s\u00e9 sin staid agus meas ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus muintir na h\u00c9ireann i gcoitinne at\u00e1 in ann an teanga Gaeilge a \u00fas\u00e1id and at the same time ensure we do not place impositions on the Ombudsman that would restrict her in carrying out her duties effectively.

One of the main issues identified in the reports of An Coimisin\u00e9ir Teanga for several years is the failure of agencies and State bodies to fulfil their responsibilities under the Official Languages Act.  The opt-out clause used most often is the one which concerns insufficient staff or capacity to comply with the Act.  My amendment would close that loophole in the case of the Office of the Ombudsman.  The Minister will be aware that when certain parts of the scheme developed by Ard-Mh\u00fasaem na h\u00c9ireann were not in compliance with the Act, it offered the excuse that it did not have sufficient staff.  In times of economic restraint this is becoming a common mantra for various agencies and Departments.  They would love to do it and travel to the Gaeltacht when they can, but, unfortunately, they do not have the staff required when it comes to the Irish language.  However, the State has a responsibility in this matter.  I referred to another case involving the Department of Social Protection.  Apparently, that Department does not need to observe the Official Languages Act when recruiting because the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has issued guidelines which differ from those relating to the Act.  This undermines the Act and I am sure An Coimisin\u00e9ir Teanga has brought the matter to the Minister's attention.<\/p><p>President Michael D. Higgins was visionary in ensuring the Act would apply to most of our cultural institutions.  The predisposition of the Ombudsman to provide a good service as Gaeilge is important because the basic aim of the Act is to cover publications, letter headings, signage and similar matters.  It does not govern staffing matters, however, unless they are specifically referred to in schemes.  The Ombudsman's scheme is out of date, but I understand that is because the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has yet to ratify the new scheme.  I, therefodre, ask the Minister to reconsider his opposition to the amendment.

I do not know whether the 110 people have achieved that much by getting themselves exempt if the decision of the court was that they were not exempt under the three grounds stipulated in the Bill.

The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority was not exempt in 2008.  We have had a lot of problems with the accounts of Irish banks since then and I do not know how they became exempt between 2008 and now.  There are some peculiar things in the Bill.  I am against the idea of exemption schedules in general and the way it &quot;growed&quot; like Topsy since 2008.  I shared the Minister's objective of extending the powers of the Ombudsman then.

I do not think this is the end of it either because we are creating two new clauses in the legislation - first, automaticity for new bodies that are created which is innovative and, second, the oversight committee will now have the power to make recommendations for exclusions now or on any further extensions in the future.     <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700030#DD02400","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1350482100,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I cannot leave that last contribution made by the Minister unanswered.

It is the second Bill that we brought in.  The fiscal responsibility Bill was brought in about this time last year, and I gather it has been to the D\u00e1il and comes back to us fairly soon.  It was important when all of us were elected in the spring of last year to take measures to assist in rectifying the public finances and to assist in the reform of banking, and that is what we seek to do.<\/p><p>  This Bill is a piece of macro-prudential legislation and will be part of a suite of reforms to make the financial system more stable.  We came across it in endorsements of what happens in Denmark.  I had not heard about it until recently, although one of us might have raised it here in the House.<\/p><p>  The IMF report on the Danish financial sector assessment programme dated March 2007 states:<ul>The Danish mortgage system is among the most sophisticated housing finance markets in the world and presents some unique characteristics.  The combination of a tight regulatory framework with developed specialized, &quot;in-house&quot; expertise in lending and credit assessment, and in wholesale funding and risk management has translated into a highly rated system (and institutions), able to deliver a variety of mortgage products at close to capital market conditions. ...<br \/>... Through the implementation of a strict balance principle, the system has proved very effective in providing borrowers with flexible, transparent and close-to-capital markets funding conditions.  Simultaneously, as pass-through securities, mortgage bonds transfer market risk from the issuing mortgage bank to bond investors.<\/ul>The key to it are these mortgage credit institutions of which the IMF speaks so highly in the Danish situation.  The bonds that these institutions issue are preferred, particularly in our circumstances, either to the bank shares or to the sovereign.  Of course, that is because the rescue of banks four years ago tied the Irish sovereign to the finances of the banks.<\/p><p>  These finances here appear to be available in Denmark, at between 2% and 3%.  That is a substantial advantage over what the Government would have to borrow on open markets and it is substantially better than the difficulties which Irish banks experience.<\/p><p>  I am informed that there are low defaults because of the loan-to-value restrictions.  On this kind of borrowing, the loan is maximised at 80% loan to value.  At that loan-to-value rate, the default is 2% internationally and only 1% in Denmark.<\/p><p>  This appears to be attractive to the borrowers.  It appears to work well in Denmark.  It is commended internationally, with warm endorsements by the IMF, the Bank for International Settlements and the European Union.<\/p><p>  It would be a good time to start now because interest rates are low.  Some of those who investigated this previously, with whom we caught up after we tabled the Bill, stated that people may have been caught in the past when interest rates were high and then declined but if we were going to start it, this would be an extremely good time to do so.<\/p><p>  We need, as we state in our memorandum, to stimulate the economy.  Senators, and, I am sure, Deputies in the other House, have spoken about the difficulties of the mortgage market.  I note in <i>The Irish Times<\/i> today that Ms Fiona Muldoon, the Central Bank's head of banking regulation, stated the Central Bank has strongly criticised banks for their slow progress in tackling the mortgage crisis.  The Secretary General of the Department of Finance, Mr. John Moran, expressed similar sentiments.  Yesterday the <i>The Irish Times<\/i> also reported that Dr. Joachim Faber, chairman of the supervisory board of the Deutsche B\u00f6rse, stated that it was almost untenable that five years into the financial crisis there was still no clarity on banking reform, and the industry itself was completely passive and this was unacceptable.<\/p> <p>This House, however, is not completely passive and we have already worked on the Fiscal Responsibility Bill, which will return to the Seanad shortly.  The House has addressed the crises in the public finances and in banking.  The Central Bank and the Department of Finance indicated only yesterday that there is a need for a Bill such as the one we propose today.  It is important that people cannot say the Seanad is standing idly by or, indeed, that both Houses are doing so.  We are not; we are bringing an innovative system from another country and pointing to its success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700032#GG00600","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350483900,"counter":389,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700033#HH00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1350483900,"counter":390,"content":"<p>We are also pointing out the advantages the proposed measures would have in terms of reviving the housing market and divorcing house purchase from financial speculation.  These became far too entangled in Ireland, which got us into the situation we are now trying to rectify.  The Danish system, referred to as <i>nykredit<\/i>, dates back to 1797 and is very robust due to extensive regulation that spreads outside the mortgage credit market to the wider banking sector.  Bubbles are not a feature of the mortgage market under this system and, indeed, that was the original purpose.<\/p><p>  Strict loan-to-value ratios are an important feature of our Bill and it is a pity we did not have them here through most of the last decade.  Such ratios ensure much lower rates of default.  There are variations in the ratios used, with an 80% loan-to-value ratio for residences and a 70% ratio for agricultural holdings.  Social housing and other types of property could also be included, which makes it possible to use the future flow of rents from local authority housing - or, indeed, any other public building that has an income flow - as security for loans.  This has worked well in Denmark.  Danish bonds are desirable and are rated typically either triple A or triple A plus.  This low-risk profile is due to that country's strict loan-to-value requirements and the low default rate, to which I referred earlier.  <\/p><p>  We must find a way to separate the cycles of causation, with the Irish banking sector infecting the sovereign and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  Under this proposed system, the market would be of the view that, pending a solution to our public finance problems, there is a better chance that an Irish person will repay his or her mortgage than there is of us fixing our public finances or of the banks sorting themselves out.  Therefore, it would be to the advantage of the person seeking to become a home owner to have this system in place and to be divorced from what is happening in banking and the public finances.<\/p><p>  This structure is not part of the opaque securitisation process that became infamous with the US sub-prime mortgage crisis.  It is therefore not attached to a waterfall payment profile with various tranches of payment and risk profiles.  These bonds are transparent and easy to rate and analyse for risk, which makes them very safe and of low yield.  In fact, I suggested to a colleague earlier that if there was a fear that this could lead to a repeat of the US sub-prime situation, we might invite the Danes to do it first, given their experience going back over several centuries.  In order for the system to work, we would have to improve the registration of title, deeds and valuations system, which is actually being done now as part of the process of introducing a property tax.  We must also do away with letters of comfort, falsification of documents and so forth.<\/p><p>  This system may have been studied in the past, according to some former officials, now in academia, whom I spoke to after this Bill was published.  There are papers somewhere in the realms of Government that I did not know about in which this system was considered.  Those papers would be well worth examining to determine whether we can make the breakthrough here.  The bankruptcy procedures might be made slightly more complicated with these proposed mortgages but that can be handled.  <\/p><p>  The Central Bank would have a major role to play as the licensing authority.  The system encompasses checks and balances that obviously were not in place in the past and would be part of a wider programme of reform of financial institutions, directed at transforming the Irish financial system and putting in place a macro-prudential system of finance, as advocated by the Central Bank.  The Danish system has been endorsed by the IMF, the Bank for International Settlements and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and is part of the Basel III banking reforms.  Many economic commentators have argued that the system is desirable due to its stability.  The legislation as written is also compliant with Directive 2006\/48\/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 14 June 2006, relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions, as published on page 1 of the <i>Official Journal of the European Union<\/i>, L177.<\/p><p>  In the <i>Financial Times<\/i> of 16 October, Martin Wolf wrote:<ul>It is no secret why growth is slowing in high-income countries; this is due to fiscal tightening, weak financial systems and powerful uncertainty.  This toxic combination is particularly threatening inside the eurozone...<\/ul>We are trying to deal with those problems here and I hope this Bill will assist the Government in that endeavour.

I first learned about Denmark in the 1950s in the context of their folk schools.  Their system of education and of involving people in traditional folk schools is wonderful.  My father became involved in that and I found it very interesting, way back then.  In the 1970s I went to Denmark because it was the first country with a supermarket that put barcodes on its products.  Denmark has led the way in many areas but I was unaware of the <i>nykredit<\/i> system until Senator Barrett brought it to our attention.<\/p><p>  The crisis has set off a search for the best possible mortgage financing system and many economists have praised the Danish model, which I had not heard about until now.  It has been in operation since 1797 and since then, not a single Danish mortgage institution has defaulted, gone bust or had to be bailed out.  As Senator Barrett explains in this Bill, the Danish system features specialised mortgage lenders that observe strict loan-to-value limits, along with a system of matched funding in which each mortgage is financed by a specific bond with the same maturity and cashflow characteristics.  Unlike Ireland, losses in Danish mortgage banks have remained low during the crisis and there has been plenty of liquidity in those institutions.  Indeed, it is a very secure system, and Danish mortgage bonds differ in essence from the widely distributed mortgage-backed securities, MBS.  The regulations for Danish mortgage bonds are laid down by law, which means they continue to constitute on-balance financing and are therefore more similar to savings deposits with a general bank than to an MBS, which constitutes off-balance financing.  The issuing body continues to carry the risk if a home owner is no longer able to fulfil his or her obligations.  With an MBS, on the other hand, the risk rests solely with the investor.  <\/p><p>  We need to break the linkages between the State and the banks.  As the Bill points out, Ireland is unattractive to foreigners but access to credit for mortgages is determined by the ability of our existing pillar banks to obtain credit on the international capital markets.  The bank guarantee further undermined this situation.<\/p> <p>Danish mortgage lenders compete on their ability to distribute and service loans.  This specialised competition has helped to drive down costs for the consumer.  The Danish system also protects borrowers from interest rate risks by offering long-term fixed rate mortgages.  Such a system would greatly benefit consumers in Ireland, compared to the floating rate mortgages which expose borrowers to risks of payment shocks when interest rates rise.  Regulations in Denmark limit the amount that can be loaned to homeowners to no more than 80% of the value of a home.  We fell into that trap to a great extent in Ireland.  Policymakers should be concentrating on this issue.<\/p><p> Several years ago I was invited by then Senator Maurice Hayes to have lunch with George Soros, the billionaire financier and philanthropist, who certainly educated me on these matters.  He established a joint venture in Mexico based on this model and argued that a similar system should be adopted in the United States.  He has stated in regard to the Danish model: <font color=\"#333333\">&#8220;If you need systemic change ... you may as well go for something that is vastly superior.&quot;<\/font><\/p><p> We cannot speak about mortgages in a vacuum.  There are lessons to be taken from the way Iceland dealt with the crisis and is now recovering strongly.  I do not suggest, however, that we should have moved in that direction, given that we do not have our own currency.  We must look at mortgages, but we must also push harder than ever for a debt write-off.  The IMF is coming round to the idea that Iceland did the right thing by burning bondholders and that recession is made worse when there is no restructuring of household debt.  It has stated: &#8220;Key to Iceland&#8217;s recovery was ... [a] program ... [which] sought to ensure that the restructuring of the banks would not require Icelandic taxpayers to shoulder excessive private sector losses&#8221;.  <\/p><p> Overall, this is a positive proposal to tackle a fundamental part of the banking system.  If people start to default on their mortgages on an even larger scale, they are also likely to have trouble paying off their credit cards and the resulting credit crunch is going to be even greater.  The major lesson we must learn from the recent past is that leverage by banks in property is usually lethal.  This system would help to prevent that happening.  While there are some drawbacks, the system offers many benefits, including low and competitive prices of loans against mortgages on real property; transparency in prices and repayment terms for loans; market based pricing; availability for all owners of real property; and a system that supports overall financial stability.   There is much to be said for these alternatives and we should look around to see who else can offer advice.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding the selective views of ratings agencies, there is strong market demand for Danish mortgage bonds.  Nykredit, Europe&#8217;s biggest issuer of covered bonds backed by mortgages, has seen its international investor base grow to almost 20%, compared to 13% just one year ago.  The bonds are seen as a safe haven which offers investors no credit risk and plenty of liquidity.  We also want to be regarded as a safe haven.  Perhaps the Danish model might help us in this respect.  Realkredit Danmark, the mortgage lending unit of Danske Bank, terminated its contract with Moody&#8217;s after it had issued a credit warning because it argued that the agency did not understand Denmark&#8217;s mortgage market.  Perhaps our own banks would do well to sever their links with some of the ratings agencies.<\/p><p> The economist, Professor Joseph Stiglitz, describes Danish mortgage bonds as a good innovation which helps to improve risk management and lower transaction costs.  However, the financial system has resisted many beneficial financial innovations which improve the efficiency of economies.  We should move to a model in which people lose their homes only as a last resort.  Although Denmark is still in the middle of a slump in its real estate market, foreclosures account for just 0.2% of the total housing stock.  The economic and financial crisis has only affected 1% of mortgage holders in Denmark.  Any homeowner in Ireland would see the benefits of such a system.  During the worst months of the financial crisis and the subsequent eurozone crisis, it was business as usual in the Danish mortgage bond market.  This model would not solve all of our problems, nor is it the only solution, but it is worth considering.  I urge the Minister not to reject the Bill before it receives the attention it deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700033#HH00600","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350484500,"counter":395,"content":"<p>Senator Sean D.

However, I am conflicted about his proposal because, while it is a great idea that has worked in a jurisdiction which is not alien to ours, I am concerned that the Irish psyche is different from that of people in Germany or Denmark.  The housing sector in Ireland needs something to make it operational again.<\/p><p>I have repeatedly pointed out that the number unemployed in Ireland is not 440,000 but 300,000.  These 300,000 people were working 36 months ago.  The remaining 140,000 who were not working at the peak of the boom are still not working and I do not believe they want to work.  Every single one of the 300,000 who were working three years ago want to work.  An enormous proportion of these individuals worked in the construction sector.  It was easy for young men to leave school early, get a shovel and earn large wages.  Six weeks ago I noticed a full page newspaper advertisement for Savills which was selling 1,000 apartments in seven developments in Dublin city.  I am almost certain these apartments are in the possession of NAMA.  They were being advertised as being under different management and rented.  The future of the housing sector lies in those apartments being put on the market to set a base price which would flow throughout the country.  <\/p><p>I am not certain about the Government's opinion on Senator Sean D. Barrett's proposals, but I am prepared to give them a fair wind.  I do not know if they would work, but I would like to explore them further.  We require more than a two hour debate if we are to tease out the issues involved.  I have to admit I do not know enough about the subject or sufficiently understand the intricate details set out in the explanatory memorandum to state whether the proposals would succeed in this country.  However, I am grateful to the Senator for giving us an opportunity to learn more about them.<\/p><p>We would have hit the perfect storm financially were it not for the fact that interest rates remained historically low.  Without such low rates, we would be in 1930s territory and speaking about recession rather than depression.<\/p> <p>This legislation is prudential and I am satisfied that is the way Irish lending should be.  However, there is a dichotomy currently.  We are telling the banks they should lend, but at the same time we are telling them they should leave people in their homes, although many of these people will not stay in their homes because they have completely over-borrowed.  The Personal Insolvency Bill will be available.  If people have over-borrowed to the extent I am aware some people have, there is no prospect they can remain in their homes.  I am dissatisfied by that, but it is the reality.  The Personal Insolvency Bill is on the way and we are satisfied that is the start of the process.  However, in truth we do not know how the legislation will work in practice.  The theory of how it will work has been debated in the other Chamber and it will come to us in November.  However, I am unsure it will work as well in practice as in theory, but we hope it will work.<\/p><p>I am also concerned that while the local value ratios at 80% are prudential, they are perhaps even more prudential than the banking sector's way of lending now.  In my time with local authorities, I always observed that the local authorities were better at providing loans to certain sectors of society, people who could not get loans from the lending and financial institutions.  Local authorities went beyond the standard prudential rate, because they knew the people who were borrowing and knew their families.  They also knew which families repaid their loans.  It was always the same families who repaid and always the same families who did not.  That local knowledge existed within the local authorities and among most of the local councillors.   My concern is that if this legislation prescribes an 80% loan to value ratio, we will exclude the input of that local knowledge.  That would be a mistake.<\/p><p>I was heartened by what Fiona Muldoon said yesterday.  It is about time somebody from the regulatory sector put the boot into the banks.  Many of us here, from both sides of the House, have tried to do the same, but to no avail.  The banks are still the same in my experience.  I must tell Senator Barrett that the use of the term &quot;microprudential legislation&quot; is new to me, but I am open to learning and to listening.  <\/p><p>I have a concern that while the bond system has operated as it has for centuries, this smacks of what happened in the United States.  I understand however that the intention is that what happened in the US, where they bundled them up and started selling them to each other, will not happen here.  That caused a huge problem in the US.  I remember reading an article relating to the United States, where they have the three strike rule with regard to felonies.  On the third strike, even if minor, culprits go down for 25 years.  People in the United States who had two strikes against them were getting loans.  These were being bundled together and sold within credit institutions in the United States and this created a huge problem further down the line.<\/p><p>Page 4 of the explanatory memorandum mentions the balance principle.  I have a concern in this regard.  Irish society went through much of the same as we are going through today in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  I remember hearing people say we would never go back to that again and that there was no way we would ever make the same mistakes again.  However, as capitalism goes unchecked over time - I speak as someone who supports capitalism - the problem is that it gets out of hand and greed takes over.  We believed we would never get back to this position, but we have got back here with a vengeance.  It is many times worse than what happened in the 1970s and 1980s, but I do not believe the Irish mindset is prepared to purchase at the loan to value ratios we should be at.<\/p><p>I would like to know what the situation with regard to home ownership is in Denmark.  In Ireland and in the United Kingdom, a man's home is his castle.  That is the mindset in these islands.  However, that mindset is not so strong on the Continent and I suspect home ownership is much lower in Denmark than in Ireland or the United Kingdom.  The Irish psyche is intent on home purchase.  I was not as dead set against 100% mortgages as some people were.  Quite a few people were caught in the trap where they were renting and did not have the opportunity to put together enough cash to pay off or purchase the 92% or 85%.  In Ireland, people set their minds to purchasing their home and becoming a homeowner.  The difficulty was that banks lost the run of themselves.  They also lost the ability to decipher which people could and could not pay.  This was compounded further by the fact they did not care.  Their objective was to lend the money and then chase it, because their bonuses were linked to the money going out.  Therein lay the problem.  The regulators, the Central Bank, the European institutions and others lost control also.  They too let the animal off the leash.<\/p><p>I would like more detail on this Bill.  I am not satisfied that two hours of Private Members' debate is adequate to deal with a Bill intended to radically reform Irish lending institutions.  However, I am open to its intention and to giving it fair wind, but would like to go through it in much more detail, whether here, in committee or elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700034#JJ00200","speaker":"1160","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350485100,"counter":397,"content":"<p>Cuirim f\u00e1ilte roimh an Aire St\u00e1it go dt\u00ed an Teach ar\u00eds.  I thank Senator Barrett for introducing this Bill.  We are all agreed an immense amount of work has been put into this Bill.  This is the first Bill I have seen where the explanatory memorandum probably needs an explanatory memorandum of its own.  I have been reading through it and trying to make a good fist of it.<\/p><p>All potential solutions and all aspects of them need to be considered in the light of day.  I support the thrust of the Bill, but the issues need to be teased out.  This is not the first Bill we have had on the issue of mortgages.  Senator Barrett already produced the Fiscal Responsibility Bill on which the Government is moving separately and Senator MacSharry mentioned the Family Home Protection Bill 2011.  There has been significant concern, across parties and among Independent Members with regard to how we can grapple with the banking problem and mortgage debt.  The figures given by Fiona Muldoon that we raise all the time with regard to the mortgage arrears crisis are probably another day's work, but they indicate the fact that the banks are kicking the can down the road and are not dealing with the real issue.  They are not dealing with the \u20ac6 billion or \u20ac7 billion figure given with regard to potential future write-downs.<\/p><p>The banks have not even dealt with aspects such as zeroisation of interest.  It is all very well giving people a moratorium for 12 months, but interest still piles up.  The banks are not looking at the extension of mortgage terms for those who are in their 30s or 20s with 25 year mortgages who have the capacity to extend the mortgage term out further. <\/p> <p>If one asks our pillar banks for such a mechanism - this is the crux of the issue of freeing money into the economy - one is asked to rewrite the mortgage and to underwrite the mortgage again at its original value.  In other words, one will not get it.  If we were to allow the terms of mortgages to be extended by five years, with full medical underwriting being done again, we would reduce people's current repayments by between 15% and 20%.  People are struggling under mortgage debt.  There is no question about that.  Senator Barrett's Bill looks towards the future by trying to enable the banks to alter the way they do their jobs.  The strict loan-to-value ratios that are provided for and set out clearly in this Bill are very important.  That is the way it is.  If someone wants to borrow through this mechanism, he or she will know what the situation is.  I think that would help the people and the banks.<\/p><p>When the Minister for Finance replied to a question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, we learned that one third of all mortgage applications made in the last 12 months - the ones that reached application stage - were refused.  The market is simply not going to move if that pattern continues.  We have seen an increase in rental yields because professionals and other people who can afford to do so are renting rather than stepping into the market to buy.  To be frank, I would not step into the market if I had any money to do so, which I do not.  I do not believe this is a good time for people to purchase.  The NAMA scheme that was announced in this House, which aims to provide protection from future falls in property values, is under-subscribed.  Approximately 35% of the houses in question have been sold.  The take-up of the incentives offered by the Minister for Finance in the last budget, such as the increase in mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers, has been minimal.  The reason for that is people's lack of cash.<\/p><p>The banks do not have money.  Senator Michael D'Arcy covered it very well when he said we are asking the banks to show forbearance to people.  I think that should happen because the banks shoulder much of the blame for where people are at.  I know about it because I worked in the sector.  I did not work in a bank, but in a role that was directly related to mortgages and pensions.  Normal people went in to look for a 92% loan, but by the time they left they had been given a 110% loan.  Those who did not understand what that meant were asked whether they wanted a new car, a holiday or an opportunity to throw all their other loans in with their mortgage and were told everything would be grand.  People might not have had guns held to their heads, but they were pushed in a certain direction as I have outlined, particularly by banks that were led by sales bonuses.<\/p><p>The mechanism included in this legislation is part of the solution.  It needs to be teased out.  It would apply strict structures to what can and cannot be loaned in the case of a certain type of property or development, or in the case of agricultural land.  It goes through all aspects of the matter.  It really needs to be looked at.  I assume and hope the Government will take this Bill seriously.  I have referred to two other Bills that have been proposed.  Senator MacSharry came into the Chamber about a minute after I mentioned his Bill, which would have established an independent debt settlement office.  I put it to the Minister that such an office is still required.  Perhaps an independent appeals mechanism can be provided for in the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012.  We cannot give the banks the final say on how mortgage arrears are dealt with.<\/p><p>I wish to ask the Minister for Finance a question while he is here.  Perhaps he or his officials might be able to answer it.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, both said that mortgage resolution schemes would be submitted by the banks to the Central Bank by 30 September 2012.  I would love to know where they are.  Have they actually done that?  Are they being considered?  The Personal Insolvency Bill 2012 is the nuclear button.  It is not a solution for people.  The mortgage-to-rent scheme is not being taken up by most local authorities, including my own local authority in Fingal.  They are telling people they are not operating it.  Lenders are also saying they are not operating it.  People in my own area of Fingal do not want to know about it.  Neither the Oireachtas nor the Government will solve this overnight.  Some aspects of Senator Barrett's Bill should be part of the solution.  We need to be serious about getting stuck into the banks and the local authorities, where possible.  What is the point of the Minister of State with responsibility for housing coming to this House to announce a mortgage-to-rent scheme when most local authorities will not even participate in it?<\/p><p>I will conclude by thanking and congratulating Senator Barrett on the work he has done.  If he can work on a new explanatory memorandum for me, I will be happy to circulate it.  We know we are in the midst of a mortgage crisis that is getting worse.  Mortgage arrears have increased by 50% year on year.  I will not even talk about the buy-to-let market, which the banks have failed to deal with.  Many of the loans in question are about to reach their capital repayment terms.  The mortgage crisis will get worse if action is not taken.  The Bill proposed by Senator Barrett would force the banks to engage in new lending and to look at things differently.  That is needed as part of the solution.  I ask the Government to allow this Bill to be passed on Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700035#KK00200","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350485700,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700036#LL00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1350485700,"counter":400,"content":"<p>That would allow us to kick it around a bit more.

Like a number of others, I would like to thank Senator Barrett for all the work he has put into this draft Bill.  It is a superb piece of work.  I am a lawyer.  I also have a degree in economics.  I have gone through this proposal on a number of occasions.  If I sat down to go through it ten more times, I doubt that I would understand it completely.  I can say honestly that I am pretty confident that I would not understand it.<\/p><p>Like other speakers, I would like the Government to give this Bill some serious consideration.  I honestly believe we have reached a point in our history at which we need to examine new ways of doing things.  I agree with those Senators who have said we need to deal with the difficulties in the housing market at present.  I refer in particular to the manner in which the housing market relates to the current economy.  Ms Fiona Muldoon has been mentioned in this House on a number of occasions in the last two days.  Her comments at the Irish Banking Federation conference were particularly timely.  When she described the dealings of the Central Bank and the regulator with the banking sector as being like dealing with a teenager, she said it all about the point we have reached in our interaction with the banking sector.<\/p><p>I would like to mention a couple of figures to demonstrate that the housing market is currently stuck.  The CSO has indicated on a number of occasions that it believes the housing market has over-corrected.  The most recent auction figures suggested that over 50% of properties being bought in the State at the moment are being bought for cash.  That is not a healthy situation.  It does not suggest that the mortgage market is functioning properly.  We are all too well aware of the number of home owners who are in mortgage distress.  Now that the Minister is in our midst, it is tempting to mention that Senators have asked for a fuller debate on the issue of mortgage arrears, with particular regard to what is happening under the mortgage arrears resolution process, which is meant to be presented to the Central Bank by the pillar banks.<\/p><p>I must admit I have a lot of time for Senator Barrett's proposal.  However, there needs to be a note of caution with regard to a couple of points.  History matters when it comes to a housing system.  When one is talking about the Dutch housing system, for the sake of argument, it is important to bear in mind that one is looking at a process that is over 200 years old.  Denmark belongs to the category of countries which come from a social democratic tradition.  There is a much lower level of home ownership and a much higher level of social provision, particularly pension provision, in that country.  That means people look to home ownership in a way that is completely different from the way people in Ireland look to it.  Norway, to take another example, has deliberately encouraged very high levels of home ownership in order to establish a form of asset-based welfare.  In other words, one's home is an asset on which one relies as one gets older.  When we choose the models we will look at, we should be careful to select those that are most sympathetic to where we are coming from as a jurisdiction and that reflect our priorities and our past.<\/p><p>I would like to make a couple of points in response to Senator Barrett's analysis.  He spoke about 80% loan-to-value ratios, for example.  The Senator's Bill inspired me to study a couple of the treatises on the Irish housing market that have been published in recent years.  I was struck by the 2004 report of the National Economic and Social Council, which basically said that the issue at that time was not one of affordability.<\/p> <p>For most earners, the issue was access to a deposit.  In other words, home ownership had never been less expensive than it was in 2004 but a significant number of people could not actually access the deposit.<\/p><p>It is easy to turn around and say what happened was a failure of banking regulation but that is not true.  I would like to take the opportunity to refer Senator Barrett to one of his colleagues, Professor P. J. Drudy, and his work on the difficulty we had with not capturing betterment for the Irish people, for example, in terms of escalating land price values.  It is very easy to look at what happened in the Irish housing system and look beyond the banking sector and the failure of regulation but let us not totally be myopic around the banking system.  Let us look at the wider issues of why this system failed and collapsed.  As an economist, Senator Barrett is particularly attached to the laws of supply and demand.  The work of, for example, Mr. Peter Bacon and others shows that what happened in this housing market was not just about the failure of banking regulation but about the failure of supply and demand and, quite clearly, it was about the failure to provide an adequate amount of housing for people who needed it.  I do not think we can ever get away from that when we move forward.  If we think our problems are going to be solved by banking regulation and correcting banking misregulation without looking at the fundamental principles of supply and demand and the fact people need homes, we will never move on.<\/p><p>There is one issue we need to look to in the future.  As I said, history matters.  In the 1990s and leading into the market collapse in the 2000s, one of the fundamental matters in Ireland was the withdrawal of the Irish State from housing provision.  The bottom line is that if one looks at Irish housing in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, we had a very similar banking sector over those three decades and, in fact, we did not really have financial liberalisation until the end of the 1970s and into the 1980s.  The gap was filled by the role played by local authorities in lending to and providing homes for people on low incomes.  My point is that if we are to look to the future, we must to some extent look to the past and what worked for this country in the past.  Where we went wrong, if I may say so, and I am not sure if I have six or ten minutes remaining-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700036#LL00600","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350486300,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Six.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700037#MM00200","speaker":"1118"},{"type":"speech","time":1350486300,"counter":406,"content":"<p>My colleague had ten.

Ireland is and always has been a nation of homeowners.  Some 25% of the people in this country became homeowners through the local authority sector.  There is a significant body of evidence that shows that older people in this country are not poorer than they could be because they own their own homes.<\/p><p>What Senator Barrett has presented is part of what I would suggest is a rich tapestry of options and I thank him very much for producing it in the House.

It is an indication of how serious the Government is taking this issue that the Minister for Finance would present himself to Seanad \u00c9ireann.  I regret he was not able to be present, though I am sure it was for very good reasons, when Senators Barrett and Quinn spoke.  What they said was so important, so precise, so clear and so brilliantly argued that it is very important the Minister should take the time to read the record of the Seanad, because what they said will be of infinitely greater value than anything I can say, as I am very much an amateur.  Nonetheless, I am an amateur who has been concerned politically and socially for the welfare of the Irish people throughout my political career.<\/p><p>I remember a number of years ago, at the beginning of this financial crisis, predicting that mortgages would be a really serious problem, that we were only beginning to see the tip of the iceberg and that, as the situation worsened, more people would be dragged into this very difficult situation.  I made a suggestion at that stage, which was probably a little naive, that we would create a department, not of homeland security, as it is in the United States, but a department of home security, so a group of officials could get together and study the kind of proposals Senator Barrett has used his academic training and encyclopaedic knowledge of the markets and regulations to present to us today.<\/p><p>It is a very important day for Seanad \u00c9ireann when such a constructive and immediate response to a very difficult situation should have been entered by Senator Barrett.  I am glad the Minister is here but I hope Senator Barrett will send it also to Ms Fiona Muldoon and to the public interest directors of the banks.  After all, we own them.  I do not know what they are doing.  I understand they got \u20ac2.5 billion and they have lent about \u20ac1 million of it.  What is happening?  It is very constipated banking, as far as I can see.  Nothing very much seems to emerge.  We hear day after day on the radio of situations where valid mortgages are turned down.  The banks want to amass money in order to refloat their books.  Very few people will disagree with this assessment.<\/p><p>The Bill gives certain things.  It gives stability, which is very important.  It is EU-complicit and has been validated by  a number of very significant financial authorities.  It provides a situation which could protect us against bubbles in the market.  In addition, it has a strict loan to value ratio, which is very important and would allow a much lower possibility of default.<\/p><p>I wish to turn to some of the points made by other speakers.  Senator D'Arcy is a very amiable and decent person and I hope he was not put in just to block this Bill.  I hope Senator Barrett will do something that Seanad \u00c9ireann has done historically for the past few years, namely, when we feel there is something very valuable, the proposer, when he responds, sits down after three minutes instead of five, leaving two minutes remaining so that the Bill is still alive in some form on the Order Paper of Seanad \u00c9ireann.  This is a terribly important and timely Bill.<\/p><p>Senator D'Arcy seemed to suggest one thing with which I profoundly disagree, namely, that the 100,000 or so people who were on the unemployment register before the bubble and the crisis were not really looking for work at all.  One cannot say that about an entire group of people and I hope he did not mean it.  God knows, I know it is easy to make a slip of the tongue but I hope that remark was an ill-considered one.  I presume Senator D'Arcy's little excursion into the German psyche came from one of the words used by Senator Barrett, realkreditobligationer.  It is actually a Danish model and I am not sure the Danes would be flattered by being accused of having a Germanic psyche.<\/p><p>I was very impressed indeed by the tribute paid to Senator Barrett by Senator Hayden, who is one of the best speakers and one of the most incisive intellects in this House.  I do not always agree with her but, by God, you know what you are dealing with when you are dealing with her.  She talked about the historical background we need to look at.  However, that came out of the kind of historical background we are looking at, because the great fire in Denmark in the late 1790s created appalling chaos in the market and this was produced in response to it.  Now, it is a valuable response in our situation.<\/p><p>The other point is that it was a mutual situation.  It was not just the banks, it was also the building societies.  I remember them in my day being mutual societies for the communal benefit and social welfare of people.  Then, we got greedy.  They decided to privatise themselves and everybody got \u20ac10,000, \u20ac15,000 or \u20ac20,000 - I think I got about \u20ac2,000 out of mine.  I always felt this was a violation of what they were set up for, which takes us back to the principal of mutuality and social good.  One need only look at the situation from which we have come.<\/p> <p>I am not good at graphs but I refer to one which shows the composition of debt by country in 2010 as a percentage of GDP.  We are the worst in every category.  Senator Barrett has not given a percentage for household debt but it looks as though it is 120%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700037#MM00600","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350486900,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Senator Norris has one minute remaining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700038#NN00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1350486900,"counter":412,"content":"<p>For non-financial corporations it is 222%, and it goes up to 259% for financial corporations.

The first type of property is those which require an 80% loan-to-value ratio.  This refers to owner-occupied, all-year residences, namely, homes.  Also in that category, there is private co-operative housing - the social element; private residential property for letting, including facilities for persons who require care - the decency of the Irish people is reflected there; non-profit rental housing; youth housing; housing for the elderly; and properties for social, cultural and educational purposes.  This makes the scheme socially attractive.  The next type of property is those which require a loan-to-value ratio of 70%.  In that case we are looking at agricultural holdings, forestry property and market gardens.  Again, they are immensely socially constructive and also good for the economy.  The required loan-to-value ratio then declines to 60% for recreational dwellings, office properties, retail properties, industrial properties and collective energy supply plants.  We are again looking at an incentive mechanism for restarting the economy, but we are putting it at a lower level than the socially important items.  For the construction industry the required loan-to-value ratio is 40%.<\/p><p>I say well done to Senator Barrett.  I congratulate him.  He should not withdraw this explanatory memorandum.  It is wonderful.  It is brilliant and idiosyncratic.  I have never seen one like it in my life but it is refreshing because it gives one the answers.  It asks the principal question of why Ireland needs the balance-principle banking model.  If one wants an answer, it is there.  It is not given in the kind of way I have ever seen in an explanatory memorandum before.  We need to translate it in case there are any journalists listening who may think that immorality is being proposed.  My good colleague, the brilliant academic from Trinity, Senator Barrett, dares to use the classical languages.  He uses a phrase from Latin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700038#NN00300","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1350486900,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I ask Senator Norris to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700038#NN00400","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1350486900,"counter":414,"content":"<p>He says it would be useful to put in place a highly regulated <i>tabula rasa<\/i> approach to kick-start the mortgage market again.

It is clear that there are many challenges currently facing the Irish banking system and I welcome all contributions to the debate, particularly from the Senator, given his expertise in the economic field.  Mortgage credit is a key component of the banking system and we accept that the market is sub-optimal at the moment.  I regret I cannot accept the Bill as proposed by the Senator in its totality but I have asked my officials to consider whether elements of the proposal could be feasibly rolled out as the financial system is returned to sustainable operation.<\/p><p>As the Senator has acknowledged, this Bill borrows heavily from the Danish model which has operated successfully in Denmark for generations.  The balance principle of matching loans and bonds is the backbone of the Danish mortgage system.  Within the system, the mortgage banks there operate differently from mortgage lenders in Ireland.  They do not take deposits or raise funding for lending purposes.  Instead, they act as an intermediary between the borrower and the investor who funds the loans by purchasing bonds.<\/p><p>It is far from clear that the Danish system could be transposed to the Irish situation.  We must remember that, until the global banking crisis broke in 2007, mortgages in Ireland were funded through a variety of sources.  These included customer deposits and unsecured funding from the money markets of both short and long duration, as well as secured funding structures such as mortgage-backed securities and covered bonds.  However, as is widely understood today - albeit with the benefit of hindsight - as the last decade wore on and banks developed an insatiable appetite for funding to support their expanding loan books, more and more Irish mortgages were effectively being funded by the international markets.<\/p><p>As part of the restructuring of our banking system, we are downsizing our institutions to a more sustainable level and also restoring a more traditional funding model that largely comprises customer deposits, which do not tend to move frequently.  Significant progress in aligning the quantum of bank lending with customer deposits has already been made.  However, that is not to say there is no place for market or wholesale funding in the Irish banking system.  We do recognise the benefits provided by this type of funding, particularly as banks seek to better align the long-term nature of their lending with that of their funding, which tends to be more short term.  It is for that reason the Government is supportive of the covered bond structure we have in place in this country, which has been proven by international investors to be a robust and valued framework.<\/p><p>As Senators can appreciate, since the Government has taken office, much effort and focus and substantial taxpayer resources have been directed towards the stabilisation of a badly damaged banking system.  Any proposal for the introduction of new initiatives needs to be viewed through the lens of the State support already committed and broader sectoral financial stability.  The Danish covered bond model has been in place for more than 200 years and is specific to the Danish property market.  It is a concept that has worked well in the Danish context and is well embedded in Denmark.  There are many positives to the system but it must be remembered that the introduction of such a system in this country would necessitate a total shift in mortgage banking policy and regulation.  Such a transformation would bring with it a number of risks and could conflict with other Government initiatives currently under way.<\/p><p>For example, the Central Bank's code of conduct on mortgage arrears applies to mortgage lending activities with borrowers in respect of their principal private residences in the State.  Compliance with the code is mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Central Bank.  The code provides a number of protections to borrowers.  These include the establishment of a formal mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, to deal with mortgage customers who are in arrears or pre-arrears, the establishment of a dedicated appeals support unit and a separate internal appeals process by lenders to deal with individuals on a case-by-case basis.  Provision 9 of the code restricts lenders from imposing charges or surcharge interest on arrears outstanding in MARP cases.  With regard to repossessions, a lender may not apply to the courts to commence legal action for repossession of property until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative arrangement.  When a borrower is co-operating with a lender, the lender must wait at least 12 months from the date the borrower is classified by the lender as being under its mortgage arrears resolution process - that is, 31 days from when arrears first arose - before applying to the courts to start legal action for repossession.  This contrasts greatly with the Danish system, where it typically takes no more than six months from the time when the borrower defaults until a forced sale can be carried through.  The Government could not countenance a system that forced families out of their homes in such a short period of time.  The Government's proposals for dealing with the mortgage arrears problems have been designed to assist people to stay in their homes for as long as they are proportionate to their needs.<\/p><p>In addition, the Bill, together with necessary and detailed Central Bank regulations, could conflict with the personal insolvency legislation which will deal with borrower indebtedness and with the deleveraging process that is under way in the banks.  The Danish model and the Bill proposed by the Senator involve the standardisation of mortgage products, most notably with regard to loan-to-value, LTV, limits.  Danish regulations and the proposed Bill limit the amount that can be lent to homeowners to 80% LTV.  Although this helps in terms of credit risk for the bank and negative equity risk for the borrower, it would greatly limit the number of mortgages issued in Ireland.  Most banks in this country currently offer mortgages of 92% LTV.  This is important to many potential borrowers, especially the important first-time buyers, who would struggle to find the additional 12% for a deposit.<\/p><p>In addition, the capital requirements directive and regulation is currently in the trilogue phase of negotiations among the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament.<\/p> <p>It would not be appropriate to introduce new lending and banking practices in advance of the conclusion of negotiations on this regulation and directive.  Concerns have been expressed about how the directive may treat bonds such as those used in the Danish system.  The outcome of the negotiations has the potential to require significant change to that system.  Finally and crucially, for this system to work, it would need to generate a critical mass and would need legal certainty.  It is not clear that there would be sufficient interest in the purchase of Irish mortgage bonds at this time.<\/p><p> The Government is playing its part in returning the property and mortgage market to normal levels although I wish to make it clear that the Government will not artificially stimulate demand.  Last year's budget aimed to restore confidence, rebuild our economy and provide stability and certainty to investors to invest in Ireland.  It provided that first-time buyers in 2012 will get mortgage interest relief at a rate of 25% and other buyers will benefit from relief at 15%  This measure gives certainty to those considering purchasing a home.  Again, I strongly emphasise that this mortgage interest relief measure will come to an end at the end of this year and there will be no extension to this measure given the current budgetary position.  Furthermore, purchasers should ensure they factor in the time required between purchase and mortgage draw-down in order to qualify for mortgage interest relief.  We are getting really close to the time when the curtain comes down on this relief.<\/p><p> The recently launched residential property prices register also gives certainty to the market in regard to prices paid for specific properties and it is already helping to guide commentators about the current state of the market.  The budget also introduced a capital gains tax incentive for property purchased between 7 December 2011 and the end of 2013.  If a property is bought during this period and held for at least seven years, the gain attributable to that seven year holding period will be relieved from capital gains tax.  This applies to commercial property, including industrial and commercial buildings, farmland and residential property.<\/p><p> A number of further initiatives have been pushed forward.  The Government is aware of the significant difficulties some homeowners are facing in meeting their mortgage obligations and is committed to advancing appropriate measures to assist those mortgage holders who are experiencing genuine difficulties.  In this regard, the Government is actively implementing the main recommendations contained in the report of the interdepartmental working group on mortgage arrears,<\/p><p> A number of significant milestones have now been achieved.  The Personal Insolvency Bill was approved by Government and published last June and Committee stage of the Bill was passed by the D\u00e1il last month.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning has formally launched the mortgage to rent scheme on a nationwide basis.  Lenders have now provided details to the Central Bank on their proposed  forbearance and loan modification options and some forbearance measures have been introduced on a pilot basis, with a further roll-out later in the year.  In addition, an extensive independent mortgage advice framework has now been put in place by the Minister of Social Protection comprising: an enhanced website, <i>keepingyourhome.ie: <\/i>a mortgage arrears information helpline; and the provision of free, independent, one-to-one, professional financial advice to borrowers considering a long-term forbearance or resolution offer from their lender.  The list of accountants providing this service is located on the <i>keepingyourhome.ie<\/i>website.  The Government remains very committed to progressing these measures, which are in addition to existing supports such as the code of conduct on mortgage arrears which assists genuine mortgage holders in difficulty, and the Government sub-committee on mortgage arrears, chaired by An Taoiseach, which continues to meet to ensure this matter receives priority attention across relevant Departments and agencies.<\/p><p> I note that the comments of the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, Mr. John Moran, and the Central Bank's director of credit institutions and insurance supervision, Ms Fiona Muldoon, have generated significant coverage.  These two public servants were doing exactly what public servants do -  clearly articulating and implementing the Government's policy on the resolution of mortgage arrears.<\/p><p> It is important to remember there is no quick-fix solution to the Irish banking and mortgage issues.  The Danish model is about a different financial and institutional system of mortgages and lending.  Adopting such a system in Ireland would involve many risks and now is not the right time to include further risks into the Irish financial system.  While accepting the many merits of the Bill proposed by Senator Barrett, I consider that the direction being taken by the Government is appropriate at this time and I am satisfied that the initiatives currently underway will resolve the situation.  I fully accept many of the principles behind the Bill and the spirit in which it is put forward but regret that we cannot accept it at this time.  However, I reiterate that I have asked my officials to see if proposals within the Bill can be advanced over time as the financial system moves to a more sustainable level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700038#NN00600","speaker":"955","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350487500,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for taking time to attend, given his busy schedule.  It is a shame we have to talk so often about this issue without any consequent penetrative action.  I commend Senator Barrett on his work on this Bill.  If we had had a model such as the Danish model some 20 or 25 years ago, before we had all our problems, I do not believe we would be in the difficulties we now face.  There is a good body of work there to consider but although the Minister stated he would ask his officials to look at aspects of it and how they might be transposed into an Irish set up, which is welcome, I have no confidence that this is hitting home in the Department of Finance given the way that Department interacts with Government.  I speak of the inherent difficulties which demand immediate action.<\/p><p>The Minister stated: &quot;These two public servants were doing exactly what public servants do  -  clearly articulating and implementing the Government's policy on the resolution of mortgage arrears.&quot;  Ms Fiona Muldoon stated that the banks should fix their balance sheets through &quot;at least partial forgiveness of irrecoverable loans&quot;.  In my view that means debt forgiveness.  Mr. John Moran said something very similar, leading to the headline in one of the local newspapers: &quot;New Hope for Write-Down on Mortgage Debt.&quot;<\/p><p>The Minister mentioned possible mortgage resolution solutions, referring in the first place to a code of conduct.  In its analysis of compliance with the code of conduct, the Central Bank showed that the banks are not following that code of conduct.  This can be verified in the releases published by the Central Bank on its website.  It is true that a mortgage arrears resolution process has been put in place which offers a structure of contact with people who are in difficulty and it has been followed to an extent.  However, all reasonable solutions are not being considered.  The Minister referred specifically to an appeals process but that is an internal process.  To what body does it appeal?  If a bank's decision to offer very little is appealed, the appeal is heard by the bank itself, which also determines whether action is necessary.  <\/p><p>Senator O'Brien observed that according to anecdotal evidence in his constituency action on the mortgage to rent scheme is not being followed through.  In situations where I act formally on behalf of people who have asked me to be a point of contact with the lender, I have asked for action to be taken but no bank has the slightest intention of taking this on board.  They are not interested in meaningful solutions.  Senator Barrett referred to the back stairs for bankers in the Department of Finance.  Unless a measure happens to be the banker's idea, it seems the Legislature must continue to be in denial and refuse to come forward with reasonable solutions.  This will be the case until there is an independent statutory demand that banks take particular actions.  That does not mean codes of conduct although if these were statutory and properly enforced we would find out that banks were not complying.  Consider what would happen if there was a law enjoining banks to take a particular action. <\/p> <p>For example, why not have aspects of the Personal Insolvency Bill tested before the courts by requiring that order for repossession of a family home cannot be granted unless specific steps are taken by the relevant bank, including extending the term of the loan, renegotiating its terms or offering a rent-to-mortgage facility?  If the law required such steps to be taken in advance of any order for repossession being granted, the brains of the very same bankers who produced various complex methods of losing money, such as derivatives, would have to be engaged to put forward what is needed in this process.  This is not just about having the \"best boy in the class\" T-shirt for European bankers to whom we had to repay enormous sums but about the people of this country.  The number of residential mortgages in arrears has reached 129,000 and the figure is increasing by 1,000 each month.  If we wait for the market to rise to allow people to recover, we will probably wait for 18 years, as a number of reports have shown.  We are still in denial.  We have had the Personal Insolvency and Debt Settlement and Mortgage Resolution Office Bills.  Senator Sean Barrett, the sponsor of this Bill, is being given the pat on the head that is customary when Independent Senators introduce legislation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700039#OO00200","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350488100,"counter":419,"content":"<p>Senator MacSharry is being unfair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700040#PP00200","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1350488100,"counter":420,"content":"<p>The Government is thanking him for doing a great job and while indicating it would be give him a first class grade if he was being adjudicated on his economics class, it is also telling him it has no interest in changing the law to do something for people.<\/p><p>The Minister stated that two senior civil servants, the Secretary General of the Department, Mr. John Moran, and Ms Muldoon of the Central Bank, were carrying out Government policy when they spoke of the need for debt forgiveness.  Nothing is being done on this issue.  As the evidence from every constituency office in the country shows and as everyone involved in business knows, the banks are only superficially engaging with people.  I ask the Minister of State to cite one instance of individuals aged in their mid-40s who have paid off 15 years of a 35 year mortgage being offered the option to extend their mortgage term to 35 years.  The reason no one can cite a single example of such a scenario is that there are no such cases.  Can anyone cite an example of people being offered a mortgage-to-let facility?  I cannot find a single example of this in the north west.  I have requested that such an option be provided in two specific cases and both my requests have been declined. <\/p><p>I do not doubt that everyone wants the position to improve.  However, until responsibility for this matter is removed from the banks, they will continue to act in a superficial manner and put the interests of people last, which I am sure is not the Government's intention. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700040#PP00300","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1350488100,"counter":421,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, to the Chamber.  It is great to see him again.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to discuss this innovative legislation.  It is always worthwhile spending time examining the approaches taken in other jurisdictions.  I commend Senator Sean Barrett on affording us an opportunity to discuss this issue, even if I called down many maledictions on his head in recent days for presenting such complex legislation.<\/p><p>The Standing Orders of the Seanad work against us in respect of this legislation and it is regrettable we must discuss this highly technical Bill within the constraints of a Second Stage debate.  I thank the Leader for taking time today to ascertain whether Standing Orders could be amended to allow us debate the Bill in an alternative format.  We must deal with it in the prescribed manner, which means we are unable to interrogate the intentions of the proposer in as full a way as I would like.  Notwithstanding this, we must do what we can within the constraints of Second Stage to examine this proposal, which has undoubted merit.<\/p><p>No one disagrees that restructuring of the mortgage market is necessary.  The introduction of new mortgage products should be considered and welcomed if they are found to reduce the level of risk involved in all lending.  Concerns have arisen about the drafting of certain sections of the Bill.  These could be improved with further work as one or two sections appear to seek to achieve a little more than is legislatively possible.  An example is the prescription for action following default or bankruptcy in relation to the ranking of creditors in section 24, which appears to be outside the scope and jurisdiction of the Bill.  However, I will leave this matter aside until we are able to discuss it in a more appropriate manner, perhaps on Committee Stage.<\/p><p>One of the reasons I asked the Leader to ascertain if a different process was available for having this discussion in Private Members' time is that I believe the Government side could support the Bill if it were presented in another form.  It is a great shame that we cannot allow the Bill to proceed in its current form as many aspects of it are worth exploring. <\/p><p>Some of the literature I have read on this issue suggests the financial culture in the jurisdiction in which the proposed bonds would be processed is very important for the successful operation of the bonds.  The Danish model on which the proposal is based involves a conservative lending regime in a well-funded and mature financial market.  As the Senator's note indicates, mortgage credit bonds have been operating successfully in Denmark for two centuries.  A similar product in the United States, the mortgage backed security, is an instrument that represents a claim on cash flows from mortgage loans.  We know now, however, that in the financial culture prevailing in the United States in the happy days before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, these instruments were bundled with more risky financial instruments and caused massive damage and contagion throughout the global market.  Having seen how domestic lending institutions have operated over the years, people could be forgiven for lacking confidence in our lending leaders.  I understand, however, that provision has been made within the operation of the mortgage credit bond to prevent over-the-counter resales and bundling with riskier products.  I would liked to have had an opportunity to discuss this matter further with the Senator.<\/p><p>I have another concern about the operation of mortgage credit loans and associated bonds.  It seems we are proposing that the lending institution - I will use the term &quot;bank&quot; for simplicity of argument - will act as a clearing house to match the loan given to the borrower to the bond of the lender.  The bank charges an administrative charge, the borrower receives his or her money and the lender receives an income flow to the value of the bond.  While I note that the balance principle works here, I would have also have liked an opportunity to tease out the implications of this with the Senator.  My concern in this regard is that it breaks the traditional link between lender and borrower.  It is customary for the bank to carry the lending risk and it is in its interest to act in a prudential manner with regard to due diligence because it is carrying the risk.  Acting as a clearing house removes this responsibility from the bank or at least reduces the urgency of acting in such a manner.  If the credit mortgage bond is available in the financial markets, over-the-counter resale would make this requirement or the urgency of this requirement less onerous on the banks. <\/p><p>Senator Barrett's proposal is exciting and stimulating and I would like to explore a number of other questions with him.  For instance, would it be necessary to establish a new organisation as a specialised lender or would another, existing institution be retooled, so to speak, to assume this role in the Irish context?  Is there a facility for early settlement of the bond and, if so, would this entail the bond carrying an increased risk premium?  <\/p><p>I note section 6 sets out categories of property that would be eligible under the scheme.  The non-profit or social housing element calls to mind our old friends, now deceased, in the United States, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  We saw where these two institutions ended up when they used a similar sounding financial instrument, despite enjoying the faith and confidence of the US Government.<\/p><p>Could we introduce this model in an oven-ready manner, as it were?  Are there any distinctive Danish characteristics associated with this lending model or any unique or novel Irish characteristics which could preclude its smooth transfer into our system?  I would have liked more time to discuss these issues. <\/p> <p> The Minister indicated in his reply that a total shift in mortgage bank policy and regulation might be required to make it compatible with this Bill but contrary to what Senator MacSharry might say, the Minister's reply constitutes a result.  He can take some satisfaction from the fact that it has not been dismissed like many of the proposals we may want to accept but are barred from doing so by the party Whip system.  I say that because we must be honest in our dealings here.<\/p><p>I commend Senator Barrett.  It is an interesting topic which I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss again in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700040#PP00400","speaker":"1117","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350488700,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I commend Senator Barrett on this innovative Bill.

We have not heard yet from any Minister for Finance, including the Minister present, or any Government spokesperson on how bad the situation is in the Irish banks.  Ms Muldoon was extremely critical of the behaviour of the banks in doing the job they are supposed to do.  She stated:<ul>Old-fashioned credit collection techniques were largely absent.  We found that challenge to SFS was minor and peripheral.  There was little understanding or agreement around affordability.  We found that systems were clunky and difficult to operate.  Management information was not in place - I am a big proponent of what gets measured gets done!<\/ul>She further stated that she has not found any humility in the banks in contrast to the American way of doing business where if one makes a mistake, one gets on with it and resolves it.  <\/p><p>  I find a conflict in what the Minister said in his contribution which diminishes what Senator Barrett has proposed.

There were 150,000 unoccupied houses in the country in 2006, yet Government policy was to build 90,000 units per annum.  We do not have to look outside these Houses for people to blame for that.

That is the reason we got to where we are now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700041#QQ00700","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1350488700,"counter":429,"content":"<p>I welcome the Bill and commend the interest of Senator Barrett in this area.  It grieves me that four years into probably the greatest financial disaster we have seen in our lifetime we are still trying to get to grips with some of the basic actions that need to be taken.  That reflects badly on recent Administrations, and I am not excluding my party, and certainly includes the current Administration.<\/p><p>The idea behind the Bill, as Senator Barrett explained, is that the institution will be a bridge between investors on the one hand and borrowers on the other.  Everybody in this House will recognise that we do not have a functioning banking system.  Having recapitalised the banks, they are still not working, and I do not believe they will work.  I recall somebody who was working within the banking architecture for many years saying to me at the time this crisis emerged that the banks, months before the issue arose, were sitting at high levels preparing their campaign and that they would dance rings around our Department of Finance and our Administration.  Our Administration depends on people in the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the regulator, all of whom failed, catastrophically in my opinion, to deal with the issues when they needed to be dealt with.<\/p><p>Many people have identified as a central failing during those good years that policies pursued were pro-cyclical, in other words, we had tax incentives and generated more investment into the property area.  I was a critic of our tax regime at the time.  I believe the commencement of this spiral began in the mid-1990s when the current Taoiseach, as Minister for Tourism and Trade, introduced the holiday home scheme.  Over 1,000 houses were built in the Courtown area in my county and sold at a multiple of three times what houses in the rest of the county were selling for simply because of the tax breaks.  Developers and investment structures made a killing, so to speak, because people were blinded by the tax deduction they got and, consequently, spent much more than they should have spent on the system.<\/p> <p>I remember putting it to the Minister in 2001 that we needed to re-introduce a provision from the 1970s which required a certificate of reasonable value.  If one was selling a house at that time one had to get from the Department a certificate of reasonable value.  I argued strongly with the Minister.  He tried with his officials but they convinced him that it would not work and that people would not go for it.  He suggested that we introduce a provision whereby borrowing could not exceed the certificate but that was not done either.<\/p><p>The current Government is pursuing pro-cyclical policies which are depressing the market more than it should be depressed.  The market needs to be stimulated.  Some of the things we were doing in the good times should be brought back to try to get the market back to a realistic, sustainable level.  It is not happening and I do not believe it will happen because I do not believe the advice or expertise is in place.<\/p><p>Everyone in the House knows that there are many young people who need to borrow to purchase their home.  They are in a position to meet the repayments on the borrowings but the financial resources are not available in the banks.  The banks are simply repairing their balance sheets.  The Bill before the House would give an avenue of recourse to revenues for some of these people, although not all of them.  It is a way for them to get access to moneys.  It is a tried and trusted system in Denmark and elsewhere and it has worked well and successfully for many generations, as the Minister of State has acknowledged.<\/p><p>I note two points made by the Minister of State.  He indicated he had no wish to introduce further risk in this area.  I have tried to think about what risks there could be but I could only identify one.  A securitised bond such as this one would attract the better or stronger borrowers and therefore remove them from the banks, which are dead banks and are not lending in any event.  Many of the policies being pursued by this Government are trying to bolster a system that has failed and that is dead in the water.  Something needs to be done.<\/p><p>I am a critic of the Personal Insolvency Bill which is still sitting in the Minister's office.  Some four years into the crisis we have not addressed the antiquated bankruptcy laws in the country.  As a consequence we have seen entrepreneurs and people who have lost everything they had having to emigrate to avail of more realistic bankruptcy provisions in other jurisdictions.  In recent mornings on the Order of Business I have said that such people may resume their careers and business activities in those countries with a consequential loss of potential jobs in this country.  We need to get expertise that will guide us in the right direction.<\/p><p>I commend Senator Barrett.  He has taken a step in the right direction and this proposal should be supported.  It is not a solution but it is part of the solution.  I appeal to the other side to exercise their independence and leave this on the Order Paper by not voting it down.  I imagine some of them realise that this needs to be done.  If we vote it down we are going nowhere in respect of solving these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700041#QQ00800","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350489300,"counter":431,"content":"<p>This is a brief interjection.  I call on the Minister of State to ask the Minister for Finance if he will consider some fundamental changes in the way we do our financial business with regard to the question of mortgage debt and bank sustainability.  This is a time of national emergency.  Let us reflect on when many people took the advice of bankers.  They were a group the people in Ireland were brought up to believe could be trusted.  They were a near priest class with whom people had a professional relationship.  They were supposed to be counted on to give people advice which was in their interests with respect to what they could and could not afford in a mortgage.<\/p><p>As a result of systematic misleading, a large chunk of our population have found themselves with a level of debt that was never sustainable.  However, these people had been advised by those who had a profound personal financial self-interest in telling them that such borrowing was sustainable.  We should quickly move to the model of non-recourse mortgages.  Anyone who wishes should be able to go to the bank, throw their keys down and tell them that the property belongs to the bank now and that they can keep it and keep the mortgage.  This is the way in many countries and it would fundamentally change the outlook for many people here who find themselves trapped in debt or with the burden of negative equity.<\/p><p>These people cannot reinvest in any other part of our economy.  Their entire future is in hock and it affects their social and geographic mobility.  Their ability to change jobs is totally gone but this measure would restore it.  In many cases it would still represent a financial catastrophe for people but at least it would be a liberating experience.  It would not be for everyone.  I do not imagine our banks would support the proposal but now we truly understood their essential culpability with regard to people making this mistake.  It is often misrepresented in Germany and elsewhere that we went mad buying big houses.  We did not.  Most Irish people bought the same kind of house that their parents and grandparents bought.  The only difference was that they bought it for five or ten times the price because they were led to believe that all the old rules of prudence which had applied were gone, rules such as that one should only take out a mortgage of two and a half times one's salary and that one should only take out a mortgage for 80% of the value of the property.  These were no longer applicable and those days were gone.  People were seriously advised that it was safe to take 100% interest-only mortgages to the value of three, four and five times their salaries.  With respect, this was done with the complicity of several Governments, which were perfectly happy to take large sums of stamp duty from them as well.  We should give consideration to simple legislation - perhaps it cannot be introduced in this House - to give anyone in a negative equity mortgage the opportunity of changing to a non-recourse mortgage.<\/p><p>I have put it to the Minister previously in the House that many people are in serious debt to banks and other lending institutions.  At the same time some of these people have large amounts of personal savings tied up in pension funds, which they cannot access until retirement at 60 or 65 years of age.  In many cases by the time those funds mature those involved will have lost their home or business because of the burden of unsustainable debt.  I know of many people who would willingly get their hands on some part of their pension fund that is sequestered and untouchable until it is too late, pay the tax that would be due, and then use the money to pay down debt.  The figure for Irish pension fund assets stored outside the country is approximately \u20ac100 billion.  If only a small portion of that was redeployed not to satisfy the Government's payments to those who so unwisely invested in our banks as bondholders, but to deal with the other debt problem in the country, personal debt, I believe it would be a win win win situation.  The Government would get more money in tax, the banks would get repayments on debts, which would otherwise simply go bad, and people would get some degree of liquidity which would help them to get their debt-ridden lives back on course.  I thank the Minister of State for his attention.

Would the Irish psyche adjust to this?  I would like to see the two systems going side by side.  I gather the telephone has hardly stopped ringing since we printed the Bill.  I understand there was an IDA proposal for a centre of this type of finance in the IFSC at one stage.  Perhaps they could operate side by side.  Would I like to see Irish banks running these operations?  No, I would not like to see Irish banks running anything.  Some \u20ac64 billion taken out of a country this size of a evening is enough damage done to this country as far as I am concerned.  Perhaps they would actually become real banks if we had this measure.  It might address their overwhelming reliance on mortgages at inflated prices and that reliance might be replaced by their getting to know some small and medium-sized enterprises.  It might encourage them to do some other investment.<\/p><p>Would we have the associated problems that arose in the USA here?  This question was raised by Senator Gilroy and other friends and colleagues.  I am informed that it is plain vanilla that it will not be combined with anything else.<\/p> <p>That would be something on which I would like assurance as well.  I would not like to see that situation developed.<\/p><p>The IMF likes it, it is Basel II compliant and the EU likes it.

It could be good for local authorities.  As one can see in one of the sections, they could get involved in schemes with it as well.<\/p><p>I hope I have dealt with the problems that Senators raised.  The Minister is taking a look at it but I will address some of the points in the Minister's speech.  I welcome the fact that he will look at this.  That is extremely good news.<\/p><p>The Minister stated: &quot;There are many positives to the system [obviously, I agree] but it must be remembered that the introduction of such a system in this country would necessitate a total shift in mortgage banking policy and regulation.&quot;  We are in a European Union with the Danes and it might not be so.  I gather one other Minister, whom I better not name due to the rules of the House, was interested in this previously as well and the IDA was interested in it.  It may not be that revolutionary.<\/p><p>He also stated &quot;The Government could not countenance a system which forced families out of their homes ...&quot;.  I am informed that in Denmark the number is minuscule, a fraction of 0.1%.  These are much lower priced loans than anything that is in operation in the Irish system and that has not been a problem.  I am glad to deal with that in response.<\/p><p>The Minister stated that it would not be appropriate to introduce new lending and banking practices in advance of the conclusion of negotiations on this regulation and directive in the European Union.  I am certain what we suggest is EU compliant and it is not new - it has been there since 1756 or whatever Senator Quinn told us.<\/p><p>The Minister stated, &quot;It is not clear that there would be sufficient interest in the purchase of Irish mortgage bonds at this time.&quot;  If the Danes could come here in 1014, they can come back with their mortgage proposals and we will see what gives.  In fact, we will invite them back for The Gathering next year, with their mortgage advisers and mortgage companies.<\/p><p>I thank Senator Hayden and all of the Senators.  Senator Norris used the word &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; about me.  I think I could return the compliment - he always is.  Senator Hayden's views are always most interesting.

This has just been the start.  This is, as I have said, a wonderful Seanad where ideas are discussed.  The Seanad did not stand idly by in this crisis.  Banks stood idly by and did serious damage and certain officials, who have been mentioned, were not the most active either, but it cannot be said in terms of what we have done on fiscal responsibility and today, that the Seanad ever neglected its duties, and it will assist the Minister and his colleagues in Cabinet in the work of reform.  I hope that there will be many contacts between the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, as the tourism Minister of State, and many Danish people, and I hope they will bring their mortgage advisers along as well.<\/p><p>I propose that we adjourn at this stage, if that is acceptable to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700042#RR00500","speaker":"1157","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1350489900,"counter":436,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1350489900,"counter":437,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700043#SS00300","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1350489900,"counter":438,"content":"<p>Leathuair tar \u00e9is a deich maidin am\u00e1rach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700043#SS00400","speaker":"1130"},{"type":"speech","time":1350489900,"counter":439,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

The last time he was in the House when we had a discussion about a Bill to reform the HSE, I mentioned a working group that was established to look at hospital networks.  The Minister will also be aware of a south-east hospital working group, which also sent a submission to him and which is headed up by Professor Fred Jackson.  The submission was about a regional structure for the south east, that works and that is based on maintaining services in the south-east region, and obviously wanting to protect the status of Waterford Regional Hospital.<\/p> <p>Professor Fred Jackson, a spokesperson for the south east hospitals working group, has said that a key reform being proposed by the Department of Health involves the establishment of hospital groups in Ireland.  His group believes that this proposal is consistent with the programme for Government and that it recognises the clinical networks which have already been established within the region.  He went on to say that if implemented, the proposal would ensure that patients of the south-east region can access high-quality care on a timely, local and cost-effective basis and that is what the people of Waterford want.  <\/p><p>There is certainly a need to realign some services, cardiac services being one example, across the south east.  We do not have 24-7 cardiac care in Waterford Regional Hospital, for example.  Some of the services are fragmented.  There is an appetite within the region to build up capacity in the regional hospital but to do so in the best interests of all patients across the region.  Obviously the hospital, like all others in the State, has suffered from cutbacks in recent years but I must put on record my appreciation of the staff and management of the hospital, who are doing their very best in difficult circumstances and are providing very good services to the people of the south east.  <\/p><p>There is a genuine fear that there might be a proposal to create a new network which would link Waterford to Cork, with the possibility of services in Waterford Regional Hospital drifting away to Cork, which would not be in the best interests of the people of Waterford or the south east generally.  It would also fly in the face of the logic of the Minister's attempts to ensure that people have access to world-class health services as close as possible to their communities, but also on a regional basis, where practical and appropriate.  That is what we are seeking here.  <\/p><p>The Minister is already aware of this issue and he received a copy of the submission.  I appreciate that a review is being carried out across the country regarding hospital networks but I just wanted to put on the record the fear that many consultants, not just in Waterford, but across the south east have, of not maintaining a regional entity within the south east and of a drift of services towards Cork, under a new hospital network set-up.  I look forward to the Minister's response and hope he will outline what he feels is the most appropriate way forward for the region. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700043#SS00900","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350490500,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and for the opportunity to clarify the position.  Senator Maurice Cummins has also made several representations to me on this issue.<\/p><p>Under the programme for Government 2011-2016, the Government committed to developing a universal, single-tier health service which guarantees access to medical care based on need, not income.  On foot of this commitment, the Government will introduce a system of universal health insurance.  A key stepping stone to the new system will be to develop independent, not-for-profit hospital trusts, in which all hospitals will function as part of integrated groups.  As a first step on that journey, these groups will be formed on an administrative basis.  It is envisaged that this will take place from early 2013 onwards, with groups being constituted and becoming operational as soon as is feasible, depending on their readiness and capacity to do so.  Groups will be established on the clear understanding that the groupings and their governance arrangements will be reviewed prior to 2015, to ensure an appropriate environment for the introduction of universal health insurance.<\/p><p>The rationale behind the establishment of hospital groups and trusts is to support increased operational autonomy and accountability for hospital services in a way that will drive service reforms and provide the maximum possible benefit to patients.  Each group will have a single consolidated management team with responsibility for performance and outcomes.  It is intended that non-executive boards, consisting of representative experts, will oversee each hospital group management team and will have responsibility for decisions in relation to services in all hospitals in the group.<\/p><p>In June this year I appointed Professor John Higgins to chair a strategic board on the establishment of hospital groups.  Professor Higgins is head of the college of medicine and health at University College Cork.  He has a deep interest in organisational reform and change management.  He was the director of the reconfiguration of the health system in Cork and Kerry from 2009 to 2011 and he remains chair of the reconfiguration forum there.  The strategic board has representatives with both national and international expertise in health service delivery, governance and linkages with academic institutions.  On the advice of Professor Higgins, a project team was established to support the strategic board, consisting of Professor Higgins and the team who were previously engaged in the reconfiguration process in the south, as well as members of the special delivery unit and acute hospitals section of my own Department.  <\/p><p>The project team is tasked with making recommendations to the strategic board on the composition of hospital groups, governance arrangements, current management frameworks and linkages to academic institutions.  In order to be in a position to do this they carried out a comprehensive consultation process with all acute hospitals and other health service agencies.  In carrying out this work, use has been made of video conferencing and meetings have been scheduled to coincide with the presence of international representatives in Ireland, in order to minimise costs.<\/p><p>The consultation process included two days of meetings with the hospitals in the south east, on 9 July and again in October.  A significant number of submissions, including one from representatives of the south east, have also been received by the team.  Work is ongoing on finalising a draft report on the recommendations for submission to the strategic board for consideration when it meets at the end of this month.  When the board has signed off on this report it will be submitted to me and I will then bring it to Cabinet.<\/p><p>I assure Senators that in many areas the hospital groups can be described as marriages made in heaven, but in other areas, they are more difficult.  I am aware that the issue of a hospital group in the south east is causing great concern to people in Waterford, Wexford, south Tipperary and Kilkenny.  The rationale behind these groups is that we do not have the management expertise to cover the 49 hospitals individually but by having hospital groups, we will be able to get the expertise necessary to turn our hospitals around, as has been done in Galway and is being done in Limerick.  We can certainly do it with between eight and ten managers and we can grow new management beneath them.  The group system will also give local autonomy.<\/p><p>Recommendations will be made and a discussion will be had at Cabinet but the hospital groups will not necessarily be permanent.  If it transpires that a group which looked like it would work at the outset does not work, there will be another opportunity to realign hospitals before the actual hospital trusts are formed.  I hope that gives reassurance to people who might be concerned about this.  We are still listening to and consulting with people and the draft report has not been presented to me yet.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700044#TT00200","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1350490500,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I have no difficulty whatsoever with hospital networks and agree they are necessary, based on the rationale outlined by the Minister, in terms of getting managerial expertise across a network of hospitals.

In that context, if it is not broken, why fix it?  What we need to do is develop capacity in the region and not see a situation where there is a realignment, even if it is on a temporary basis, of Waterford with Cork rather than the more natural regional alignment which prevails at present, with the existing clinical network teams.  That is the argument of the consultants from Waterford and across the south east.  I ask the Minister to be conscious of that when recommendations are made.

It has always been a mystery to me that this is the case, given that we have some of the best doctors, nurses and managers in the world in our health service.  Clearly, what is needed is a reorganisation of the system to make it a service for patients, which is the core of this.  That is the outcome we seek.  We want to see better outcomes for patients.

I predicted that problems would arise with the centralisation of the medical card system to the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, in Finglas.  I cannot blame the Government for the centralisation decision because it was made by its predecessor.  <\/p><p>The medical card guidelines are often interpreted differently by the PCRS than under the old, locally based system.  For example, car loans were allowed to be considered under the previous medical card guidelines where a certificate could be produced to show a medical need to have a car.  The guidelines state the HSE must have regard to a person's overall financial position.  They do not refer to car loans, but the practice was to take them into account in cases of medical hardship.  They permit home improvement loans to be considered, but there could be a situation where a woman decides to upgrade to a modern kitchen that she may not need because it looks nicer.  Such a loan would be allowed to be considered, but people need their cars to get to work.  A car is not a luxury in such circumstances.  Many double income families own two cars and most of them have car loans.  Furthermore, where a family relies on two cars to travel to work in different directions, an allowance of \u20ac50 per car should be taken into account.  In most cases, however, the PCRS is only allowing for one car.<\/p><p>The PCRS is also interpreting child care costs differently.  The guidelines state outgoings on child care are allowable, provided they are necessarily incurred in taking up or continuing in employment or education and training, or in providing family supports.  Appropriate documentary evidence is required to ensure the costs claimed are reasonable and being incurred.  The medical card application form asks for the name and address of the child's creche or childminder.  Previously, if a neighbour or friend looked after the children, it was acceptable for him or her to state in a letter how much he or she was being paid.  However, the PCRS will only accept such letters from registered childminders, even though the guidelines are silent on this issue.<\/p><p>As a Senator, I am doing as much work on medical cards as I did during my 28 years as a community welfare officer because of all the problems that have arisen.  An individual who was refused a medical card was recently referred to me for advice.  He brought his income calculation sheet to our meeting, but he had only studied the first page, which stated he was not entitled to a medical card because he was over the limit.  I asked him to show me his P60 which indicated that he had earned \u20ac19,500.

It represents an increase of approximately 500,000 since the end of 2008.  It is expected that the provision of GP services and prescription drugs under the general medical services scheme will cost almost \u20ac2 billion in 2012.  We have already issued a further 35,000 medical cards this year than we had budgeted for.<\/p><p>Under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, medical cards are provided for persons who, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive, are unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.  Under the legislation, determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE.  The assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including income and reasonable expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  The HSE has produced national assessment guidelines to provide a clear framework to assist in the making of reasonable, consistent and equitable decisions when assessing an applicant under the general medical services scheme.  The guidelines are publicly available and can be downloaded from the HSE's medical card website.<\/p><p>There is no automatic entitlement under the 1970 Act to a medical card on the basis of a specific illness.  However, there is provision for discretion for the HSE to grant a medical card in cases of undue hardship where the income guidelines are exceeded.  The HSE has set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances.  It has also established a specific system for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally or seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care which they cannot afford.  These emergency medical cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or medical consultant.  This system is initiated through the local health office by the office manager.<\/p><p>Every year the HSE processes in excess of 500,000 applications for medical cards and GP visit cards.  It centralised the processing of all medical card applications and renewals at the its primary care reimbursement service with effect from 1 July 2011.  This established a single uniform system of assessment for all applicants to replace the various systems which previously operated through more than 100 local offices across the country.  I am aware that difficulties with the centralisation project gave rise to a large backlog and long delays for both new applicants and those seeking medical card renewals earlier this year.  However, the HSE has taken a range of actions which completely eliminated the backlog of almost 58,000 applications from earlier this year and confirmed that over 95% of complete medical card applications and renewal forms are now being processed within 15 working days.  It has also implemented a range of changes to the application procedures which have improved the process for applicants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700045#UU00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1350491100,"counter":451,"content":"<p>I do not doubt that the person who wrote the Minister's response has five years of experience in dealing with health related matters, but I have 28.

I understand this is not the Minister's area, but I presume he has been provided with a response on it.  In the past three weeks I have been in contact with two people who have dropped out of college.  In one case the person came to Ireland with parents who had been recruited by the health service to work in an Irish hospital.  The mother, a maternity nurse, was recruited from the Philippines when there was a shortage of maternity nurses and her entire family came here with her.  Her daughter spent a full five or six years in secondary school here and also spent some time in primary school here and got her leaving certificate.  The mother got citizenship, but the daughter could not apply for citizenship until her mother had got hers.  She got her leaving certificate and a place in university, but then found out that she does not qualify for a grant for attending university.  Her mother has been paying income tax in this country for the past eight or nine years.<\/p><p>The second case is similar.  The person in this case has been paying income tax since 2001.  This student has done two years in university and has had to pay full fees.  The student does not have citizenship, but she is not receiving the student grant for attending university, although both parents have been paying income tax for eight or nine years.  <\/p><p>I seek clarification with regard to how these cases are dealt with.  It appears to me that these students are being penalised even though their parents have been paying tax in this country and have contributed to the country.  In the first case, the parent has made a huge contribution in the health care sector during a time when there was a shortage, but now despite the work she has done and the taxes she has paid, her family is being penalised.  Can I have clarification on this matter? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700046#VV00200","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1350491700,"counter":456,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Burke for raising this important matter which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills.<\/p><p>Under the terms of the student grant scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those which relate to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.  The nationality requirements for the student grant scheme are set out in section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011 and regulation 5 of the Student Support Regulations 2012.<\/p><p>The nationality rules require that the student be an Irish, EU, EEA or Swiss national.  There are a number of exceptions to this requirement.  A person who holds refugee status or the rights and privileges as specified in section 3 of the Refugee Act 1996, or holds subsidiary protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006, meets the nationality requirement.  In addition, a person who holds one of the prescribed immigration status as provided for in the Student Support Regulations 2012 may also meet the nationality requirement.  These include permission to remain as the family member of a European Union, EEA or Swiss citizen under the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2006 and 2008 and EU directive and also permission to remain on the basis of marriage or civil partnership with an Irish national resident in the State or as the dependent child of such person.  A person who has humanitarian leave to remain granted before the Immigration Act 1999 came into effect or permission to remain in Ireland following a decision not to deport a person under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, also meets the nationality requirements.<\/p><p>In all cases, to qualify for a student grant, it is the grant applicant and not his or her parents who must meet the nationality or prescribed immigration status requirements in his or her own right.  The onus is on the grant applicant to provide the necessary documentary evidence as proof of his or her nationality or immigration status to the relevant grant awarding authority.<\/p><p>Article 32 of the student grant scheme 2012 provides for the review of eligibility for the award of a grant in the event of changes of circumstances in the academic year, including a change in relation to a student's nationality or immigration status.  This means that where a student acquires Irish citizenship by naturalisation or acquires a prescribed immigration status during the course of his or her studies, he or she may make an application in the academic year for a student grant.  This is done under the change in circumstances provision.  He or she may also under this provision re-apply for a student grant if he or she has previously been refused a grant on nationality grounds.  In both cases students may qualify for a student grant from that point, subject to meeting all other terms and conditions of the student grant scheme.<\/p><p>The Minister for Education and Skills has asked his Department to examine the overall issue of the entitlement of non-EU families to third level fees and grants generally and he is currently considering the matter to ensure that there is clarity as to precise entitlements in this complex area.  Any decision on changes to the student grant scheme, including changes to eligibility criteria, will need to be considered in the context of availability of resources.<\/p><p>Other supports available to students include the student assistance fund, which will continue to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial need.  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education, including approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU member states and in non-EU countries.  Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700046#VV00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1350491700,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I notice the last paragraph on the first page of the Minister's response does not correspond with the decision by the University of Limerick with regard to the grant applicant.

I thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, for coming to the House to respond on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on the need for that Minister to confirm the approval of a loan to Roscommon County Council for the development of new civic offices in Roscommon town and to verify the date the original application was made for this loan, the amount sought and when the application was previously approved.  Furthermore, I seek confirmation of when the approval of the loan was made by him as Minister, the amount sought, the terms and conditions and date sanctioned.<\/p><p>For some years, Roscommon County Council has been planning the redevelopment of its offices in Roscommon town, where it needs new centralised civic offices.  The preparatory work has been going on some time.<\/p> <p>As a former member of Roscommon County Council, I supported the processing of the loan by the previous Government.  My colleague, Michael Finneran, who was a Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government at the time was extremely helpful in ensuring approval of Roscommon County Council's application for the loan in order that the work could be carried out.  We relocated the fire service to Circular Road in Roscommon town after a site there was made available.  We removed temporary prefabricated buildings which had been used by the former Western Health Board.  As a result, the site is very compact.  <\/p><p>The development of these offices to accommodate approximately 250 staff would result in the centralisation of the services of Roscommon County Council in Roscommon town.  In the light of new developments in local government, it is important that we retain that type of facility in Roscommon town to service the county.  Roscommon town has had council offices since the 1800s.  Roscommon courthouse was the centre for the services and senior staff now have offices there.  However, the courthouse needs to be refurbished to facilitate sittings of the District Court, the Circuit Court and the High Court in circuit.  The children and family courts are also very important.  All of these consultations are taking place in the foyer of the building, which is totally unsatisfactory.  The Courts Service will have further additional responsibilities relating to the care of children if the children's rights referendum is passed on 10 November.  It is important for proper facilities to be provided, as the existing services are not suitable.  The provision of new offices for Roscommon County Council would allow the courthouse to be used exclusively for court services, as originally intended.  <\/p><p>We are fortunate to have the headquarters of the Roscommon-Longford division of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na in Roscommon town.  We are also extremely fortunate that the General Register Office and the Property Registration Authority have been decentralised to the county town.  It has been said there is spare capacity in these buildings.  The Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na is moving some of its facilities to the General Register Office, while the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is moving some of its services to the Property Registration Authority.  The Government is ensuring all State services will be combined in suitable buildings.  If those buildings are environmentally designed with proper heating and lighting facilities, there will be a reduction in costs in the long term.  The council is paying an enormous amount in rent.  It would be far more desirable to have these rents put towards a loan.  I hope the Minister will be the bearer of good news on this occasion.  <\/p><p>This issue has created controversy in Roscommon.  Very few country towns would decline a loan to build new civic offices.  It is unique.  As the Minister knows, we have been campaigning for services at Roscommon County Hospital.  In this case, some people are campaigning for a decision to be made to refuse permission for this building to proceed.  It is ironic that the Minister is here to deliver good news for the people of Roscommon on this occasion.  I am sure they will be waiting with bated breath to hear his response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2012101700046#VV00700","speaker":"1140","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1350492300,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I am responding to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, who is not available.  I thank the Senator for raising it.  <\/p><p>Local authority office accommodation is a matter, in the first instance, for local authorities.  However, they are expected to provide such accommodation in the most cost-effective manner possible, having regard to their needs and resources, a point the Senator has made clearly.  In that context, future plans for the council office in Roscommon are a matter for Roscommon County Council, essentially, based on its assessment of the position.<\/p><p>A formal application to borrow \u20ac26 million was submitted to the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in October 2007.  As the Senator pointed out, approval for the loan was granted in April 2008.  A revised application to borrow \u20ac22 million for the project was submitted in January 2010 and approved on 19 March that year, in accordance with section 106 of the Local Government Act 2001.  Sanction was provided subject to the council being satisfied that it was receiving the best possible terms available, making sufficient provision in its annual budgets for the repayment of the loan charges over the repayment period and being satisfied that the financing of the project would not adversely affect the provision of council services during the repayment period.  I am sure we would all be very strong on that point.<\/p><p>I am advised that the fragmentation of local authority offices in Roscommon at eight locations, just two of which are fully owned by the county council, causes operational inefficiencies, including the need for staff to spend time delivering files and post and attending meetings at various locations in the town.  There are additional indirect hidden costs to the council as a result.  I understand issues regarding health and safety, staff welfare, fire safety, disabled access and facilities for the public and elected members have necessitated the extension and refurbishment of the existing headquarters.  I understand Roscommon County Council has negotiated a loan of up to \u20ac22 million from the Housing Finance Agency over 40 years at a variable interest rate.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has completed the necessary steps at his end to allow the council to proceed with the work, in accordance with the conditions I have outlined.
