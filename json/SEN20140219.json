The Irish Postmasters Union has invited Deputies and Senators to a briefing later today.  More questions have arisen since yesterday and all these questions raise serious concerns about the future viability of the post office network.  The Government, through the Department of Social Protection and An Post, issued press statements in the past five to six week welcoming the signing of a new contract, which had gone out to tender.  Both An Post and the Department of Social Protection said this would ensure the continuing viability of the post office network.  However, while An Post has highlighted that the new contract will generate business worth billions for the post office network, the Department of Social Protection has made it clear it is moving toward e-commerce and electronic transfers of money.  Some 83% of the client base of the Department of Social Protection have bank accounts.  It costs little or nothing to transfer moneys to a bank account but I understand An Post charges the Department in excess of &euro;300,000 in administrative charges to cash social welfare cheques through the post office network.  Somebody is not telling the truth.  The Department of Social Protection has made it clear that the costs being imposed by An Post are prohibitive and expensive.  If that is the case, it means that 83% of the Department of Social Protection client base will in future receive their money through the banking sector and not the post office.  They will then cash their money through the banks and not the post office.  At present one is more likely to meet a machine than a cashier in banks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900003#B00500","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1392768000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900003#B00600","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1392768000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Can one image the chaos that will arise from this increased footfall?

KPMG was the auditor to the Irish Nationwide Building Society, and two of its former staff are the liquidators of IBRC.  I am concerned there is an apparent blatant conflict of interest.  I read yesterday evening that Mr. Justice Peter Kelly is equally concerned and he has joined them as a notice party in an action before the courts.  In regard to the question of residential mortgages, which my good friends opposite are concerned about and about which I am equally concerned, I do not think that is the business of IBRC.  There is some suggestion that &euro;200 million of loans will be floated and will be let go to NAMA.  I do not believe that is the business of NAMA.  I think the loans should be given to AIB or Bank of Ireland and the banks should work them out because they have the people to deal with it.  Of course, nobody should be dispossessed.  Anybody who is making an effort should be left in their homes, as to do otherwise would be disastrous for society.

I said to the ambassador that it was just as well it went that way because if we had snubbed the Japanese politicians they would probably all have had to commit hara-kiri.  We are much more relaxed about this sort of thing.

There has also been a lot of transactions in the public domain.  For example, Hibernia REIT has announced that it will buy part of the Ulster Bank's portfolio, at a very significant discount, that includes a large body of residential property.  We all know that there is a residential shortage in this country.  Therefore, I would like to see a lot more transparency on what is happening to the loan books of financial institutions, particularly the ones that the people of Ireland have bailed out in one way or another.<\/p><p>I wish to raise an issue related to mortgage arrears directly with the Minister for Finance.  I refer to the fact that there has been an increase in the number of repossessions.  The increase is particularly happening in urban Ireland, and in the Dublin region in particular.  There is a real issue for people who are in a marital breakdown situation.  I refer to people who are in the process of a marital breakdown or have experienced marital breakdown.  The bank will not deal with them as individuals but insists on dealing with them as a couple.  That effectively means that the mortgage arrears resolution process cannot and does not work.  I do not believe that we can ever more forward to resolve the mortgage arrears situation unless we deal with the reality of family breakdown.

It was in the newspapers today claiming credit for helping to draft the speech read by the Minister for Justice and Equality in the D&aacute;il last night.

A review that any of us could carry out if we simply conducted an Internet search or gathered the documents together.  It is completely worthless.<\/p><p>I want to ask the Deputy Leader the following question.  Why has a commission of investigation not been appointed regarding the matter?  Why has the Government not proposed that the Oireachtas would appoint one?  As the Taoiseach has said, no witnesses will be called, nothing is going to happen, there will be no powers of compellability.  Therefore, if someone does not tell the truth there will be no consequences and if the documentation is flawed or incomplete there will be no consequences.  The only way to get to the bottom of the issue is through a commission of investigation.  I am certain that if the Labour Party Members were on this side of the House they would be the main people pushing for an investigation.  This matter must be very embarrassing for them.  It was outrageous last night that the Minister prejudged the outcome.  It was more outrageous on Monday when the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality demanded that the GSOC, a statutory and independent body, be dragged into the Oireachtas and be dragged into the Minister's office.<\/p><p>The committee hearings that are taking place with the GSOC - I will participate in one today - should not have happened.  The GSOC should not have had to explain the matter to the Oireachtas.  It is not required to do so under Statute but is required to report on certain things such as financial and administrative matters.  The GSOC must be independent.

This year the German taxpayer will subsidise the wind industry in Germany to the tune of &euro;23 billion.  That is not small change by any standards, even for the Germans.

Yesterday, as part of an ongoing propaganda process, Sustainable Energy Ireland published a report that is r&aacute;im&eacute;is masquerading as a report that is really propaganda driven by wind energy developers.

We have all been calling for that debate to happen in this House over recent weeks and months.  There is a bizarre situation where we have a Minister with responsibility for this area who is not listening to public representatives in government or opposition.  He is not listening to communities in regard to their fears about industrial wind farms which are essentially set up, if we are to be honest about it, to make profit for a small number of individuals and will not be serving the best needs or interests of the Irish people and Irish citizens.  The power that is generated will most likely be exported and will not be used in this State at all.  That is not on.<\/p><p>With regard to the high voltage power lines and EirGrid's plans to proceed with the Grid West project and the North-South interconnector, the Minister put in place a commission which he tells us is going to look at the costs and benefits of putting the high voltage power lines underground.  However, we know the commission is going to be asked to look at evidence and an analysis of undergrounding by EirGrid, when its position on this is very clear, namely, it has been against undergrounding from the outset.  As recently as last month, the CEO of EirGrid was before one of the Oireachtas committees, where he again repeated that undergrounding was simply not an option in his mind.  Yet, this commission has been set up which is going to look at analyses and studies carried out by an organisation which has its mind made up a long time ago on this issue.  We need to take a step back and rethink this but that is not going to be possible if the Minister himself continues with what I see as a very arrogant approach of not listening to people within his own party, within the Opposition and in communities throughout the country who will be affected by this.<\/p><p>I would go further.  If one looks at what is happening in my own county of Waterford, where we are planning to put these unsightly pylons of up to 45 m in height through the beautiful heart of the Comeragh Mountains, it is an act of vandalism for that to be happening.  For the Minister to simply dismiss the concerns of all involved is regrettable.

The authorities in America have taken an alternative view and have referred to the validity of the currency and the fact that it is being used to facilitate certain underground transactions.

I am not stating that Bitcoin is bad and it could certainly be good in the context of facilitating transactions online.  Ireland is a high-tech country.

Such a debate should be open-ended and people should be open-minded in respect of it.  We do not have all the answers and it is not possible for us to become experts overnight on the pros and cons of wind, wave, fracking or other methods of producing energy.  We must all agree, however, that in order for our country and its economy to grow, thrive and succeed in the long term, we must obtain access to the cheapest sources of energy.  That issue must be placed at the very core of the debate on this matter.  The strong economies of Europe have access to much cheaper sources of energy than Ireland.  It is very difficult, therefore, for the various industries involved in job creation to compete in view of the current level of energy costs.  That matter must also be placed at the core of the debate.<\/p><p>Will the Deputy Leader comment on the ongoing saga involving the GSOC?  We are now well into the second week of the latter.  Yesterday, the Minister for Justice and Equality announced that a retired High Court judge is going to take charge of some type of review into this matter.  He also advised that he will publish the terms of reference of that review shortly.  I ask the Deputy Leader to ensure that those terms of reference be debated and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If the review's terms of reference are not widely supported across the Oireachtas, we will again be setting out on a journey towards an unknown destination.  This House and the Lower House should engage in a calm debate on those terms of reference.  If people feel that the latter should be amended, then they should be given the opportunity to say so.  If a debate such as that to which I refer were facilitated, it would show goodwill on the part of the Minister to try to bring about a satisfactory conclusion to this almost two-week old saga.  I request that the terms of reference be brought before both Houses - for debate and approval - when they are published.  The Deputy Leader is far more expert in legal matters than I am but I am of the view that there is precedent for reviews such as that in question having their terms of reference approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900008#G00400","speaker":"1121"},{"type":"speech","time":1392771000,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I wish to seek clarification from the Government side with regard to an issue relating to the Order of Business for the next week or so.

Most people - not everyone - broadly welcomed the fact that an independent review is being established.  Many individuals sought such a review.  I recently criticised the Government's handling of this matter on radio.  Many of us were concerned with regard to the drip-feeding of information from different sources as to what actually occurred and, in particular, the very recent information which emerged in respect of the technical findings contained in the Verrimus report.  We are all operating in the dark because we have not seen that report or the letter of clarification provided by GSOC to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, on Friday last in respect of his request for clarification.  The Minister will be appearing before the Joint Committee on Public Oversight and Petitions later today, a development I very much welcome.  It is important that a committee of these Houses should hear directly from him as to the sequence of events relating to this matter and why the relevant information did not emerge more quickly.  It will also be useful, however, to have a review carried out by a retired judge.  A number of names have been circulated in that regard.  It is essential and extremely important that there should be a clarification as to the sequence of events with regard to exactly what happened in this case and that the drip-feeding of information should cease.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney also sought a debate on the viability of the post office network.  He referred to the briefing to be held later for Oireachtas Members and his concerns with regard to the use of An Post's facilities for electronic fund transfers.  The Senator is seeking a debate with the Minister for Social Protection on this matter today.  I cannot accept his amendment to the Order of Business.  I would be happy to ask the Leader's office to arrange a debate on the viability of post offices.  Having sought a briefing on the matter, I know the Government is committed to sustaining a strong and viable An Post and supports the maintenance of the maximum number of economically viable post offices.  Ireland has one of the most extensive networks of post offices per head of population in Europe.  There are 1,145 post offices and 141 postal agents.  Some 65% of post offices are in rural areas and we are all aware of their huge importance to communities.  I grew up in a small village in Cork and I distinctly recall the enormous role the post office there played in people's lives in the context of facilitating telephone calls through its exchange, postal deliveries, etc.<\/p><p>As a commercial State body, An Post faces a challenge.  Mail volumes have fallen by 25% in the past five years.  We are witnessing a real challenge to the traditional business of post offices.<\/p> <p>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications produced a report on the sustainable future of the post office network in March 2013.  I do not think we had a debate on that report, but I will check.  If not, we could have a debate on the report and address many of the issues raised by colleagues.  An Post is now bidding for other business, given the fall in mail volumes.  For example, the local property tax is paid via An Post outlets, and An Post has been selected by the Department of Social Protection, following competitive tender, to provide over-the-counter cash services to social welfare recipients.  I understand that it will pitch strongly for the e-payment of social welfare from the Department.  That has not yet been allocated.<\/p><p>The closure of individual post offices is a matter for the board of An Post.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Minister for Social Protection do not have a direct role in that, but I have set out Government policy as far as An Post is concerned and the position in which the company finds itself.  However, I cannot accept the amendment today.<\/p><p>Senator Coghlan agreed on the welcome review of the GSOC controversy and rightly pointed out that it will take this issue out of the political arena, although I think the Oireachtas committee hearing is important today.  The Senator also raised a concern about the liquidators of IBRC and a potential conflict of interest.  I understand there is a case currently before the courts on this, so perhaps I will not comment any further on it other than to note the Senator's comments.<\/p><p>I am always happy to agree with my friend and colleague, Senator Norris, and to agree in particular that we are lucky to live in a wonderful country, especially on such a lovely sunny day.  His comments on Java Republic made me think that it is time for us all to wake up and smell the coffee.  He also mentioned the bugging of his own telephone in the 1980s.  I seem to remember in the 1980s it was a badge of honour for all of us to have our phones bugged.  We had our phones bugged in the Trinity College Students' Union, and we used to boast about it.  Sadly, I cannot agree with the Senator's comment that the review is a waste of time.  I think it will be very helpful to have an independent adjudicator come in and make sense of the myriad of different allegations, including the serious allegations of bugging at GSOC.  The big question is whether GSOC was bugged and, if so, by whom.  We still do not have an answer to that critical question and it is very important we get that.  An independent review is the way to do it.<\/p><p>Senator Norris also referred to the debate on homophobia and free speech last night.  I commend Senator Zappone on taking the initiative on it, which we all supported.  I was very proud to second the motion she put forward.  I thought it was an excellent debate.  I thought the comments of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, were also really important because he focused on the need to address the so-called 50-50 rule in the lead-up to a referendum debate on marriage equality next year.  It is good that we have that debate now and that he invited the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to look again at how that 50-50 rule is being implemented in practice.  There is a question as to whether it is a rule that binds broadcasters.  That was a very useful debate, and I am sorry that Senator Mullen was not here to listen to it and to the Minister's response in particular.<\/p><p>I had no knowledge in advance of the visit by Senators and one Deputy to Japan.

I made queries internally within the party as to how the invitation was processed.  It is not an invitation I would have wanted myself, but I wanted to see the process and I understand it came through the Whip's office.

I understand from Senator Keane that while there was a full discussion of this on the agenda of the environment committee, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland was not before it.  Perhaps the committee should calls its representatives in, given what has been said by colleagues, but certainly I will seek a debate on wind energy and energy policy in this House.  We will seek to pursue further a debate on the Bill proposed by Senator Kelly on behalf of the Labour Party in the Seanad, which passed Second Stage.  I think a number of others raised issues about that Bill.  I know the Leader's office is actively pursuing Private Members' Bills that have passed Second Stage in the Seanad and which we want to see continue through the Seanad and then into the D&aacute;il, because we do not want to see these Bills hanging on forever.  We are trying to pursue that.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett is also seeking a debate on energy policy.  He also referred to comments by Mr. Barroso concerning the future of an independent Scotland.  I agree entirely with Senator Barrett that matters on domestic referendums should be left to the people, so in Scotland they should be left to the people of Scotland.  In our experience in Ireland, it has not been helpful for senior EU figures to intervene in any referendum campaign.  I could not comment on that, other than to say that as a person of Czech descent, I regret the division of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, but it was very important that they enter the EU as separate, independent countries.<\/p><p>Senator Kelly referred to his own Bill on wind energy and, as I said, we need to hasten the progress of that Bill and other Private Members' Bills before the House.  I am also seeking a question on the conflict of interest.  The environment committee might be more appropriate.  Representatives of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland could be brought before the committee and questioned by Oireachtas Members.  While we can have a useful debate with the Minister on energy policy, it would also be important that the very specific issues raised by Senators Whelan, Kelly and others would be addressed before an Oireachtas committee, with a to and fro between witnesses and committee members.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke about the Magdalen laundries.  I agree with him that delays are regrettable in the process of securing redress for the survivors of the laundries.  I know that progress has been made, and the Senator accepts that himself, but clearly it needs to be pursued further.  I will write to the relevant Department - I think it is the Department of Justice and Equality - and I suggest the Senator does the same in order to get more rapid progress.<\/p><p>Senator Comiskey spoke about the need to build up rural post offices, and I dealt with that matter.<\/p><p>Senator MacSharry seconded the amendment to the Order of Business and also called for a debate on mortgage arrears and repossessions.  I hope we will have that next week, if we get confirmation from the Minister for Finance.  Senator Conway spoke about the wind energy debate and also referred to the fact that some banks do not take coin lodgements on particular dates.  I do not think this is only an issue in rural Ireland.  The Dame Street branch of Bank of Ireland is quite limited in some of the functions it carries out.  For example, international transfers of money now have to be done online.  This is a general issue on which we could have a debate.<\/p><p>Senator Mullen called for a debate on wind energy and referred to the effect of pylons on thoroughbred horse breeding.  We had a debate on pylons in this House recently with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, but I will seek the debate on energy, as I have said.<\/p><p>Senator Burke raised the issue of the cost of drugs and the seeming delay in any impact from the important legislation passed some months ago which provided for the prescription of generic medicines.  I agree entirely that it seems extraordinary that there has not been more progress.  I know there has been some progress, with reports of some chemists offering generic drugs as a general rule, and these are much more cost effective.  Senator Burke also raised the issue of the GP contract.  We received a briefing recently from the Minister of State, Deputy White, at a Labour Party conference.  He published the draft contract with GPs, which was developed by the Department of Health and the HSE for the very important aim that all children aged under six will now be able to access GP services for free.  That will mean an additional 240,000 children by this summer.  It is a wonderful development and this Government can be very proud of it.  The draft contract has been placed online in the interests of transparency, so that everyone can see it and so that people can input into it.  The Minister of State has met with representatives of the IMO and the Irish College of General Practitioners.  There is ongoing consultation concerning the terms of the contract and it is premature to see any particular clause within it as being set in stone, as Senator Crown said.<\/p> <p>I emphasise that and the Minister of State, Deputy White, has also emphasised it.

Again, this is a hugely important development to strengthen primary care and keep people out of hospitals and acute services where possible.  The contract will also be more comprehensive than the existing GMS contract, which is, again, very welcome.  It will cover prevention and health promotion as well as diagnosis and treatment.  There is a range of other terms and conditions.  Somebody said it was a 40-page contract.  It proposes a defined contract duration of five years with extension for further periods of five years.  There is a great deal in it and there is ongoing discussion and consultation with the doctors' representatives.  We can certainly ask the Minister of State to come to the House to brief us or debate with us developments in primary care.  I understand he did so relatively recently and I am sure he would be happy to do so again.<\/p><p>Senator Healy Eames spoke about the GSOC issue and raised a separate issue regarding the projected sale of IBRC mortgages.  I gave a very full answer on that question yesterday, which was raised by a number of people who had very real concerns about the 13,000 persons who could be affected by this - concerns I share.  As I explained yesterday, the sale has not yet been made.  NAMA is one of the bodies to whom the business may be sold.  It is expected that the code of conduct will be adhered to by whoever buys it.  I gave a full answer yesterday and the Senator can look at it on the record.  <\/p><p>Senator Landy again raised the issue of wind energy and sought a debate on the future of wind energy.  I will seek that as a matter of urgency and will pursue the Bill sponsored by Senator Kelly.  Senator Quinn sought a debate on fracking.  Perhaps a debate on the future of energy policy more generally would be appropriate so that we could encompass that because I take Senator Quinn's point that sometimes we come to these things with preconceived notions and it is useful to have a fuller debate on issues like fracking and wind energy.  Senator Quinn also spoke about generic drugs and the difficulty with the seeming delay in the implementation of that new legislation in pharmacies.  <\/p><p>Senator Mullins spoke about wind energy and banking and welcomed the retrofitting of local authority homes, which we all very much welcome.  Senator Cullinane sought a debate on energy policy and pylons.  We had a debate quite recently with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on pylons.  I understand it was just before Christmas.  <\/p><p>Senator Keane very helpfully spoke about the hearing of the Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government yesterday.  She also raised the issue of Bitcoins and the new developments in the US.  It is of huge interest.  I attended a conference on white-collar crime recently where senior Europol figures and garda&iacute; expressed real concern about the potential for criminality, for example, the silk road and the use of Bitcoins to assist in white-collar crime and organised crime generally.  It is interesting to see that the US has gone down the road of regulation rather than simply seeing Bitcoin as something to be rejected out of hand as a way of pursuing criminality.  I agree with Senator Keane that we need to look at taking a similar approach to that in the US and to look at how we regulate the use of Bitcoin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900010#J00500","speaker":"1148"},{"type":"speech","time":1392772200,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I said we should take an approach similar to that used in Germany.

I am aware that many Senators are teachers.  We know from several international studies that teacher quality is the critical factor in improving educational outcomes.  The role of a regulatory body in enhancing teacher quality is, therefore, a valuable area for public discussion.  In light of the recent enactment of section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001 and my recent proposals to enhance the &quot;fitness to practice&quot; element of that legislation, this debate is particularly timely.<\/p><p>  Let us turn to the background of this situation and the question of what the Teaching Council is.  The council was established in March 2006 after the passage of the 2001 Act.  It is charged with regulating the teaching profession and the professional conduct of teachers; establishing and promoting standards of teacher education, the knowledge and competence required of teachers and their professional conduct; and promoting continuing professional development for teachers.  The council comprises 37 members, of whom 22 are either directly elected teachers or nominated by teacher trade unions.  The council is a key agency in supporting my Department's strategic objectives and in contributing to the Government's education programme.  In particular, the council's work advances Government priorities in respect of recruiting, training and supporting the highest calibre of teachers and as a driver for the reform of teacher education.<\/p><p>  Ireland has been fortunate in the quality of its teachers.  This is due in no small measure to the supportive role of the State in teacher education.  It is accepted that education is a public good.  The State, through the Government, the profession itself and the Teaching Council, recognises and accepts responsibility for the ongoing development of teachers as life-long learners supporting their students.<\/p> <p>Full implementation of the Teaching Council Act will support a cohesive framework of teacher education, professionalism and registration based on quality inputs across the whole continuum of teacher education.  I plan to commence the critically important remaining sections within the next two years.  <\/p><p>I will now deal with what we are trying to achieve, namely, a regulated profession.  I recently signed the commencement orders giving effect to section 30 of the Teaching Council Act and related regulations.  This is a historic time.  For the first time in the history of the State, to be paid from State funds all teachers working in recognised schools must since 28 January last be registered with the Teaching Council.  When I say &quot;recognised schools&quot; I am speaking of 99.9% of all primary and secondary schools in this State.  This has been a long time coming.  In truth, far too long.  <\/p><p>It is no mean achievement that there are now 87,000 teachers on the Teaching Council's register.  I take this opportunity to put on record my appreciation of the efforts made by the council and its staff to process the large volumes of applications in the lead-in period.  The co-operation of the Garda Central Vetting Unit and the teachers' payroll section of my Department and the Education and Training Boards of Ireland, ETBI, should also be acknowledged.  This move also paves the way for the commencement of the remaining functions of the council as provided for in the Act, which relate to fitness to teach and professional development.<\/p><p>It is essential that there is a robust system of regulation in place for the teaching profession.  The role of the Teaching Council is key to ensuring the development and implementation of standards for teachers' conduct and performance, which complements the work of initial and continuing teacher training.  Much progress has been made by the council as reports placed before the Houses illustrate.  The setting of fees, while subject to ministerial consent, is a matter for the council in the first instance.  The current initial registration fee of &euro;90 is significantly lower than registration fees charged by many other professional regulatory bodies.  The council has reduced its renewal fee to &euro;65 per annum.<\/p><p>Entry to the Teaching Council register is governed by a cohesive and coherent set of regulations which set out the qualifications required to become a recognised teacher.  The council is currently working on revising these regulations to reflect recent developments, such as changes to the entry criteria for certain programmes of initial teacher education and changes to the council's legislation with regard to registration renewal.  Along with the qualifications requirements, the council has in place a robust professional standards framework to ensure appropriate standards of competence and conduct throughout a teacher's career.  Given the education system reaches into virtually every home in the country, and affects so many so deeply, it is crucial that the teaching profession's value system and professional standards are clear for all.<\/p><p>The code of professional conduct for teachers sets out standards of professional knowledge, skill, competence and conduct which reflect the complexity and variety of teaching.  It covers areas such as communication and relationships, equality and inclusion, compliance with national and school policies, professional development and pupil-student welfare.  The standards are underpinned by the four core values of respect, care, integrity and trust.  Teachers are required to know and uphold the core values and professional commitments which are set out in the code.<\/p><p>As Members of this House will be aware, I recently announced the Government's intention to publish legislation which will amend the fitness to teach provisions of the 2001 Act to bring them into line with current practice in the regulatory area.  It is clear from the reaction to that announcement that there will be intense interest in this area.  Fitness to teach will be about reassuring the public and the profession, by dealing with cases where a complaint has been made about a teacher's professional misconduct, poor practice, or with cases where medical fitness impacts on a teacher's ability to teach.  It will do this in the cases of teachers who are found to be falling short of the required standard by finding ways of helping them to address difficulties.  This will be done with the aim of improving the quality of teaching and learning for pupils and teachers alike.  In serious cases, where a teacher does not demonstrate a capacity or willingness to improve, or the subject matter of the complaint is deemed to be sufficiently serious, suspension or removal from the register will be an available sanction.  It is important to note that the Teaching Council's fitness to teach role will not replace the responsibility at school level in the first instance for the resolution of complaints.  The council will have the power to hear a complaint where it believes the case so warrants.<\/p><p>Protection of pupils-students attending our schools is a major priority of the Government and my Department.  Since the introduction in September 2006 of the arrangements for Garda vetting of school staff, the Teaching Council has undertaken a very important role in the vetting arrangements for teachers.  The National Vetting Bureau Act, when commenced later this year, will place the vetting of persons working with children or vulnerable adults, including teachers, on a statutory basis.  My Department is currently engaging with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Office of the Attorney General in relation to the implementation of the Act in the education sector.  I also intend to bring forward Teaching Council legislation that will underpin the central role of the council in the vetting of teachers.<\/p><p>I will deal now with initial teacher education, ITE, which is the training of our teachers at primary and second level.  If we are serious about maintaining and enhancing the calibre of people who are entering the profession of teaching, we must look at the entry criteria for initial teacher education.  I have asked the Teaching Council for advice on the requirements for entry to programmes of teacher education.  The council carried out consultation in this area and research has also been commissioned.  In the interim, the council has produced a new set of criteria for registration on the basis of qualifications in post-primary subjects from 2017 onward.  The lead-in time and related communications are particularly important for students entering first and second year of their degrees as they will need to ensure that they choose the right modules if they wish to pursue a career in teaching.  The State has also made a conscious policy choice to ensure that ITE is research-informed and based in third level institutions.  This is in keeping with the best practices of education systems of other countries held in high regard.  While the council is not directly involved in implementing this policy its work will be supported by the restructuring currently underway.  This reform process is designed to ensure that programmes have explicit and clearly articulated sets of values underpinning them and that students are ready to meet the expected learning outcomes established by the council.  This is but one step in a process of empowering teachers to empower learners to meet the unknown challenges of the century to come.  The first graduates of reconceptualised programmes will emerge in 2016.<\/p><p>It is also worth noting that within the last 18 months, the provisions of the Teaching Council Act relating to its powers to set down the procedures for the induction and probation of new teachers have been commenced.  Initial teacher education is only one phase in what we hope will be a lifelong career for teachers.  Currently, the Teaching Council's pilot programme for induction and probation of newly qualified teachers, Droichead, is being implemented in over 50 schools, with this number is expected to increase.  This pilot is important.  It is about enhancing the quality of teaching beyond the period of initial teacher education.  It is about embedding ways of thinking, reflecting and improving that should stand to teachers for the rest of their careers.  It is about empowering teachers, within supportive school communities, to lead their own process of professional induction and development.<\/p><p>Engagement in ongoing continuous professional development is a key hallmark of any profession.  Put simply, teachers should always learn so that they can always teach.  This function of the Act has yet to be commenced but I intend to commence it during the lifetime of this Government.<\/p> <p>In the meantime it is heartening to know we have a strong culture of teachers engaging in self-directed CPD and that this is growing.  My Department also makes significant investment in CPD in a wide range of areas.  Current priorities include literacy and numeracy, school self-evaluation, special education, wellbeing and curricular reform including the junior cycle.<\/p><p>Regulating the profession, improving professional standards and encouraging professional learning among teachers are three of the primary functions of the Teaching Council of Ireland.  The council also works hard to promote teaching as a profession and to promote quality standards in teaching.  The council is keen to expand its role and the ways in which it reaches out to teachers.<\/p><p>A particular case in point is F&Eacute;ILTE, the Festival of Education in Learning and Teaching Excellence, which the council held to mark World Teachers' Day last October.  Teachers from all over the country came to Dublin, in their own time, to showcase their work in teaching and learning, to share it with their peers, and to learn from their peers.  It was a resounding success.  Planning is already under way for the next F&Eacute;ILTE, where it is intended to have increased capacity for teachers to attend and to open it to the public.<\/p><p>In order to support the process of lifelong learning for teachers, research is and will continue to be critical.  The council has been co-operating closely with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Centre for Effective Services on an initiative called Research Alive!  This will enhance connections between teachers, research and researchers in ways that make a real difference to the quality of teaching in our schools.<\/p><p>Teachers have called for more access to research and the council has provided all registered teachers with free access to the EBSCO education collection of online research.  The council also hopes to reactivate soon its research bursary scheme for action research in classrooms.<\/p><p>I have also asked the council to provide me with advice on the matter of teacher supply.  It is important that those considering embarking on a teaching career are aware of likely opportunities or limitations.  The council has been liaising closely with the officials in my Department.  We have no policy of measuring the labour market requirements for teachers coming into the system.  In addition we have no say over what kinds of teachers come out of the initial teacher education system.  For example, we do not have the ability - although it would be my intention to have it - to identify that we have a shortage of STEM teachers in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.<\/p><p>We cannot prescribe the priorities we would like to give the colleges.  We simply do not know and we take whatever teachers come out of the system.  Senators will recall that until very recently we did not even know how many qualified mathematics teachers we had.  That will change and I will be very interested to hear Members' comments on that.  We have more than 800,000 young people in the primary and post-primary system.  Any sane rational system looking at such a fixed cohort of young students should look at what labour force we need and what skillsets we require from those people and how we should achieve those outcomes without being too intrusive.<\/p><p>Quality of teaching has been determined as a critical influential factor towards improving educational outcomes for students.  The work of the council is focused on the maintenance and improvement of the teaching standards.  Notwithstanding the progress made to date, there are challenges ahead, including the further inculcation of the professional culture of teachers.  The council needs to become more relevant and meaningful to all teachers in their day-to-day work, putting into operation further functions including sound and robust fitness to teach procedures, and continuing professional development.  I look forward to working with the council on these and other matters and to discussing these further with Members of the Seanad today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900012#L00300","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392774000,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  As he has outlined, the Teaching Council of Ireland has a number of important functions, including to protect the standards of entry to the teaching profession; to advise the Minister on teacher supply; to promote teaching as a profession; to establish and maintain the register of teachers and to maintain and improve standards, professional practice and conduct.<\/p><p>In recent times there has been much discussion about the latter function since the Minister announced his intention to introduce legislation to give new powers to the Teaching Council of Ireland to deal with underperforming teachers, which I very much welcome.  I believe it is good news that parents will have an accessible and independent body to decide on complaints and to impose appropriate sanctions.  It is also good news for the majority of teachers who are good at their jobs.  They have nothing about which to worry and can only gain from enhanced faith in the profession and its ability to deal with problems where they arise.<\/p><p>While we have only a few details in advance of the publication of the legislation, the Minister has indicated there will be a range of options or sanctions, which is appropriate.  Until now the emphasis has been on dealing with problems when they become extreme and a decision needs to be made over whether a teacher is fit to be in the classroom at all.  All of us in our professions can encounter difficulties from time to time that affect performance, and teaching is no different.  People in all walks of life need to deal with personal difficulties such as bereavement or family and relationship issues that affect the quality of their work.  It is appropriate that in addition to disciplinary procedures we should also have the availability of counselling, support and other services to help people work through those difficulties.  Of course it will be also essential to have the right opportunities for people to reskill and to improve their teaching performance, and to ensure they are up to date with modern methods.<\/p><p>So far we like what we are hearing and we await the detail of the legislation.  Perhaps the Minister can give more details in his concluding speech.  He mentioned that the legislation is due to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas shortly.  Will it be before the summer recess with the intention of having a system in place for the next school year or will more preparatory work be needed?<\/p><p>There was some disquiet about the public hearings.  The INTO and ASTI have welcomed the initiative in general terms; the TUI has expressed concern about public hearings.  I believe we need public hearings if people are to have faith in the process.  It is not appropriate to have private discussions behind closed doors because there would not be public confidence in that.  They also need to be structured to ensure there are fair procedures.  I know the Minister has referred in the media and elsewhere to the Medical Council procedures and I ask him to outline more of the detail in that regard.<\/p><p>Getting away from the area of discipline, a key area that needs to be addressed is a broader performance management system for schools.  The 2008 OECD report into post-primary teaching found that the percentage of teachers in Ireland who had received an appraisal of their teaching or feedback from a principal was the lowest of the 24 countries reviewed.  We have never empowered principals to be educational leaders in the same way as managers in other professions.  I know this has been an ongoing issue for the IPPN and the NAPD.  They would like to see principals equipped with the time, resources and support to be real educational leaders and not just deal with administrative work or be worried about scheduling.  They need to be able to support their staff as professionals and to give them feedback on their work.  I hope the Minister will address that issue.<\/p><p>While I welcome the new system for dealing with underperformance, we should not just focus on that area.  We need to introduce a system where teachers are appraised systematically throughout their careers.  This would allow us not only to spot difficulties and have an early warning system for teachers in difficulty, but also to acknowledge and affirm good performance.  In any working environment it is essential that people get affirmation when they are doing a good job.  We need a more systematic and structured system for doing that.  Affirmation is always a highly motivating factor for employees and teachers are no different from the rest of us.  Everybody likes to get acknowledgement when he or she puts in the effort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900014#N00200","speaker":"1154"},{"type":"speech","time":1392774000,"counter":117,"content":"<p>We call them elections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900014#N00300","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1392774000,"counter":118,"content":"<p>That is true.<\/p><p>I welcome the developments that are taking place.  As the Minister mentioned, the council also has an important function in teacher education.<\/p> <p>The Minister adverted to several reforms that are under way.  I urge the Minister to ensure sufficient resources are put in place to deliver on these reforms effectively because that aspect is crucial.  We must ensure that teachers are given proper support at the initial teacher education stage but also in terms of continuous professional development throughout their careers.  This should apply not only in their subjects, but also for all the challenges they face in the modern-day classroom.  I appreciate that resources are tight but this is a critical area and I urge the Minister to ensure it is a priority.  If we are to get out of the difficulties that we have as a country, then we must focus on education, and the quality of our teachers is important in this regard.  However, they can only do as good a job as they are equipped to do.  I urge the Minister to prioritise this area.<\/p><p>The Minister referred to teacher supply.  Concerns have been raised by the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals in the past week about the serious shortage of teachers qualified to cope with increasing student levels at second level.  The NAPD director, Clive Byrne, has predicted an increase of 15%.  I realise the Department has been monitoring demographic data in recent years and has been tracking the increases coming through and planning for them.  Mr. Byrne has highlighted the fact that currently there is no relevant data on the types of teachers who will be retiring in the coming years and the subjects they teach.  The Minister has remarked on this absence as well.  I appreciate that the Teaching Council is working on this at the moment and preparing advice for him and I urge the Minister to give this priority.  I realise things have become a good deal better and that much work was done under the last Government and this Government on improving data.  We cannot run any system, whether in education or anywhere else, without proper data and planning.  I realise much work has been done but we must ensure we fix this part of the problem as well.  If changes have to be made to teacher education and if we have to consider introducing reserve places for teachers in certain subjects, then that is what we need to do.  We cannot simply assume that it will work out fine and that we will get enough.  We cannot assume that without putting quotas in place for subjects in higher diploma in education training that we will get enough people coming out who are capable of teaching mathematics, science or other key subjects.  It might not make everyone happy to have to examine this aspect of planning but we must get serious about finding the most effective system to ensure that we have properly qualified teachers across all subjects.  We must plan not only for next year or five years time, but for ten and 20 years time in terms of where are the subject demands and priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900014#N00400","speaker":"1154","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392774600,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire ar ais go dt&iacute; an Seanad.

I hope, in time, they will become registered members of the Teaching Council.  That would be a great achievement for them and a great passport in life.<\/p><p>The Teaching Council, established on a statutory basis in 2006, is a welcome and significant development in Irish education.  Why do we have a teaching council?  The Teaching Council exists to promote public confidence in the profession of teaching.  The council is responsible for promoting standards in teaching in the interests of the public good.  When we reflect on how important education is for an individual's life chances and well-being, it is clear that teachers play a vital role in society and that the highest standards in teaching are in everyone's interests.<\/p><p>As the Minister said some weeks ago, the profession reached an important milestone with the commencement of section 30 of the Teaching Council Act.  Now, all teachers who are paid by the State must be registered.  Now, over 87,000 teachers are registered.  Teachers can rejoice in this because it sends an important message to parents and the public.  Only those teachers who have reached specific standards can be registered and, therefore, be eligible for a salary from the State.<\/p><p>Equally important is the introduction of the Teaching Council disciplinary function, called fitness to teach.  It is important that this system is fair to everyone involved.  Teachers need to believe that the Teaching Council is supportive of the difficult and important task they perform from day to day and that the council will provide teachers with the necessary supports and ongoing training.  The fitness to teach function is not about demonising teachers or replacing disciplinary procedures that already exist at a local level.  It is about the Teaching Council investigating complaints that have exhausted all other avenues of resolution.  It is about identifying issues of concern with respect to a teacher's professional practice and helping him to address those issues, a point well made by the Minister.  It is about providing students, parents, fellow teachers and employers with a formal mechanism.<\/p><p>It is important that we see continual professional development introduced for teachers in time.  Following the section 30 commencement, I hope these two measures will follow in the term of this Teaching Council.  I understand that the Teaching Council has arranged for registered teachers to have free online access to research.  This is an important measure to support teachers in keeping abreast of research and development in education.  It should be noted that groups such as the Irish National Teachers Organisation have been providing courses in continual professional development for many years and have done so successfully.  Therefore, we are not starting from scratch.  I suggest that the Teaching Council engages, consultants and learns from groups such as the INTO, the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland and the Teachers Union of Ireland in this regard when the time comes.<\/p><p>I congratulate the Teaching Council on its F&eacute;ilte initiative, launched last year, which supports teachers and helps them to learn from each other.  This festival of education facilitates teachers talking to each other about innovation in their practice as educators.  I am pleased to see that the council is planning another F&eacute;ilte for October.<\/p><p>The Teaching Council regulates teaching and promotes professionalism in the interests of the public good.  I have great admiration for the council.  I know that Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Ruairc, the current director, and his staff are fully committed to their task.  I am aware of the dedication and commitment of teachers at primary, secondary and third level and their high professionalism.  I have no doubt that as things develop the Teaching Council will be seen even more fully as a great step forward in giving public recognition to the dedication and professionalism of teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900015#O00700","speaker":"1166"},{"type":"speech","time":1392775200,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  What he has been telling us about is most important; the 87,000 registered people will have a major role to play in the future of this country.  They always have.  I do not want to be defensive, but some of the people who have made negative comments about Irish education were the very people who in 2008 were so incompetent in their own fields that education must now rectify that.  The quality of Brendan Kennelly's poetry did not deteriorate in 2008, but the quality of banking, insurance and many other industries did, and hence we are left with the bill.<\/p><p>The process of learning is collegiate in nature.  Teachers should group around their subject areas, come back to their old departments and see what the developments are in the current year in economics, geography, science and so on.  Field trips are extremely valuable.  I know the Minister wishes to have the same enthusiasm at second level that he feels has been generated at primary level by a curriculum change, rather than have this very strong domination by an exam system.  Field trips and visits to schools by figures in public life, the world of business and the world of sport could be the days that students will remember when they have finished their education.  There is room for great partnerships.  The professionalism of education which this measure promotes is most valuable.<\/p><p>At third level, it should be expected that all subjects should be supplying the teachers.  The Minister referred to how we get an adequate supply of people for the STEM subjects.  How do we tackle the language problem?  It has been a tradition that only certain academic departments produce the next generation of higher diploma graduates, but they should all be eligible.  In planning for these changes, if we had an Italian teacher, could we have that person teaching Italian in about three or four schools, rather than teaching subjects outside their professional degree?  There is a problem whereby teachers are teaching subjects for which they have not got the degree qualification.  Perhaps some co-operation between schools and more flexible arrangements might lead to a better result all round.<\/p><p>There is a need for education departments in universities to relate to all of the subjects.  Perhaps in the past, the links to science, technology, engineering and maths have not been strong enough.  It is a problem, as the Minister has said, trying to get an adequate listing of how many maths teachers actually have a qualification in the subject.  It was always held in the past that one of the difficulties with the revival of the Irish language was that at the foundation of the State, there were not that many people who had qualifications.  Students are very astute.  They will know whether one teacher is skilled and qualified in the subject, while the other teacher is not.  That professionalism is most important, because there are no more astute consumers than the pupils themselves.<\/p><p>We still have to look at the problem of untrained and temporary teachers, as part of professionalism------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900016#P00100","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speech","time":1392775200,"counter":127,"content":"<p>That is a very small problem now.

James Hickman is one of the most eminent people in contemporary economics.  He is saying the kind of things that the Minister is saying here.<\/p><p>Every university department should invite its teachers and its graduates back for a day or so.  Let the geography teachers catch up on what has been happening with their subject, and so on.  Looking at teacher conferences during the Easter vacation, I sometimes wish that much of the energy and the organisation went into discussing the subjects that happened in the classroom.  They are very good at looking after labour relations and giving Ministers frosty receptions sometimes; if only there was the same organisation and enthusiasm for the subjects, such as how we are interpreting different events in history 100 years on.  Conferences can be extremely valuable, and they certainly are at third level.  If I go to a conference outside Ireland and catch up with what has been going on, I come back enthused.  I know they have a reputation for being junkets, but they are very important in professional development.<\/p><p>The Minister's speech referred to compliance with national and school policies.

It has probably not been given enough prominence within third level that the most important job we do is to produce the next generation of teachers and to relate to younger people.

As a profession, teaching has long been viewed as a valuable and respected way of earning a living.  Going back to the days of the hedge schools, or the scoileanna scairte, in the 18th and 19th centuries, when the Penal Laws dictated that \"no person of the popish religion shall publicly or in private houses teach school or instruct youth in the learning within the realm\", the school teacher was seen as a pillar of society, a crucial contributor to the life of the village or town, as well as an educator.  Going back even further in time to the era of the Book of Kells and the Book of Durrow, and the Annals of the Four Masters, Ireland was considered a seat of learning, while Irish colleges were established all over Europe, from Leuven to Salamanca.  We have had a long history of excellent education in Ireland, and can be justly proud of the high esteem in which our schools and colleges are held.<\/p><p>With such a long history, it is quite extraordinary that it took until seven years ago to establish a teaching council in Ireland, considering that such councils exist for many other professions, such as medicine, nursing, pharmacy and the legal profession.  The establishment of the Teaching Council and its achievements to date are very positive developments for the foundation of professionally led regulations for teachers.  The functions of the council are set out clearly in the 2001 Act, with the council being established in March 2006.  For the past few years, teachers have been getting notifications - myself included - every year requesting them to register and to pay their registration fee.  I am delighted that the registration fee has been reduced from &euro;90 to &euro;65.  Along with my colleagues, I might have asked why we were paying this, but now I am delighted that the real impact of the Teaching Council on education in Ireland is becoming clear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900016#P00600","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1392775800,"counter":132,"content":"<p>From 28 January 2014 any teacher in receipt of a salary from State funds must be registered with the Teaching Council of Ireland, under section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001.  As a former teacher of many years, I wholeheartedly welcome this registration requirement.  One of the most important functions of the Teaching Council of Ireland is the protection of standards of entry to the teaching profession, and establishing this register is one of the most significant milestones in the development of teaching as a profession.  When one goes to a hospital or a surgery to get treatment for an illness, one expects the nurse, doctor or consultant will be registered, unless one is attending a training hospital, and to have a certain level competence.  The same will apply to the teachers to whom parents entrust their child, as we all do, for a significant portion of the day.  There are very limited and strict circumstances under which a school can employ an unregistered teacher, such as to prevent the school having to close if a registered substitute cannot be found.  That is very significant because it has been a bone of contention and an area in which we need much stricter regulations.  This will be a significant area in which the Teaching Council of Ireland will be of benefit and, as has been said, has closed that door quite considerably.  The experience of newly qualified teachers in the past, myself included as I left college at the age of 19 years, was a baptism of fire.  The teacher having completed the H Dip or primary school teaching degree walked into the classroom and on his or her first day was more or less left to one's own devices<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1392775800,"counter":133,"content":"<p>One was on one's own.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900017#Q00200","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1392775800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>It was a case of sink or swim.  If one were lucky one could ask for advice from an experienced teacher, but it could be a very isolating and lonely experience.  I was a music teacher and I had to set up a music department in the school.  While it gave me great scope and I had great ideas, it could be also a very daunting experience.  The Teaching Council of Ireland recognises the importance of this period in a newly qualified teacher's career as a time when he or she needs the support of induction and probation.  The Department for Education and Skills funds the national induction programme for teachers and the piloting of the Droichead scheme.  This period of induction and probation supported by the Teaching Council of Ireland will ensure that newly qualified teachers get established in the classroom with the highest possible level of competence and confidence.  This should go a long way towards enhancing the quality of teaching and learning for students in our classroom.  Continuous professional development is also to be welcomed as I believe it is vital to the success of teaching and education and will keep all teachers up to date in the profession.  When I taught music I was the only music teacher in the school, as happens with that subject, and as the only music teacher at department meetings, things were very harmonious and nobody objected to any of the ideas I wanted to introduce.  It is very important to have that outside scope.  I know that the post-primary music teachers association conferences were always a great support to me and we had some excellent conferences.<\/p><p>September 2012 saw the roll out of extended and reconceptualised programmes of initial teacher education.  Concurrent initial teacher education programmes are now four years duration with the post graduate programmes taking place over the two years.  This is welcome.  All reconfigured programmes are required to meet the Teachers Council's accreditation criteria, some of which are specifically related to numeracy and literacy.  All of the 60 programmes of initial teacher education at primary and post-primary levels will be reviewed by October 2014.  In addition the ten programmes in the further education sector have been accredited.<\/p><p>Teaching is a very complex career in many ways.  The teacher is in a position of great trust and responsibility and must be competent not only in his or her subject area but in dealing with children and adolescence who not only require teaching but will benefit from mentoring, counselling, disciplining and often advising and providing advice.  The teacher must also communicate with parents, who thankfully nowadays take a major interest in their child's education.  The Teachers Council published the second edition of its code of professional conduct for teachers in 2012.  The code was developed following a process of consultation with teachers and other stakeholders in education.  It sets out first and foremost  a clear description of what is expected of teachers in their professional role.  It is great that we have clear definitions and clear goals of where we are going.  There are 33 standards of professional knowledge, skills, competence and conduct expected of registered teachers.  This shows just how complex this is but the core values are respect, care, integrity and trust.<\/p><p>I will comment briefly on the Teaching Council's function in respect to fitness to teach.  This section of the Act will commence very shortly and is an area that has attracted most of the recent media coverage.  In line with other regulatory bodies, the Act provides that the Teaching Council will have the means to investigate a teacher's fitness to teach and the Bill, given Government approval for drafting on 10 December 2013, will provide for a range of sanctions such as advice, admonishment and censure that may be applied by the Teaching Council following an inquiry.  Such measures will ensure that members of the public and teachers themselves can be confident that teachers who are guilty of misconduct or who may need additional support will be dealt with appropriately.  It is very important that we recognise that some people may need extra support because of something happening in their personal life or in the classroom.  Parents can be assured that genuine concerns can be addressed through the available channels.  We can look forward to the remaining element of the Act pertaining to the continuous professional development of teachers being rolled out in the near future.  Teaching is a profession in which one cannot stand still.  One must be always open to new methodologies, new ways of thinking.  The majority of teachers welcome the opportunity to upskill and update.  This can only mean enhanced teaching and learning in the classroom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900017#Q00300","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1392775800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill has five minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900017#Q00400","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1392775800,"counter":136,"content":"<p>I want to share my time equally with Senator Healy Eames.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900017#Q00500","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1392775800,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Each of the Senators will have 2.5 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900017#Q00600","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1392775800,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire inniu.

It is vitally important that the Department of Education and Skills would have an absolute command of the number of teachers in the system and projected demands, whether demographic or industry-led demands.  Obviously there will be a cost associated with this, but I am not sure what it will be.

The council is a progressive and positive step forward in maintaining and improving teaching and learning standards.  I was a primary schoolteacher and can see its value.  Like Senator Moran, when we received notification about the Teaching Council we all wondered where it would lead.  I can now say it a  positive step forward and is much needed in the education system.<\/p><p>As the Teaching Council is in place, I have a number of questions for the Minister on responsibilities, for example, those between the board of management, the Teaching Council, the Department and school inspections.  Will there now be an overlap?  With regard to standards and learning, will inspections come under the remit of the council?<\/p><p>My next question is on the hiring of teachers.  I was employed by the board of management at my school.  Is there an issue with regard to the standards of teaching, the code of conduct, professional standards, pupil or student welfare?  Is it not the board of management that hires a teacher who is the first in line to deal with any issues that arise?  I shall elaborate in order to provide clarity. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900018#R01400","speaker":"1187"},{"type":"speech","time":1392776400,"counter":155,"content":"<p>None of those relationships has changed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900018#R01500","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1392776400,"counter":156,"content":"<p>If there is a complaint then at what point does the Teaching Council engage in the process?  I want to understand the process and I ask the Minister to elaborate on the provision.<\/p><p>I welcome the minimum service requirement for probation.  It has been reduced to 100 days in order to allow student teachers to complete their probation period.<\/p><p>I want the Minister to clear up another issue which relates to JobBridge.  There are myths about JobBridge.  It has been regularly said that young teachers have taken the jobs of other teachers but I do not believe that has been the case.  I wish to put on record that I am very much in favour of JobBridge.  I am also in favour of giving young people - be they teachers or whatever - work experience because it is a big issue in terms of unemployment.  Employers receive impressive CVs that list primary degrees, masters and doctorates but the person may not have one day's work experience.  An employer will take on a person who has work experience.  Therefore, it is important to give young people a chance to gain some.  I ask the Minister to expand and clarify the matter.<\/p><p>As a teacher I can say that it is important to have ongoing training and learning.  It is crucial for the teacher but it is also crucial to maintain the morale in the school.  One is constantly learning new skills and new ways to deal with special needs children.  It is vital to keep up to date.  What is learned in teacher training college is great but skills must be constantly renewed.  A lot of teachers, as the Minister has said, are already engaged in training.  It is nothing new but training will now be standard  across the country. <\/p><p>I have outlined my main issues.  I welcome the attendance of the Minister.

I welcome the Minister to the House.  Much of what I was going to discuss has already been covered so I shall talk briefly about initial teacher education and entry requirements for teacher education programmes.  My questions relates to the Minister's recent announcement about the politics in society module to be introduced for the leaving certificate course.  What arrangement will be put in place to include teachers in the programme?  When will the course be recognised by the Teaching Council as being suitable for teaching politics in society under the new curriculum?<\/p><p>Earlier the Minister said that in the interim, the council has produced a new set of criteria for registration on the basis of qualifications in post-primary subjects from 2017 onward.  That provision will be important for students entering their first and second year of a degree in terms of module choice.  What about those who have finished their primary degrees and masters, etc?  Let me give myself as an example.  If I wanted to become a politics in society teacher following my term in the Seanad would my course be recognised and if so, when would that be announced?  When would I be able to study for a HDip course and achieve a qualification that would allow me to teach politics in society in a school?  Many students and graduates of politics are greatly interested in such a job.  There has also been talk about reducing the voting age.  I attended the Constitutional Convention and part of the process was how to educate young in order to get them to engage in the process and want to vote.  The new curriculum will feed into that aim in a big way.  How will teacher education feed into the goal to have politics in society?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900018#R01800","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1392776400,"counter":159,"content":"<p>The Senator's brevity is much appreciated, especially by Senator Quinn who has three minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900018#R01900","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"speech","time":1392776400,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I am sure that I will not use my three minutes.  I welcome my cousin here today.  We do not see him often enough in here.<\/p><p>My experience and involvement in education was up to the leaving certificate applied.  I do not hear enough about the course and I am a great believer in the qualification.  There are a lot of jealousies or divisions in the area and I would like to hear far more about it.  <\/p><p>I have checked and know - or at least I do not think so - that there is no follow-through on what happens when people graduate, have left college or emigrated.  Other countries collect such data.  In Italy and the Netherlands, the authorities follow through and collect data on what happens to their teachers.<\/p><p>There is a belief that there will be a big increase in the number of students starting school in the next six years - something like 15,000 extra students  - yet there are 5,000 jobs in the IT area waiting to be filled.  I know that the Minister is working on the problem and hope that we can do something about the matter.<\/p><p>The other area that teachers can do something about, rather than the Department, is their status.  In Finland the recognition and status of a teacher is what it used to be here although I am not sure that continues to be the case.  In Finland teachers are still the most important person in a town.  Finnish teachers earn less than their Irish counterparts but they are still highly regarded.  Part of that is due to the behaviour of the teachers' council in Finland which encourages its teachers to continue their studies during the summer break.  I am not sure to what extent such learning takes place here.<\/p><p>In France teachers give students who have slipped back a little bit over the year lessons or tuition during the summer.  I understand that is done, to a large extent, by the teachers themselves but such an initiative is encouraged by their local teachers' council.  Those are the sorts of things that the Teaching Council could do in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900018#R02000","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1392777000,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I thank all Senators for the welcome they have given the proposal and for their generally supportive comments.<\/p><p>  I will try to respond as comprehensively as possible to everything that has been said but if I fail to do so, I will communicate with Members later.  Senator Power raised the issue of facilitating principals.  We are recognising the leadership role of principals, to which Senator Healy Eames and others referred.  In Finland, for example, the role of the principal is recognised in a way that previously was not the case in a formal sense and we are exploring how that can be implemented in consultation with the representative bodies, the IPPN and NAPD.<\/p><p>  I will come back on another occasion to discuss the issue of fitness to teach and related matters because time does not allow for that now.  Senator Power asked whether fitness to teach hearings will be held in public.  This will be a matter for the Teaching Council to determine, as is the case with the Medical Council and other bodies.  I will meet council members over the next few weeks and I will convey to them the concerns expressed.  I will ensure all 37 members receive a hard copy of the transcript of this debate in order that they will have an up-to-date record of Members' concerns.<\/p><p>  I welcome Senator Jim D'Arcy's comments about the new junior cycle.  He said the council is an important body and I regret it has taken such a long time for it to get the point it has reached.  We now have a clear system, which we did not have, given the primary education system officially goes back to 1831 and there is significant evidence there was a strong, albeit informal, structure of primary education throughout the country prior to that.  Former Senator, Professor Joe Lee, reviewed a book written by the late Garret FitzGerald, which I had the honour to launch, in last Saturday's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>.  There is a great deal of statistical data that clearly indicate there was a commitment to obtaining an education and, consequently, a respect for the standing of the school teacher, to which Senator Moran alluded.  That has stood us in great stead and continues to do so.<\/p><p>  I would like the emergence of the Teaching Council to build on that tradition and respect.  It should be a regulatory body for teachers and how they move forward.  A total of 22 out of the 37 members of the council are teachers.  One cannot say they are not represented in respect of the council and how it evolves.  There are plenty of models worldwide that provide an example of how it should evolve.  The council must respect the concerns of parents and those who use the education system.<\/p><p>  I refer to the pertinent comments raised by Senator Barrett.  Primary schoolteachers come through the initial teacher education training and, classically, they teach schoolchildren whereas secondary school teachers teach subjects.  The Senator is correct that we have been haphazard in allowing the system to independently produce subject teachers such as for geography and science.  Until two and a half years ago, there were 19 centres of initial teacher education, all of which were funded by the State but controlled by different institutions, reflecting the history of education in the country.  They have been reconfigured into six centres and we will examine the issues to which the Senator referred and, hopefully, having regard to the esteemed institution in which he spends the remainder of his time, it will take a renewed interested in education.  As he correctly said, it is not just the compartmentalised responsibility of one department; it is the responsibility of the entire university system to examine how it prepares graduates in whatever discipline to become teachers.  I would welcome that very much.<\/p><p>  Senator Moran referred to the scoileanna scairte, hedge schools.  She also referred to the support for teachers in the context of her experience as the sole music teacher in a school.  Support for teachers as their careers progress is important.  What is happening informally at the moment is extraordinary.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i> education supplement is one of the bibles of the profession and there is a website on which thousands of teachers write about their observations on teaching plans and their experience of what has or has not worked.  It is a virtual chatroom in which teachers are not confined to the physical staffroom but can enter the staffroom in the cloud to share best practice and experience, including the significant amount of continuing professional development, CPD, work that they do.  I would not like the impression to emerge from this debate that teachers are not engaged in self-development and CPD.  The vast bulk of them are but they are not our problem.  Our problem is those who do not do this.  To renew a licence to practise as a doctor, solicitor or an architect, one must provide evidence of CPD and that will now apply to teachers.  How that is produced and delivered is a matter for the council, as it is with every other regulated profession.  This is a critically important step.  This should not be perceived as a criticism of teachers.  This will set a floor whereby all teachers will continue to do what the vast bulk of them currently do.<\/p><p>  Senator &Oacute; D&oacute;mhnaill referred to fees.  I will point his comments out to the members of the council when I meet them but I am told that this money will be used as a war chest to fight legal disputes.  We have learned from such disputes elsewhere that it is best to find another way to intervene with a teacher for whatever reason.  We all slip on occasion.  The last thing I want is teachers barred from practice.  If they are struggling, I would like other teachers, as has happened informally in schools, metaphorically to put their arms around them and get them back to the point where they can continue.  If teaching turns out not to be the career for them, they should be assisted to move successfully to another career.  They should not have their livelihood taken from them.  This is not about a punitive raid on somebody who does not meet somebody else's standard.  Hopefully, the &euro;11 million war chest could be used in a supportive way to reinforce and sustain teachers.  We have all gone through periods, as Senator Power said, when other factors impact and intrude on our ability to do our day job.  That is what this is about.  It has been caricatured as being punitive but it is not.  It is supportive.  At the end of the day, the 37 members of the council will have the final say.  The Department will liaise with them and we will offer our views and so on but the council will stand in its own right.<\/p><p>  Senator Naughton asked a number of questions.  The role of the board of management as the employer will remain untouched by this.  If a teacher has performance difficulties, the principal, as would happen in any organisation, will have the primary responsibility as the manager to intervene and provide support.  I acknowledge they need support in this area and this relates to leadership and so on.  The current inspection system can draw attention to deficiencies or difficulties in the performance of some teachers in the most gentle and supportive way.  We are trying to identify weaknesses that can be remedied rather than punishing people or hunting them out of the system.<\/p><p>  The hiring of a teacher is a matter for the board of management.  The Senator also referred to a code of conduct and complaints.  This will evolve.  If parents had a problem with a teacher but had no problem with the school, I would like to think they could convey that in a way that did not get them into a conflict with the school.<\/p> <p>It is to be hoped the evolution of the Teaching Council will facilitate that.<\/p><p>I could not agree more with Senators on JobBridge and probation.  There is a worldwide shortage of teachers and an even larger worldwide shortage of Irish-trained teachers.  Some argue we should tighten the labour market to produce enough teachers to meet our demands.  That is not the case.  There are many people who want to be teachers but also want to see the world.  Through postgraduate courses, Irish-trained teachers can teach as far away as in Australia and closer to home in the south of England where there is a chronic shortage of teachers.  I would like the INTO to change its attitude to JobBridge.  It is not a yellow pack substitute for teachers but is designed to enable qualified teachers to get the necessary 100 day probation period which will allow them apply for other positions.<\/p><p>We will be introducing a new leaving certificate subject called politics and society.  The course has been written and is available online.  A teacher will naturally be qualified to teach and can add it to other subjects.  If the person has done politics in their primary degree, they would be a prime candidate for this subject.  It is early days yet, however.<\/p><p>My cousin, Senator Feargal Quinn raised the issue of the leaving certificate applied.  I commend the work done on it at the time but, sadly, the numbers on it are beginning to drop.  While it was appropriate at the time it was introduced, changes in the junior cycle will pick up the points the Senator and his team identified at the time on non-academic subjects that need to be recognised and advanced.<\/p><p>I thank the House again for the positive input it gives to education debates whenever I attend here.  I will make arrangements for the 37 members of the Teaching Council to get a full transcript of what has transpired here in order that they will be informed of the Senators&rsquo; concerns and can respond to them.  I would like the miscellaneous education Bill to be introduced tomorrow but that sense of impatience does not necessarily produce the results.  One cannot make a kettle boil faster than it will.  There are several provisions, such as vetting, that we would like to add to it.  I hope to initiate it in this House this side of Easter and have it enacted before the summer recess.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900019#S00100","speaker":"1035","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392777600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive replies which are always appreciated by Members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900020#T00200","speaker":"1171"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Address to Seanad \u00c9ireann by the Pope: Motion","time":1392777600,"counter":164,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900020#T00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1392777600,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote><br \/>Seanad &Eacute;ireann consequent upon the unanimous decision of the Committee on Procedures and Privileges to add the name of His Holiness Pope Francis the First to be included among the most prominent distinguished visitors to be invited to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann, strongly supports this invitation and requests the Government to assist in making the formal arrangements necessary for such a visit which may naturally include meetings with the President, An Taoiseach and political leaders.<\/blockquote>I would be very happy if the Minister for Education and Skills was inclined to stay and reply on behalf of the Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900020#T00400","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1392777600,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I will leave it in the Senator&rsquo;s capable hands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900020#T00500","speaker":"1035"},{"type":"speech","time":1392777600,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I am very heartened by the general support I have received from colleagues.  This motion was put before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and passed unanimously.  It now goes before the House.<\/p><p>  The reason I came up with this idea is that there are very few world leaders who have any kind of vision at all.  In the person of Pope Francis, we have someone with a prophetic, compelling and comprehensive vision.  In my opinion, if anyone needed proof of the existence of God and of the Holy Spirit, this man is it.  How he was found among a collection of cardinals appointed by his two predecessors is a genuine miracle.  He is an extraordinary person.  I am a realist.  I am an Anglican and have no intention of changing my religion because I am impressed by this man.  I also do not believe he is going to campaign for gay marriage or women priests.  However, he has changed the entire climate of debate within the Catholic church, allowing for genuine dialogue.  Christendom is in a perilous state.  This is a man who has spotted the iceberg and is trying to turn <i>Titanic<\/i> around.<\/p><p>  On his first appearance on the Vatican balcony, I felt the exceptional goodness of this person, even mediated through the electronic broadcast media.  He had something of the spirit of the beloved Pope John XXIII with his rejection of pomp, circumstance and majesty.  We have heard less of that rather bullying language traditionally used by the Vatican, the language of magisterium, authority and all the rest of it.  This is a man of genuine of Christ-like humility.  The fact he took the name Francis is very significant.  There is an arrogance and megalomania of the human animal that sees itself as the only significant life force on Earth.  The name Francis reminds us of our need to care for other life forms in this world.<\/p><p>  By addressing Seanad &Eacute;ireann and coming to Ireland, he would give us all a lift at this time in our history.  He brings hope, joy and community.  It is not just a sentimental thing.  I did feel a strong emotional draw towards him when he came out on the balcony and refused to be decorated like a Christmas tree.  There is real substance to what he does and says.  He says, &ldquo;I am a sinner&rdquo;.  There is a lack of arrogance in that.<\/p><p>  He lives a modest lifestyle and demonstrates his solidarity with the marginalised.  For example, there was the moving occasion when he celebrated mass on an upturned boat at Lampedusa in solidarity with the marginalised African peoples trying to get to Europe because of their desperate economic, political and human rights plight.  He is concerned for the unemployed and economic disparities.  He has recognised the whole financial system needs to be addressed.  It is perfectly clear that the obsession with the minutiae of human sexuality is on the backburner as far as this Pope is concerned.  He is dealing with real issues which affect everyone.  He speaks from the heart about a church that knows the dirt, the poverty and the distress of the streets.<\/p><p>  I am not sure he will be able to accept an invitation to address the Seanad.  He has two roles as the leader of the largest Christian denomination and as a Head of State.  Ireland, however, has a special place in the history of the church.  It also has a special place in his life, as he was partly educated at Milltown.  I hope he has happy memories of his time in Ireland.  I also hope this motion is passed unanimously and referred back to the delicate machinery of diplomacy in order that this might be accomplished.  I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges who passed this motion unanimously, as well as the advice given by Deirdre Lane, Jody Blake and the rest of the staff on the delicate diplomatic negotiations required.<\/p> <p>I think this would be a healing process.  Perhaps it is too much to hope that if he was able to come, he would be able to visit the North of Ireland.  Would that not be a fantastic thing if he - a good, simple, ordinary man who reaches out to the hearts of everybody, whether they have religion or none - was able to go to that part of our island and help to reconcile people?  If he could at least come here, I, for one, would be humbled to sit in his presence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900020#T00600","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392778200,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I second the motion and commend Senator Norris on all the work he has put into this.

These gestures are most important to us.  We need people of vision and spirituality.  I might like Pope Francis to have slightly different views, as Senator Norris would, on debates within the church about the traditionally inferior roles of women, the unfortunate record in many cases in dealing with children and in regard to the LGBT community.  However, that is for another day, and discussions on developing these ideas have much to commend them.<\/p><p>It is also what the public outside would like us to do.

I believe this is a wonderful idea.  It was proper and appropriate that the CPP was unanimous when he put the matter to it.  We all agreed that this Pope is one of the great popes of our time, certainly, perhaps of all time.  While that is yet to be judged, as he is only 11 months in office, already he has brought about an amazing transformation.<\/p><p>That he comes from Argentina is very important for us here in Ireland.  If Senator Norris has already referred to this, he will forgive me, but that country is the largest non-English speaking segment of the Irish diaspora and the fifth largest overall.  The Argentinian navy was founded by a Mayo man, Admiral Brown, and, as I have mentioned in the House before, its rail system was founded by John Coghlan, an ancestor of mine.  There is a borough or district, just as Sandymount or Donnybrook is a district, known as Coghlan, and a railway station is named after him.  I have not seen it, by the way, but close relatives of mine have visited and brought me back wonderful photographs.  The Pope is of Italian parents and I believe he has a wonderful respect for Ireland.  This invitation is tremendously important and, please God, it is something that will be pursued and taken up.  We should also give credit to his representative here in Ireland, the Papal Nuncio, Archbishop Charles Brown, who might be connected with Admiral Brown, for all we know.  In any case, I know he has great time for the Irish-Argentinian connection.<\/p><p>The Pope has done a lot to date.  In particular, he appointed the eight cardinals to advise him on reformation and reorganisation - the C8, as they are known.  They have been dealing with many things which gave us trouble, shall we say, in the recent past.  I understand that, on this very day in Rome, they are dealing with the Institute for the Works of Religion, more commonly known as the Vatican Bank.  Unfortunately, while there might have been good men at the head of it, they might not have known what the minions were up to.  In any event, the council of eight cardinals is dealing with that today in Rome.  This Pope, in getting these people together, and in all he is doing and wants to do, and all that, hopefully, he will have the time and energy to deal with, is doing very important work.<\/p><p>This is a wonderful idea from Senator Norris, very ably seconded by Senator Barrett.

It is possible this motion is the acorn but it certainly has the potential to become the great oak.  That is why I commend Senator Norris.  I must admit that when he first circulated a note to us all asking whether we would support it, I had a certain doubt in my mind as to how it might be perceived or even be ridiculed, like <i>The Skibbereen Eagle<\/i> and the Tsar.  All of those things went through my mind, but the more I thought about it, the more I realised that any worthwhile development has to start from a premise of openness.  That is precisely what Senator Norris has done here.  I listened to the Senator's contribution and one would have to be inspired by it.  He finished by saying he would be humbled to be in the presence of Pope Francis.  I do not mean he would be humbled as a person, rather, his point is the mere fact of being able to engage with Pope Francis, what he stands for, what he believes in and, indeed, the general perception which is out there at the moment of Pope Francis.<\/p><p>  The Pope has a very difficult task, there is no question of that.  We are at a crossroads, but it is not only the church that is at a crossroads because society is at a crossroads and Ireland is at a crossroads.  This is not for any particular issue.  It can be an economic issue, an issue of deprivation or an issue of a lack of human rights, but there is a crossroads.  We have two choices.  Either we stick in that position or we endeavour to put the head above the parapet and decide which road we want to go on.<\/p><p>  I have come to the conclusion that there is no reason at all that this invitation should not be progressed.  I believe it will make it easier for officialdom to handle it by having it come from this Assembly.  It is a good starting point in itself.   We only know of Pope Francis from the media because we have never met him, and I am sure some may look on it differently from others.  However, in the main, there is one central theme coming across from his papacy, which is that he is a humble man.  When he should have been at a ceremonial occasion, he decided he would visit a prison and meet the prisoners.  I do not believe this was gimmickry.<\/p> <p>I am convinced he is genuine in his approach to these matters.  Since becoming Pope, he has gone out onto the streets - incommunicado, so to speak - to meet poor people.  Surely that is what Christianity is all about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900021#U00400","speaker":"1115","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392778800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>He is like Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900022#V00200","speaker":"1151"},{"type":"speech","time":1392778800,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Yes.  I am always saddened when I hear that in more than half the developed countries in the world, Christians cannot practise their faith.  That is a frightening statistic.<\/p><p>Pope Francis has an exceptionally difficult task ahead of him.  Popes, like all leaders, are obliged to interact with people, including those with whom they do not agree.  I am speaking here in the context of countries and administrations.  When one considers how Russia and even China are developing at this time - countries we thought would always be isolated and with which we would never communicate - there is some room for optimism.  When we interact and use employ diplomacy and dialogue, it is much better than any type of violent reaction.  Pope Francis comes across as a very peace-loving person and a very understanding man.  It is very easy when one is comfortable in one's own skin to forget how many people are not comfortable in their skin and who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in difficult positions.  People in those circumstances are always pleased when they encounter somebody who reaches out and tries to understand.<\/p><p>If Pope Francis accepts an invitation to visit Ireland, an address to the Seanad should form part of it.  It is not just Catholics or even other Christians who would have a welcome for him.  I heard an interview on the radio this morning with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in which she was asked whether the situation in regard to human rights is better than it was ten years ago.  Her response was that the situation is more stressful than ever.  The violence taking place in various countries around the world can lead, at times, to a sense of helplessness and hopelessness.  We can look to the Heads of State involved to provide leadership but the reality is that they themselves are very often involved in militarism, arms trading and all of it.  If one person can stand aside from that and hold out a message of hope, understanding and reconciliation, then that must be welcome.<\/p><p>I do not know when a visit to this country by Pope Francis might happen.  Although the future of the Seanad is secure for now, I do not know whether any of us in this Chamber today will still be here when he arrives in Ireland.  I certainly would feel exceptionally happy to have Pope Francis speaking directly to us as legislators.  Even if the most difficult questions were put to him, I feel sure he would do his best to be open and transparent and, at the same time, understanding towards people.  My hope is that the train of thought that has begun here today through the good work and initiative of Senator Norris will develop and evolve.  I conclude by reminding colleagues of the fable of the acorn and the great oak, which speaks of the importance of believing the impossible is sometimes possible.  If we do not adopt that philosophy, we remain stagnant.  Senator Norris and the colleagues who are supporting this motion believe it is possible to advance this invitation.  I certainly hope their initiative is successful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900022#V00300","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1392778800,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I very rarely stand on ceremony, but I will do so on this occasion.

The invitation would, of course, have to be issued on behalf of the State.  I very much support such an invitation for several reasons.  First, Pope Francis is the leader of one of the largest religious denominations in the world, with 770 million of its adherents residing outside western Europe, in Africa, Asia and the Americas.  That is an important factor, because we tend to be very much preoccupied with issues relating to the Western world and not the broader issues that dominate the global world.<\/p><p>  It is important to bear in mind that any discussion of the Catholic Church and Christianity in general must take on board the issue of power.  We are used to dealing with multinational power, governmental power, corporate power - the types of powers which often are exercised without the interests of the individual being at their heart.  One of the main principles of Christianity - for the Catholic Church, Anglican Church and other churches with a Christian ethos - is the importance of the individual in society and the importance of individual rights.  I disagree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; that our impression of Pope Francis is largely based on a media representation.  On the contrary, he has been represented by his own words.  I have in front of me an edition of <i>America Magazine<\/i> containing an extensive interview in which he outlines his position on a wide range of issues.  His pronouncements on poverty, the importance of the individual and of what he calls &quot;discernment&quot; - what might more usually be referred to as &quot;conscience&quot; - in terms of how individuals, societies and governments exercise their power, are very enlightening.  As a social democrat, I find what he has to say in general terms about how governments and societies should exercise their conscience towards individuals to be very persuasive.  It is a very important message which needs to go out to the world.<\/p><p>  In many of his public statements, the Pope has touched broadly on the failings of modern capitalism.  It is not surprising that these pronouncements have not been enormously popular among some of the more right-wing groups in the United States, for example.  Certainly, he has not found a unanimous welcome in that country.  I do not support extreme right-wing religious dogma, irrespective of whence it comes.  I admire the Pope for what he has done and said in regard to the importance of dealing with poverty, of not allowing multinational interests such as bankers, for the sake of argument, to dominate the international agenda.  His message should be welcomed by all.  Given that he has 770 million followers outside the Western world, it is important that he is making statements in a scenario where Uganda, for example, has imposed the death penalty on homosexuals.  It is an important point to bear in mind in terms of where the man is coming from and the context of his statements.<\/p><p>  It is important to acknowledge who the Pope is as a person, as eloquently described by Senator Norris.  He is a humble man.  He is a man who has made his position very clear in terms of what he believes to be the important issues.  He has stated that how we respond to the poorest of people in our society is the most important consideration.  Across the spectrum of issues, whether same-sex marriage, the role of women and so on, I am an adamant advocate of equality.  It is important to bear in mind that one does not turn an institution like the Catholic Church around in 24 hours, but the Pope's self-awareness on these issues is clear.  He has mentioned, for instance, that he has been challenged on not being sufficiently dogmatic on the issue of homosexuality.  His response was that he was nobody to judge.<\/p> <p>While I might argue with his views on the role of women and in respect of homosexual rights, I am of the view that he has moved the church in the right direction.  He is caught up in an official position but that should not blind us to the moves he is making in a wider sense.  Neither must we forget the emphasis he is placing on issues I believe to be of great importance, namely, the role of the individual and our responsibility to every individual and in the context of world power.  As a social democrat, I do not believe a rising tide raises all boats and, therefore, I do not believe in a trickle-down approach.  It is a great source of comfort to me that someone as important as Pope Francis does not believe in it either.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900022#V00600","speaker":"1172","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392779400,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900023#W00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1392779400,"counter":180,"content":"<p>He believes that every one of us has a personal responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900023#W00300","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1392779400,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I am delighted to contribute to this debate this motion, which was proposed by Senator Norris and seconded by Senator Barrett.  The entire concept behind the motion is one which we must support.  I am obliged to declare an interest in that I received a Papal knighthood 20 years ago.  While it was not bestowed upon me by Pope Francis, I am biased in respect of this matter.  Pope Francis is the first holder of that office during my lifetime who is younger than me.  In fact, I am just two weeks older than him.  I doubt, however, that he is aware of this fact.<\/p><p>The concept of inviting Pope Francis to address the Seanad provides a real reminder of the power of this House in the context of doing something to change the world.  The Pope is the one who is changing the world.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to the acorn and the oak.  There is little doubt that this man can change and - by his very behaviour - that he has already changed.  It is the little things that sometimes change people's attitudes.  For example, he telephoned from Rome the man in Argentina who delivered his daily newspaper to cancel his order.  This shows both humility and personality.  Senators Norris and Barrett referred to the fact that the Pope no longer stays in a grand palace and that, unlike some of his predecessors, he does not wear glamorous clothes.  We can learn a great deal from this man.<\/p><p>I do not know whether it was Hitler who, in the context of one of the Pope's predecessors, inquired as to the number of legions he had at his disposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900023#W00400","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1392779400,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I think that was Napoleon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900023#W00500","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1392779400,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Perhaps it was.  I am not old enough to remember.<\/p><p>  The current Pope's ability to change is something of which he can be very proud.  In the context of global inequity, he recently stated, &quot;New ideologies, characterised by rampant individualism, egocentrism and materialistic consumerism, weaken social bonds, fuelling that &quot;throw away&quot; mentality which leads to contempt for ... the weakest and those considered &quot;useless&quot;&quot;.  These are the opinions of a man who is used to contemplating matters and who knows that by his very behaviour he can change the world.  A great deal can be done on that basis.  In light of this country's past experience, we can understand the sentiment expressed by the Pope.<\/p><p>  Our Government is to be commended on realising the value of reopening the Irish embassy to the Vatican.  It must be remembered that diplomatic links of that nature are all about intelligence and knowledge-gathering.  The Vatican has one of the best diplomatic networks in the world.  It has been engaging in diplomacy for thousands of years.  Cutting off connections with the Vatican is not the way to go.  With the reopening of the embassy, we can strengthen co-operation between the two states and work together to tackle issues such as hunger and poverty.  In a recent article in <i>The Economist<\/i> it is stated that &quot;Pope Francis certainly has all the necessary building-blocks to explore the links between culture, inequality and poverty&quot;.  He is attracting worldwide attention for doing exactly the sort of things we would like to see him doing to attract such attention.  He is someone of whom we can be very proud.<\/p><p>  I am not sure how we would go about issuing to the Pope an invitation to address this House.  I am sure it would have to be done at State level.  I hope there is a possibility he would visit Ireland in order to take up such an invitation.  Extending to Pope Francis an invitation to visit this country would be an important step on the road to exploring how we can work together on the issues that confront the world.  He has shown us one way to do it.  Let us see if we can enhance matters by taking our own steps in the same direction.  I would welcome the State's involvement in respect of this matter.  I hope the support required in respect of Senator Norris's proposal will be forthcoming.  As Senator Norris reminded us, the Pope spent some years studying in Dublin when he was a student.  I am sure he has good memories of the city and, if so, this might encourage him to pay us a visit.  Such a Papal visit would be the second of its kind to this country and we would certainly welcome it very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900023#W00600","speaker":"1145"},{"type":"speech","time":1392779400,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this wonderful motion.

There is a need to encourage younger people to become involved.  As Senator Quinn observed, the Pope does not reside in a big house but rather lives in more humble accommodation.

I note that, for whatever reason, my name is not attached to it.  Senator Hayden stated that Christianity is about power.  I do not see it that way.  Christianity is about salvation and involves encouraging and helping us to live our lives in a way that is in accordance with the teachings of Christ.  As we go through life, we are constantly searching for the truth - we have an obligation in that regard - in respect of all issues and despite the fact that we might attract criticism or court unpopularity as a result.  In politics, the challenge in searching for the truth is greater than in most other spheres.  This is because of the electoral system and the fact that the propensity to try to be popular and politically correct can sometimes lead us in directions which, perhaps, we should not go.<\/p><p>The commentary, both in this House and internationally, since Pope Francis was elected as Bishop of Rome last year has been interesting.  Throughout his life, the Pope has been on a journey.  At 36, he was nominated to be the provincial of his order - the Jesuits - in Buenos Aires.  That was a very young age at which to take up such a position.  At the time he worked under Pedro Arrupe, the former Superior General of the Jesuits, who was based in Rome.  I know the Pope still carries great devotion for the late Pedro Arrupe and that six months ago he spent some time praying at his grave.  On many occasions I have repeated the following quote from Pedro Arrupe, &quot;Let there be men and women who will bend their energies not to strengthen positions of privilege, but, to the best extent possible, reduce privilege in favour of the underprivileged&quot;.  Thinking of that sort ultimately led to the development in South America of what became known as liberation theology.<\/p> <p>It is not widely known that Pope Francis as archbishop of Buenos Aires and provincial of his order was strongly opposed to liberation theology.  He always felt there was a need to work with and assist the poor but there should be no involvement in the politics which went with that.  He steered a course in Argentina that was different from that steered in many other South American countries.  <\/p><p>For those who take an interest, some of the encyclicals are worth looking at.  His first encyclical, which is about the joy of the Gospel, is a particularly good read.  Regardless of whether one is a believer, lukewarm or an unbeliever, one can benefit immensely from some of these encyclicals.  Indeed, Pope Benedict's encyclical on love was widely read and endorsed by many people who were not Catholic or Christian.  <\/p><p>The significant thing about Pope Francis is that he has been a witness to the teachings of the church in his life, actions and words.  Last September, I had the opportunity on a visit to Rome to get an audience with the Pope.  Prior to it, I spoke to somebody who told me stories that have not appeared in the press.  Some weeks prior to my visit a woman arrived at the Vatican and went to some of the Swiss Guards with some members of her family.  It was very obvious that the woman was very ill.  Her face had suffered disfigurement because of a tumour.  She asked whether she could meet the Pope.  In the past, I would say that this would not have been an expectation she would have had but the guards told her to hold on, rang the apartments and got the Pope's private secretary.  The secretary said &quot;Hold on&quot; and the woman and her family had a quiet private audience with the Pope in his apartments for some time.  This was told to me by people who had obviously been speaking to him.  Another story involved a young boy whose brother had been killed in an automobile accident.  He and his mother were very distressed and he wrote a note to the Pope asking him to pray for his young brother who had been killed.  The young boy who wrote the letter was only about nine or ten years of age.  Apparently, it was delivered to the Pope.  The young boy was at home one afternoon and received a telephone call to be told &quot;this is Pope Francis&quot;.  The young boy said that his mother asked him to write the letter and dictated it so the Pope asked to be put on to the boy's mother.  To think that he had that common touch shows an element of concern for and empathy with people, which we all need in politics.  It is great to see it in somebody at that level.  <\/p><p>I would like to see the Pope visit Ireland.  In many ways, I would prefer if it was a pastoral rather than an official visit.  Most of our human rights have emanated from our Christian traditions over the centuries.  These values serve us all.  I certainly concur with the motion that Pope Francis would visit Ireland.  I hope we would see that in our lifetime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900023#W01000","speaker":"1126","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392780000,"counter":189,"content":"<p>As a co-signatory of the motion, I wish to express my solidarity with my colleagues on all sides of the House.  I will not go into a very long discourse on the merits or otherwise of having Pope Francis visit this Chamber and, by extension, visiting Ireland.  However, it is important that we express an opinion.  The fact that this motion is before the House and that the Seanad is passing a motion endorsing the recommendations also elevates the invitation to a much higher level than what would normally be the case if it was just coming through the CPP.<\/p><p>  In the context of the impact Pope Francis is having in his short tenure, I looked up what were the top ten papal quotes.  I will not quote all of the ten but some of them are relevant as to why I believe a man of his immense humanity and ability should come to Ireland.  It is said that he is &quot;making waves by challenging Catholic leaders to build a 'church for the poor', urging the hierarchy not to be 'obsessed' with a few hot-button issues and challenging 'trickle-down' economic theories.&quot;  That alone is a reason that we should invite him.  Of course, his most famous quote was that relating to his attitude towards homosexuality.  What he actually said in an interview aboard the papal plane after World Youth Day in Brazil was &quot;if someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?&quot;  I think that was an extraordinary statement coming from the Pope when one looks at the history of oppression experienced by those who are gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender down through the ages.  He also said <blockquote>A person once asked me, in a provocative manner, if I approved of homosexuality.  I replied with another question: &quot;Tell me: when God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person?&quot;  We must always consider the person. <\/blockquote>  He also talks about the sanctity of human life, which is another reason to invite him because the vast majority of people in this country also value the sanctity of human life and he would, therefore, be coming to a society that would reflect his own views in that regard.  He has said: <blockquote>Just as the commandment &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot; sets a clear limit in order to safeguard the value of human life, today we also have to say &quot;thou shalt not&quot; to an economy of exclusion and inequality.  Such an economy kills.  How can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure, but it is news when the stock market loses two points?<\/blockquote>How apt but it also gives an insight into the humanity of this great man.  <\/p><p>  The changing nature of Irish society and, in some ways, the loosening of the bonds that existed between the Irish people and the Catholic Church as an institution is indicated by an interview conducted on behalf of major Jesuit journals around the world.  In the interview, he said: <blockquote>Instead of being just a church that welcomes and receives by keeping the doors open, let us try also to be a church that finds new roads, that is able to step outside itself and go to those who do not attend Mass, to those who have quit or are indifferent.  The ones who quit sometimes do it for reasons that, if properly understood and assessed, can lead to a return.  But that takes audacity and courage.<\/blockquote>If one looks at even those selected quotes, it gives a very rare insight into the thinking of this man. He is thinking in a contemporary context that is much different from his predecessor.  I believe they are as different as chalk and cheese and that Pope Benedict was a very conservative, dyed-in-the-wool orthodox Catholic.  Senator Walsh was exploring Pope Francis's background in South America and the development of liberation theology.  He has been influenced by all of that to an extraordinary extent - far more so than any European pope would have been, which must be a good thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900024#X00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1392780000,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I would like to place on the record a point of information relating to the Pope Francis's connection with Ireland.

As Members will be aware, Bord na gCon is a commercial State body established under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 and is responsible for the control and development of the greyhound industry in Ireland.  The most recent estimates available suggest that the greyhound industry underpins in excess of 10,000 jobs and stimulates &euro;500 million in economic output, particularly in rural areas.  <\/p><p>The greyhound racing industry receives financial support from the State through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  Payments are made from the fund to Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The amount allocated for this purpose is published in the budget and approved by way of resolution made by both Houses of the Oireachtas each year.  State funding provided from the fund is pivotal to the survival and continued development of the horse and greyhound racing industry.<\/p><p>The 2014 budget provides for an allocation of &euro;54.22 million for the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  In accordance with section 12 of the Act, this will be distributed as follows: 80% for Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, which in effect equates to &euro;43.37 million, and 20% to Bord na gCon, which equates to &euro;10.84 million.  The funding provided to Bord na gCon supports what is a very important indigenous industry and helps to sustain the role of greyhound breeding, training and racing enterprises in the development of our rural economy.  The industry has down through the years produced a very good return for the State's investment and is a significant contributor to the Exchequer.<\/p><p>Bord na gCon reports that since 2002, more than ten million people, including Irish people and tourists, have attended greyhound racing meetings throughout Ireland.  Greyhound racing is a tourist attraction which provides foreign visitors to Ireland with an opportunity to enjoy a good night out in nice surroundings.  The funding being provided to the greyhound racing sector helps to sustain a long-standing tradition as the industry is part of the social fabric of our country.  This funding underpins the economic activity in what are in many instances less affluent regions of the country.  It has also contributed significantly to the improved facilities now available at 17 greyhound tracks throughout Ireland.<\/p><p>Bord na gCon is a corporate body with a legal personality separate from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is the responsibility of the board of Bord na gCon to lead and direct the activities of the organisation.  I am conscious of the onerous responsibilities that individuals take on when appointed to the board of a State body.  It is important that people on the board of Bord na gCon have the appropriate mix of skills to enable them to direct such an important industry.  In common with other State bodies, Bord na gCon must adhere to the requirements set out in the code of practice for governance of State bodies and any other policy directives issued by Government, together with any demands in legislation.  My Department monitors compliance of Bord na gCon in this regard.<\/p><p>The annual report and accounts of Bord na gCon are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, having been noted by Government.  The CEO of Bord na gCon is accountable to the Oireachtas in respect of these accounts through the Committee of Public Accounts.  The chairman, chief executive and chief financial officer of Bord na gCon appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts in November last year in connection with the committee's consideration of the 2011 annual report and accounts of Bord na gCon.  Subsequent to this meeting, Bord na gCon provided additional material by way of written responses to issues raised by the committee.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is currently undertaking an examination of the Limerick stadium project, the results of which will be known later this year.<\/p><p>The overall objective of the Government is to ensure the greyhound racing industry achieves its maximum potential and in so doing contributes to the economic and social fabric of the country.  Successive Governments have recognised the importance of these industries for our country and have supported them through legislation and policy initiatives.  The support provided by public funds to investment in these industries through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund has enabled Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horse racing, greyhound racing and breeding.  As part of its overall commitment to the industry, the Government is addressing, through legislation, the anomaly whereby remote and online betting operators are outside the tax net.  The Minister for Finance has published the Betting (Amendment) Bill 2013, which when enacted, will extend betting duty to online and remote operators.  As Members will be aware, that legislation is currently going through the D&aacute;il.  When in this House some time ago I was asked to urge Government to bring forth that legislation as soon as possible.  I am glad to report it is making its way through the process.<\/p><p>On the review of certain matters in relation to Bord na gCon, the Government wishes to ensure appropriate arrangements are in place to facilitate the growth and development of the greyhound racing industry into the future.<\/p> <p>Following the completion of an open public procurement process I commissioned a very comprehensive independent review of certain matters relating to Bord na gCon in December 2013.  The review encompasses the policy, governance and regulatory framework and the financial situation of Bord na gCon.  The report documenting the findings of the review will assess the current situation with regard to Bord na gCon and will make recommendations as to any changes required to best place the industry to meet the challenges that lie ahead in a very dynamic and challenging environment.  I expect to receive the final report within months.<\/p><p>All stakeholders want the greyhound industry to be put on a sound footing and to prosper into the future.  I am hopeful that when the review is completed it will be a landmark to steer the greyhound industry and Bord na gCon into the future.  The industry forms a very important part of rural life.  Some 10,000 people, mostly based in rural areas, are involved in the greyhound business.  When the report is handed to me it will give us the opportunity to steer a path forward.  We want co-operation in this industry.<\/p><p>This is an industry that has got some negative publicity, but I believe it is important we are all singing off the same hymn sheet in this regard.  There is great potential for the industry and as Ireland comes out of the economic difficulties of recent years, the greyhound racing industry will play a huge part in the recovery, particularly in rural areas.  Some years ago the greyhound industry formed part of practically every household in rural areas, but that is no longer the case.  I believe there is a potential for this industry and we should support it.  I look forward to the Senators' contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900026#Z00300","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392781500,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this discussion on Bord na gCon, the Irish Greyhound Board.  I wish to ask a number of questions that have been sent to me by the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation in particular.  Of the funding of &euro;10.84 million for IGB, approximately 50% comes from the 1% tax on betting and the other half comes from Exchequer funding.  Funding for the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund is approximately on a 50:50 basis following the approval of the SI.  Therefore we must ask whether the taxpayer is getting value for money.<\/p><p>  Let us consider the IGB figures for the years from 2007 to 2012.  In 2007 in a strategic plan presented to the Minister, the tote turnover projected by the CEO, Mr. Nealon, was expected to increase from &euro;48 million that year to &euro;75 million by 2012 and the CEO was confident of achieving this.  However, the reality is completely different.  Tote turnover in 2007 was &euro;48 million, in 2008 it was &euro;44 million, in 2009 it was &euro;32 million, in 2010 it was &euro;24 million, in 2011 it was &euro;24 million, and 2012 it was &euro;19 million.  This represents a reduction of 60.4%.  How can anyone have confidence in an organisation that is getting &euro;10.8 million, half of which is coming from the taxpayers this year, and it is not even able to implement its own strategic plan?<\/p><p>  The 2012 IGB audited accounts were presented to the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on 12 December 2013.  When will they be published?  I understand they are due to go before Cabinet.  Why is there a delay in publishing the 2012 accounts, given that we are now approaching the end of the second months of 2014?<\/p><p>  A number of alarming questions about the stadia in Limerick and Dundalk have been raised with the Minister of State.  While I do not have time to go into the queries, I ask him to expand on the issue of the running of a so-called ringer in Dundalk, the audit that was carried out there, and the manner in which the auditor's findings were not published by the board.  In fact the IGB published its own findings.  I also ask the Minister of State to expand on the issue of the problem with the bend in the track in Limerick.  Why does Limerick Greyhound Stadium, one of the best in the country, continue to lose substantial sums of money?<\/p><p>  Does the Minister of State have complete faith in the board members of the IGB?  Obviously Mr. Nealon, the former CEO, has gone.  We need a full investigation into the destruction carried out in recent years.  We are talking about taxpayers' money.  Who will appoint the new CEO?  Will it be the board, as has been the case heretofore, or will the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine step in to appoint a new CEO?  If it is the latter, it indicates that the Minister of State does not have confidence in the board.  If that is the case, would he go so far as to call for the board to resign and a new board to be appointed?<\/p><p>  One of the genuine IGB board members, Mr. Brendan Moore, wrote to the Minister of State on 19 July 2013, outlining his major concerns.  He raised a number of extremely pertinent questions.  He stated:<blockquote>At the present moment Bord na gCon is heavily indebted to a commercial bank.  As the debt is not &quot;State guaranteed&quot; the tracks are taken as security.  The failure of Bord na gCon to identify and deal with a doomed business model for the last five years has placed the Industry on the cusp of disaster.  Confidence in the Industry is at an all time low ... The Board and Executive have not dealt with these issues in a transparent and competent manner leading to massive reputational damage at home and abroad.<\/blockquote>The indebtedness is approximately &euro;30 million.  I do not have the answers to these questions and I am not sure if the Minister of State has the answers.  If those answers are not available, it is time for a full independent investigation.  While an independent audit is one thing, given the nature of the moneys involved a full and transparent public independent investigation of the operations of IGB is now overdue.  I call on the Minister of State to instigate such an investigation.  This is an issue that will not go away.  Millions of euro of taxpayers' money is called into question here.<\/p><p>  The performance of the IGB since 2007 leaves much to be desired.  Why is the IGB refusing to meet the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation?  If the greyhound racing industry is to survive, all the parties must pull together.  However, a unified approach would appear to be unlikely, given that the board, the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, continue to exclude the owners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900027#AA00200","speaker":"1123"},{"type":"speech","time":1392781500,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We must be positive about these industries and promote them in whatever way we can.<\/p> <p>As previously stated by many contributors to the debate on the greyhound industry, it is an important sector which contributes greatly to the sporting and economic life of the country.  As has already been acknowledged, over 10,300 people are employed in the greyhound industry, which, in economic terms, generated &euro;500 million this year.  Budget 2014 included a provision for the allocation of somewhat over &euro;54 million in an 80:20 split to the horse and greyhound industries.  This substantial allocation of funds reflects the prominence of the greyhound industry in the country.<\/p><p>Greyhound breeding, rearing and racing is an integral part of rural life in Ireland.  While it is a relatively small part of the Irish agriculture sector as a whole, it is an important element in the country's livestock sector.  Successive Governments have recognised the importance of the greyhound racing industry and have supported it through legislation and policy initiatives, most notably the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 which established Bord na gCon, now the Irish Greyhound Board, the governing body of Irish greyhound racing.  The support provided by public funds invested in the industry through the horse and greyhound racing fund, as provided for in the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, has led to Ireland been renowned worldwide as a centre of excellence for greyhound racing and breeding.  The funding which has been allocated to this sector over the years has come back to the Exchequer tenfold and the greyhound industry has produced large spin-offs for the many farmers and service providers linked directly and indirectly to the sector's activities.  Funding allocated to the industry over the years has been used to invest in the local economy.  It has helped to maintain a long-standing tradition of the industry as one of the most integral social fabrics of the country.  It has brought employment and capital and social entrepreneurship to what are, in some cases, less affluent sections of our country.  Funds have been used to put in place infrastructure to allow the sector to maintain its presence in rural Ireland.  The horse and greyhound racing fund has directly contributed to the improvement of 17 greyhound tracks, including the complete refurbishment of Clonmel Greyhound Stadium and the Shelbourne Park Greyhound Stadium.<\/p><p>The greyhound racing industry attracts considerable amounts of employment and foreign direct investment.  It is the type of export-oriented industry we need.  It has enhanced our international reputation and attracted significant numbers of tourists to Ireland.  Each year, the Irish Greyhound Board welcomes 40,000 international tourists to Ireland's greyhound stadiums throughout the country.  France, Germany and the United Kingdom are the organisation's top three international sources for tourists.<\/p><p>The greyhound racing industry is worth in excess of &euro;300 million annually to the economy.  The sector continues to maintain exceptional growth.  On average, over 26,500 people go greyhound racing every week.  The Irish Greyhound Board, in conjunction with the British, American and Australian greyhound boards, is conducting the highest once-off greyhound race in the world, the &euro;1 million world greyhound championship, which will further develop the industry.<\/p><p>Approximately 20,000 greyhound puppies are registered each year in Ireland.  The introduction of funds is helping to bring about improvements in many facets of the industry.  This can maximise returns to breeders following their investment.  The support of the State has been essential to the survival and revival of the greyhound industry in the country.  My colleague, Deputy Ray Butler, has attempted to demonstrate this in recent weeks by travelling to London to support a bid by the British shareholders, breeders and racegoers to save the greyhound track at Wimbledon.  He presented the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, with a letter from the Irish Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, in support of Mr. Johnson and his campaign to keep greyhound racing at Wimbledon.<\/p><p>The greyhound industry in Ireland has contributed so much to the economic and social well-being of the country and its people and it is only proper that the State should continue to assist this valuable and growing industry, put in place infrastructure for the future and support and maintain the greyhound business in Ireland.  As I stated at the beginning, it is important for us to be positive about the whole industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900027#AA00300","speaker":"1124","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392782100,"counter":209,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm bheith in ann labhairt ar an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo maidir le tionscail na gcon.  Taca&iacute;m le cuid mhaith den mh&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; ag mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Domhnaill, agus ba mhaith liom cur leis.  As we know, the greyhound industry is a substantial employer.  It is not yet on a par with the horseracing industry in terms of funding or employment but it is nevertheless substantial.  It is concerning, however, to see that breeding is down 14% and that there is a shortage of dogs for races at the moment.<\/p><p>The latest estimates claim that almost 10,500 jobs depend on the industry and that these yield over &euro;21 million in taxes to the Exchequer.  The greyhound industry is funded through the horse and greyhound fund at a ratio of 80:20.  That is to say the horses get 80% and the dogs only 20%.  We hope that the greyhound ratio will increase.  It will be contributing more to the Exchequer when the Betting (Amendment) Bill is enacted.<\/p><p>The potential of the industry is considerable.  It is estimated that 40,000 tourists attended greyhound races last year.  However, there is a serious issue around the perception of the industry at the moment as well as serious questions around governance which must be raised.  The industry has modernised and made its image more sophisticated.  While attracting corporate clients and tourists, the greyhound industry must also be supported to continue to provide the facilities and recreation it always has to its usual punters at small tracks throughout the country.  It is a rather Irish sport and we are unique in this regard.  For this reason the regulation and funding of the industry must be according to best practice.  Therefore, the Minister must look to the debts that the Irish Greyhound Board has run up during the building of its new track in Limerick.<\/p><p>I have been in contact with the North East Greyhound Owners and Breeders Association and the Dublin Greyhound Owners and Breeders Association, whose representatives are welcome to the Visitors Gallery today.  I have talked to several people in the industry who have raised serious concerns.  Representatives of the industry have been looking for meetings with the Minister and the Irish Greyhound Board but they have informed me that these have not been forthcoming.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to put the matter to bed today and inform us that he will meet them as soon as possible.<\/p><p>There are serious issues relating to the debt of the IGB.  There have been resignations from the organisation in recent years and many related questions.  There are serious questions about the rebuilding of the stadium in Limerick, for example, and the re-design of the first bend in particular.  Some of the associated legal issues relate to injuries to animals, etc.  I have also heard reference to a significant amount of cronyism on the boards of the greyhound tracks and suggestions that the boards are being filled with political cronies, which is not necessarily the best way to go.  These people do not necessarily have the relevant expertise.  I hope the Minister of State will discuss the matter.<\/p><p>One of the biggest issues I have heard raised is the doping of dogs and the numbers using drugs to enhance their performance.  This is dealing a death blow to the whole industry.  I understand that in 2012, some 6,000 samples were taken from dogs.  As of January this year, only 17 results from those tests have been published.  There is a need for more independence for the control committee, which should be independent of the IGB.  People should be absolutely clear that any regime of doping will not be tolerated in the Irish greyhound industry.  I call for the transparent publication of all the tests that have been done forthwith.<\/p><p>Recently greyhound matters have been raised at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Minister of State mentioned this in his speech but he did not go into the detail.  I imagine there will be follow-up to the committee hearings.  I will be following up with my colleague, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, on the issue to ensure full transparency around the financial issues relating to the IGB.<\/p><p>I am led to believe that the tote figures, for example, are kept separate from the track accounts.  I understand that in recent years the tote has been the money generating operation and that the associated money goes directly into the IGB, while those responsible for the tracks are finding it difficult to maintain day-to-day existence because of the costs.  It has been noted in correspondence and it has been said to me that there is major difference between the tote receipts that had been projected and the tote receipts that have been seen, even taking into consideration the economic downturn.  Let us compare the tote figures for the horseracing industry and the greyhound industry.  In 2012, there was a 60.4% change in the tote compared with the horseracing industry change of 14.8%.  Something very strange seems to be going on.  I wish to emphasise that there is low morale among many ordinary punters involved in the industry.  Can the Minister of State reassure us that the Department is aware of the financial situation at Bord na gCon and whether there is cause for concern?<\/p> <p>Will he also indicate when he intends to ask that the 2012 accounts for Bord na gCon be produced?  Two reports relating to investigations into the sport that were commissioned by Bord na gCon and these have not yet been published.  The Minister of State is aware of the contents of those reports.  Is he in a position to reassure the House that the regulations relating to the breeding and racing of greyhounds are enforced and that compliance is the norm?  Will he publish the reports to which I refer?  What is the current status of the review of Bord na gCon, a report in respect of which is due at the end of the month?  What is his opinion on the industry and does he have a view on the direction in which it is going?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900028#BB00200","speaker":"1122","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392782700,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I welcome my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes.  He and I come from Tipperary, which is classed as the home of greyhounds.  In the past I was unfortunate enough to co-own and to be a member of syndicates which owned some seriously bad dogs.  I had the luxury of collecting winnings on perhaps only four occasions.<\/p><p>Dog owning and breeding are traditions which date back centuries.  As a person who hails from Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, I grew up in that tradition and I have a great interest in this matter.  While I was unfortunate enough to own some bad dogs, my father bred a number of very bad animals.  I wish to inform those in the Gallery that I share many of their concerns.  The Minister of State's predecessor, the late Shane McEntee, had a great interest in the greyhound industry and brought forward legislation which improved the position with regard to the welfare of dogs.  The Government has been in office since 2011.  A great deal of what has already been said in this debate related to 2007.  In one of his first actions since coming to office, the current Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, launched an investigation into a number of issues of concern.  I am deputising for Senator O'Keeffe, to whom the various items of correspondence to which previous speakers referred were also sent.  I read all of that correspondence last night.  We are all concerned with regard to the matters to which the correspondence refers and that is why the investigation is taking place.  The investigation will have to be thorough and it must deal with all of the allegations that have been made and all of the concerns that have been expressed.<\/p><p>We would be living in a fools paradise if we did not accept, as Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh rightly pointed out, that fewer people are visiting greyhound tracks such as those in Waterford, Clonmel and elsewhere is because the economy is on its knees.  People who used to keep dogs at home or who bred animals from a couple of bitches no longer have the money to do so.  In addition, others do not have the money to buy pups.  In the context of the export market to England, a friend of mine used to make full-time living from whelping litters of pups from a number of bitches.  Some 90% of his dogs came from England.  The English economy is on its knees and a previous speaker referred to the efforts being made to keep the greyhound track at Wimbledon open.<\/p><p>The problems relating to the industry are not specific to it.  They also relate to the economy which the Government inherited in 2011 and which was on its knees at that time.  The economy is slowly picking up and I am sure the greyhound industry will do likewise.  There will always be greyhounds and greyhound racing in Ireland.  However, we must place this matter in the context of the position in which the nation finds itself at present.  With respect, there are issues which must be investigated.  What happened in respect of the track in Limerick must be clearly spelled out.  There is no doubt that the tote is down.  I am very good friends with a bookie from Limerick whom I will not name but who specialises in horse racing.  He informs me that those who previously bet &euro;100 now only bet &euro;20 and that those who used to bet &euro;20 now only bet &euro;5.  That is why the tote is down.  It is unfair to try to make it appear as if there is a conspiracy afoot here.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has been charged with investigating the industry, Bord na gCon and the various allegations and assertions that have been made.  We want there to be a thorough investigation of the industry and we want the 30 or so issues raised by the Irish Greyhound Owners and Breeders Federation to be examined individually.  I put my trust in the Minister of State to see to it that such an investigation takes place as soon as possible.  I ask him to comment on the current position in respect of this matter when replying to the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900029#CC00200","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1392782700,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

Even the most cursory reading of the correspondence circulated to Members - I am not sure if it was circulated to those on all sides - gives rise to very serious questions regarding the status and ongoing governance of the various boards with responsibility in this area.  One of the reasons we received this correspondence is that the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, have refused to engage with the greyhound owners.  A letter sent by the Department states that the Minister is satisfied that the board continues to discharge its statutory and other functions and obligations on an ongoing basis and that, for its part, the Department continues to discharge all its monitoring responsibilities with regard to Bord na gCon in accordance with legislation and Government policy in respect of commercial State bodies.  In a letter sent to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, one of those involved in this affair indicated that, unfortunately, his experience was contrary to the views of the Minister of State and that regrettably he had left the board.  I do not know if I can name the individual concerned but I am sure the Minister of State is aware of his identity.<\/p><p>  The individual to whom I refer some very serious allegations, as did another involved in the industry in correspondence sent to the Minister of State in July last year.  The latter referred to political influence on the industry ensuring that people are not appointed on merit, that poor and suspect decisions have been made and that there must be accountability for the position in which the industry now finds itself.  I agree with that person's assertion to the effect that there are many positives relating to the Irish greyhound industry and that it has a core of highly skilled suppliers of greyhound stock who deserve their industry to be run fairly and its continuing viability to be ensured.  The individual in question further stated that Irish greyhound stock is renowned across the globe and that Ireland is accepted as the cradle of the best gene pools in the world.  He alleged that this reputation is at risk with the manner in which breeding and racing are regulated at present and proceeded to state that the problems of the greyhound industry are not new, that they are complex and that we are running out of time in the context of saving it from collapse.  He observed:<blockquote>The culture of the Industry needs to be changed and changed immediately.  I would ask that you carry out an in-depth review of the Industry by an external expert group ... The Industry can not be changed from within ... The political nature of the Industry must be removed.  Integrity must be restored as at present it is simply a buzz word.  The Industry at present is a charade due to failures to implement and failures to identify the requirements for a fair and viable Industry.  The corporate governance and compliance duties ... have also failed.  The morale of the staff and the confidence of the Industry stakeholders have been lost.<\/blockquote>These are, as already stated, these are extremely serious allegations, particularly in the context of what is a prime industry.  I am sure the Minister of State will be able to respond to them.  As stated at the outset, he does not appear to have been engaging with those to whom I refer or the greyhound industry itself.  He will have an opportunity to either refute these allegations or clarify the position relating to them when he replies.<\/p><p>  In the context of the investigation of so-called ringers running at Dundalk stadium, a matter to which my colleague referred, another item of correspondence states &quot;The Internal Auditor has since been paid off and has left the IGB&quot;.  The writer of this letter asks, &quot;How can a semi-state be allowed to spend tax payers money to remove a person doing their job correctly while continuing to employ the people that are in breach of rules[?]&quot;.  Again, these are serious allegations.  The individual who wrote this letter also states &quot;the treatment of the Internal Auditor and the Head of Compliance should be investigated&quot;.  There is much more involved but I will only make one final point.  It relates to the fact, as the correspondent in question indicates, that:<blockquote>The 1958 Greyhound Industry Act state that Minutes must be kept of all meetings of the Board.  The recording of Board meetings is a standard governance issue.  The minutes of the January 2013 Board meeting omitted reference to important information.  The February 2013 minutes acknowledge this fact.  The May 2nd 2013 Board meeting minutes have been changed to remove large sections of the record in relation to the Dundalk inquiry and the Board members reaction to a letter I sent to the Company Solicitors.<\/blockquote>It does not give me any great pleasure to place these allegations and charges on the record.<\/p> <p>If those involved, including a former board member, have taken the time and effort to write extensive letters of several pages both to the Minister and Minister of State the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine then at the very least it raises questions that need to be answered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900029#CC00300","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392783300,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I found the speech by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, of comfort but none is in the mood for such comfort because we all know the allegations against Bord na gCon are very serious.

Indeed the dog syndicate that my sister is involved with had a good win lately.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the O'Brien family of Cush and Kilfinane who had a tremendous success in the race at Clonmel with their dog, Vale View Flyer.  I am assured by all that the craic was a terror both on the way down and back.  I spent many a good night at various fund-raising and other events in the refurbished dog track in Limerick.  The dog track in Limerick lost &euro;368,000 last year.  Haemorrhaging money at that rate cannot continue.<\/p><p>In the course of his speech the Minister acknowledged that he is conscious of the onerous responsibility that individuals take on when they are appointed to a board of a State body.  It is important that members of the board have the appropriate mix of skills to enable them to direct such an important industry.  I am not sure if the board members on Bord na gCon have the necessary skills to deal with the financial crisis facing the industry.  The model of fantastic dog tracks was fine when the economy was booming and everybody had plenty of money, but times have changed.  The crux of the matter is political appointments to State boards.  My gripe is that when a new Government takes office, it clears out the existing State boards, and party loyalists or those who have done favours get a cushy number on a State board.  That does not mean the person appointed has the necessary skills to be on a board.  I do not think it is the way to appoint any member.  In fact a member of Bord na gCon who canvassed for his position on the board and was duly appointed, a man of the utmost integrity who is a neighbour of mine, has made his concerns known about other members of this politically appointed board.  People are not appointed on merit and this policy has served Bord na gCon very badly.  He admitted that he does not the skills to tackle this indebtedness.  I put it to the Minister of State that members of the board are out of their depth and they do not know how to deal with the issue.  This man became so frustrated with what was happening - the Minister of State knows the man and was made aware of the fact by the man I am talking about - that his only recourse was to resign.  I know that many of those on State boards would hang on with their fingernails for the perks attached to going to meetings.<\/p><p>What went on in Bord na gCon with the internal auditor is bizarre.  The internal auditor was involved in the investigation of running so-called ringers in Dundalk which was brought to the attention of the board, but then the two who were in charge of the investigation were shoved aside.  One of them is now back to work as the CEO has left, but the internal auditor has been paid off and sent out to grass.  I certainly smell a rat.  I am sure I am not the only one in the Chamber who smells the rat.  I wish to put a simple question which requires only a yes or no answer and I hope I get a response from the Minister of State today.  Is the Minister of State satisfied with the way Bord na gCon is being run and does he have full confidence in the board members?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900030#DD00800","speaker":"1119"},{"type":"speech","time":1392783300,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Heffernan for sharing time and I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Normally we have rather sedate debates in this House but there has been a disturbing vein of thought throughout this debate because people are concerned.<\/p><p>There are positive and good aspects of the industry.  The number of owners are still very strong and we have fine internationally renowned trainers.  We have new facilities, new tracks and the numbers going greyhound racing are such that the horseracing industry would like to have similar numbers attend horseracing meetings.  To put things in perspective, that element is very solid.<\/p><p>The business structure is the focus of our concern.  Members are asking questions on what the Minister of State is doing.  Let me remind my colleagues that Deputy Hayes was appointed in 2013 and he is not yet 12 months in the job.  I am more concerned about what action will finally be taken to address the issue.  The Minister of State should be allowed the time he needs to do the job.  He has commissioned a report which he expects to receive in the next two months or thereabouts.  We must be fair and wait to see what is in that report.  My colleagues have put their concerns on record and we all have received e-mail correspondence in the past days outlining deep concerns.<\/p> <p>There is no need for me to repeat them as they have been said already.  However, I am interested in the Minister of State's response.<\/p><p>The previous contributor spoke about the board and raised pertinent points, not just about Bord na gCon but also about the way we appoint members to every board in the country.  I am not referring to this Government or the previous one but to every government when i say that the message that must leave the House is a call to ensure that anybody appointed to a State board, whether political or non-political, and there is no sense in being political, must be qualified, able and have a deep and profound knowledge of and interest in the activities of the board to which they are to be appointed.<\/p><p>I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.  More important, I look forward to the results of the report that has been commissioned.  We must ensure taxpayers' money is well spent and is used to the advantage of the industry, those employed by it and the people whom it will employ in the years to come.  We have read the media reports, the Minister of State has heard the comments made here today and we have studied the work done by the Committee of Public Accounts.  To put it mildly, there are disturbing issues that must be addressed.  I have every confidence the Minister of State is putting in place actions to answer the queries and resolve the problems that may exist.  I look forward to the initial reply by the Minister of State but also to his substantial reply and action that will follow receipt of the report.  I wish him well in his important endeavours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900030#DD00900","speaker":"1121","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392783900,"counter":223,"content":"<p>I thank all the Senators for their contributions.  Some of the matters raised are internal Bord na gCon day-to-day issues, but the debate has been worthwhile.<\/p><p>The first thing I did when I got home from Dublin after my appointment last June was to drive down the road to Golden, near to where I live, to visit a man, Mr. Pat Dalton, who is known by everyone in the greyhound industry.  He is one of the world's leading experts on greyhounds, breeding, ownership, etc.  He has places in the United States and another place in Golden, County Tipperary.  I spent two hours with him on that occasion.  I met Bord na gCon as a group in Limerick on another day and I also met the board members individually.  After that, I visited greyhound tracks throughout the country.  I know a bit about dog racing because, like Senator Landy, I have been involved in syndicates that owned weak dogs.<\/p><p>I met many people on my visits throughout the country and soon realised that the industry was challenging and needed to be examined.  I gave it some thought and decided that the best thing to do, in consultation with the senior Minister, Deputy Coveney, the officials in my Department and Mr. Phil Meaney, the chairman of Bord na gCon, was to get somebody independent to conduct a review of the entire industry, from head to toe.  We set about an independent process by appointing a group using the public procurement mechanism.  The post was advertised and the guidelines were provided which I can read if Senators so wish.  The terms of reference were advertised and, through public procurement, Indecon won the opportunity to conduct the process.  I have spoken to the company and can confirm it is in the middle of carrying out its review.  Many of the concerns that have been raised in this debate, particularly the fears raised by Senator Mary Ann O'Brien, some of which I share, will be raised in the review.  However, I want to give the review time.  Indecon is only on the job since Christmas but we should have its report in eight weeks time.<\/p><p>When I was asked to attend this debate, I was very conscious that some of the issues likely to be raised would be dealt with in the report.  One does not buy a dog yet do the barking oneself.  The company comprises highly efficient people.  When it gives me the review, I will return to the Seanad to discuss its contents.  I hope that many of the issues raised in this debate will be dealt with in the report.<\/p><p>The issue of appointments is quite interesting and important.  It is one of the things I can do.  I can appoint people to the board of Bord na gCon, be it political or otherwise.  After meeting the board in Limerick, I met each of its members individually.  On that occasion I met a man called Brendan Moore who was appointed by my predecessor, the late Deputy Shane McEntee.  He had written to me and told me that day that he was not fit to be on the board.  I can remember asking someone, if he was not fit to be on the board, what he would do instead.  I was not going to force him out and waited six months.  He did not attended a meeting in those six months, and he is the man Senators quoted in the debate.  He did not attend a board meeting and when some moves were being made within the Department, because I was concerned that the position was in effect being left vacant, and we thought about moving him, we received a letter of resignation from Mr. Moore prior to Christmas.  Within days I made an appointment.  I did not, for the first time in the long history of Bord na gCon or any other board, go to any political party but looked for one person, and that person was a top class accountant.  After a lot of work and effort I was able to offer the position to Ms Riona Heffernan who is a financial director of the C&amp;amp;C Group in Ireland.  When one makes such an appointment, nobody can question it and that is the road that I will continue to travel.  In the next appointments I will make, I will examine each and every one because competence to me is number one.  This is because such people have a duty as board members because the board receives taxpayers' money and public moneys are taken in.<\/p><p>The fall in attendance rates and in the tote at race tracks is due to people not having as much money in their pockets anymore, as pointed out by Senator Landy.  It is a fact of life that nobody has as much money as they used to have.  There is a need to create other ways to attract people to our tracks and it is not just a problem for Bord na gCon.  Last week I went horseracing in Portlaoise and its organisation is faced with the same issue - attracting people to its race tracks.<\/p><p>There are a lot of issues to be addressed and people on the board have a lot of responsibilities.  There are dedicated people on boards, and on this board in particular.  The board of Bord na gCon comprises some very competent people.  It is the easiest thing in the world to claim they are political appointments.  There are quite good people on the board but these are difficult times.  Bord na gCon has many assets and the company is not broke.  Obviously it does not make as much money as it did due to times we live in.  Such matters must be dealt with and that is why the board must comprise strong people.  A strong board and an upcoming report will help it to change direction and will put the company in a better place to deal with the current economic reality.<\/p><p>Other issues were raised, including about the Limerick stadium, which issues were bandied about left, right and centre.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was not the Department responsible at the time the stadium was built.  It was under the remit of the Minister for the Arts, Sport and Tourism, led by our former colleague, Deputy John O'Donoghue.  He was the Minister responsible for the project at the time.  The matter is being examined by the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General and a review has been undertaken.  The Senators are right to say that if taxpayers' money is being wasted, the matter should be dealt with.<\/p><p>It is quite easy for Senators to throw muck and to try to get it to stick to me, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, or some similar person.  The reality is that a lot of what was said and a lot of the worry started before the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine became involved.  People should be aware of that.<\/p><p>With regard to the position of the new chief executive, Mr. Adrian Nealon has moved on to a position in another organisation.<\/p> <p>He was offered the position for another two years but he did not accept that because Government policy is to cut the salaries of chief executive officers and that was provided for in the contract that was offered.  He has another job now.  However, the Public Appointments Service, PAS, in co-operation with the board will engage in an independent appointment process similar to that used for the appointments of county managers, HSE directors or Secretaries General of Departments.  An independent process is being put in place through the statutory body, the PAS.  Hopefully, next week the board will place an advertisement in newspapers and on its website.  The board has been the subject of a great deal of bad publicity, which is not good for the industry.  We should be more careful about the message we send.  I want a good chief executive officer who will recognise the major opportunities for the future.<\/p><p> The issue of doping procedures was raised.  There are procedures in place and Indecon is examining them in its report.  I ask the Senators for an opportunity to return to the House when the report has been published and we will deal with the future of the industry.  The large outstanding debts and so on will also be dealt with in the report and we can have a more substantive debate then.  Decisions are made and sanctions are imposed by the central control appeals committee regarding infringements.  Results of positive tests are published in the <i>Sporting Press<\/i>.  They are not published until after the deadline for an appeal has passed or until an appeal has been heard and the findings issued.  The control committee sits periodically - approximately once a month.  Some cases are complex and take a considerable time to process.  The committee has 14 days from the date of a hearing to notify an individual of its findings.  He or she has then one month from notification.  A new committee was appointed in August 2013.<\/p><p> With regard to meeting people and consultations, I would like a representative body to be established by owners if they want to meet me.  However, it cannot be one group of owners in one part of the country and another group elsewhere.  I have arranged a meeting with the trainers association and I will meet a representative group for owners.  It is unfair to say I have not met owners because I met some in Ballykisteen Hotel in Tipperary at the end of October.<\/p><p> I am determined to make the industry work.  We are using taxpayers' money and I will make sure the industry is in a better place in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900031#EE00200","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Mental Health Services Provision: Motion","time":1392784500,"counter":225,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900032#FF00150"},{"type":"speech","time":1392784500,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I move:<blockquote><br \/>That Seanad &Eacute;ireann &ndash;<br \/>notes:- that the mental health policy, A Vision for Change, published in 2006 was a landmark policy in advocating both for closure of the old psychiatric hospitals and continued building up of community-based services as well as cultural change in the form of human rights-based and recovery-orientated services;<br \/>- that A Vision for Change was also progressive in taking a whole of population approach to mental health, recognising the importance of improving the mental health of the whole population of Ireland;<br \/>- that A Vision for Change recommended the strong participation of users of services and family members at all levels of the mental health service;<br \/>- that A Vision for Change recognised the importance that community networks play in the recovery model;<br \/>- that it was with the publication of A Vision for Change in 2006 that a recovery-orientated, holistic view of mental health was adopted; and<br \/>- that it was envisaged as a ten-year policy, due to be fully implemented by 2016,expresses concern that:- progress on implementing A Vision for Change has been slow;<br \/>- the Inspector of Mental Health Services found that mental health services were &quot;stagnant and perhaps have slipped backwards in 2012&quot;;<br \/>- the Inspector of Mental Health Services also found that most people will be offered a more traditional, medicalised version of mental health treatment rather than the holistic service propounded in A Vision for Change;<br \/>- people still regularly must resort to seeking help through A&amp;amp;E when in crisis due to the lack of universal community-based crisis support;<br \/>- A Vision for Change stated that 1,800 additional multidisciplinary staff would be needed to fully implement the policy but, despite promises to hire 891 new staff over 2012 and 2013, the total number of staff in the mental health services at the end of December 2013 was five less than in December 2012, and 908 less than the total staffing in September 2009; and<br \/>- home treatment is also not provided universally across the country;<br \/>- pending the development of an appropriate holistic community-based service, it is contrary to public health that the HSE continue to close any further acute inpatient beds;<br \/>- there is a lack of transparency and fairness in the process by which the HSE determined the choice of Roscommon over Ballinasloe for the retention of a 22 acute inpatient bed unit; and<br \/>- that there is a shortage of staff and appropriate infrastructure for mental health services notably in the Dublin north-east HSE area,calls on the Government:- to initiate a national programme of reform driven by the National Director of Mental Health;<br \/>- to ensure that a new culture is developed within the mental health service that fosters recovery and works in partnership with users of services and their relatives;<br \/>- to ensure that the recovery principle should underpin all mental health service delivery in keeping with A Vision for Change;<br \/>- to place a stay on the closure of acute inpatient bed units until such time as appropriate holistic community-based services are in place, including St Stephen&rsquo;s Hospital, Glanmire and Carrig M&oacute;r mental health unit, Shanakiel and Toghermore, Tuam;<br \/>- to state when the additional 1,800 additional multidisciplinary staff, over the numbers working in the service in 2006, will be provided for;<br \/>- to create a plan for the full implementation of A Vision for Change with key timelines and deliverables clearly identified;<br \/>- to carry out a full, independent, transparent and fair review of the decision to close the acute inpatient bed unit in St Brigid&rsquo;s, Ballinasloe; and<br \/>- to place a stay on and further bed closures in St. Brigid&rsquo;s Ballinasloe, pending the outcome of that review.<\/blockquote>As always, the Minister of State is welcome to the House to discuss these issues.  We did not table the motion lightly.  Such motions are sometimes interpreted as highly political or not in the best interests of patient or not in keeping with the configuration of our health services.  However, this is different.  As I have often said, nobody doubts the Minister of State's commitment to this issue.  Sadly, the treatment by the Government of her office, notwithstanding her commitment, is nothing short of disgraceful.  Successive governments throughout the history of the State have paid lip-service to our mental health services.  None of us could be proud of the evolution of policy up to 2006 but the policy, A Vision for Change, was then agreed and, as she correctly stated on radio this morning, this was signed up to by all Members of both Houses at the time.  We passed the eighth anniversary of the report lately and on that night I was promoting my own document on suicide prevention, Actions Speak Louder Than Words.<\/p><p>  Sadly, A Vision for Change is failing.  It remains a noble aspiration that all of us support.  According to John Saunders, chairman of the Mental Health Commission: &quot;What we have are football teams playing with half of their players&quot;.  I watched Manchester City play Barcelona last night and as that game proved, the best teams can be made to look mediocre.  That is what is happening on the ground in the context of our mental health services.  Sadly, the fight against loss of life through suicide is being lost hand over fist.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention is being starved of resources, is poorly structured and is buried within the bowels of the HSE, subservient to the budgetary demands of the Department and the HSE.  Media reports prior to the budget highlighted the Minister of State using stern and colourful language in exchanges with the Minister for Health and the powers that be about the fact that her budget was due to be stripped of &euro;15 million of the mythical &euro;35 million budget that is supposedly ring-fenced every year for mental health services.  I do not necessarily want her to confirm this.<\/p><p>  This is always the first port of call.  The HSE said it would fill the 70% of posts in this area that remain unfilled but recently the HSE stated that it would pick up the pace and employ people.  This will get the Government parties through the local elections but the reality is the Government continues to treat the Minister of State with contempt and with no respect whatsoever and despite her commitment, she is unable to do what she knows is correct, which is the speedy implementation of A Vision for Change.<\/p> <p>Geologists will have to ascertain the pace of the kind of change required.  It was envisioned that it would cost &euro;150 million and be completed in ten years.  We are a million miles away from where it should be.  As the Minister of State is aware, her Department is being starved of resources.<\/p><p>We are losing the battle with mental health issues such as suicide prevention.  There are higher incidences of mental health issues.  One in four has a mental health issue; one in 20 will have a suicide ideation.  It is okay if one does not need a counsellor in a school, a 24-hour social worker or any other support.<\/p><p>It now seems that in Ballinasloe, as well as certain parts of Cork, acute state-of-the-art services that cost &euro;3 million or more will be stripped back.  In the case of Ballinasloe, the service will put into UCHG, University College Hospital Galway, in a department which was condemned by the Mental Health Commission as unfit.  Anecdotal evidence suggests two patients at this unit have been sitting on trolleys in one of the busiest accident and emergency departments in the country waiting to be treated.<\/p><p>Is that the vision A Vision for Change promotes?  Does this give people dignity and respect at their most needy hour?  No, it does not.  Why is this?  It is because there is no respect for the Minister of State or her office.  The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, kicks it around.  If he needs &euro;10 million for the health services, he will take it from mental health services.  Mental health service provision will be put on the never-never and no one cares who dies from a mental health issue.<\/p><p>The decision on the Ballinasloe service was based on a flawed evaluation.  The Minister came up with criteria that suited himself for primary care centres.  What criteria were used to shut down this facility which has been described by Dr. O&rsquo;Grady and the 15 general practitioners in the area as clinically imprudent?  I understand the criteria used date back to 2006 which means it could not take cognisance of the up-to-date improved facility and staff complement.<\/p><p>The people of Roscommon have been treated disgracefully by the Government.  In an act of political delinquency, signed letters came from the Taoiseach and the Minister promising to keep the accident and emergency department at Roscommon County Hospital.  These were not worth the paper they were written on.  In the same way, the Minister of State has been given false and mythical commitments by her senior Minister.  She is subservient to him because he will not give her the money for her services.  There is nothing she can do about it.<\/p><p>Several years ago, the then Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, saw the light.  She knew she had a job to do but she could not be expected to do it as she was not given any funding.  The facility at Ballinasloe will be shut and moved to a site where haematologists and physiologists using it have described it as beyond capacity.  Last week, when the Minister of State was defending the decision to Deputy Colm Keaveney in the other House, the roof at the site was falling down.  It is now held up by RSJs, rolled steel joists.  Has the Minister of State been in Galway lately?  I am listening to the people on the ground telling me this site is beyond capacity.  The choice of stuffing this service into Galway is to placate Roscommon for the disgraceful way it was treated. The Government lost Deputy Denis Naughten, one of the best there has been in Leinster House, because of the lies told to the people of Roscommon about their accident and emergency department.  The Government must now do something for poor Deputy Frank Feighan who will be cleaned out of it because of the lies told before the election.  This is political expediency, as well as a flawed evaluation process which dates back to 2006.  The core principle in A Vision for Change is that there would be a consultative process for service users.  How many were consulted on these closures?  None.<\/p><p>John Saunders and Dr. McDevitt have claimed that the lack of pace in hiring key nursing and other staff is making it impossible for them to run inpatient outlets.  A Vision for Change is dead.  I will put it to the Minister of State again.  Her own senior Minister is treating her like muck.  He is making her look stupid because he will not give her the money she needs.<\/p><p>The latest victim to this headless chicken approach to health management and planning is this state-of-the-art unit in Ballinasloe.  Excellent services have been provided heretofore and the community is not ready to wind down such services.  I am sure some consultant or other will be wheeled out to claim this is the best way forward but the reality is it was a flawed evaluation process.  I, along with Deputy Colm Keaveney, have requested it to be published.  I know from freedom of information requests that it is impossible to get information from the health service but we will get to the bottom of this.<\/p><p>Closing this service will be a serious mistake by the Government.  A Vision for Change is all but dead in the water because the Minister of State is starved of resources.  Despite her wish and that of her predecessor as Minister of State, former Deputy John Moloney, who commissioned it, to deliver on it the reality is that it is failing.  It is failing because this Government does not give a tuppenny damn about mental health services.  The proof is in the pudding.  The Minister of State should not take it from me but from John Saunders and Dr. McDevitt, as well as the people from Ballinasloe here tonight who now see the latest innovation in the Government&rsquo;s headless chicken approach to mental health services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900032#FF00200","speaker":"1149","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392785100,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I second the motion.<\/p><p>My colleague Senator MacSharry has covered many of the points.  Members opposite should note we could have been far more critical when drawing up this motion.  It allows, however, the Government to review some of the decisions with which we strongly disagree.  While Senator MacSharry has addressed the issues concerning the Ballinasloe unit, the motion also covers St. Stephen&rsquo;s Hospital, Glanmire and Carrig M&oacute;r mental health unit, Shanakiel and Toghermore, Tuam, and the speedy implementation of A Vision for Change.<\/p><p>We debated this matter last year.  At the time, I put it to the Minister of State that putting one&rsquo;s personal commitment aside, her office is failing in mental health service delivery.  A Vision for Change sought 1,800 additional multidisciplinary staff to fully implement the policy.  Despite these promises, in 2012 and 2013 the total number of staff by the end of December 2013 was five fewer than 2012 and 908 fewer than September 2009.  If any Government Member argues we have sufficient resources in the mental health area, they must accept we do not.<\/p><p>Last week, I attended the funeral of a young man in north Dublin who died by suicide.  The priest officiating deplored the lack of adult mental health services in north Dublin.  I raised this with the Minister of State over 12 months ago and have continued to do so with the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  The Department shut the Curam Clinic, Swords, which provided adult mental health services for the whole of north Dublin and shoe-horned it into the back of a health centre.<\/p> <p> I will read the Minister of State a quote from the main clinical psychiatrist for the whole north Dublin region.  This goes back to 11 April 2013, it is still not resolved and we have still not managed to meet the senior Minister.  The clinical psychiatrist has been writing back and forth to the HSE and one of the e-mails states:<blockquote><br \/>I have just been informed that the psychologist employed for the mental health team in Swords has been working in the primary care centre in Coolock for the past few weeks.  This is because there is not enough space in the Swords health centre for her to work.  Another unusual upturn is that some of the nurses in this mental health team [which, by the way, was held up in 2010 as an example for the rest of the country regarding how this team would work under Dr. Declan Murray] are now based in Balbriggan, 20 km away, a surprising eventuality as when Cuirim clinic was closed last October, they were assured there was plenty of space in the unit.<\/blockquote>That is just one example.  There is not the space that is required and nothing is being done about it.<\/p><p> When one looks at the numbers and the commitment to ring-fence &euro;35 million, I would ask the Minister of State to enlighten us as to the pre-budget discussions, in particular her discussions and her submission, to try to retain the &euro;35 million she and the Government promised would be ring-fenced for adult mental health services, &euro;15 million of which is gone.  While I am not questioning the Minister of State's personal commitment, I have to say this is a failure.  It is a failure on her and her Department's behalf not to ensure this funding was not cut.<\/p><p> Let us consider the situation in the whole Dublin region in regard to adult mental health and early intervention for children, which is another matter that has been brought to the D&aacute;il's attention.  There is not one early intervention team in the whole Dublin area.  Not one child has been added to a waiting list since June 2012.  Does the Minister of State know the HSE is not adding to the waiting lists and will not even take applications for the waiting list?  It is true.  It will not add to them.  Children cannot even get a transitional plan or an occupational therapy report, and all that is being done is that charities are paying for it to be done on a private basis.<\/p><p> This is an important debate to highlight the issues that exist.  I ask Members to read the motion, which calls for something we have all agreed, namely, the swift implementation of A Vision for Change.  It calls for proper resourcing of the mental health services.  All it calls for in Ballinasloe and at St. Stephen's Hospital in Glanmire is for the Government to put a stay on the closure of those beds to allow a review to take place.  That is all it calls for.  I cannot understand why anyone in this House would vote against this motion.  There is no reason to do so.  Read it.  It is not politically charged.  It is stating facts and is putting forward a path to allow the Minister of State to say: &quot;Let us hold off on this before we make a mistake.  Let us review it.&quot;<\/p><p> If the Government moves ahead with the closure of these beds, we should remember what happened at St. Ita's in Portrane.  When it had to be closed, the Government promised that 38 beds would be available in Beaumont but those 38 beds are not available.  Last week, two people who presented for mental health beds in Beaumont Hospital waited for eight hours to be admitted and they left.  The clinical psychologist in north County Dublin does not know where those two individuals are now.  They waited for eight hours but there was nowhere for them to go.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900033#GG00200","speaker":"1139","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392785700,"counter":230,"content":"<p>The Senator must conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900034#HH00200","speaker":"1140"},{"type":"speech","time":1392785700,"counter":231,"content":"<p>We have to take this seriously.

I thank her for the work she is doing and has done in this area, and I know she is fully committed to reform.  However, reform is not something that is easily achieved.  It is something that affects people directly, in particular those who have been providing the services.  A Vision for Change was published in 2006.  It is interesting that my colleague across the House seems to forget that his party continued to remain in office for a number of years after it was published.  When we came in, the amount of change that had occurred was little or none.<\/p><p>  It is interesting to read the extract from the executive summary of A Vision for Change, which states:<blockquote>Specialist expertise should be provided by community mental health teams (CMHTs) - expanded multidisciplinary teams of clinicians who work together to serve the needs of service users across the lifespan.  CMHTs should serve defined populations and age groups and operate from community-based mental health centres in specific sectors throughout re-configured mental health catchments areas.<\/blockquote>Basically, the whole issue is about community-based teams, and that is what the Minister of State has been working through in this reform.  I accept there will be change and that it will not be achieved overnight.  The main point of the reform is the creation of a new division dealing with mental health, with its own budget and the appointment of a national director for mental health, which is proceeding.  There is a whole reconfiguration of services, which is proceeding.  The Senator referred to the budget.  The budget for this year for mental health is of the order of &euro;766 million, which is a substantial budget, so I am not sure from where my colleague across the House is coming.  Yes, we would like to put more money into mental health services, and we would like to create all of the changes overnight, but, unfortunately, we also have to deal with what we inherited in regard to the economy and, therefore, we have a limited budget and we have to accept that.  It is about using the budget we have in the best way possible and trying to bring forward the reform in the fastest possible timeframe.<\/p><p>  For example, the Government in 2012 prioritised the creation of 1,100 posts - 414 in 2012, 477 in 2013 and 250 in 2014.  Community health teams are to be made up of a number of different groups of people.  However, there are difficulties in filling all of these posts because, in some areas, we do not have people with the required qualifications.  For example-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900034#HH00600","speaker":"1150"},{"type":"speech","time":1392785700,"counter":235,"content":"<p>We need to put it back to the end of the year.

We need consultant psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and social care workers.  That is what the teams consist of and all of those posts cannot be filled in all cases.  However, the Minister of State is working towards filling every one of those posts that need to be filled.  Figures are already available with regard to what posts are filled and with regard to the targets for the end of this year.  I know the Minister of State will do everything possible to make sure those positions are filled.<\/p><p>There is also the whole issue of moving mental health towards primary care, in particular the counselling in primary care service, which was launched in 2013 to provide access at primary care level.  The target is to provide short-term counselling to more than 13,000 people, with eight counselling sessions to address mild to moderate psychological difficulties.  In July of this year, this was made available, and 2,648 referrals were made between just July and October, which shows that change is occurring.  While it will take time to implement and will not happen overnight, the Minister of State is doing everything possible, as are the Department and the people working within the HSE.  I accept there will be difficulties in certain areas and we will have to deal with those difficulties and move forward.<\/p><p>A Vision for  Change sets out that we would move away from the traditional institution-based model.<\/p> <p>I was involved some years ago in dealing with several nursing home cases.  One of them involved a member of the Army who was 18 years of age in 1956.  The Army authorities had written to his parents at that time to say that if they did not come to collect him, he would be admitted to a psychiatric hospital.  Fifty years later, he was still in that facility, even though everybody acknowledged there was nothing wrong with him other than that he had become institutionalised.  That is the system we worked with in this country for far too long.  That was the accepted norm in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.<\/p><p>We are trying to change the system so that such things cannot recur.  That change involves the provision of community-based services involving a comprehensive team of staff and a range of expertise.  The stigma that was attached to mental health problems in the past must be removed forever.  The Minister of State is working to ensure the changes set out in A Vision for Change are fully implemented.  By the end of the Government's term, substantial progress will have been made, in contrast to the delays that occurred between 2006 and 2011.  Certainly, within the next five years the bulk of the programme will have been put in place and fully operational.  I ask my colleagues to support the Government amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900034#HH00900","speaker":"1150","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392786300,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank her for the constructive and open manner in which she always approaches debates on mental health issues.  I have had many vibrant and robust discussions with her, both in this Chamber and at meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I am assured of her commitment as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health to delivering the comprehensive reform of mental health policy set out in A Vision for Change.  At the same time, I thank my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il for using their Private Members' time to raise these important issues for debate.<\/p><p>A key component of A Vision for Change is the move away from a dependency on inpatient care towards a focus on the provision of community care.  That commitment is one of the main reasons I am a champion of A Vision for Change.  In practice, it will amount to a significant and welcome realignment of perspective.  Unfortunately, however, the evidence suggests that we have a long way to go to achieve it.  The reality is that we have not developed community services to the extent that is necessary, particularly the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and the multidisciplinary approach encompassed in the provision of community teams.<\/p><p>The fifth annual CAMHS report that was launched by the Minister of State last week paints a worrying picture.  While there are improvements in some areas, there are others requiring urgent attention.  Only 66 of the 107 multidisciplinary CAMHS teams recommended in A Vision for Change are in place, with some of these only partially established.  Seventy additional posts in CAMHS teams had been filled by the end of 2013 compared with the end of September 2012, which is very positive.  However, looking at the whole-time equivalents figure of 531.76, we see that the total number of staff in place at the end of September 2013 was only 44.6% of what is recommended in A Vision for Change.  My understanding from talking to people outside the child and adolescent mental health sector is that these shortfalls in service provision are replicated across the adult sector.  Likewise, there is welcome progress in the indication that 50% of children and young people are now seen within one month of referral and 71% within three months.  My job, however, is to focus on the 5% of children who waited between six months and a year to be seen and the 4% who waited more than a year for a first appointment.  Adolescence is a critical time in a person's development.  The reality that almost 10% of young people are waiting between six months and one year plus to avail of services is of huge concern.<\/p><p>I have received a considerable volume of correspondence concerning the decision to close the inpatient bed unit at St. Brigid's Hospital in Ballinasloe.  I am sure the Minister of State has also received correspondence on the matter.  One can feel the hurt, upset and distress people are experiencing because of these types of decisions.  At the health committee yesterday we discussed the closure of Mount Carmel Hospital.  The main issue here is the way in which decisions are communicated and how the transition is managed.  People are chiefly concerned with their own situations, and we must find a better way of communicating with them.  Grand schemes are great, but people need to have certainty in regard to their personal situations.<\/p><p>An issue of particular concern is the perception, which was all too prevalent in the past and persists to some degree even now, that inpatient care for people with mental health problems is an end destination - that once one goes in, one will never come out.  That is not and should not be the case.  Inpatient care is part of a continuum of care which people may or may not need to access, depending on their needs.  Furthermore, it must be provided in an appropriate and timely manner.  I am not sure, however, whether the Health Service Executive is always the best choice to facilitate that process.  Perhaps we need to look to some of the private providers so that access in the timely manner that is required can be assured.  There must be an examination of how the State accesses and provides that type of care.<\/p><p>Of course, we must also ensure that inpatient care is of the highest possible standard.  To that end, all services in approved centres must comply with the regulations set out by the Mental Health Commission and accord with our international human rights treaty obligations.  It is incumbent on Ireland to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  All individuals, particularly children, have a right to a mental health service that is compliant with agreed standards.  This means not putting children and adolescents into adult units, as we continue to do in this country.  There were 102 children in adult units during 2012 and 68 from January to September 2013.  We all agree that this practice must be eliminated, but it continues to happen.<\/p><p>The motion rightly highlights the difficulties encountered by people experiencing a mental health crisis in accessing services.  This difficulty emerged as a paramount concern for people during Mental Health Reform's public consultation process in 2013.  One individual who shared her story with Mental Health Reform has given me her consent to share it with colleagues.  The name &quot;Sandra&quot; is a pseudonym but no other detail has been changed.  Unfortunately, her story is one with which many people who experience a mental health crisis will identify.  Sandra described as a &quot;complete nightmare&quot; the experience of having to seek help through a hospital emergency department.  She spoke of waiting nearly five hours to be seen, during which time, as she observed, she or anybody in that situation could easily go off and harm themselves.  According to Sandra, an accident and emergency doctor agreed that she was suicidal but informed her there were no beds.  She was sent home with a promise that somebody from the emergency department would check in with her by telephone the following day and that the community mental health team would be informed of her situation.  Neither of these actions was taken.  Having arrived at the emergency department by ambulance, Sandra was asked to make her own way home after being discharged at 5 a.m., a distance of more than 14 miles.<\/p><p>I am sure the Minister of State agrees that this is an unacceptable state of affairs.  Several contributions at Mental Health Reform's public meetings make it abundantly clear that for those experiencing a mental health crisis, the difficulties involved in going through emergency departments exacerbate their distress.  It was pointed out during the public consultation that accident and emergency is one of the only services available to people with mental health difficulties outside normal working hours, even though it is neither a desirable nor appropriate forum for accessing support and advice.<\/p><p>I conclude by referring to the role of education in tackling mental health problems.  The number of children and adolescents presenting with mental health difficulties, including alcohol and other substance misuse issues, is a cause for serious concern.  We had a debate in this House yesterday on homophobia.  The incidence of suicide, suicidal ideation and self-harm among LGBT young people points to the need for greater linkages between the education and health systems.  Early intervention and prevention are essential.<\/p> <p>Key to this is education at primary level rather than only at second level.  Mental health needs to be part of the curriculum.  We need to normalise and destigmatise mental health difficulties and distress.  Teachers tell me they are not armed with the information they need to speak authoritatively about mental health, to spot the signs or to access the resources and services they need.  If they believe a child is in crisis, they must watch while he or she waits three to six months to access services.<\/p><p>I wish to raise again with the Minister of State my concern that the child and adolescent mental health services was not transferred to the Child and Family Agency.  I believe they should have been transferred to that agency and that such services are clearly the remit of the new agency.  I am concerned and will remain so until it has been proven to me that the protocol for agreement between social workers and child and adolescent mental health services will work.  They told us they had difficulties when they were all part of the HSE.  They are now part of two agencies.  Will children have access in a timely manner to the services they need?  I believe we are on the right road but there is a long journey to go on this road of progressing mental health.  The Minister of State knows I will not go away on this issue.  We will meet one another regularly at meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  We have to do more.  Access to community services in a timely and appropriate manner in the context of the situation in which someone finds themselves is important.  When a person is in distress and has mental health difficulties, three months is three months too long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900035#JJ00200","speaker":"1171","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392786900,"counter":241,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The Minister of State and Members of the House will be aware, because I have said it often enough, that one of the reasons I entered politics was to try to add some small bit of value from my experience to the mental health services.  Prior to entering politics I was a psychiatric nurse.  It is looking increasingly likely I will be one again soon enough.<\/p><p>Some time ago, I had the good fortune to be involved in a literature review on an international level in relation to mental health policies.  One of the documents reviewed was A Vision for Change which ranked high, if not foremost, among the documents being reviewed.  My colleague, Senator MacSharry, and I have crossed swords many times, often robustly, in this Chamber.  Senator Darragh O'Brien called for Members on this side of the House to consider the actual wording of the motion.  I believe it is a decent motion.  I cannot see a great deal wrong with it.  It is a fair and good motion that offers us an opportunity to reflect on where we are in regard to the development of our services.  When Senator MacSharry says A Vision for Change is under pressure, we could shout &quot;politics&quot; and &quot;stop&quot;, but when the review of the independent monitoring group says the same we should take good care to listen to what they are saying.<\/p><p>We are not very good at policy in this country.  I am speaking not of the Minister of State or the current Government but of governments in general.  We often feed in policy at the top and expect it to come out oven ready at the bottom.  We sometimes fail to realise that each step of policy needs to be mediated through different levels before the objective is achievable.  A Vision for Change suffers from this weakness.  It is a ten year policy and we are eight years into it.  While A Vision for Change is being monitored by an independent group, there is no measurement or mid-term review built into it, which is a serious weakness.  Circumstances have changed and changed dramatically since 2006 when A Vision for Change was published.  We are in economic recession and it is well documented and known from international studies that recessions play a significant role in increasing morbidity in this area.  We need to stop, reflect and take stock of where we are.<\/p><p>There is a great disconnect between policy and practice in this area.  There is no question of that.  Senators van Turnhout, Darragh O'Brien and MacSharry have drawn attention to legitimate concerns in this regard.  As rapporteur on suicide prevention for the health committee, I am writing a report in which I am highly critical of our mental health services.  I have said many times in this Chamber - this is not a criticism of the Minister of State - that we do not do mental health services well in this country.  It seems to me there is nobody in charge.  There are no dedicated people with responsibility for named acts or omissions in this area.  This a fundamental weakness of our system.<\/p><p>The child and adolescent mental health services are newly established.  There have been great advances in this area.  However, is it acceptable that a 13 year old boy suffering from acute anxiety can be told he must wait eight months for an appointment?  How could we in government or anywhere else be proud of such a service?  We appear to have all the right language around this in that we all say the right things, with which everybody can agree, yet mental health services do not appear to be progressing at the rate we would wish them to.<\/p><p>The motion refers to several individual incidents of bed closure.  I am glad it mentions St. Stephen's Hospital in particular in this regard.  Prior to my becoming a Member of this House, I was a trade union representative for St. Stephen's Hospital for almost 20 years.  I am glad to be able to say I was part of a team that put together a template for community development in the north Cork mental health services.  A meeting was held today at St. Stephen's Hospital in regard to the very bed closures to which this motion refers.  Management and the staff representatives and organisations of that hospital have been working together on how best this issue might be addressed.  There are 26 beds at that hospital in two acute admission units.  The proposal is that one unit be closed.  This means there will in future be 18 beds on the campus rather than 26, thus freeing up 12.5 posts.  I use this as an illustration of how progress can be achieved.  Five of the 12.5 posts freed up will be moved to the community crisis intervention teams and five more will be moved to the amalgamated 18 bed ward.  While there is not yet agreement in regard to what will happen in regard to the remaining 2.5 posts, another meeting will be held next week to discuss the best way forward in that regard.  This is a bottom-up approach to the development of our services.  This is how progress has been made in north Cork for as long as I can remember.  As stated in the independent monitoring group's report, most of the progress taking place in terms of A Vision for Change is on a bottom-up rather than bottom-down basis.  There does not appear to be any leadership in this regard.<\/p><p>There is a need for calmness and strategic thinking on this issue.  Perhaps the Minister of State would take a more hands-on approach to it.  I do not know what HSE west is doing in that it has alienated all of its staff and the community in Ballinasloe.  I cannot understand that.  That has not been the experience in HSE south.   If HSE south can do things fairly well, why then cannot HSE west do so?  These are the questions that need to be asked.  Perhaps the Minister of State has a view on these issues and will share them with us.  I could talk all day about mental health but prefer when speaking on the issue to make one or two important points in order that all the other points do not get lost in the cacophony of my talking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900036#KK00200","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1392786900,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I do not believe she is the slightest bit comfortable here.  While she is always welcome here and is a good Minister and conscientious person, she looks thoroughly miserable.  Her body language is wretched and she looks ashamed and miserable.  I feel really sorry for her.  I believe she is in a very difficult position and that her heart is on the side of the patients and the people.<\/p><p>Senator MacSharry made a passionate speech.  It was splendid.  However, the person I honour most here is Senator Gilroy who spoke from the heart and told the truth, which is what we want to hear.  We do not want partisan point scoring.  It is for that reason I consider the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment rubbish.  It is tripe and part of a ritual.  What makes people cynical is that we are not telling the truth.  We need to tell the truth and face the truth.  If money is an issue, let us say so.  Let us face what our European partners, in robbing and stripping us during our financial collapse, which was their fault, have done to this country.<\/p> <p>As it happens, I will be supporting the Fianna F&aacute;il motion.  I pick and choose.  Sometimes I support the Government, sometimes I support the Opposition and sometimes I support the Independents.  The motion quotes the inspector of mental health services, who stated that mental health services were stagnant and perhaps had slipped backwards in 2012.  That is what he said, yet, with unbelievable gall, the Government motion \"notes the 2012 report of the inspector of mental health which highlights the continued progress\".  That is rubbish.  How can people believe in politicians if the director of mental health says it is stagnant or going backwards but the Government says there is progress?  It is an absolute tissue of lies.<\/p><p>The amendment refers to the ongoing closure of unsuitable psychiatric institutions and the moving of patients to more appropriate community-based facilities.  That is rubbish.  In fact, suitable psychiatric institutions are being closed and patients are being stuck out and left rudderless in the community.  That is what is happening.  When I was trying to run for President I went throughout the country.  It was pretty bad then but it must be a hell of a lot worse now.  The inspector's report consolidates this.  I met people, some of whom were in wonderful facilities largely created by voluntary work and fund-raising, and I saw people in the State sector who were heroic.  They were reducing staff and not replacing them.  People were working and exhausted but only because they were devoted to their patients.<\/p><p>The chairman of the Mental Health Commission said: &quot;But it is clear from reports of the independent body monitoring the implementation of this policy that insufficient community services have been put in place.&quot;  That is the official statement.  How can anyone possibly deny it?  Dr. Devitt, the inspector of the health services, said nursing staff numbers continue to dwindle.  This is what I was witnessing in 2011.  There were unfilled vacancies resulting in professionals being pulled out of community services to plug gaps in inpatient care.  That is the work of the State.  Worse still is what is going on to this day.  I was one of the signatories of a Bill presented to the House relating to involuntary electro-convulsion therapy.  Apparently, it is still being used.  This is a shame and a disgrace.<\/p><p>In the final part of my contribution I will concentrate particularly on the situation at Ballinasloe.  The reason I came to the House was because my heart was broken when I read some of the material that came in.  I have an e-mail from a clinical psychologist who is very concerned about the decision to close the beds.  From reading all the e-mails that have come in, it seems the points system by which these decisions are made is seriously flawed and has been interfered with to gear it in one particular direction.  That is grossly wrong.<\/p><p>Earlier, I referred to putting people into a rundown facility in Roscommon.  We are told that there will be a new 50-bed unit at University College Hospital Galway in March 2015.  This is 2014 and there is no sign of anything; not a blade of grass has stirred in it.  What the hell is going on?  These are people without a voice.  The voice they have is the voice in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and thank God it has been preserved.<\/p><p>I do not intend to mention the name of this man or his daughter but her mental health failed her early in her life and she has had a desperate lifetime.  Now, they want to close the only remaining acute unit.  This man's daughter was a patient in the unit until last March when she moved into a house in the community.  He is concerned that if she needs readmission there will be no place for her to go.  The patient is forgotten and the plan reigns supreme.<\/p><p>The position is that these institutions are returning money.  How is it that they are returning money from the budget every year?  Why are they not spending it?  This is a political decision as well as a financial one.  They spent &euro;3 million in the past year on the unit in Ballinasloe.  That is a total waste.  Why are they still pouring money down the drain?  It is the single most modern piece of infrastructure in that area of the west.  It seems to me quite extraordinary that it would be treated in this manner.  The survey carried out was a major disaster.  I wish to make a practical point born of human experience.  What about the damage suffered by the place in Galway?  We all know about it.  The Minister of State shook her head but I believe the roof is not even still on the building.  The man who contacted me said that he lives in Ballinasloe and that the trip to the overcrowded traffic-choked unit in Galway could take him two hours, while the trip to Dublin is one and a half hours.  That is what the Government is doing to them.  It is worse than going to Dublin.<\/p><p>The final example I want to highlight is a real heart-breaker.  It is from a woman who has a sister to whom she is devoted and who suffered from epilepsy when she was young.  That appears to have triggered some further mental distress.  She was put into care in Ballinasloe and her situation appears to have deteriorated.  She has lost her real emotional connection with her family.  She insisted her parents were kidnappers and not her real parents.  She said her real parents were coming to get her but that she would not be there because she would be at the Rose of Tralee festival.  She said her boyfriend was coming to get her and that she was going to be in a movie.  She said that she had all her bags packed and that she would wait.  It was heart-breaking.  That was her reaction to being five minutes from her home.  What on earth would the devastation to that poor bewildered woman be like if she is moved so far away from where she is?  We must also consider the impact on the patient's family.  It is not only devastating for the patients themselves.  Then there is the fact that there was no proper consultation process.<\/p><p>I will end with the most heart-breaking thing of all.  A woman wrote to me and said that when she was a child she used to watch her parents looking after her sister while she had an epileptic attack.  She said she would hear the screams that preceded a seizure and she would run through the house, the classroom, the schoolyard or wherever - it did not matter.  She would cradle her sister's head and let her dig her nails into her arm.  The woman had watched her mother and father do this and so she did it too.  She said she figured the e-mail was simply another way of trying to cushion her sister's fall and keep her head from hitting the floor.  It was a way of cradling her and letting her nails sink in because she loved her sister.<\/p><p>We should consider this in the light of the fact that money is put back into the Exchequer and in light of the contradictions in the motions.  I know the Minister of State and how humane and decent she is.  I do not know how difficult it is to be in government because I have never been in government and I never will be.  However, I will continue to be a gadfly on the rump of Irish political life for as long as I can.  I am sorry if it stings my friends - the Minister of State is definitely one of them - but I urge her to take this debate as support in her fight to look after the people who are most vulnerable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900036#KK00300","speaker":"1136","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392787500,"counter":244,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I thank my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues for using their Private Members' time to discuss this vital topic of mental health services.  I welcome the many friends from the community in Ballinasloe who are present in the Visitors Gallery for the debate this afternoon.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the personal commitment of the Minister of State to driving the Vision for Change concept and her success in securing the resources required to deliver a community-based service, which is gradually being put in place and working well in many parts of the country.<\/p><p>I accept that not as many resources as the Minister of State would wish are being put into the service, but I recognise she is fighting a good battle in that regard.  The experts tell us this delivers the best possible outcomes for patients.  However, there will always be a need for acute beds in the system.  A Vision for Change recommends 50 beds for a population of 300,000 people.  Currently there are 35 acute beds in Galway city and 22 each in the hospital in Roscommon and St. Brigid's Hospital, making a total of 79 beds for a population of approximately 315,000 people.<\/p> <p>I accept that under A Vision for Change this is too many beds.  A steering group assessed the merits of Roscommon and Ballinasloe and, using a scoring system, decided that the Roscommon facility was preferable.  In my opinion and in the opinion of mental health clinicians and hospital consultants, the scoring system was flawed and does not stand up to close scrutiny.  As the Minister of State is aware, the Roscommon unit is located beside a category 2 hospital while the Ballinasloe unit is close to a category 3 hospital, Portiuncula Hospital.  Despite this, under the scoring system used, Roscommon scored ten under the heading \"adjacent to a main or regional hospital\".  This is just one of a number of scores that do not add up.  For any major project in the health area to succeed and to gain acceptance by those using the service, their families, the staff and the community, there must be honesty and transparency in decision-making.  There must be respect for patients, staff and community and good communications.  It is with great regret that I say to the Minister of State that HSE west management displayed total disrespect for patients, staff and the people of Ballinasloe by their actions in dismantling beds in the acute unit in Ballinasloe last night in the knowledge that a Seanad debate was taking place today.  If it wanted to alienate a community, it went the right way about it.  They showed no respect to me or to my colleagues, as Members of the Oireachtas, given that we were led to believe no beds would be removed in advance of today's debate.  I welcome the fact that following my intervention last night, the beds were returned to the acute unit.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State is aware, Ballinasloe has been synonymous with the provision of mental health services for more than a century.  The services have changed from an institutional setting to a community-based model.  East Galway mental health services have been implementing A Vision for Change effectively for many years and in many instances are well ahead of the curve in comparison with other parts of the country.<\/p><p>I place on record the appreciation of the community, the service users and their families to the wonderful staff who provide mental health care in our community.  I have been deeply moved, as has Senator David Norris and others who have spoken, by the huge volume of testimonies I have received from so many patients and their families who have benefited from care in St. Brigid's Hospital acute unit.  The acute unit in University College Hospital Galway is a 1970s building in very poor condition.  It is on an exceptionally cramped site and is difficult for patients and families to access and has totally inadequate parking facilities.  The Roscommon unit is beside a category 2 hospital while a state-of-the-art facility costing &euro;3 million is on a fabulous site close to a category 3 hospital.<\/p><p>It makes sense to use that beautiful facility in Ballinasloe.  I am not asking, and neither is the proposer of the motion asking, the Minister of State to reverse any particular decision in relation to A Vision for Change.  I support the whole concept of A Vision for Change but I am unhappy with the scoring system used.  I implore the Minister of State to review the scoring system that decided the Roscommon facility was more suitable than the Ballinasloe facility.  That is not too much to ask.  While that review is taking place, I ask the Minister of State to give a commitment that no further beds will be removed from the facility in St. Brigid's Hospital.  I support the concept of A Vision for Change but I appeal to the Minister of State, in order for the system to have credibility and to get the support and the buy-in of the community and the people of Galway and Roscommon, to ensure there is no doubt about the honesty and the veracity of that scoring system.  The Minister of State would do a great service to the provision of mental health services in Galway and Roscommon if she can accede to that part of the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900037#LL00200","speaker":"1118","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392788100,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.

It is our centre of excellence for cardiac, cancer and many other issues and does not need the mental health unit there as well.  It is overcrowded and to decide to put more facilities in University College Hospital Galway is to downgrade that hospital.  For example, there is a proposal to move the addiction and counselling service from Merlin Park to that hospital, which I vehemently oppose.

Some &euro;2.8 million or &euro;3 million has been put into the unit at Ballinasloe and now it is being taken out.

We know that people at risk of mental health issues do not deal well with change.  Where they have been served and taken care of well, let us maintain it.

We have maintained our professional dignity as we believe that public wrangling can only sow disquiet amongst those we profess to serve, our current and indeed potential future service users.  However, at this juncture I can no longer remain silent and in the face of a campaign of apparent vilification, the aim of which appears to be to heap odium upon this service, I have the utmost regard for all staff members and can no longer tolerate inaccurate comments that can be construed externally as a denigration of their professional standards and care.  My main concern, however, in the midst of these issues, is that any individual, whether currently attending this service or whether considering approaching this service for assistance, is deterred from doing so in light of inaccurate public comment.<\/blockquote>I would also like to tell the Senators that the national director of mental health visited Galway University Hospital and its mental health unit.  That person found that the area where the leak was - not the roof gone but where the leak was - was closed, there were empty beds in the unit, the unit was extremely calm and the executive clinical director there was very happy with the service as it was progressing.  We need to be careful.  There are people delivering a service which we want them to deliver so we should be very careful about how we describe them and the care they give to others.  <\/p><p>  I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the important issue of mental health in open discussion - as I have always done - on Private Members' business in the Seanad.  Mental health is a subject that is obviously close to the hearts of many Senators.  I am right in saying that we have cross-party support for A Vision for Change.  I do not doubt that for one minute despite what we have heard in the past few weeks.  <\/p><p>  In 2006, A Vision for Change was widely welcomed as a progressive, evidence-based and realistic document that proposed a new model of service delivery which would be patient-centred, flexible and community-based.  Much progress has been made in closing many of the old psychiatric hospitals and providing modern acute inpatient as well as community-based facilities and services.  Someone that I always admired in this field was former Minister of State, John Moloney, and before him, Tim O'Malley.  We sometimes forget their work.  Through circumstances beyond their control, progress was not made on A Vision for Change programme.  Even while progress was not being made by the Government, the services were progressing.<\/p><p>  A Vision for Change recommended a move away from the old institutional system of mental health service delivery to delivering comprehensive care in a variety of settings, including the home, community and in hospital.  Despite the extraordinarily difficult economic environment we now find ourselves in, much progress has been made in implementing key recommendations.<\/p><p>  If Senators have a copy of my speech, they will see that I have deliberately focused on the pieces that the motion has asked us to deliver on.  Therefore, I will not read out the sections typed in red and will concentrate on the specific points included in the motion.  The first item is the call for a reform programme to be driven by a national director of mental health.  In July 2013, Mr. Stephen Mulvany was appointed as the first national director for mental health and, as such, has full authority and responsibility for the implementation of A Vision for Change.  Since his appointment, Mr. Mulvany has met every mental health management team across the country to create concrete, coherent and deliverable plans to realise the vision commitments in their catchment areas.  This level of planning has been crystallised in the HSE's national service plan and the recently published operational plan for mental health.  Each service has declared its immediate and key objectives for 2014 which are explicitly stated and documented.<\/p><p>  Mr. Mulvany has also conducted a detailed audit of the human resources down to team level for all mental health services reporting to him.  This will guide him on how the 2014 investment of &euro;20 million will be allocated to ensure equity and drive further innovation; that a new culture is developed within the mental health service that fosters recovery and works in partnership with users of services and their relatives; and to ensure that the recovery principle should underpin all mental health service delivery in keeping with A Vision for Change.<\/p> <p> Since 2006, the HSE has invested in many innovative initiatives to promote the service user and family perspective.  Every acute unit has a trained peer advocate available to all inpatients to provide information, assistance, welfare and housing advice, personal advocacy and a recovery guide.  Collaborative leadership and change management programmes have been delivered at DCU and I have had the pleasure of meeting many graduates from this exciting and integrated programme of change, which includes service users, family members and mental health professional.  An academic post for an expert by experience has been in place since 2009 to provide robust evidence and rigour to the service user's viewpoint.  The national mental health division has appointed an interim service user adviser to work with service user and carer organisations to ensure their viewpoint is heard and heeded at all levels in our mental health services.  There are trialogue meetings with service users, family members and mental health professionals engaging in a direct debate on the needs of service and how these can be best delivered in a coherent and effective manner.  The EOLAS knowledge and understanding innovative programme offers pragmatic information and guidance to families living with mental illness and we hope to extend the reach of this well regarded programme during 2014.<\/p><p>Advancing Recovery in Ireland, ARI, which is an incredible programme, supports mental health services in re-orientating service objectives to facilitate and not impede recovery.  It must be the ambition of every service user to return to his or her home and family.  ARI works with services to make sure that all aspects of service from acute community, acute inpatient, rehabilitation and recovery teams and residential supports are designed to maximise independence and progression towards a high quality of life within the community.  For too long the professional knew best and this led to a power imbalance, which is being rebalanced at long last, not by rejecting the professional viewpoint, which we cannot, but by ensuring the service users and carers' voices are also heard and acknowledged.<\/p><p>The motion seeks &quot;to place a stay on the closure of acute in-patient bed units until such time as appropriate holistic community-based services are in place, including St Stephen's Hospital, Glanmire and Carrig M&oacute;r mental health unit, Shanakiel and Toghermore, Tuam;&quot;.  Modern community-based teams and services have being created all over Ireland by recasting the skilled human resources trapped within institutional and residential service models.  Staff have developed a broad range of skills which have outgrown the confines of the bedside and wish to work with service users within their own homes and communities.  Modern mental health services are predominately community-based and, as in the acute hospital sector, acute inpatient stays are reduced by investing in community-based care models.  The average stay in an acute mental health unit is down to 11 days.  This reflects the service users strong preference for care at home and within their community.<\/p><p>Along with the investment of new skills and professions on our community mental health teams, including clinical psychology, social work, speech and language therapists, child care workers and occupational therapy, the HSE has trained more than 40 facilitators to work with teams on the enhancing team working programme to ensure team effectiveness and focus.  When a team is put together, one does not choose the person with whom one works.  It does not automatically become a functioning team and that is why we have to work on this.  However, it is not possible to run old style residential services and to develop fully staffed community mental health teams.  The skilled and experienced staff required for the teams are all too often trapped within institutional service models.  We must escape the gravitational effect of these old institutions and liberate the service users and the dedicated staff who serve them.<\/p><p>People with mental illness have been hidden away for too long living in a parallel universe away from their own communities.  This is no longer an acceptable model; we can and must do better. There always will be a group of individuals who require acute inpatient care and whose mental health needs are best met in hospital.  We have invested more than &euro;200 million providing superior inpatient settings for people with mental illness.  Follow-on care and continuing care plans are designed for all service users as they progress towards recovery and staff released from inpatient commitments continue to work with service users in their new home settings.  Some mental health services have found it difficult to move away from residential service models and, in some instances, replaced hospital care with residential hostels but the journey has been incomplete.  Service users have the same right to live within their communities and to enjoy the benefits of community living while continuing to receive support from rehabilitation specialists and community mental health teams.  New improved facilities are in train to replace older facilities that can no longer meet the needs of 2014.<\/p><p>Since A Vision for Change was published in January 2006, we have made major investments in mental health capital developments in counties Cork, Dublin, Limerick, Westmeath, Galway, Donegal, Wexford and Tipperary to replace older and unsuitable facilities.  We need to offer modern service settings for users and a modern and sustainable workplace for our staff.  We will replace the Central Mental Hospital at Dundrum with a new state-of-the-art facility at Portrane by 2017, which will be supported by intensive care rehabilitation units.  This is an extraordinary programme of works and all have been advanced under the guidance of A Vision for Change.  It would be unethical to pause this progress and to retreat back into the past.  I have no mandate for such a move and can see no good reason to lose the momentum gained since I took up this office.<\/p><p>The motion states, &quot;when the additional 1,800 additional multidisciplinary staff, over the numbers working in the service in 2006, will be provided for&quot;.  I attend the House regularly to discuss mental health issues.  I have never said that we have reached that point.  We are not there yet but the push that has been made over the past three years is significant and we need to keep going.  In the context of the economic difficulties, it has not been possible to reach the 10,657 whole-time equivalent posts, WTEs, described in A Vision for Change.  At the end of December 2013, a total of 9,052 WTEs were working in our mental health services.  This presents a challenge and requires us to ensure all staff are positioned in the most effective settings, on the front-line, responding to current and assessed needs.  The national director for mental health has an additional 250 to 280 WTEs to allocate in 2014 in addition to the 2012 and 2013 posts.<\/p><p>With regard to Senator van Turnhout's comments, last week I launched the HSE's fifth annual child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, report, which clearly shows a massive 50% increase in the number of staff working in children's mental health since A Vision for Change was published.  This focused year on year investment on teams and a quadrupling of CAMHS beds in the past eight years extends the reach of our mental health services for children.  Today more than 17,000 young people attend CAMHS.  I agree with the Senator that even 5% is too much but it is something on which we have to keep working.<\/p><p>The motion then refers to creating &quot;a plan for the full implementation of A Vision for Change with key timelines and deliverables clearly identified&quot;.  The HSE's national operational plan for mental health was published on 30 January and I encourage colleagues to read this detailed document.  It clearly sets out the targets and ambitions for 2014, which have been costed and are deliverable within the available resources.  All these commitments are fully aligned not only to the values of A Vision for Change but also to its recommendations.  With additional resources we can do more, but we must be realistic and drive forward within the known and available resources.<\/p><p>The motion calls on the Minister &quot;to carry out a full, independent, transparent and fair review of the decision to close the acute in-patient bed unit in St Brigid's, Ballinasloe; and to place a stay on any further bed closures in St. Brigid's Ballinasloe, pending the outcome of that review.&quot;  I am absolutely confident that the decision to close the old hospital at St Brigid's Ballinasloe is correct and I checked this again earlier.  I apologise to the Senators and Deputies from the area for the confusion that was caused last night.  This should not have happened.  A transparent and careful set of criteria was applied by a panel of experienced mental health professionals and the decision stands.  I have met senior clinicians, the service managers and local service users and there is a great desire to see the promise of A Vision for Change fully realised in counties Galway and Roscommon.  I have also met people who have expressed genuine concerns but I encourage them to examine the progress that has been made in other parts of the country and to embrace the objectives in A Vision for Change.<\/p> <p>I invite those people to visit such an area which I will arrange.  Stigmatising and scaremongering can have no place in this debate.  We are working to provide a range of services for young people, adults and older persons who are seeking help in an acceptable form, which they are comfortable with and are supported by modern practice and evidence.<\/p><p>Nothing is happening in County Galway that has not already been delivered in most other parts of the country.  The staff and clinicians at Ballinasloe have worked hard for many years to return patients from St. Brigid's to their home communities and to fully support them on that journey.  No one has ever told me that the staff have been behind the corner in delivering A Vision for Change.  To bring that to the next stage we need to further rationalise acute bed provision.  This is completely consistent with A Vision for Change recommendations.  Some staff employed in St. Brigid's have recently submitted expressions of interest for redeployment to other roles in mental health services in the area.  It must be stressed that modernisation of services is taking place with no impact for current inpatients in Ballinasloe.<\/p><p>A Vision for Change recommends 50 beds for a catchment population of 300,000.  It is clear, therefore, in line with policy and operational norms nationally, that the provision of 22 beds in both Ballinasloe and Roscommon means that the current overall stock of 76 in HSE west is too high in relative terms, allied to a corresponding underdevelopment of community-based mental health services.  In the context of the service improvements now under way, a purpose-built 50 bed acute mental health unit will be completed in Galway University Hospital in 2015 to replace the existing smaller unit.  This unit will consist of 35 general adult mental health beds-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900040#OO02500","speaker":"982","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1392790500,"counter":298,"content":"<p>Is there any chance we could contribute to this debate?

The acute unit in Roscommon will continue to provide 22 general adult mental health beds.<\/p><p>We must make rational decisions if we are to create and reinforce the community mental health teams around which A Vision for Change model is built.  A Vision for Change recommends a catchment area of this size would have nine community residences for rehabilitation and continuing care.  There are currently 58 such hostels in this catchment area, 11 of which cater for people with an intellectual disability.  This level of support has absorbed a significant amount of resources and we need to see how we can best marshal our available resources to the best effect.  We need to look to the future.  Excellent models like Jigsaw in Galway city have been supported by reworking old resources.  The funding for the brand new 20-bed child and adolescent unit at Merlin Park has been fashioned from the reinvestment of savings achieved through the decommissioning of older services<\/p><p>Why would we stop now?  We must remember that St. Brigid&rsquo;s Hospital opened in 1833 and accepted patients from all over Connacht.  The hospital had a long and honourable tradition of care and support when hospitalisation was the only model of service available to distressed and mentally ill members of the community.  Today, we have better options to offer, so we must modernise.  At the end of 2013, there were 920 posts in the Galway-Roscommon mental health service.  We now need to create a sustainable model of service.  In 2013, this service spent over &euro;61 million which is &euro;194 per head of population, significantly above the national average of &euro;168.  Galway-Roscommon has a population of over 314,000 people, 6% of the national population, but currently spends 10% of the national mental health budget.  This creates an equity issue as overspend in one area creates a corresponding underspend elsewhere.  This imbalance also occurs within the catchment area with a significant imbalance of resources for the population living in sectors Galway-Roscommon 1, Galway-Roscommon and Galway-Roscommon.  The overconcentration of resources in one area is at the expense of its neighbouring catchment.  This cannot continue in a nationally managed mental health service.<\/p><p>National and local managers are working to address this imbalance to ensure all communities can avail of resources that are fairly and evenly distributed.  We welcome the passion and commitment people have shown to protect their mental health services.  I invite the people of Galway and Roscommon to work with us to reshape this resource into a more modern and dynamic service model.  This service has a history of innovation and has adopted many of the recommendations of A Vision for Change and, indeed, 1984&rsquo;s Planning for the Future.  Now that we are about to take the final steps into the community, we should not pause on the progress made but continue what we have started.<\/p><p>A comprehensive review of services in this area has shown there are sufficient resources to deliver on all aspects of A Vision for Change, but we need to ensure it is properly configured to meet the modern needs of the population particularly young people, adults, older adults, people with very particular needs.  Are we suggesting we halt the extraordinary progress made across the country where clinicians, managers, professional staff and service-users have worked to move away from this institutional model of care?  Have we learned nothing from our past?  We have recently dealt with residential homes, Magdalen laundries and old and remote psychiatric hospitals.  I heard a Deputy in the other House earlier talking about allowing people wander the fields.  Surely not.  We continually encourage people at a time of distress to come forward, talk it through, seek help and treatment.  The historical legacy of the asylum still lingers on in the public imagination, however.  We are now towards the end of that journey.  Are we to turn back and reverse the work of the past 30 years?  Let us not forget the stigma which has been associated with these services in the past, the hopelessness and the sense of abandonment felt by service users.  We cannot halt the progress of A Vision for Change and we can no longer disappoint vulnerable individuals in our communities who wish to re-gather their lives, have treatment and return to school, college, work, their families and their homes.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the professionals, staff, managers and various leaders who have done so much, in difficult circumstances, to modernise our mental health services and who have no desire to hold back the tide of progress and return to limiting, stifling and institutional ways.  When we look back at the services in the past, we must admit they did it with the best intentions and to ensure the best care was provided.  I hope when people look back on us, that they will be as kind to us.  We do no better and we know there is a better way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900042#QQ01000","speaker":"982"},{"type":"speech","time":1392790500,"counter":307,"content":"<p>On a point of order, I want to clarify a point for the Minister.

I have listened to people from both the Government and Opposition over the past hour and a half.  I remember how about four years ago in Waterford, a geriatric care unit, which was coincidentally called St. Brigid's, in St. Patrick's Hospital closed.  At the time it was closed, I remember that promises were made by the then Government that replacement beds would be put in place.  I remember saying that once the unit was gone, it would be gone forever and that without a guarantee of replacement beds, I was not going to buy a pig in a poke.  What happened?  The ward was closed.  Guess what?

The reality is that if the beds are taken from Ballinasloe, it will be a loss to that area and community and I can understand its fears.<\/p><p>I have listened to this debate for the past hour and a half.  Even a number of Government Senators have talked about the criteria process, which they believe has not been applied fairly.  I know they are from the constituency and are perhaps under political pressure.  These are not Opposition Senators but Government Senators.  One said he would abstain and another was quite critical of the decision that was made.  I must take cognisance of that as well.  If this was in Waterford, I would be as upset as the people in the Public Gallery and the people of Ballinasloe generally.  The motion contains a reasonable request for the carrying out of a full independent, transparent and fair review of the decision to close the acute inpatient bed unit at St. Brigid's and for a stay on the closure of the unit pending the outcome of that review.  If that embarrasses anybody, so what?  Somebody said earlier that they are embarrassed.  There are many motions tabled and we can all say we can be embarrassed.  There is no reason to be embarrassed.  One would be embarrassed only if one believed one would be voting for something one should not be voting for.  That is the only reason any Senator would be embarrassed so I do not think there is anything wrong with the wording of the motion.  My party tabled an amendment to the motion, which seeks to remind Fianna F&aacute;il of its failures in government in respect of A Vision for Change.  I believe this had to be done as well because Fianna F&aacute;il also had opportunities to deliver on this issue.<\/p><p>I will now move to the broader issues of A Vision for Change, which is important because we must have an holistic debate on mental health services in the context of the Minister of State coming to the House today.  The issue of mental health is of great importance to Sinn F&eacute;in.  This is reflected in our party's health manifesto entitled Healthcare in an Ireland of Equals, which was published in 2006.  This rights-based policy has informed our approach to mental health.  It has been reflected in successive election manifestos, including the one in the previous general election when we called for the development of mental health services on an all-Ireland basis progressing from increased co-operation to integration of services on the island; improved accountability and transparency in planning and financing mental health service reform; modernised mental health legislation in line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; promotion of cross-departmental action to combat social exclusion, prejudice and discrimination against people with mental health problems; the ring-fencing of 12% of the annual Department of Health budget for mental health services in line with the World Health Organization recommendations; the development and promotion of suicide prevention strategies; the provision of required child and adolescent community-based mental health services; and the ending the placement of children in adult inpatient facilities.<\/p><p>In the current D&aacute;il, my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is a co-convener of the Oireachtas cross-party group on mental health.  The fact that there has been cross-party support on mental health issues and A Vision for Change has been to the benefit of the entire political system.  I very much hope that continues despite some of the rancour we have seen in the Chamber today and the understandable frustrations and concerns felt by people in Ballinasloe, which have been rightly expressed by Members here today.  The Oireachtas cross-party group on mental health has made very clear that at its core it has the conviction that now more than ever, in a time of recession, we need to prioritise mental health.  In light of this, the Oireachtas cross-party group on mental health made the following recommendations in respect of budgets.  The first is that in line with the programme for Government, we would see the implementation of A Vision for Change and that this should continue.  The second is that funding for mental health must be held at the budget 2011 level and that the funding attached to any mental health post must be preserved and used for the recruitment of multidisciplinary community-based mental health staff.  The third recommendation is the ring-fencing of &euro;35 million annually from within the health budget to develop community mental health teams and services as outlined in A Vision for Change and that this occur to ensure early access to more appropriate services for adults and children and improved comprehensive community-based mental health services that are linked to primary care.<\/p><p>The recommendations agreed by the Oireachtas cross-party group on mental health are obvious, clear and deliverable but, unfortunately, not all of them have been delivered.  We have highlighted the fact that mental health difficulties cost the economy around 2% of GDP annually and that most of these costs occur in the labour market as a result of lost employment, absenteeism, lost productivity and premature retirement.  I do not have the time to finish the rest of the speech and I will send a copy to the Minister of State.  There is a lot more than we can be doing in this area.  It is also close to my heart because a number of people close to me have suffered mental health problems.  I have watched them suffer but I have also seen that services are not always there when they should be there for them.  We should do whatever we need to do and put in place whatever resources are necessary.  On the last occasion the Minister of State was in the House in connection with this issue, I reminded her that both our parties share a common philosophy in respect of progressive taxation.  If we need to raise taxes on those in this State who earn more to pay for people who need services, be they mental health or other services, we should do so and ensure people get the services rather than coming in and saying we do not have the money to do things we should be doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900043#RR00300","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1392791100,"counter":313,"content":"<p>Some people will be disappointed because I cannot fit everyone in as everybody is eating up each other's time.

St. Senan's Hospital is now closed and we now have a service in County Wexford that is far superior to anything that was available in St. Senan's.

It is good for the Minister of State that she is not running in east Galway or Galway-Roscommon at the next election, as she would not get one vote.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900044#SS01100","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1392791700,"counter":340,"content":"<p>It is funny that Senator Mullen is.

I saw a state-of-the-art facility that had been renovated at considerable public expense, yet its beds are being sent elsewhere.  I learned about the bogus consultation and scoring procedures that saw Roscommon score 10 and Ballinasloe score 3 on a question of adjacency when Ballinasloe is a level 3 hospital and Roscommon is level 2.  I mean no disrespect to the services available in any of these hospitals, but when a decision does not add up, people are rightly - &quot;discouraged&quot; is too mild a term - scandalised by how they have been treated.<\/p><p>I also spoke with the head of community and primary care services, Ms Catherine Cunningham, about this matter when I visited St. Brigid's.  I made it my business to meet her when she was passing through.  I got all the usual civil and public service arguments when a decision has been taken and there will be no going back on it no matter the quality of the arguments being made by the other side.  I was treated courteously and heard how she hoped that the money would not be wasted and would go to whatever services existed, but I walked through a state-of-the-art facility that had been superbly upgraded.  It was located in a place where A Vision for Change was being implemented and there was a quality movement towards community-based care in respect of mental health.<\/p><p>People do not understand what has happened, why the Government is not listening, why their local, highly valued facilities should be targeted for cuts in this way or why it was so arrogantly proposed to remove beds from the facility on the eve of a Seanad debate.  They regard that as thumbing the nose at them.  They are in the Visitors Gallery and outside Leinster House in large numbers because they do not feel good about how their services are being targeted by the Government.<\/p><p>There is only one way to vote, and that is in favour of the motion.  We all support centres of excellence and the more intelligent consolidation of services, but people across the country want excellent services to be available close to them.<\/p><p>I have been asked by my colleague, Senator Crown, whether I can share time with him.

I am not an instinctive \"save our hospital\" type.  I understand that, sometimes, hospitals need to be closed and units rationalised.  Nor am I anti-Roscommon.  It is a matter of public record that I was staunch in my defence of an unfair closure of the emergency services in Roscommon in the face of data that were shown to be clearly inaccurate.  Those services should never have been retracted by the Government.  It was a great shame.<\/p><p>I also used to work in Ballinasloe hospital where I saw many patients from St. Brigid's Hospital who had developed acute medical problems and were transferred between those two fine institutions.  They had suffered heart attacks, strokes, pneumonia and so on, the usual issues that an often elderly population, although sometimes including young people, encounter.  They suffered these problems at night time, on weekends and during the day.  For the life of me, I cannot understand how Roscommon hospital is not considered an appropriate place for the management of these medical emergencies 24 hours per day, seven days per week, yet it is so considered when the patients are transferred from an adjacent psychiatric unit.<\/p><p>I have studied the methodology used in the questionnaire.  I have published quite a few papers and have a nodding acquaintance with statistics.  The methodology was unbelievably subjective.  I could see no logic to it whatsoever.  I hate to say it, but there must be a whiff of politics about this.  Before the last election, the current Taoiseach and Minister for Health, then Opposition politicians, personally wrote and assured everyone in Roscommon that the unit's status would not be changed.  They had to make an about-face on that assurance in the face of data that we now know were inaccurate.  There is a desperate need to be seen to be doing something for Roscommon.  I am unsure as to whether this is not an example of robbing Peter to pay Paul.  An error is being made and the methodology needs to be re-examined.  I urge the Minister of State and the other officials to study the way the assessment of these units was conducted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900044#SS02000","speaker":"1147"},{"type":"speech","time":1392791700,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Senator MacSharry has four minutes to conclude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900044#SS02100","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1392791700,"counter":350,"content":"<p>Do I not have five?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900044#SS02200","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1392791700,"counter":351,"content":"<p>No.  We have gone over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900044#SS02300","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1392791700,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I thank everyone who has contributed to this debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900044#SS02400","speaker":"1149"},{"type":"speech","time":1392791700,"counter":353,"content":"<p>On a point of order, I was set down as the second speaker for Labour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900044#SS02500","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1392791700,"counter":354,"content":"<p>The time is up, unfortunately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900044#SS02600","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1392792300,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I resent the fact that others were allowed to speak but-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900045#TT00100","speaker":"1174"},{"type":"speech","time":1392792300,"counter":356,"content":"<p>If I allow Senator Moran to speak I will have to allow Senator Leyden in.

The Minister of State is in government now.  Act accordingly, take the decisions and take your bloody medicine when you make a mistake.

What was the net result of that?  Nothing.  They now expect teachers to do the job of the guidance counsellors they cut and lacerated.  In the words of Brian Mooney, one of the foremost guidance counsellors in this country, we might as well expect passing motorists to bring victims of car accidents to hospital instead of ambulances.  That is the kind of medical planning we have seen by this Government.  That is the gombeen approach to somebody who is questioning the Minister of State on it.  Call it that if they will.<\/p><p>The Minister of State has been starved of resources.  The reality on the ground is that, sadly, the incidence of suicide is increasing and nothing is being done.

The matter I wish to raise is self-explanatory.  I am seeking an update on the Shannon water treatment plant.  Difficulties have arisen because the plant has reached maximum capacity.  There are many reasons for this, including the fact that one local pharmaceutical company pumped large volumes of material into the river in recent years and that leachate seeped into it from a dump in the area.  It is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to indicate how it facilitated that.  The biggest issue which arises in the context of Shannon is that, at present, it would not be possible for a prospective employer to set up operations there and, for example, create 200 jobs.  This is because the water treatment plant has no additional capacity and planning permission could not be granted.  In the past six or seven years, horrendous smells have wafted through the town at intervals.  We want to find a permanent solution to this problem, which has been already been raised with the Minister elsewhere.

This was included as a scheme at planning in my Department's water services investment programme for the period 2010 to 2013.  I approved the commitment of the necessary capital funding of just over &euro;1 million to allow Clare County Council to complete the tender formalities with the successful tenderer in respect of an advance mechanical and electrical contract to upgrade four pumping stations on the scheme.  I understand from the council that this contract was signed in December 2013 and that operations in respect of this advance works contract will commence in March 2014.<\/p> <p>In October 2012, my Department wrote to Clare County Council informing the council that the preliminary report for the Shannon sewerage scheme was not approved since the council had to address detailed technical issues in respect of storm water run-off ingress, re-evaluation of the collection system and implementation of the composite sampling programme recommended for the treatment plant and monitoring of the discharges.  The council was also advised to take cognisance of all additional statutory obligations that had come into effect since the completion of the preliminary report.  A response to this request from Clare County Council was received in my Department last October and the follow-up to this response will be dealt with by Irish Water.<\/p><p>The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 transferred statutory responsibility for water services from local authorities to Irish Water and provided for local authorities to act as agents for Irish Water, with this relationship being expressed through service level agreements.  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has been responsible for the delivery of water services capital infrastructure.  Irish Water is preparing its capital investment plan for 2014-2016 which will provide for the transition of projects that were included in my Department's water services investment programme 2010-2013.  The further progression of all water services capital projects, including the Shannon sewerage scheme, is now a matter for Irish Water.<\/p><p>Resolving the issues that have arisen at the Shannon town scheme is a priority for Irish Water.  Prior to taking up responsibility for water services in January 2014, Irish Water commenced the process of examining options that could resolve the issues at the scheme.  The existing scheme requires major re-engineering which will need an investment of between &euro;2.5 and &euro;3 million.  Irish Water is considering the technical options for the scheme and will be proceeding to detailed design, budget finalisation and, subject to all statutory consents being approved, construction in 2015.  In the meantime Irish Water is proceeding with pumping upgrades and other short-term measures.

The question for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is whether, given its importance to the retail and social revitalisation of Laois, there are any plans for the Department to assist, through rates discounts, with the development of Rathdowney shopping outlet and similar sites throughout the country.  This raises the bigger issue of rates discounts and so on for derelict or unused commercial buildings.<\/p><p>As the retail recovery slowly begins to take root, the Minister has the opportunity, perhaps, to improve the recovery by encouraging a rates discount in such circumstances.  Perhaps this could be accomplished by changing the law covering the valuation of property.  A change could allow a discount to be applied in shopping centres or other buildings where the occupancy rate is at a certain low level.<\/p><p>I appreciate that this is a matter for the council in question.  Perhaps it could be seen as a case study or an example of where policy could be engineered to facilitate such buildings.  Many people living in the area would benefit greatly from the employment that would be created.  I believe there are several shopping centres for which something could be done to allow their growth to be kick-started.  I am keen to know whether the Minister has any plans in this regard.<\/p><p>I am considering the wider issue in the sense that there are numerous commercial buildings throughout the country.  I accept that the commercial market dictates much of this and I accept that the sector is improving, more so in urban areas.  However, outside Dublin the struggle is still going on.  I am a Dublin-based Senator but I see this as a national issue.  When it comes to rural development, this begs the question of whether we should have a Minister for rural development, perhaps a super junior Minister, if there is a Cabinet reshuffle, which, I realise, is beyond the Minister's scope.  I am keen to hear the Minister's response to the issue of derelict sites and what we could do to improve the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900048#WW00400","speaker":"1153"},{"type":"speech","time":1392793500,"counter":421,"content":"<p>The Senator's is correct to suggest that Cabinet reshuffles are above my pay grade.  My colleagues and I are acutely aware of the pressures on businesses at this time, especially outside the major urban areas.  The decline in business activity in our city centres, rural towns and villages has meant that many businesses have been unable to survive the downturn in economic activity, resulting in increasing numbers of shop closures and vacant units in town centres in particular.  Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each local authority.<\/p><p>Local authorities have been asked by my Department to exercise restraint and, where possible, to reduce commercial rates and local charges for 2014.  They have responded well to such requests in recent years, and in 2013, a total of 87 out of the 88 rating authorities either reduced their annual rate on valuation or kept it as it was.  It appears that a similarly restrained approach has been adopted by local authorities in this year's local authority budgets.<\/p><p>The reorganisation of local governance structures, which I set out in my policy programme, Putting People First, has been given legislative effect by the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  A key objective of the reform programme is to reduce the burden on ratepayers and taxpayers generally by reducing cost and maximising efficiency.  While the determination of the annual rate on valuation, ARV, will continue to be a reserved function of the new authorities, I am determined that these savings should be passed on to ratepayers in the form of lower charges.<\/p><p>The Act contains several rating provisions that form part of the Government's commitment to economic stimulation.  One such provision is the removal of the commercial rates liability that is placed on new occupiers of properties for up to two years of outstanding rates of the previous occupier.  I have also provided discretion to local authorities to vary the rate of vacancy refunds to apply in their administrative areas, thus allowing councillors to respond to local circumstances.  The timing of the commencement of these provisions is being considered in the context of the timetable for commencement of provisions in the Act generally.<\/p><p>Specific reference was made to a rates discount.  Under the provisions of the Local Government (Rates) Act 1970, a rating authority may make and carry out a scheme providing for the waiver by the authority of all or a portion of commercial rates due by ratepayers in respect of a specified class or classes of property.  The making of such a scheme is subject to the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Any application received for a rate waiver scheme is carefully considered.  However, in considering any application, it should be borne in mind that if an authority gives a waiver of rates for one class of ratepayer, the forgone amount must be made up in another area.  In other words, there must be a balance.  Moreover, the introduction of a waiver scheme could further increase costs on the part of businesses not in the scheme, since it is likely that they would be required to make up the cost.<\/p><p>I will continue to keep the approach to rates by local authorities under active review and I am determined that every avenue will be pursued to optimise efficiency and contain costs in the local government sector to allow for commercial rates to be reduced if the councillors decide to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014021900048#WW00500","speaker":"967"},{"type":"speech","time":1392793500,"counter":422,"content":"<p>That is certainly a positive aspect of the Act.

In addition, I have transferred the responsibility from the tenant to the landlord in respect of any difficulties where rates have not been paid in previous years.  The responsibility is now attached to the property and the landlord of the property rather than the tenant.

The review is in the very early stages and will take some months to complete.<\/p><p>I am informed that a draft report exists.  I am further informed that it makes no recommendations on the closure of any of the five maternity units within the hospital group.  The House can be assured that any decision on maternity service reconfiguration will be considered in the context of the development of a new national strategy for maternity services.  No decisions on service reconfiguration will be implemented without the agreement of my Department, and certainly not in advance of the publication of the proposed national maternity strategy.<\/p><p>The development of this strategy is currently under way and it will determine the optimal configuration of maternity services to ensure that women in Ireland have access to safe, high quality maternity care in a setting most appropriate to their needs.  It is my intention to publish the strategy later this year.  As part of the development of the strategy, maternity services in all parts of the country, and not just the west, will be reviewed and evaluated.  The House may recall that one of the recommendations of the HIQA report into the death of Savita Halappanavar called for a review of maternity services nationally.  I accept that report. In addition, the Higgins report on the establishment of hospital groups requires that each hospital group prepare a strategic plan for service configuration, consistent with national objectives, for the delivery of patient services.<\/p><p>We should welcome the review and look forward to similar reviews throughout the country.
