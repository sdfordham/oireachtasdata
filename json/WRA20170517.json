This was the first visit to Canada by a serving Taoiseach in more than a decade, and provided an opportunity to develop and strengthen the important bilateral relationship between our two nations, who share deep historic ties, and enjoy strong trading relations.  Over the centuries, Canada has been an important destination for Irish immigrants.  Today, over four and a half million Canadians - more than 14% of the country's population - claim Irish ancestry.<\/p><p>During my visit I had a series of engagements with political, business and civic society representatives in Montreal and Toronto, and met with a number of existing and potential new IDA and Enterprise Ireland client companies.  These engagements provided very useful opportunities for me to promote Ireland as a location for trade and investment, as well as to emphasise our commitment to the EU and to outline Ireland's priorities in the context of Brexit.<\/p><p>While in Montreal, I met with Prime Minister Trudeau.  We discussed the trade relationship between Ireland and Canada and Ireland's strengths as a location for trade and investment.  We also considered ways to further strengthen the economic and trade relationship between our two countries, and agreed to prioritise the opportunities offered by the CETA trade agreement.  I also updated the Prime Minister on Ireland's Brexit priorities and outlined to him the current position in Northern Ireland.  The Prime Minister reiterated to me the Canadian Government's continued support for the Northern Ireland peace process<font color=\"#FF1F35\">.<\/font><\/p><p>Also in Montreal, I attended a business lunch with senior members of the Montreal business community, where I met with potential and current investors in Ireland.  I also visited the School of Irish studies at Concordia University where I met with members of the Irish Diaspora.<\/p><p>In Toronto, I addressed an Enterprise Ireland event, and also an event hosted by the Ireland-Canada Chamber of Commerce, both of which provided me opportunities to meet with current and potential investors in Ireland.  I addressed a Tourism Ireland event and visited Ireland Park, the Irish Famine memorial park in Toronto.  I also paid a courtesy call on the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Elizabeth Dowdeswell.  My Programme concluded with a meeting with members of the Board of the Irish Canada Immigration Centre and other representatives of the Irish Diaspora, and an event with representatives of the Ireland Fund in Canada. <\/p><p>This was a very successful visit which I believe will provide a platform to further strengthen the bilateral relations between Ireland and Canada - and I expect will be further enhanced during the trade mission to Canada that will be led by Minister Mitchell O'Connor later this month (30 May to 02 June).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700069#WRA01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":12,"content":"<p>Question No. 20 resubmitted.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":13,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 21 to 23, inclusive, answered with Question No. 19.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":14,"content":"<p>Question No. 24 resubmitted.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Advisers Appointments","counter":15,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700069#WRA01400"},{"type":"question","counter":16,"qnumday":25,"qnumall":"[22090\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700069#WRA01500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"his plans to appoint new special advisers generally or in the area of economics or Brexit.","asker":"1353","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":17,"content":"<p>I have no plans to appoint new Special Advisers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700069#WRA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Seanad Reform","counter":18,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700069#WRA01700"},{"type":"question","counter":19,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[22098\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700069#WRA01800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the position regarding the group being formed to reform Seanad &Eacute;ireann as agreed in 2016.","asker":"1224","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":20,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, in the Programme for a Partnership Government the Government stated its intention to reform Seanad Eireann and committed to pursuing implementation of the Report of the Working Group on Seanad Reform (the Manning Report).<\/p><p>That Report was published in 2015 and it is available on my Department's website.<\/p><p>One of the recommendations of the Report was the establishment of an Implementation Group to oversee implementation of the reforms contained in the Report.<\/p><p>As I have previously said in the House, I agreed with a suggestion made here some time ago by the Deputy that this Group should be based in the Oireachtas and should comprise members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad from all parties and groups, with access to independent expert advice as required.

This includes undertaking overseas Peace Support Operations, and in this regard to afford the greatest possible force protection to Irish troops whilst on all missions.<\/p>  <p>  The principle of competitive tendering for Government contracts is used by the Department of Defence for the acquisition of defensive equipment for the Defence Forces.  Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders following advertising of the tender competition on the e-tenders site and on the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), where appropriate, in line with the EU procurement directives, including the Directive on the procurement of Defensive and Security Equipment.   <\/p>  <p>  Such tender competitions are open to any company or country in accordance with the terms of all UN, OSCE and EU arms embargos or restrictions.  There are no such restrictions or embargos in place on Israeli companies.<\/p>  <p>  In following these guidelines and codes, the Department of Defence must deal impartially with all companies that are entitled to enter its procurement competitions and must evaluate tenders on the basis of objective criteria.<\/p>  <p>  The value of contracts for equipment, goods or services procured from Israeli based firms and companies since 2012 is &euro;5.86m, this includes the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles currently operated by the Defence Forces, commonly referred to as UAVs.<\/p>  <p>  These UAVs, are, in effect, an information gathering asset which have no offensive capability.  They do not carry weapons.  The UAV systems were acquired to enhance the capability of the Defence Forces to carry out surveillance, intelligence gathering and target acquisition for Peace Support Operations and provide a low cost, low risk means to increase capabilities and enhance force protection by performing missions which do not demand the use of manned aircraft.   <\/p>  <p>  UAVs have a wide range of civilian and military applications, particularly in the area of surveillance over land and sea.  They have the ability to perform tasks that manned systems cannot perform, either for safety or for economic reasons.  UAVs can efficiently complement existing manned aircraft or satellites infrastructure used in environmental protection, maritime surveillance, natural disasters, crisis management, border control, etc. <\/p>  <p>  Following a competitive tender process, 4 UAV Systems were procured between 2007 and 2009 from Aeronautics Defense Systems Ltd based in Israel.  An upgrade of the Defence Forces UAV systems was carried out by the original equipment manufacturer in 2016 at a cost of &euro;1.9m ex VAT.  This involved the upgrade of 4 UAV systems, with 3 airframes in each system.<\/p>  <p>  The matter of barring Israeli companies from entering tender competitions for the provision of military goods would be akin to Ireland unilaterally placing an embargo on such goods from Israel and this raises, inter alia, serious implications for Irish foreign policy which are outside my remit. <\/p>  <p>  Trade policy and market access are largely EU competencies and any restriction or ban on imports from any particular country would have to be concerted at EU level. <\/p>  <p>  The manner in which the Department of Defence procures both goods and services remains consistent with international best practice and is in line with EU and UN decisions on trade embargos.  I am satisfied that this is the appropriate way in which to continue, rather than Ireland taking any unilateral decision to target individual companies or countries in that respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700070#WRB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Deployment","counter":58,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700070#WRB03500"},{"type":"question","counter":59,"qnumday":52,"qnumall":"[23323\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700070#WRB03600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"when the projected number of personnel will be based in Custume barracks, Athlone, in view of the fact that on the announcement of the Defence Forces reorganisation in 2012, the projected permanent Defence Forces strength for the barracks was 971 personnel.","asker":"1250","askee":"1245"},{"type":"speech","counter":60,"content":"<p>The current strength of Defence Force personnel at Custume barracks, Athlone on 15 May, 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, was 886 personnel across all ranks.<\/p>  <p>  The re-organisation in 2013 did not significantly alter the actual number of PDF personnel serving in Custume Barracks, Athlone.

The guidelines reflect Ireland's unique concerns - support and protect the achievements, benefits and commitments of the peace process; avoid a hard border; and protect the Common Travel Area. <\/p>  <p>  They also recognise the desirability of moving to discuss the future relationship between the EU and the UK once sufficient progress has been made on the withdrawal issues, as well as the likely need for transitional arrangements.  Furthermore, the statement agreed by the European Council acknowledges that in the event of a united Ireland, brought about in accordance with the Good Friday Agreement, the entire territory of such a united Ireland would legally be part of the EU. <\/p>  <p>  This outcome is a major endorsement of Government's approach, and results from an intensive engagement with EU partners and institutions at all political and official levels in recent months. <\/p>  <p>  Now that the overall approach to the negotiations has been set out by the EU, the Government has stated its intention to intensify its focus on the economic implications of Brexit, including on domestic policy measures to reinforce the competitiveness of the Irish economy, to protect it from potential negative impacts of Brexit and to pursue all possible opportunities that might arise. <\/p>  <p>  To underpin this work, the Government will prepare a further paper on the economic implications of the Brexit challenge.  This will draw on the extensive work already underway across Departments, including sectoral analyses, and will reflect the core economic themes of my speech to the Institute of International and European Affairs of 15 February, including:<\/p>  <p> - sustainable fiscal policies to ensure capacity to absorb and respond to economic shocks, not least from Brexit<\/p>  <p> - policies to make Irish enterprise more diverse and resilient, to diversify trade and investment patterns, and to strengthen competitiveness<\/p>  <p> - prioritising policy measures and dedicating resources to protect jobs and businesses in the sectors and regions most affected by Brexit<\/p>  <p> - realising economic opportunities arising from Brexit, and helpful businesses adjust to any new logistical or trade barriers arising; <\/p>  <p> - making a strong case at EU level that Ireland will require support that recognises where Brexit represents a serious disturbance to the Irish economy. <\/p>  <p>  Policy decisions in support of these objectives arise across a wide range of areas, including the annual Budgetary process; the forthcoming National Planning Framework 2040; the new 10-year National Capital Plan; the review of Enterprise 2025; and sectoral policies and investment decisions in areas such as agriculture, enterprise, transport, communications and energy. <\/p>  <p>  In taking this important work forward, the Government will continue to engage with stakeholders, including through the All Island Civic Dialogue process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700073#WRE00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1245"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":136,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700073#WRE00750"},{"type":"question","counter":137,"qnumday":81,"qnumall":"[23937\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700073#WRE00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of persons who are employed under the aegis of his Department through agencies.

The purpose of the Strategy is to address the under-representation of people with disabilities in the labour force, and sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring that people with disabilities, who are able to and want to work, are supported and enabled to do so.  Co-ordination of the Strategy&rsquo;s implementation is the responsibility of the Equality Division in the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Strategy's six strategic priorities are:<\/p><p>- Build skills, capacity and independence<\/p><p>- Provide bridges and supports into work<\/p><p>- Make work pay<\/p><p>- Promote job retention and re-entry to work<\/p><p>- Provide coordinated and seamless support<\/p><p>- Engage employers<\/p><p>Given the complex cross-government nature of the strategy, an oversight implementation group was established under the independent chairmanship of Fergus Finlay.  This group is tasked with monitoring the progress of the above six strategic priorities of the strategy, ensuring that each Government Department is fulfilling its obligations and meeting its targets.  The Chair of the Group recently published the Annual Report, which highlighted areas where greater progress needs to be made, and which also included recommendations in relation to priorities for 2017.<\/p><p>The Strategy contains a range of practical measures to increase employment opportunities for people with disabilities.  Of particular relevance to people with autism are:<\/p><p>- The establishment of special public service competitions for people with disabilities and where appropriate, the provision of alternative recruitment channels for people with disabilities into the public service.  Discussions in relation to this commitment are underway between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Appointments Service. <\/p><p>- A national employer helpline, which was launched in January 2016, to provide expert guidance and peer support to employers in relation to the employment of staff with disabilities.  <\/p><p>- An increase in the pubic sector employment quota from 3% to 6% on a phased basis to 2024, with work beginning on this later in the year. <\/p><p>The helpline was established by the employer bodies with support from the National Disability Authority and the Authority works with them to ensure greater awareness amongst and support for employers in employing people with disabilities, including those on the autism spectrum.  <\/p><p>I might also mention the Action Plan on Autism, which the Department of Justice and Equality developed in conjunction with the National Disability Authority (NDA).  The NDA monitors the implementation of the Plan and has initiated a number of actions relating to the Plan, including:<\/p><p>- Improving customer services for persons with disabilities with a specific focus on autism; <\/p><p>- Launching an online autism friendly public services training course; <\/p><p>- Providing training courses on autism friendly public services in connection with the autism advocacy and support organisation AsIAm to specific public services providers (e.g. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, transport providers etc.);<\/p><p>- Updating and monitoring compliance with the statutory Code of Practice on Accessibility of Public Services and Information provided by Public Bodies, with a specific focus on autism.<\/p><p>The Department is responsible for several specific objectives contained in the Plan including:<\/p><p>- Raising disability awareness, including the dissemination of autism related materials; <\/p><p>- Engaging, supporting and providing guidance to people with autism who come in contact with the criminal justice system; <\/p><p>- Working with the NDA to review the impact of disability related policy and legislation.<\/p><p>Full implementation of the Action Plan on Autism is one of the actions contained in the new National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017- 2021, which it is expected will be published soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700073#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Procedures","counter":144,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700073#WRE01350"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[23368\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700073#WRE01400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of ministerial permissions her Department has given to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to open bank accounts for official purposes in the past 20 years, in tabular form; the reason for the account opening and the year; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":146,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy spans a large period of time and arrangements are in train in my Department to prepare a response.

Another office, the Refugee Documentation Centre, provides information services to all of the bodies involved in international protection cases.  I am informed by the Legal Aid Board that the number of additional staff recruited to date and engaged in the provision of services in the area of International Protection is 13.  As I stated in my response to the Deputy's Question of 30 March 2017, individual staff members can be involved in both international protection and other civil legal aid work.  Some newly-recruited staff engaged in the provision of services in the area of international protection commenced employment during 2016; I understand that these staff were assigned in preparation for the commencement of the single application procedure.  The Board continues to monitor staffing needs, capacity, and demand for services so that it can recruit and place staff, if necessary, where they will be most effective.  <\/p><p>As previously stated,<b><\/b>while the Board has staff that are specifically assigned to the area of international protection, it also provides legal services in relation to a range of important civil issues including, for example, legal services to parents whose children may be subject to care orders.  While the Board is developing specialisation in its staff, it is also wishes to ensure flexibility in order to address areas of particular priority at a point in time.  For that reason, some new staff engaged in the provision of services in the international protection area also have a wider civil element to their role.  <\/p><p>The Board is committed to giving early legal advice to persons seeking international protection and to ensuring that those persons see a solicitor prior to their interview with the International Protection Office.  I am further informed that the Board is currently finalising its model of service delivery and clarifying expectations regarding staff output, performance and value for money.  When this process is finalised any further requirement will be considered but the Board is satisfied that the current demand for services is being met and there is no backlog of applicants waiting for international protection services.

While the Ready Reckoner does not show all of the specific costings requested by the Deputy, other changes can be estimated on a pro-rata basis with those displayed in the Reckoner. <\/p><p>In relation to the second question, I am informed by Revenue that the first and full year cost of introducing an additional tax band in the manner outlined by the Deputy is estimated to be in the order of &euro;165 million and &euro;191 million respectively.<\/p><p>These figures and all figures provided in the Ready Reckoner are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2014, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim.  They are estimated by reference to projected 2017 incomes.  They are provisional and may be revised.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, in the Programme for Partnership Government there is a commitment to ask the Oireachtas to continue to phase out the Universal Social Charge (USC) as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, reduces excessive tax rates for middle income earners, and limits the benefit for high earners.  The Programme for Government therefore incudes a commitment not to index tax credits or rate bands.  Indexation of the income tax standard-rate bands would benefit only those currently paying income tax at the higher rate &ndash; i.e. single individuals earning over &euro;33,800 and single-income married couples earning over &euro;42,800.\u00a0 It is estimated that in 2017, 21% of taxpayer units will pay income tax at the higher rate.\u00a0 Indexation of the standard rate bands would therefore be of benefit to only 21% of taxpayers.<\/p><p>I have long said that the burden of the income tax system in Ireland is too high and that I would seek to reduce it as soon as it was prudent to do so.  Budget 2017 has, for the third year in succession, introduced reductions in the income tax burden for all those within the scope of USC with the three lowest rates of USC having been reduced over these years from 2%, 4% and 7% to 0.5%, 2.5% and 5% respectively.  This is important progress in making work pay and supporting individuals returning to and remaining in employment. <\/p><p>In this regard the Income Tax Reform Plan developed for consultation with the Oireachtas, published in July last year, may be of interest, and is available at the following link: <i> <\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700075#WRG01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Agencies Expenditure","counter":188,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700075#WRG01900"},{"type":"question","counter":189,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[23466\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700075#WRG02000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount spent by bodies and agencies under the aegis of his Department on renting car park spaces in each of the years 2011 to 2016 and to date in 2017 in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy, I am advised that of the 18 bodies under the aegis of my Department, 8 have incurred costs relating to the rental of car park spaces for the period in question.

The CCMA provides that a lender must ensure that it has in place a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) as a framework for handling cases.\u00a0 The first step in the MARP process is communication with the borrower.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Under the CCMA, a lender is required to produce and implement a policy, approved by the board of directors, regarding communications with borrowers.  Further the CCMA provides that a lender must ensure that the level of communications from the lender, or any third party acting on its behalf, is proportionate and not excessive, taking into account the circumstances of the borrowers, including that unnecessarily frequent communications are not made.  The lender must also ensure that communications with borrowers are not aggressive, intimidating or harassing and that borrowers are given sufficient time to complete an action they have committed to before follow up communication is attempted.  Steps must also be taken to agree future communication with borrowers.  A lender must maintain records of all communications with borrowers in mortgage arrears or in pre arrears.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  For mortgages in arrears that do not fall within the scope of the CCMA, lenders are required to comply with the arrears handling provisions of the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 (&lsquo;the Code&rsquo;).  The relevant provisions as regards &lsquo;Arrears Handling&rsquo; are contained in Chapter 10 of the Code.  The Code provides that a regulated entity must ensure that the level of contact and communications with a personal consumer in arrears is proportionate and not excessive.  Each calendar month, no more than three unsolicited communications to a personal consumer in respect of arrears, by whatever means, can be initiated.  This does not include any communication that has been requested by, or agreed in advance with, the personal consumer; and any communication to the personal consumer the sole purpose of which is to comply with the requirements of the Code or other regulatory requirements.<\/p>  <p>  If a consumer is not satisfied with how a regulated entity is dealing with him\/her, or believes that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank codes and regulations, the consumer should firstly make a complaint to the regulated entity.  Under the Consumer Protection Code (Provisions 10.7 to 10.12), regulated entities must have a complaints procedure in place and must handle complaints speedily, efficiently and fairly.  If a consumer is not happy with the response he\/she receives from the regulated entity they can, provided the conduct complained of occurred within the last six years, escalate their complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSO).  The FSO has the statutory powers to investigate complaints against financial services providers.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Central Bank that it\u00a0has a wide range of tools at its disposal to investigate and take action against regulated entities and\/or individuals which fall short of\u00a0its' expected standards of behaviour, up to and including, where appropriate, administrative sanctions (which can include fines and other penalties) under Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942 in the case of a contravention of the above requirements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700075#WRG02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Rebates","counter":195,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700076#WRH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":196,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[23583\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700076#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the status of a tax refund for a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1370","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":197,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that a refund of tax for 2016 was made by direct credit to the nominated bank account of the authorised agent of the person concerned on 16 February, 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700076#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Issues","counter":198,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700076#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":199,"qnumday":106,"qnumall":"[16716\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700076#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he or his Department is assessing options on border control other than a hard border; and the measures which will be required between Northern Ireland and here, in view of the repeated statements from Prime Minister May regarding leaving the customs union and the response from the EU confirming that this will require a type of border.

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.<\/p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.<\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.<\/p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.<\/p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO in September 2016 will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4,600 and &euro;6,700) for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  The pay increases for new teachers were also available to ASTI members under the proposals which members recently balloted on.<\/p>  <p>  The agreements have\u00a0restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.<\/p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost\u00a0would be in the order of &euro;85 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.<\/p>  <p>  Further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A\u00a0broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay across the public service will be informed by the recently published analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission.<\/p>  <p>  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of future public service pay talks.  Indeed, negotiations on a successor agreement to Lansdowne Road will shortly get under way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700079#WRL01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation Provision","counter":293,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700079#WRL01150"},{"type":"question","counter":294,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[23568\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700079#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to outline the position regarding an application for a required extension to a school (details supplied) in County Sligo; the progress to date with the proposal; the details of the extension involved; when construction is likely to commence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":295,"content":"<p>I\u00a0can confirm to the Deputy that my Department received an application from the school referred to for additional accommodation to provide classrooms, specialist rooms and ancillary accommodation.<\/p><p>The process of assessing the application is currently being finalised and my Department will be in contact with the school authority in the matter shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700079#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700079#WRL01350"},{"type":"question","counter":297,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[23576\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700079#WRL01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his Department stated in a court case (details supplied) that Bus &Eacute;ireann does not make a profit from school transport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":298,"content":"<p>School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.<\/p><p>Currently\u00a0almost\u00a0116,000 children, including\u00a0some 12,000 children with special educational needs, are being transported in over 4,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually.<\/p><p>The arrangements between\u00a0the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann for the provision of national school transport services were the subject of High Court proceedings and an appeal to the Supreme Court.

This resulted in one of the bands (in respect of those with a yearly average of 20-47 contributions) being replaced with three bands (in respect of yearly averages of 40-47, 30-39, and 20-29 respectively).  These additional bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life are likely to benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions. <\/p>  <p>  These bands have been changed a number of times over the years.  For example, there was no payment for people with a yearly average below 24 until 1973, or for those below 20 until 1989.  Between the years 2000-2012, someone reaching retirement age with a yearly average of 47 contributions qualified for the same rate of payment (98% of the maximum rate) as someone with a yearly average of 20 contributions, despite generally their much more significant PRSI record, and regardless of their means.  A person with an average of 48-52 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 more than someone with a yearly average of 20 PRSI contributions.  This meant that the last 20 years of a person&rsquo;s contributions to the Social Insurance Fund might have no impact upon their contributory pension entitlements.<\/p>  <p>  When savings were required in 2012, as part of dealing with the fiscal crisis which faced the country, it was decided to make them by addressing this anomaly, rather than cut the core rate of the pension, which would have hit all pensioners, including the poorest, notably those solely dependent upon the State pension.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cost of reverting to the percentage rate-bands which existed between 2000 and 2012 would be over &euro;60 million in 2018, if introduced from January 2018, and that this annual cost would rise at a rate of some &euro;10 million each year, that is an additional amount of &euro;10 million in each subsequent year would be added to the base amount, e.g. &euro;70 million in 2019, etc.<\/p>  <p>  Calculation of the cost of backdating such a change (i.e. paying a lump sum in respect of the difference between such higher rates and those legislated for in the period 2012-2017) would be very complex, would require analysis of a number of historic datasets, and would be complicated by the fact that the State pension (transition) was abolished during the period in question.  There would also be issues as to whether such back-dating applied only in respect of such pensioners who were still in payment at the date a decision was made to backdate such a change, or if there would also be similar payments made to the estates and\/or surviving spouses of those pensioners who died beforehand.  The effective date of such backdating would also impact upon the cost.  It is very tentatively estimated that, depending on the details of such a payment, the cost of such backdating would be in the region of &euro;200 million.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that backdating of such an increase and payment as a lump sum would be extremely unusual, in the context of a weekly payment such as the State pension, and there are no plans to make such a payment.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700083#WRP01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":388,"content":"<p>Question No. 173 withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":389,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700083#WRP01250"},{"type":"question","counter":390,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[23936\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700083#WRP01300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the number of persons who are employed under the aegis of his Department through agencies in the public sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1434","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":391,"content":"<p>My Department does not employ staff through agencies.

It is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) of the HSE has extensive information concerning Lyme disease on its website . <\/p><p>Lyme disease is diagnosed by medical history and physical examination.  The infection is confirmed by blood tests which look for antibodies produced by an infected person's body in response to the infection.  These normally take several weeks to develop and may not be present in the early stages of the disease.  The standard approach to Lyme diagnostics is a two-stage approach and involves using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as an initial, screening step.  Screening EIAs can be insufficiently specific, giving false-positive reactions in the presence of other similar bacteria, and certain other viral infections, including glandular fever.  In addition, blood samples from patients with autoimmune disorders and other inflammatory conditions can also lead to false-positive results.  Samples giving positive or equivocal results in screening tests are further investigated in a second-stage immunoblot (Western blot) tests.  Use of immunoblot testing greatly increases specificity.  Using this two stage approach will give a great degree of certainty around the diagnosis of Lyme. <\/p><p>All clinical (and other) laboratories in Ireland must undergo continuous quality assurance to ensure that the quality of the diagnostics they provide is maintained at the highest international level for human diagnostics.  Some laboratories abroad do not use antibody tests like the EIA (screening ELISA test) and Western Blot and instead will use other types of tests, for example, testing for levels of a specific white blood cell (CD-57) or lymphocyte transformation tests (tests to measure how specific cells in a person's immune system respond when exposed to antigens against Borrelia burgdorferi - the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease).  These types of tests are not currently recommended by international groups such as the CDC, Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) or BIA for a number of reasons:<\/p><p>1.  There is not enough scientific evidence that they are suitable tests to diagnose Lyme disease;<\/p><p>2.  There is no standard method to perform and interpret these kind of tests; and<\/p><p>3.  Positive results in these kinds of tests may be due to other illnesses or conditions and not just Borrelia infection.<\/p><p>The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC, the Infectious Diseases Society of Ireland, the Irish Society of Clinical Microbiologists, the Irish Institute of Clinical Neuroscience and the Irish College of General Practitioners agreed a Consensus Statement on the Clinical Management of Lyme Borreliosis, which endorsed the previously referenced, internationally recognised set of guidelines (those of the IDSA) to Medical Practitioners to ensure a standardised approach to the diagnosis and management of Lyme disease in Ireland.  <\/p><p>The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee, the aim of which is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency, an Environmental Health Officer and, very importantly, a representative from Tick Talk Ireland, the primary Support Group for Lyme disease in Ireland. <\/p><p>The initial work of the Lyme Borreliosis Sub-committee involved a survey of laboratory methods for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland, the development of Lyme borreliosis guidance for general practitioners, the publication of medical media articles to highlight diagnostics and laboratory methods relating to Lyme borreliosis available in Ireland.  Material has been produced which is aimed both at the general public and General Practitioners.  <\/p><p>There is extensive information for the public and health professionals on the HPSC website.  This information for the public includes: <\/p><p>-  Lyme Disease Frequently Asked Questions;<\/p><p>-  Laboratory testing for Lyme Disease: FAQs for general public; <\/p><p>-  Lyme Disease Illustrations; and<\/p><p>-  CDC's instructions on how to remove a tick.<\/p><p>There is significant support and information for health professionals on the HPSC website.  These supports include a fact sheet on tick borne diseases, including Lyne Disease.  This fact sheet gives information on clinical  the disease, transmission routes, prevention measures, diagnosis, and management and treatment.  There is also an erythema migrans (EM) diagnostic tool to aid health professionals in the diagnosis of EM, which is frequently the earliest clinical manifestation of Lyme borreliosis. <\/p><p>With regard to medical education and training, the content and composition of curricula and specialist training programmes is a matter for the Medical Council and the recognised medical education or postgraduate training bodies.  Under the Medical Practitioners Act, all medical degree courses and specialist training programmes in Ireland are required to be accredited by the Council.  As of May 2011, doctors are legally obliged to maintain their professional competence by enrolling in approved professional competence schemes and following requirements set by the Medical Council.  In this context, the Council has established a range of professional competence schemes through formal arrangements with the recognised postgraduate training bodies.  Schemes are operated by the postgraduate training bodies and have been developed to drive good professional practice, which is centred on patient safety and quality of patient care.<\/p><p>As testing and treatment for Lyme borreliosis is widely available in Ireland there is no requirement for people to travel to other EU Member States to access these services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700087#WRT01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Services for People with Disabilities","counter":494,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700087#WRT01550"},{"type":"question","counter":495,"qnumday":212,"qnumall":"[23411\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700087#WRT01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason the diagnosis of a person (details supplied) will not be confirmed in a report prior to the enrolment of the person in preschool; if the report can be provided in time for the person to enrol; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1340","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":496,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  <\/p><p>The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are:<\/p><p>-  Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;<\/p><p>-  Bed and board;<\/p><p>-  Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and<\/p><p>-  Laundry service.<\/p><p>The legislation underpinning the Nursing Homes Support Scheme requires each private nursing home to negotiate and agree a price for long-term residential care services with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) should they wish to be an approved nursing home for the purposes of the Scheme.  The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis.  The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State.  In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:<\/p><p>-  Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;<\/p><p>-  Price(s) previously charged;<\/p><p>-  Local market price; and<\/p><p>-  Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.<\/p><p>When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  A number of issues have been identified for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanisms by the NTPF, with a view to:<\/p><p>-  Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative costs for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;<\/p><p>-  Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and<\/p><p>-  Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.<\/p><p>A Steering Committee has been established to oversee the review of the pricing system for private long-term residential care facilities.

Section 33(2) of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009 provides for the HSE to charge for the cost of care in long-term residential care settings.

As part of this a Medical Assessment Unit may temporarily be used to accommodate a locally agreed number of extra patients to address the overcrowding.  This is often referred to as being used for surge capacity.  At these times, patients are seen in the Emergency Department rather than in the Medical Assessment Unit (MAU).  While this temporary change of use may not be ideal in terms of the utilisation of these units, it does enable hospitals to alleviate overcrowding in EDs and afford patients a greater degree of dignity.<\/p>  <p>  Recent data from the HSE indicates that despite an increase in over 3% in attendances for the first quarter in 2017, the situation at the Our Lady of Lourdes ED has been improving, with 42% fewer patients waiting a trolley, as compared to the same period last year.

This scheme was offered by the EU Commission to Member States to implement on a voluntary basis to allow producers who had incurred super levy debt to spread the cost over three years (2015&ndash;2017) interest free.  This repayment schedule took the form of a 33% lump sum in 2015 and the balance to be spread over five equal instalments in 2016 and 2017 over the peak production period of May to September.  Ireland was one the few MS with a super levy bill to introduce the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  At the end of the milk quota regime in April 2015 Ireland exceeded its quota by 4.4%, resulting in a super levy bill of &euro;71 million for 6,400 Irish farmers.  Each Member State was obliged to settle the liability in full in 2015 with the EU Commission and could then re-coup the money from its farmers as per the scheme.  My Department chose to implement the scheme on the basis that it would minimise the burden on the sector during a period of planned expansion here as well as helping with the immediate cash flow difficulties for farmers faced with such a bill.<\/p>  <p>  In 2015 2,700 producers opted to pay their full levy (&euro;16.7 million) to my Department up front with &euro;18.9m collected from the remaining 3,700 producers by 1 October 2015.  These 3,700 producers are the participants in the instalment scheme and 2015 was the first year of their three-year repayment phase.  My Department introduced the scheme of phased recoupment from farmers who had the option of joining the scheme and spreading their repayment over three years. <\/p>  <p>  This scheme was financed from Exchequer funds and so my Department is responsible for ensuring that the funds advanced to the Commission on behalf of farmers are recouped on behalf of the taxpayer.  The person in question incurred a superlevy fine because they supplied almost double their assigned quota in the 2014\/15 quota year.<\/p>  <p>  In any event, given that the milk quota regime ended on 31 March 2015 and all superlevy liabilities due to the EU Commission were paid by Ireland on 1 November 2015, it is not possible at this stage to have any super levy liabilities recalculated for individual producers.

The report also stated that Ireland had the lowest emissions per kg of pork (4.8 kg\/kg) with the EU average 7.5kg\/kg and Ireland&rsquo;s emissions per kg of beef were 18.4 kg\/kg with and EU Average of 22.2kg\/kg.<\/p>  <p>  The Report also recognised that with regard to dairy systems in Europe, intensive systems create less methane and nitrous oxide emissions than extensive ones, but this is countered by higher emissions from land use and land use change.  Lowest emissions are created by extensive grassland systems, such as those in Ireland.  The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations has also recognised the efficiency of our temperate grassland based production system.<\/p>  <p>  Methane accounts for approximately 22% of Ireland's green house gas (GHG) emissions.  It is the most significant GHG emitted from agricultural activity in Ireland accounting for 64.5% of total agricultural emissions.  Enteric fermentation, which is a natural process in the digestive system of ruminant animals that results in the emission of methane, accounts for 90% of agricultural methane emissions.  The remaining agricultural methane is associated with the storage and management of animal manures.<\/p>  <p>  Current research into reducing methane emissions is primarily focussed on reducing emissions per unit product (i.e. reducing emissions intensity).  This research is primarily focused on improving productivity per animal and thus decoupling animal numbers from production.  Most of this research is focussed on developing economic breeding indices (EBI), extension of the grazing season, reducing beef finishing times (and reducing total methane per animal) and optimising beef and dairy animals via the use of sexed semen.  Many of these measures are currently in use or being commenced.<\/p>  <p>  Carbon audits by our Food Agency (An Bord Bia) are placing new emphasis on reduction in emissions intensity of beef and dairy produce.<\/p>  <p>  Through the deployment of innovative and efficient practices at farm level, combined with the application of emerging scientific knowledge, Ireland can take the necessary steps towards addressing the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions, including methane, in the Irish agriculture sector.  In the Rural Development Programme, there are some 38,000 farmers taking part in the Green Low carbon Agri-environment Scheme (GLAS) and 24,000 herds in the first Beef Data Genomics Programme (BDGP), which is a world-leading initiative to improve the quality of breeding of our beef cattle.  Applications for participating in a new BDGP are currently being processed.<\/p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 is a cohesive, strategic plan for the sustainable development of agrifood sector over the next decade.\u00a0 The strategy identified over 400 recommendations to achieve the growth projections identified at the outset which the Agrifood Strategy Committee believed were achievable.  Progress is reviewed on a quarterly basis by a High Level Implementation Committee.  The first progress report Steps to Success outlined that good progress had been made in its first year.\u00a0 A second annual progress report is due to be produced shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700093#WRZ01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":649,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700093#WRZ01800"},{"type":"question","counter":650,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[23938\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700093#WRZ01900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the persons employed through agencies in his Department in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1434","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":651,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the following table:<table><tr><th>No of Employees<\/th><th>Name of Agency<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>62 <\/td><td>Farm Relief Services Network (FRS)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>3<\/td><td>Irish Diagnostic Laboratory Services (IDLS)<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700093#WRZ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Contracts Data","counter":652,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700093#WRZ02100"},{"type":"question","counter":653,"qnumday":265,"qnumall":"[23950\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700093#WRZ02200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the monetary value of all work contracted out under the aegis of his Department to external agencies or consultancy for work completed or investigations undertaken in human resources and industrial relations, including hiring and interviewing of staff and so on; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":654,"content":"<p>An amount of &euro;2647.50 was paid to date in 2017 in respect of all work contracted out under the aegis of\u00a0my department to external agencies or consultancy for work completed or investigations undertaken in human resources and industrial relations including hiring and interviewing of staff and so on during 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700093#WRZ02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","counter":656,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700093#WRZ02500"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Media Mergers","counter":655,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700093#WRZ02400"},{"type":"question","counter":656,"qnumday":266,"qnumall":"[23377\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017051700093#WRZ02500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 511 of 2 May 2017, if the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland has provided him with its\u00a0report and recommendations on the proposed media merger involving the acquisition of sole control of a company (details supplied); if he will publish this report immediately; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":657,"content":"<p>I received the report and recommendation from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland regarding the proposed media merger referred to by the Deputy on 9 May 2017.<\/p><p>In accordance with the relevant legislation I have 20 working days from the date of receipt of this report and recommendation within which I must make a final determination to allow the proposed\u00a0media merger\u00a0to proceed; to allow the proposed\u00a0media merger\u00a0to proceed with conditions; or to refuse to allow the proposed\u00a0media merger\u00a0to proceed.
