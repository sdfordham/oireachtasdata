I had the pleasure of working with Mr. Begg when he was an active member of the Forum on Europe.  He will be well known because of the excellent work he did as chief executive officer of Concern before taking over his current job.  I wish him well in his retirement and he has made an enormous contribution to trade unionism and to other areas of life.  He pointed out something on which the Leader might comment, which is that 48 trade unions represent 800,000 workers, which he believes to be too widely structured.  It is under-resourced and is open to dissent.  There certainly is a message in this regard that perhaps could be addressed.  I am unsure whether the Government has a role in this regard but 48 unions representing 800,000 workers appears to be somewhat excessive.<\/p><p>I call on the Minister for Education and Skills to come to the House to discuss the junior certificate reform proposals that have caused enormous dissent and controversy among the teaching profession.  The TUI is balloting on whether it should take strike action in this regard and these proposals have been met with stiff resistance by the teaching unions.  The other two unions have today called on the Minister to abolish her predecessor's proposals.  On foot of the discussions I have had with members of the teaching profession in my native town of Drumshanbo and in County Leitrim in general, I certainly support that view.  I call on the Minister for Education and Skills to come before the House today to clarify her position regarding the junior certificate and how she will respond to the trade union movement.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business calling on her to come to the House today.<\/p><p>I commend the Government on its decision to announce the by-elections and to have moved the writs for them in the other House yesterday.  While I commend it, that is as far as I will go in so doing because this will give an opportunity to the voters of Roscommon-South Leitrim and Dublin South-West to respond to the Government's actions in a wide range of areas.  It is a Government of broken promises that has introduced political spin to a degree far greater than any previous Administration and which has imposed punitive taxes on people, particularly water charges.  This is of particular interest in Roscommon-South Leitrim where approximately 21,000 families are unable to access fresh water that is clear and healthy.  They now will be expected to pay this iniquitous water charge.  Later today in the other House, Government Deputies will troop into the lobbies to oppose a motion tabled by my colleague, Deputy Cowen, calling for an exemption for the aforementioned 21,000 families and other families nationwide who, because of the manner in which water has been regulated, are unable to access clean, fresh and healthy water.  However, they will be expected to pay this punitive tax.<\/p><p>Members also have learned there is no clarity surrounding those who will be able to have a medical exemption.  Why has the Government, not for the first time, introduced laws, only to be obliged to come back months later to figure out precisely how it will implement them?  This should have been done months ago.  The Government should have been able to explain to people months ago, particularly those with a medical condition, how much they will be obliged to pay.  Irish Water has stated that it will rely on the honesty of citizens and is not even going to ask them for medical evidence.  Consequently, real issues arise that affect people in Roscommon-South Leitrim.  In addition, in the constituency of Dublin South-West, taxes have been imposed and there have been reductions by the Department of Social Protection that have affected lone-parent families and those who are most vulnerable in society who live in the Tallaght and south-west Dublin area.<\/p><p>I ask the Government to get its act together.  All one has heard in recent months is spin about the economy recovering.  The Government should tell that to the people of Tallaght and Roscommon-South Leitrim as a two-tier recovery is under way.  While one part of the country is gaining a little, where I come from, down in the midlands and the west, there certainly is nothing other than people saying the Government has neglected rural Ireland and could not care less about it.  The people will decide on 10 October and I hope they decide in favour of non-government candidates.  Fianna F&aacute;il has two excellent candidates in those constituencies, namely, John Lahart in Dublin South-West and Ivan Connaughton in Roscommon-South Leitrim.  I hope to see them as Deputies in the Oireachtas after 10 October, which would be a response to this iniquitous Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800003#B00400","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1411032600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Today is a huge day for the people of Scotland as they go to the polls to decide their future.

I have spent some time examining this issue and there have been some disturbing reports about evidence being planted, hiding evidence, bullying, heavy-handedness and forged documentation.  There appears to be a pattern over a number of years in respect of the activities of the special investigations unit within the aforementioned Department.  Like many people, including the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I believe it is important to do everything that can be done to ensure a healthy and prosperous food industry in Ireland, as well as for the protection of farmers and the payments made to them.  However, the idea that a unit may end up planting evidence in people's homes and forging documents is extremely serious.<\/p> <p>We now see reports relating to an unpublished report within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which, strangely, took the opportunity to find ways to offer some criticism of a judge who offered observations about the special investigations unit in a court case last year.  A document, which has not been published and which was written by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, suggests the judge's remarks may have been influenced by an unsubstantiated allegation or that perhaps if the prosecution counsel had been able to explain and clarify the circumstances, the judge might have said differently.  I find this very disturbing that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's officials are suggesting privately that a judge in the judicial system is somehow not behaving as she ought to.  This is a very serious matter and it is as serious as the other matters relating to the special investigations unit.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to come to the House to give an explanation and tell us what has been happening with the special investigations unit, which seems to be turning into some kind of private hit squad, and I do not say that lightly?  There are very serious matters going on behind the scenes and, as I said, in the interests of farmers and of our very valuable industry, the Minister could do well by coming to the House to help explain what has been happening, in particular in regard to this unpublished report which is a very serious departure for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800003#B02000","speaker":"1129","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411033200,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Before I call Senator Norris, I welcome some German visitors, Nina, Belke and Thomas Gumprecht from Erlangen in Germany, to the Visitors Gallery.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800004#C00200","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1411033200,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Yesterday, our colleague, Senator Zappone, welcomed the fact that she believes the Government will introduce what she described as reform of the university seats.  That reform will expand the constituency to 850,000 voters.  Once one takes into account the fact that Senator Zappone was appointed and did not have to face an election, it is easy to be airy-fairy about other people's elections.  I put that in contrast with the fact that next week, there will be a by-election in which the total poll will be less than 250 votes and the Taoiseach is doing nothing about that.<br\/>I would like to commend John Bruton on his analysis of 1916.  The Redmondite tradition is a very honourable one and should be commended.  It is the main tradition of nationalism in this country, going back to the great figure of Daniel O'Connell, Parnell and Redmond, of non-violence.  I think of this particularly because we should, in this House and as a Parliament, note the fact that today is the 100th anniversary of the passage of the Home Rule Bill in Westminster, which was a very significant achievement.  I know the leaders of 1916 were shot and that was a great political mistake and a great human one but that was in the middle of a war and the government felt it was being shot in the back.  One should put it in the context of the time.  I was part of the Shot at Dawn Campaign which tried to look after the interests of 16 year old kids who were shell shocked and then shot because, in their state of nervous paralysis, they did not take their cap off in the presence of an officer.  That is the kind of context in which this took place.<br\/>If one looks at 1916, I believe Yeats was correct in his first impression of some of these people when he said that they were vainglorious.  Indeed, they were.  They were afraid that history would write them out.  They were seen by the British as traitors to the Empire but they were traitors to their own cause because Eoin MacNeill, the commander-in-chief, had cancelled the Rising and yet they ignored that.  I have read <i>Cla&iacute;omh Solais<\/i>by P&aacute;draig Pearse and all the racist pap in it about the Gaul and the Gael and all this kind of stuff.  His father was an English Protestant.  Cathal Brugha was Charlie Burgess and &Eacute;amonn Ceant was Edward Kent.  It is really quite ridiculous.<br\/>In the Proclamation, which contains some good things, when they referred to our gallant allies in Europe, they were actually talking about the Kaiser and his armies which trampled over little Catholic Belgium and engaged in war crimes.  I think it is no harm for us to put these matters in context and to re-establish the central, democratic and parliamentary tradition in which this House from the days of Grattan through to O'Connell through to Parnell and through to Redmond should be prepared to celebrate and honour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800004#C00300","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1411033200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>When will the Forestry Bill be coming before the Seanad?

In other words, we have the worst diabetes care in western European.  Despite shadowing the UK in many health indices, in this survey, Ireland is far behind the UK in this particular health matter.  The director of the index, Dr. Beatriz Cebolla, notes that we have a huge public health problem in that we, as a population, are obese and sedentary.  She notes that we have very good services in terms of the supply of equipment for monitoring and treating diabetes and in educational matters but no reliable data on the health complications for such patients, such as blood sugar levels and eye and foot conditions.  She makes a number of recommendations, including addressing obesity, exercise and nutrition in schools, which I consider an excellent idea.

It is quite obvious from the summer months that the public will be asked to pay more for water than was previously anticipated and that the annual charge will be greater than what was presented by the Minister when we had very lengthy debates in this House on the water services legislation.  The way the Government has gone about this is also very undemocratic because in a very clever way from its perspective, although I think it will backfire on it, it has given responsibility for setting the charges over to the Commission for Energy Regulation, thereby allowing Fine Gael and the Labour Party to wash their hands of the charge and the rate.  I do not think it will wash with the people or the electorate.<\/p><p>It is also interesting at a time when we are hearing from the Government that we may have some wriggle room in the budget to support low and middle income families, it is planning to dip into their already empty pockets to charge them for water, which we know is one of the most necessary resources people need.  That is on the back of the huge level of investment going into water meters which would be better spent on fixing the leaks in the system rather than putting what I would characterise as Government cash registers outside people's homes, which is what these water meters will be.<\/p><p>It is important that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government comes to the House to spell out exactly what is happening because we have not had that since the Commission for Energy Regulation has been given the responsibility to set the water charge.  Members of the Oireachtas, both in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad, should be allowed to have a discussion with the Minister on this important issue because obviously people throughout the State are getting packs and they have a large number of questions, even around the logistics and modalities of it, which need to be addressed also.

I believe that is an underestimate of the level of rent increases and I know that Threshold, for example, has noticed that 20%, 30% and 40% rent increases regularly occur.  As the PRTB pointed out, the reality is that those kinds of rents represent 41% of the income of the tenants registered with it.<\/p> <p>It is not sustainable to have people pay such an amount to put a roof over their heads.<\/p><p>Renting is no longer a minor or marginal form of tenure consisting of students and people moving towards home ownership.

A new and sinister activity known as petrol stretching, which involves the mixing of kerosine with petrol, is reaching epidemic proportions in western and Border counties.  This fuel is causing severe damage to vehicles, imposing significant financial burdens on people and putting livelihoods at risk.  A question arises as to who is liable in the event of a vehicle being severely damaged.  Is it the owner of the petrol station or the supplier of the illegal fuel?  In some cases, insurance companies are not accepting liability, which is a major issue.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality on identifying what can be done to curb this activity as it is costing many people a great deal of money.<\/p><p>A system of quality assurance for fuels, including an inspection regime, is required to provide customers on garage forecourts the certainty that the fuel they are purchasing is good and has not been interfered with.  This sinister activity must be nipped in the bud before it spreads further.  I understand, 350 people attended a public meeting to highlight the issue in Swinford, County Mayo.  I call on the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Environment, Community and Local Government to take the matter in hand as a matter of urgency by putting the people involved in the activity out of business.

A Government press release indicates the Taoiseach will defend the 12.5% corporation tax rate, which is very valuable to the country.  I support his position in that regard and his view that Ireland is not a brass plate location.  However, the important part of the draft speech is the Taoiseach's view that, as international tax loopholes are closed, our low corporation tax rate will become even more attractive and offer a great opportunity.  Ireland should fully participate in any moves by the OECD and United States against the international tax lawyer and tax accountant loophole industry.  We have a 12.5% corporation tax rate and it is incumbent on companies that they pay it.  The tax base must not be eroded for the many reasons outlined by Senator Cullinane and others.  We need tax revenues.<\/p><p>Our industrial policy must be refocused on competitiveness, better sheltered sector services, better value for pubic expenditure and the better policies the House is dedicated to achieving.

I will make a happy announcement to the House.  In San Francisco two days ago, Dr. Pierre Thirion, acting on behalf of the Ireland Co-operative Clinical Oncology Research Group, presented a paper selected for the very top presentation at the American Society for Radiation Oncology, ASTRO, conference.  It is the leading meeting in the world for radiation therapy of cancer and thousands of papers are submitted every year, with a few accepted for presentation and a handful being accepted for what is called the plenary presentation.  It has been described as \"the Oscars\" of radiation oncology research.  Dr. Thirion did a study conducted entirely in Ireland and it was led, designed and run here by Irish doctors.  I pay tribute to them for this extraordinary achievement in putting cancer research in this country on such an important stage.<\/p><p>The principle which underlies socialised health care is the notion that people will be looked after from the cradle to the grave, with appropriate access to health care based on need and not ability to pay throughout the long trajectory of a normal life.  Sadly, over the past week, we have seen evidence that we are getting it systematically wrong at the extremes of life.  I do not wish to personalise the issue to a particular hospital, as the fault is not with a hospital but rather the system in general.  However, patients in Galway hospital receiving terminal care at the very end of their lives were forced to receive this in circumstances that were less than private and dignified.  No fault can really be attached to any of the nurses or doctors involved but it underlines a gross underprovision of required services.  That is not specific to this Government or the current or previous Minister but it is instead related to a creaking system in need of reform.  It has required such reform for the 21 years I have been in the country, when it has been obvious that we needed to carry it out.<\/p><p>There is a similar issue at the beginning of life.  During the week we heard reports of some sequelae of both the obstetric tragedy which occurred in Galway several years ago and also of problems in another hospital.  I cannot make the point strongly enough that we have a grotesquely small number of specialists in obstetrics per head of population and we are way off the bottom of the European charts, despite having one of the highest birth rates in Europe.  This cannot continue.  All of the committees, bodies like HIQA, care pathways, guidelines and disciplinary hearings which occur afterwards will not fix this problem.<\/p> <p>All of the disciplinary hearings that occur afterwards will not fix the problem; it must be fixed prospectively.  It is not just a question of plugging in an extra couple of hands here or there; it is a question of reforming the system.  I feel that I have been defrauded because I backed the Government parties when they were in opposition and came forward with plans to reform the health system based on insurance, which was one of the five key points of their reform policy.  I want the Government to tell us its plan for implementing it because all of the mood music we have been getting both from the previous Minister, who said it would be implemented in a subsequent period of government, and from the current Minister, who is now effectively saying that the advice of his officials is that it may never be implementable, is very confusing.<\/p><p>I urge that we get clarity on this issue and I believe that we need a specific debate in this House - not a broad ramble about the health service, but one in which the Minister comes in to us to tell us exactly what happened to the plan; what were the criteria that were not met that made Fine Gael decide it was no longer implementable; what it will do in future; and if it is not to proceed, what is its alternative vision for the health service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800006#E04000","speaker":"1147","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411035000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>I have just noted the queues at polling stations in Scotland.

Whereas I fully agree with his point that John Redmond deserves to be commemorated and was a decent, honourable and fine Irish politician in the tradition of Parnell, O'Connell and Grattan, to try to have revision on that at the expense of the leaders of 1916 is a non-starter.<br\/>It must be remembered that Henry Grattan, who was the ultimate parliamentarian, had the original Irish Volunteers parading up and down College Green when he was making some of his inflammatory statements in the old House of Commons.  From that came a whole new tradition - a different tradition from that of Parnell - of Wolfe Tone, Emmet and the Fenians.  That tradition was inherited by the men of 1916.  Whatever else they were, they were not traitors and they paid the ultimate price for their beliefs.<br\/>The Senator quoted Yeats to suit his purpose.  Like the devil, we can all quote scripture.  However, he should remember that Yeats's most famous statement on 1916 was:<blockquote>All changed, changed utterly:<br \/>A terrible beauty is born.<\/blockquote>That was the beauty created by the sacrifice of 1916, which has informed Irish politics, whichever way we want to look at it, ever since.  We can celebrate 1916 and honour John Redmond, and continue to work towards a peacefully achieved united Ireland, which was the ideal of all of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800007#F00300","speaker":"1142"},{"type":"speech","time":1411035000,"counter":86,"content":"<p>At the outset, I wish to say that I am a supporter of the JobBridge internship scheme and I will continue to support it.  International evidence and experience shows that internship schemes play a very important role in supporting labour forces.  The experience in Ireland has shown that 63% of people who take part in JobBridge schemes enter the workforce at the end of it, not necessarily in the jobs they are doing as an intern.  The internship scheme is evidence that it is more advantageous to be involved in the workforce than not to be involved in the workforce.<\/p><p>However, I am very alarmed to hear this morning that 168 internees are being employed in the educational system in various roles, including SNAs, school secretaries and caretakers.  There is a real suspicion that this could be seen as an instance of displacement of workforce.  The internship scheme was never intended to be used in this manner.  I ask the Leader if we could get a statement from the Minister in this regard.  I believe the internship scheme is so important to our economic recovery that anything that goes to undermine the credibility of the scheme needs to be resisted.  I believe that 18% of recently recruited internships are in the educational system, which is unacceptable.  I do not blame school principals for taking the opportunity to recruit additional help in the classroom and around the schools; that is not the point I am making.  However, we need to take a fundamental look at how the internship scheme is working.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800007#F00400","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1411035000,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Last year, we had a very interesting debate on the Food Provenance Bill and I believe I got wholehearted support.  However, the Minister said he wished to delay it because the Food Provenance Bill was aimed at identifying the ingredients in processed food and particularly after the horsemeat scandal that occurred the previous year, that was understandable.  The Minister said that Europe was going to introduce legislation and he wished to delay the implementation of it in Ireland until the European decision was made.  In fact, what happened was that they never got to it in the last session of the European Parliament.  I am urging the MEPs to ensure they get it to the top of the agenda.  Those pushing to delay it say it will be very expensive even though the cost to test each of those processed foods will be less than 1 cent for a product, meaning that customers would have to pay an extra 1 cent to buy a hamburger or whatever.<\/p> <p>Unless we ensure that we get that legislation enacted, we will be the ones who will get the blame.  The horsemeat scandal was discovered by us, but many in Europe assume that because we discovered it, we were at fault.  It turns out the horsemeat scandal was not our fault at all.  It was coming from somewhere else.  Let us ensure we get the safety of food to the top of the agenda.  The belief in the quality of Irish food is essential.  One of the soundings being made from Europe is to label food as from the EU or non-EU instead of listing the country of origin on the ingredients.  I do not think that is nearly good enough.  A number of Irish companies are already showing the source of their products and I think they are gaining the benefit for it.  Let us ensure that we get legislation through our legislative process in Ireland or else that it is covered by the European Parliament.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800007#F00500","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411035600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>The new education and training boards set up under SOLAS to deliver skills and apprenticeship training to our young school leavers will meet for the first time this month.  The legislation to establish the education and training boards was initiated in the Seanad and significant amendments to the Bill were tabled in the Seanad before it was sent to the D&aacute;il.  With the demand for new skills, this is an important time for these boards.  Some five education and training boards do not have a training centre under the current structure, and the delivery of courses will be from other education and training boards.  We must keep an eye on this.  I do not know how it will work out but I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Damien English to make a statement on this matter.  I reiterate that the legislation was initiated in the Seanad and we have a very special function in this regard.<br\/>Senator Mary White made a rousing speech.  It was a pity she did not get a run for the Office of President as she could possibly be there in 2016 to preside over the commemorations.  I was nearly getting my old Thompson gun down from the attic and calling on Volunteer Cullinane to come out with me, but then I remembered the words of W.B. Yeats: &quot;Did that play of mine send out\/Certain men the English shot?&quot;.  I decided to rest easy.<br\/>Senator Norris also referred to a line in Yeats' poem <i>Easter, 1916<\/i>: &quot;A drunken, vainglorious lout.&quot;  That was a particular reference to an individual, Major John MacBride, not because he was fighting in 1916 but because he stole his bird from him.  It was not a general reference to the leaders of 1916.<br\/>Both traditions are noble.  I would prefer that we reflect on the words of Mrs. Una O'Higgins O'Malley in which she says that Irish people North and South:<blockquote>Should gaze into the faces of their children<br \/>And not their ancestors<br \/>While planning for the future.<\/blockquote>I concur with Senator Paschal Mooney's call yesterday for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, to come to the Seanad.  To quote from the Proclamation:<blockquote>IRISHMEN AND IRISHWOMEN: In the name of God and of the dead generations from which she receives her old tradition of nationhood, Ireland, through us, summons her children to her flag and strikes for her freedom.<\/blockquote>The leaders of 1916 did not have popular support but went not with the will of the people but in the name of God and of the dead generations.  If we do not work in the North to get political progress from all sides, we are in danger of those at the extremes taking over and politics being cast to one side.  It is quite a dangerous situation at present.  I agree that we need the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to come to the House and outline what we can do to help keep politics to the forefront in the North.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800008#G00200","speaker":"1166"},{"type":"speech","time":1411035600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>Bheadh s&eacute; tr&aacute;th&uacute;il agus cabhrach d&aacute; mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn ar chom&oacute;radh &Eacute;ir&iacute; Amach na C&aacute;sca.

There is a vacuum which is being filled by leaks from the all-party committee.  That is not helpful because the debate that ensues from those leaks is not comprehensive and is creating a lot of confusion among the public.  I believe it would be an impoverished nation that would benefit from the fruits of the sacrifices of our patriots and yet ignore their memory, misrepresent them or even worse still, endeavour to trample on their legacy, even if that is part of a great political secret or plan which is perhaps being crafted at present but of which the public is not aware.<\/p><p>I believe every Member, including Senator Norris, appreciates what 1916 really meant.  It is all there in the Proclamation of 1916.  It is possibly one of the shortest charters of Irish independence, and yet it is so visionary in so many ways that many of the sentiments and aspirations are still relevant to this day.  Anybody with the slightest open-minded interest in history knows full well that the men and women of 1916 went out to fight an impossible fight at that stage.  It was certainly a matter of right against might - the might of the British Empire at that time.  If we try through some method or deliberately set out to distract from 1916 in the midst of all the other commemorations, all of which are legitimate in their own right, I believe we challenge the morale of our own people.  It was quite clear in the ensuing general election after 1916 where the people's wishes were at that time.  There is another aspect to this.  Not only would we challenge our morale as a nation, we would also diminish the respect in those countries that were inspired by the 1916 Rising.  Whatever political views we have or whatever political plans may be hatched to play down the 1916 commemoration, it is important to look at the bigger picture, and I genuinely believe that is what the people want us to do.  I am totally committed to integrating North and South further and to having greater interaction.  I saw this for myself in Derry, as did Senator Jim D'Arcy, at the Fleadh Cheoil last year.  When we went to the Waterside, we met the loyalist leaders and made presentations to them.  I will never forget one loyalist who came up and put his arm around me and said that this has been one of the greatest weeks in the history of their city.  He went a step further when he said that they will teach those in Belfast how they should behave.  To me that interaction is taking place and we can have a commemoration of 1916 and still respect the other traditions on this island.  I plead that we do not minimise it to the point that all we are interested in is scoring points or putting forward petty agendas.  This would not be worthy of us as a Seanad, a people and a nation and I hope we do not go down that road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800008#G00300","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speech","time":1411036200,"counter":91,"content":"<p>I support the good wishes expressed for David Begg, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.

Yeats has been quoted liberally and next year we will celebrate his 150th birthday.  Senator Susan O'Keeffe and I are heavily involved in the preparations for this event and last night we won a significant victory in this House on this matter.  In 2009 the ancestral home of Yeats, Thoor Ballylee in south Galway, was severely flooded.  Though it is under the remit of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the house has since remained closed.  It would be a shame, locally, nationally and internationally, if the house was not opened for his 150th birthday.<\/p><p>Senator Susan O'Keeffe attended a meeting of the Yeats Thoor Ballylee society chaired by me ten days ago in Galway.

Senator Barrett referred to the recent OECD report and the importance of defending our 12.5% corporation tax rate.

I can assure the Senator of that.  <\/p><p>Senator Paul Coghlan outlined Government policy on water charges and referred to the success of various economic policies.  Senator Crowne complimented cancer care research which was conducted in Ireland on radiation oncology and referred to the fact that a paper will be delivered at a plenary session in San Francisco.

I note that we have two Ministers called Humphreys, both of whom are dealing with commemorations.  The Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection, Deputy Kevin Humphreys was in this House yesterday and said that he will also be dealing with the forthcoming commemorations.  I will invite the Minister or the Minister of State to the House to discuss the decade of commemorations and the 1916 commemorations in particular.  It is important that we would have such a discussion.  The former Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan was in the House not too long ago to discuss the same subject.  We had a comprehensive debate with him at that time but I agree with Senators who argue that we should have a discussion with either the new Minister or the Minister of State.  <\/p><p>Senator O'Sullivan also referred to the commemoration of 1916 and the fact that we can celebrate both 1916 and John Redmond's achievements on Home Rule.  Senator Gilroy raised the issue of the JobBridge scheme and its success to date.  He also spoke about the importance of the scheme and the need to combat any undermining of it.  I agree with him on that point and will try to raise the matter with the Minister.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn asked about the Food Provenance Bill.  As he rightly pointed out, the EU measures that were envisaged were not dealt with in the last session of the European Parliament.  I agree that there is a need to expedite matters in that regard, perhaps by way of the Bill proposed by the Senator.  The issue needs to be advanced either at home or at EU level.<\/p><p>Senator Jim D'Arcy spoke about the Education and Training Boards, ETBs, and asked that the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation be invited to the House to give a progress report on them and I will issue such an invitation.  I note Senator D'Arcy's wise words regarding the importance of expediting matters in Northern Ireland.  He asked that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade be invited to the House to update us on developments there.<\/p><p>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; also referred to the plans for commemorating 1916.  Respect for all traditions on this island has been paramount in this House at all times.  We have done our best to ensure that respect is shown to all traditions here.<\/p><p>Senator Brennan spoke about the major boost to tourism arising from sporting events including the US colleges football games, the securing of the Curtis Cup and the amateur ladies' and men's championships proposed for Carton House.

This Bill has benefitted significantly from the detailed consideration given in its passage through the other House and I look forward to an equally constructive and productive debate in this House.<\/p><p>In line with the programme for Government commitment, the primary purpose of the Bill is threefold: to restore the substance of the access to information regime put in place in the original 1997 Act; to extend freedom of information, FOI, to all public bodies, including some noteworthy long-standing exclusions, as well as providing the power to extend FOI to non-statutory bodies that get significant funding from the Exchequer; and to enhance and strengthen our FOI legislation so that it works more effectively and is consistent wholly with the objectives for FOI set out in the initial 1997 legislation.<\/p><p>The FOI Bill is, of course, merely one of a broad suite of political and legislative reforms which the Government has initiated.  Since I became Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I have placed great emphasis on the reform element of that role and I intend to continue to focus on delivering open, accountable and ethical public governance arrangements in Ireland for both the operation of Government and the public service generally.  My aim has been to strengthen citizens' trust in Government and in the institutions of the State and to promote a transparent, efficient and effective public system.<\/p><p>Real progress has been made on many fronts, including, as this House will be aware because of its detailed consideration of these pieces of legislation, the extension of the Ombudsman's remit in 2012, the enactment of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Bill in 2013; the recent enactment of the protected disclosures legislation better known as the whistleblowers' Act, the publication of the draft Bill to regulate lobbying, the overhaul of ethics legislation and preparation of a general scheme which is at an advanced stage of preparation and on which I look forward to returning here shortly, significant steps to advance Ireland's participation in the open government partnership, OGP, which I recommended to Government, and the development of proposals to strengthen Civil Service accountability on which front significant initiatives will be advanced in this parliamentary session.  The reform of FOI legislation is central to the Government's goal of rebuilding public trust in the State and to enhancing public governance through a significant strengthening of openness, transparency and accountability of government and public administration.<\/p><p>The introduction of freedom of Information in 1998 was a milestone in terms of defining the relationship between the Administration and the citizen.  Effectively, it substituted the presumption of openness in relation to official information for the presumption of secrecy which had existed up until then.  It also allowed both citizens and commentators to become much more informed on the deliberations which preceded decisions affecting them.  Before FOI, the work of the Administration was carried out behind closed doors in accordance with legislation such as the Official Secrets Acts.  The introduction of FOI lifted this veil of secrecy for the first time, allowing information relating to the governing of the State to be made openly available to the public.  FOI has also been instrumental in bringing issues of vital public concern into the public domain and has facilitated stronger oversight of the actions of Government and the public service.<\/p><p>The 2003 amendment Act introduced by the then Government severely restricted access to records in a number of respects and represented a significant curtailment of the approach to openness and transparency that the 1997 Act had introduced.  My starting point in introducing this reforming legislation was to reverse the majority of the 2003 changes so that Ireland's FOI regime could again compare favourably with the best access regimes internationally.<\/p><p>In that regard, I am reversing the wide definition of Government introduced in the 2003 amending legislation.  I am amending the strict definition of what constitutes a Cabinet record and restoring the original definition.  Communications between members of Government will no longer be exempt from FOI.  The ten-year prohibition on the release of Cabinet records is being restored to the original five-year gap - one of the most liberal provisions on access to Cabinet records that exists anywhere.  The mandatory power to refuse an FOI request relating to Government records, or records to be submitted to Government, introduced in 2003 Act is being removed.  The power for Secretaries General of Departments to certify the existence of a deliberative process with no scope for appeal is being repealed, and the public interest test applying to records relating to the deliberative process is being restored - that replicates what was in the original Act.<\/p><p>The reform of the legislation provides for some liberalisation of the mandatory 'class' exemption put in place in 2003 in relation to diplomatic communications and defence matters.  Significant protections for highly sensitive or obviously secret information will be maintained.<\/p><p>The restriction of the Act to the costing by a public body of political party proposals is also being repealed.  Where a commercial State body provides a service under a contract to a public body subject to FOI, the records relating to that service will now also be subject to FOI.  In addition, I am removing the power to impose an application fee for making FOI requests.<\/p><p>In terms of extending the application of FOI, I am proposing to introduce a generic definition which will allow the Act to apply to all public bodies subject to strictly limited exemptions as set out in this Bill.  As I did in other provisions I brought this House, everybody is included unless there is a compelling legislative reason to exclude him or her that must be set out in law.  This represents a reversal of the current position where a public body is included only if it is explicitly scheduled in the Bill.  This will result in a number of long-standing high profile exclusions from FOI being brought under the scope of the legislation, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; public financial bodies such as the NTMA, NAMA, the NPRF, the NDFA and the Central Bank of Ireland; and the refugee agencies.<\/p> <p>As a result of this new structure, public bodies excluded either in whole or in part from FOI need to be specifically set out in the Bill.  This introduces a high degree of transparency in respect of any body that is not subject to the exclusions and ensures that there is a full examination by the Oireachtas of the rationale for any proposed exclusion in the future.  In that regard, I am providing that a positive resolution of both Houses will be required before any orders are made concerning the application of FOI to bodies.  If there is any change, including or excluding, it will have to come before the House and stand up on its own merits.<\/p><p>Certain exemptions are proposed in the public interest for some bodies.  FOI does need to perform a balancing act between meeting the public need for information while seeking to deliver public administration effectively.  In the interests of transparency, I have adopted a policy of providing, to the greatest extent possible, for the exemptions from FOI for public bodies, in whole or in part, in a Schedule to the Bill.  It is important to note that the inclusion of exemptions for specific public bodies in the Schedule is intended to facilitate scope for their removal or amendment if that decision was to be taken at any time in the future.<\/p><p>Official information held by the public sector can and should be made available but without compromising citizens or leading to privacy concerns.  It is an interesting balance.  I gave a talk on FOI at a public forum.  As I went into that public forum a group protested on one side demanding transparency while a group protesting at the other side of the door was demanding privacy.  There are concerns that we get the balance right, particularly in regard to private information in respect of any individual citizen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800011#L00400","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411038000,"counter":112,"content":"<p>The protests were balanced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800012#M00200","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1411038000,"counter":113,"content":"<p>They were.  Official information held by the public sector can and should be made available but we must have regard for privacy concerns.  Where exemptions exist, they correspond to those found in FOI legislation in the most regressive jurisdictions that I have looked at.  In addition, many of these exemptions are not absolute but will require to be subjected to public interest tests.  My FOI reforms also encompass some highly significant enhancements and innovations in the legislation that are aimed at substantially transforming the environment for FOI in Ireland.  We looked very carefully at what is happening in the best jurisdictions abroad in that regard.<\/p><p>A key element in the Bill is the requirement to prepare and furnish publication schemes - there has been some misunderstanding about this - to promote the proactive publication of information outside of FOI and in a more accessible form.  These publication schemes will set out the nature of the information an organisation publishes on its website, including extensive information on the nature, role, responsibilities and activities of any such organisation.  To ensure that there is no question whatsoever that less information would be made available by public bodies under the publication schemes than under the current regime, I made an important amendment in the D&aacute;il specifying key information that would be required for inclusion in a publication scheme.  The idea is to promote the proactive publication of as much information as possible without the need for FOI and there should be access point for all of that.<\/p><p>Other innovative elements of the FOI reform legislation that are very significant include the inclusion in the Bill of key principles to guide public bodies in the performance of their functions under the Act.  During this whole process I learned that the application of the original 1997 Act was treated differently by different public bodies.  Some embraced it enthusiastically and some less enthusiastically.  There is a need for standard guidelines and proper training for FOI officers, as provided for in this Bill, including the need to achieve greater openness, strengthen accountability and decision making and facilitate more effective participation by the public in consultations relating to the role, responsibilities and performance of FOI bodies.  Also in the Bill there are provisions to enable extension of FOI to non-public bodies in receipt of significant Exchequer funding by way of ministerial order in the future.  There are many public bodies who receive a large amount of their funding from the State purse and there is no reason, simply because they are NGOs or private sector bodies,  they would not be subject to FOI if the taxpayer is funding them.  I was asked outside if I could include An Taisce.  I do not know because I do not know what funding it gets.  There are bodies that can be looked at in that regard if they are significantly funded by the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800012#M00300","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1411038000,"counter":114,"content":"<p>Does the Minister have any problem with that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800012#M00400","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1411038000,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I am sure not.

I understand there is a burden involved but we have to help all bodies to meet obligations as they are rolled out and I am cognisant of that.  There are new provisions in the Bill to ensure FOI requests relating to information held electronically are dealt with effectively; and an amendment at section 11 to clarify that there is a general right of access to records; and records should be released unless they are found to be exempt.  That is the fundamental principle.  In applying the exemptions the right of access is only to be set aside where the exemptions very clearly support a refusal of such access.<\/p><p>I turn to the matter of fees, the point of greatest controversy in the passage of the Bill so far. There was considerable discussion in the D&aacute;il on the issue of fees for FOI requests and between Committee Stage and Report Stage I gave extensive consideration to the matter including the commissioning of an international trawl of best practice and met many international colleagues.  I attended a number of fora under the open government partnership to ascertain the best practice.  I asked my officials to undertake a detailed assessment of the case.  The assessment, a copy of which is available on my Department's website, was approached in the context of the Government's commitment to securing substantially greater openness, transparency and accountability.<\/p><p>On the basis of the assessment, I decided that a complete reform of the FOI fees regime was required, reflecting elements of good practice in other jurisdictions such as Australia and the UK, including the removal of the application fee, the setting of caps on what can be charged for search, retrieval and copying fees, providing some search, retrieval and copying time free of charge up to a reasonable limit and the proposed provision of information in simple administrative form outside of FOI, through more proactive publication of information and open data policies as well as other access regimes such as access to environmental information and the EU re-use of public sector information directive.<\/p><p>In summary, the amendments to the FOI Bill in regard to fees that were agreed in the D&aacute;il and are now before this House include the abolition of the &euro;15 application fee.  I have removed the power in the Bill to set a fee - some said I should reduce the fee to zero - so any re-introduction would require primary legislation.  In addition, there is the introduction of a cap on the amount of search, retrieval and copying fees that can be charged at &euro;500 which involves about 25 hours work; the introduction of a further upper limit on estimated search, retrieval and copying fees at &euro;700 which involves about 35 hours work by a civil servant above which an FOI body could refuse to process a request, unless the requester was prepared to refine the request to bring the search, retrieval and copying fees below the limit.  The idea is that one would not make a complicated multifaceted request, for example, a genealogical search where a person wants to know their family tree to the Norman conquest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800012#M00900","speaker":"1097"},{"type":"speech","time":1411038000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>Very modest of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800012#M01000","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1411038000,"counter":121,"content":"<p>My retort would be that one should hire a researcher.  There can be discreet bespoke FOI requests that would take less than 25 hours of search and retrieval by a public servant.  That is a more reasonable way of proceeding.  I am also providing for the introduction of a minimum threshold of &euro;100, five hours work, below which no search, retrieval and copying fees would be charged; that would mean that for the majority of requests there will be no fees whatsoever.  However, if search, retrieval and copying of records are required above that level the full cost of search, retrieval and copying would apply subject to the cap of &euro;500.  The idea is to have a focused rather than a general trawl for information.  This will enable a person to ask for sequential information in discreet bites as opposed to a general trawl that would take a number of civil servants days to work through it.<\/p> <p>From having spoken to colleagues internationally, that is the way to go.<br\/>There is also the introduction of a definition in the Bill to ensure there is clarity on the activities for which search, retrieval and copying fees can be applied fully in line with the intention in the original legislation, which includes all activities carried out leading up to the finalisation of a file containing the records for review by the decision maker.  The reduction in costs for internal reviews and appeals to the Information Commissioner had been agreed by Government from the outset.  Appeals will also be much cheaper.  I am strongly of the view that my freedom of information fees reforms complement the overall thrust of the freedom of information reform legislation and other key initiatives such as the open government partnership, which I think is a very important international initiative, the planned revision of re-use of public sector information legislation, and open data to increase significantly the volume of official information made available to all our citizens.  These measures should be acknowledged as a far-reaching reform of freedom of information in Ireland.<br\/>This freedom of information reform legislation is being introduced in tandem with the development of a code of practice in relation to its operation. This is the outcome of a short, focused and targeted operational review of freedom of information which I initiated last year.  The review was carried out by an expert group comprising academics, journalists and other users and a public body review group consisting of freedom of information experts in the public service itself.  The draft code, which is currently out for public comment, is an essential development.  It will support the implementation of freedom of information and promote best and, I hope, uniform practice in its operation.  It will guide and inform the performance of public bodies in relation to their responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act and help to minimise the administrative burden, particularly on smaller organisations that will now be subject to it.  It will seek to ensure appropriate consistency and standardisation of approach for the benefit of both requesters and the public bodies themselves, and will deepen and widen the expertise and capacity of public bodies in freedom of information and assist them in handling requests effectively and efficiently.  I believe implementation of the code, due to be finalised on enactment of the Bill, will enhance the overall efficiency of Ireland's freedom of information regime and secure a sustained improvement in the performance by public bodies of their responsibilities under freedom of information.<br\/>I will now briefly outline the provisions of the Bill.  Part 1<b><\/b>contains sections 1 to 5, inclusive, which deal with preliminary and general matters - Short Title, definitions, etc.  Part<b><\/b>2 contains sections 6 and 7 which enable freedom of information to apply to all public bodies unless they are specifically exempted, and to other bodies that are significantly funded by the Exchequer.<br\/>Part<b><\/b>3 contains sections 8 to 27, inclusive, relating to central elements of the legal framework.  Section<b><\/b>8 deals with the publication scheme.  Sections 9 and 10<b><\/b>provide for the amendment of records relating to the personal information and the right of a person to information regarding an act of a freedom of information body affecting that person.  Section 11<b><\/b>has been amended to provide key principles to guide freedom of information bodies in the performance of their functions under the Act.  It also repeals the 2003 provision which limited the potential for access to records relating to services provided under a contract of service to a public body by a commercial State body or other private bodies.<br\/>Section 12<b><\/b>deals with requests for access to records and contains a new subsection enabling requesters to be advised of other regimes for access to official information, thus potentially reducing the cost to the requester.  Section 13<b><\/b>deals with decisions on requests and section 14<b><\/b>relates to the extension of time for consideration of freedom of information requests.  Section 15<b><\/b>provides for a refusal of an freedom of information request on administrative grounds and section 16<b><\/b>permits deferral of access to a narrow range of records.<br\/>Section<b><\/b>17 covers the manner of access to records.  It requires freedom of information bodies to take reasonable steps to search for and extract electronic data from databases.  It also clarifies that where records are available in electronic form, they may be released in electronic and searchable format.  Sections 18 to 20, inclusive,<b><\/b>relate to access to parts of records, failure to reply to a request within the timeframe specified, and the delegation of functions relating to freedom of information to enable more effective operation of the Act.  Section 21<b><\/b>provides for internal reviews.<br\/>Section<b><\/b>22 provides for reviews by the Information Commissioner of decisions of a freedom of information body.  A number of technical changes are being proposed in section 22 to improve the functioning of the Act, as has been requested.  Section<b><\/b>23 allows the commissioner of Information to require a freedom of information body to provide more detailed reasons for refusal to grant a request.  Section 24<b><\/b>provides for appeals to the High Court.  Some amendments have been made including broadening the grounds for appeals.<br\/>Sections<b><\/b>25 and 26<b><\/b>set out precautions against the disclosure of exempt information and a stay on certain decisions which may be subject to appeal.  Section<b><\/b>27 relates to fees, and I have already set out those in some detail.<br\/><b><\/b>Part 4<b><\/b>contains sections 28 to 41, inclusive, providing a series of exemptions to protect sensitive information.  Section<b><\/b>28 relates to Government records.  I have reversed the restrictions on the release of such records that were made in the 2003 Act.  Section 29<b><\/b>relates to deliberations of freedom of information bodies.  I have restored this to what it was originally in the 1997 Act.  Sections 30 to<b><\/b>32, inclusive, largely re-enact the current sections 21 to 23, inclusive.<br\/>Section 33<b><\/b>relates to security, defence and international relations.  The absolute exemption from such records relating to the tactics, strategy or operations of the Defence Forces and certain diplomatic communications is removed and made subject to a harm test.  The mandatory exemption remains only for highly sensitive confidential communications relating to, for example, negotiations between the State and international organisations, and for information relating to intelligence in respect of security or defence of the State.<br\/>Section 34<b><\/b>re-enacts the existing section 25 relating to the issue of ministerial certificates.  Sections<b><\/b>35 to<b><\/b>37, inclusive, retain the original exemptions in the 1997 Act for confidential, commercially sensitive and personal information held by a freedom of information body. <b><\/b>Section<b><\/b>38 outlines consultation procedures to be followed if a head proposes to release, in the public interest, information referred to in sections 35 to 37, inclusive.<br\/>Section 39<b><\/b>maintains the original exemption for information relating to research and natural resources, subject to certain conditions.  Section 40<b><\/b>protects information where disclosure could reasonably be expected to have serious adverse effects on the financial interests of the State or the ability of the Government to manage the economy.  Section 41<b><\/b>upholds the operation of specific secrecy and non-disclosure provisions in other enactments unless such provisions are based on Schedule 3, in which case they are all subordinate to freedom of information.<br\/>Part<b><\/b>5 contains section 42 which, as in the 1997 Act, restricts application of freedom of information to administrative records for a number of limited public bodies.  There are some additions to this section including highly sensitive crime, security and intelligence activities carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which are excluded from the scope of freedom of information.  The section also excludes records held by the Central Bank of Ireland which are subject to professional secrecy obligations under EU law, which cannot be overridden by national law.<br\/><b><\/b>Part 6<b><\/b>contains sections 43 to<b><\/b>47, inclusive, relating to the Information Commissioner in terms of his or her powers, reviews, and so on.  Some new provisions are included in section 45<b><\/b>such as to allow the Information Commissioner to apply for a court order to oblige a freedom of information body to comply with a binding decision of the commissioner where the body has failed to do so.<br\/><b><\/b>Part<b><\/b>7 contains sections 48 to 55, inclusive.  Section 48<b><\/b>provides the Minister with the power to draw up and publish a code of practice and guidelines to assist freedom of information bodies, and that is what I intend to do.  Section 50<b><\/b>amends the Central Bank Act 1942 to allow the Bank to furnish information to the Information Commissioner in the performance of the commissioner's functions.  Section<b><\/b>52 provides that it will be an offence to destroy or alter, wilfully and without lawful excuse, a record that is subject to an freedom of information request and sets out a fine on summary conviction.  Section 54<b><\/b>is a saver provision.  Regulations made under the 1997 Act relating to the scope of the application of freedom of information to particular public bodies, other than those listed in Schedule 5, will cease to be in operation on the commencement of this Act.  Section<b><\/b>55 provides for transitional arrangements for any actions commenced but not completed under the 1997 Act.  For example, if legal proceedings are pending to which the Information Commissioner is a party, the proceedings may continue as if the 1997 Act had not been repealed.<br\/>In the Schedules, as I have indicated, Schedule 1, part 1 details the bodies included, in part, under freedom of information, while Schedule 1, part 2 is a list of bodies exempted from freedom of information in full.  Schedules 2 and 3 re-enact current Schedules but have been updated.  Schedule 4 details the repeals of both primary and secondary legislation affected by the Bill, and Schedule 5 lists the statutory instruments made under the 1997 Act which are to continue in force on enactment.<br\/>I trust that Senators will strongly support this very significant reforming measure and that they will welcome the positive set of measures which I place before them in this Bill.  I commend the Bill to this House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800012#M01100","speaker":"1097","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411039200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.

We might not allow some other Ministers the same latitude.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Simon Harris.<\/p><p>The Government often talks about restoring FOI.  Some 18,000 FOI requests are made every year and a significant volume of information has been given out every year since the original FOI Act was introduced, and indeed since the amending Act in 2003.  In this debate, that reality is often ignored.  There is a huge amount of information out there and most records that people might want are available on request.  <\/p><p>The FOI process is extremely important in holding public bodies and officials to account, and I welcome many of the changes in this Bill.  The Bill underwent a complicated legislative process in the D&aacute;il before coming to this House.  Fianna F&aacute;il did not support the Bill in its original form, as it would have brought even more restrictions on FOI in terms of the charges that were originally proposed by the Government.  I am glad that there was such a deliberative process in the D&aacute;il to examine this legislation line-by-line, to force the Minister and the Government to go back and adapt it, and to listen to what was being said by interested parties, by the Opposition, and even by some members of the Government.<\/p><p>Some of the quirks of FOI have annoyed me over the years.  For example, the fee certainly does block some requests, but the need to pay by cheque is a bigger barrier to access.  Chequebooks are no longer issued routinely and it is difficult to go down to a post office and get a postal order, although I encourage people to buy as many postal orders as they can from their local post office.  That definitely had a dampening effect on the type of information that was being released.  However, a huge amount of information has been revealed to the public, and rightly so.  In some cases it was shocking information which we are glad was revealed under the existing legislation.<\/p><p>The FOI Bill significantly extends the range of bodies likely to be covered by FOI and the categories of documents affected.  I am particularly glad that during that legislative process in the D&aacute;il, EirGrid was added to the list of bodies subject to FOI.  However, port companies are listed as exempt in this legislation.  This should not be the case, particularly for the smaller port companies which are akin to local authorities as they are not really commercial.  They are not operating in an open marketplace in which one must protect commercially-sensitive material.  I am talking about Drogheda Port, possibly D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company and Galway and New Ross ports.  Waterford, Shannon and Dublin ports are large, but Wicklow Port is not.<\/p><p>I do not understand why Wicklow, Drogheda and some of the smaller port companies are not included under FOI legislation.  They function as local authorities for the areas they cover, as well as running the ports.  The Minister for transport is currently examining proposals to bring the ports under the remit of local authorities.  If that were to happen, some of the smaller ports would then be subject to FOI, so why not do that now?  Those port companies should be examined to the same extent as the local authorities beside them are examined.  I will be proposing amendments on this topic next week.  I am sure that the process of bringing ports under the remit of local authorities is well under way and will happen for some of the smaller companies.  I hope it will happen, as some of the smaller ports are more suited to existence under a local authority structure than as independent semi-State companies.<\/p><p>Section 31 of the Bill relates to the issue of parliamentary papers.  There is a specific exemption from FOI for Members of the European Parliament and members of local authorities.  While there is a constitutional provision in relation to the private papers of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, there is no exemption from FOI.  I do not believe the Houses have Standing Orders relating to this issue, although perhaps they have.  My concern is not about the material usually obtained under FOI about Members of the Houses, but rather information about constituents.  The private papers of Members of the Oireachtas would cover personal information on constituents, which I hope would not be obtained.  This is just a query.  I do not believe it is a major issue and I am certainly not seeking any reduction in the transparency expected of Members.  I would like as much information as possible to be made public.  However, the constituency or legislative work of Members should not be subject to FOI.  <\/p><p>Having said that, as I have said before, people who meet us in Leinster House should be subject to FOI.  They should all have to sign in and the signing-in book should be open to the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800014#O00300","speaker":"1116"},{"type":"speech","time":1411039200,"counter":126,"content":"<p>More signing in, more bureaucracy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800014#O00400","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1411039200,"counter":127,"content":"<p>It would be just as well if some of the characters one sees wandering around these Houses were out in public.

I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, Senator Sheahan, who has been called away to a meeting in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p><p>Senator Byrne has expressed a wish that Members of the Seanad can perfect this Bill and make it the best it can be.  <\/p> <p>The Senate is all about enhancing legislation and ensuring we can identify areas for improvement.  We seek to make legislation foolproof and as good as possible.<\/p><p>The notion of freedom of information took off during the Government that ran from 1994 to 1997 and was led by Eithne Fitzgerald.  It was a new departure in transparency, openness and accountability.  When John Bruton was elected as Taoiseach he spoke of a transparent, open and accountable Government in his inaugural speech.  I believe he said the Government should operate behind a sheet of glass and this is an aspiration with which we all agree.  Unfortunately, the Freedom of Information Bill that passed in 1997 was tweaked and restrictions were put in place.  Historians will decide whether those restrictions were well-intended but the Bill is now being recalibrated appropriately to ensure the openness and accountability that people expect of us.  It is right and good that bodies in receipt of significant taxpayer funding will now be subject to freedom of information provisions.  Some charities in Ireland received up to &euro;40 million and &euro;50 million of taxpayers' money and there was no access to their records.  They were dragged kicking and screaming before the Committee of Public Accounts, PAC, and even then the level of co-operation was frighteningly poor.  We in this House have the power to change this and this piece of legislation will do so.<\/p><p>There is always the prospect that freedom of information can be abused.  I know of a local authority where the equality tribunal process was abused in such a way that every decision the local authority made was appealed to that body by a specific individual.  The legislation facilitated this so I must ask whether there is a way to rule on rogue claims.  Standard freedom of information requests should be free but we must ensure the process is not abused because we are still in a challenging financial environment.<\/p><p>Bodies providing information should have the right to insist it is only provided electronically.  We should avoid the use of reams of paper to provide information.  In the spirit of the paperless society, exemplified by the elimination of Government Department cheques, we should move towards electronic freedom of information.  We should promote environmental objectives.<\/p><p>This Bill is appropriate and correct, though we may not get much recognition in the media for this important legislation.  When we do good things here they are rarely covered so I appeal to members of the fourth estate to alert the general public to the fact that this debate is taking place.  We are attempting to proactively open up Government.  During the 2011 presidential election one or two of the candidates were prepared to open their affairs to the scrutiny of freedom of information requests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800014#O01000","speaker":"1158","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411039800,"counter":134,"content":"<p>We saw how the media behaved then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800015#P00200","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1411039800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>This was very welcome because I do not think the Office of the President is mentioned in this legislation.

The Minister, Deputy Howlin, explained the Bill well before the Minister of State arrived.  I remember well the introduction of the 1997 Bill and I was doubtful as to whether we should support it.  I have now become an enthusiastic supporter of freedom of information and I wish to make some suggestions for improvement.<\/p><p>I got some information yesterday from the Genealogical Society of Ireland - it raised a number of questions and suggestions and, like Senator Byrne, I would like sufficient time to go through the Bill properly to table amendments on Committee Stage.  I very much welcome the legislation because the general feeling is there has been some regression in the area of freedom of information.  The FOI system has been of great benefit to society in uncovering scandals and it should be viewed in a positive way.<\/p><p>As was widely noted, Ireland is the only country in Europe with mandatory, up-front charges for all freedom of information requests.  According to reports, the only other country permitting such charges is Malta but they are not routinely applied.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, explained the steps that will be taken to cover this issue.<\/p><p>There is a need for legislation on electronic records and an amendment in this area may be necessary.  I am interested in State institutions that keep electronic records.  Article 19, a human rights organisation, has stated that in many countries one of the biggest obstacles to accessing information is the poor state in which records are kept.  There is, therefore, a need for legislation on electronic records.  Despite this being the era of e-mail, there is still much confusion around how Government Department records are stored.  I notice the Bill requires public bodies to prepare and furnish publication schemes consistent with international best practice to promote the proactive publication of information outside of FOI.  There are other important questions on this.  Who oversees a Department's records and decides which documents to keep?  Is it normal for a Department to move its papers regularly?  Perhaps the Minister would accept an amendment requiring State bodies to store electronic communications, especially e-mails.  This would contribute to the freedom of information by serving the public and setting conditions for the future.<\/p><p>There is a need for a public spending website.  The key principle underlying the Freedom of Information Act 1997 was allowing the public access to official information.  This principle can be achieved in ways other than parliamentary questions, which are inefficient, and freedom of information requests.  To cut down on freedom of information requests I have argued on several occasions that we should include all public bodies in a simple, easily accessible public spending website.  This website would be based on the US Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act 2006, which was introduced by Barack Obama when he was a Senator.  It has worked well in the US.<\/p><p>The number of FOI requests would fall dramatically if the public had access to more raw data.  It would not be necessary to ask a local TD to raise questions in the D&aacute;il if the data were available.  Patients should be able to access medical records more easily as this relates to freedom of information and transparency.  They could then keep track of their health and make more informed decisions.  A study conducted for the European Commission states that only 4% of European hospitals grant patients online access to their medical records.<\/p><p>Could Government contractors be subject to FOI?<\/p> <p>I suggest this could be an amendment.  <br\/>It is interesting to note, in the context of the extension of FOI by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as contained in this Bill, that the Scottish Government considered extending its transparency laws to major Government contractors.  While the plan was overwhelmingly popular, it was dropped on the grounds that the contractors themselves were opposed to it, understandably.  Does the Minister of State have a view on this?  If a contractor is in receipt of millions of euro in taxpayers' money, surely the public is entitled to get an insight into that business?  The Minister explained earlier that bodies such as charities in receipt of significant sums of public money will also be covered by the FOI provisions.<br\/>Would it be possible to provide for the naming and shaming of State bodies that do not release information?  There is an interesting example of this from the United States of America in the form of the <i>foia.gov<\/i>website, launched in 2011, which allows people to see whether agencies are fulfilling their obligations to disclose information under the freedom of information legislation of that country.  <br\/>Can businesses use FOI more?I believe that is an interesting question to consider.  Can businesses make more use of information generated by the State and turn such information into successful business ideas and create jobs?  I believe there is an opening there.  <br\/>I would also like to raise the issue of the wiping of information from Google searches by employees of State bodies.  I note that under the legislation it will be an offence to &quot;wilfully and without lawful excuse&quot; either destroy or alter a record that is the subject of an FOI request.  While there are sanctions for bodies that destroy their own records, do we need sanctions or fines if public bodies do not keep records?  Do we need to get State bodies to do more in this area to ensure that they keep records?  On a related note, as we have seen in recent months, private citizens now have the ability to wipe certain information from Google.  Last May, a court ruling reinforced people's &quot;right to be forgotten&quot;.  However, I wonder if people employed in State institutions could ask Google to &quot;forget&quot; certain information.  Do we need to include something in this legislation to ensure that civil servants do not simply apply to Google to make certain information that is not to their liking less accessible?  That is a legitimate question.  If we do not include a provision in this legislation to protect against such action then the public's access to information could be limited.  For instance, if a Department was involved in some sort of scandal, staff could ask that this information be removed from a Google search.  Should this be allowed?  It is an interesting question to consider in the context of this legislation.  <br\/>The Bill covers a broad area and it is only when we get down to studying it in detail that we will realise how much is in it.  I urge that we be given adequate time to consider the Bill.  Senator Byrne said earlier that he is concerned that we might not have enough time but I am sure the Leader and the Cathaoirleach will give us enough time to debate the legislation properly in this House.  I welcome the Bill and believe the legislation is in good hands - its provisions were explained very fully to us today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800015#P00400","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411040400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is rare for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, not to attend for the entire debate on his own legislation, as Senator Byrne acknowledged earlier.  Indeed, Senator Byrne also acknowledged that the Minister has brought much legislation through this House.<\/p><p>I believe that the Minister would welcome robust debate.  There are those who were critical of him when he reviewed the legislation and the costs involved.  They argued that he had to be forced to do this and that this was a weakness on his part.  Actually, it is not a weakness in my opinion when a Minister takes on board observations, makes changes and accepts amendments.  That is the democratic process and that is how legislation ought to be progressed.  That is the strength of both of these Houses.  Although the Minister is not here right now, I think it is safe to say that he will welcome robust debate and the thoughts that others, including Senator Quinn, have offered.<\/p><p>Regarding Senator Quinn's observation on Google, I attended a debate on that very matter hosted by Google recently.  I was one of the speakers in a discussion on the right to be forgotten as part of the Hay Festival in Kells this summer.  One of the issues that emerged from the conversation was that the final decision on who gets to be &quot;forgotten&quot; will be taken by Google's lawyers.  That begins to look like the privatisation of information because the information is held by Google and if Senator Quinn or Senator O'Keeffe makes an application to be forgotten, the assessors of that application will be Google lawyers.  That is a very interesting departure or change.  In some ways it was inevitable that when an organisation like Google attained such dominance in the information market it would find itself having to make decisions of this kind.  <\/p><p>I welcome this Bill which represents a strengthening of the existing legislation and a return to the spirit of the 1998 legislation.  One of my prouder moments was receiving an award from the Campaign for the Freedom of Information in the UK for my own work from the then Minister of State, former Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, who was the guest of honour that day.  I have long believed in the importance of freedom of information.  <\/p><p>This Bill is very important and many of the new thoughts that have been brought to it are strong and good.  That said, there is room for further debate, particularly about record keeping.  Not only are there are questions to be asked about the way in which records are held, but also about the way records are created.  The more one opens up the idea of freedom of information, the less information is recorded.  Therefore, one ends up in a situation where, having opened the door to it, people become quite clever in finding ways to record less.  In that way, what we seek to achieve we do not actually achieve.  This is partly due to the fact that we are all human and will find ways to defeat the system.  <\/p><p>Senator Quinn made reference to progress made in America in the context of freedom of information and, indeed, the freedom of information regime in America is pretty good.  However, it is worth noting that five years after President Obama directed agencies to invoke the &quot;deliberative process exception&quot; less frequently in order to withhold materials that describe decision making behind the scenes, withholding went up to a record of 81,752 refusals.  Senator Patrick Leahy, Chairman of the US Senate Judiciary Committee said: &quot;It becomes too much of a temptation.  If you screw up in government, just mark it top secret.&quot;  Further analysis showed that the US Government more than ever before censored materials that it turned over or fully denied access to them.  This is in a country where freedom of information was always cherished.  Indeed, the US is always cited as the country that understands freedom of information best.  <\/p><p>Let us not lull ourselves into some false sense of security that by legislating in a much wider fashion we are changing the way in which information is put into the public domain.  We are not doing that.  We are making small progress.  It is good progress and I welcome it but it is not a panacea or the answer to everything.  There will always be ways and means for Governments, Departments and people to keep secrets.  We are very good at that, as human beings.  Indeed, in this country we have a long record of networks of people keeping secrets, not just individuals.  In the context of the work I did on child abuse and the Catholic Church, it was very clear that there was a network that supported the secrecy surrounding that.  Despite the fact that we are a small country and we often talk colloquially about how everybody knows everybody, that did not stop us keeping really robust secrets which is quite a scary matter.  It is always going to be difficult to legislate for freedom of information and to find means to make information readily available.  In that sense, I welcome the fact that the Minister has worked very hard during his time in Government to find all sorts of means to open up Government.  We have been in this House discussing many different Bills with him relating to defamation, whistleblowers and so on.  <\/p><p>It is also interesting to note the situation in other countries with freedom of information legislation, like Pakistan, for example.<\/p> <p>It has a record of shooting people who do not agree with it and look for information.  It is on the list of countries which have freedom of information.  I am not suggesting for a moment it would ever happen here or that legislation would encourage it, but it can be difficult to legislate and have a framework which is robust enough to withstand the ways and means by which people will seek to protect information.  Knowledge is power, after all, and keeping knowledge gives one greater power, as we all know.<\/p><p>In conclusion, I would like to highlight the fact the Bill extends to all public bodies.  That has been the subject of much discussion and now it includes the Central Bank, the NTMA, NAMA, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and so on.  The inclusion of the refugee agencies, in particular, is a good addition.  We will see a change in the way journalists do their work in regard to the use of FOI.

I thought the Senator might say that.  I refer in particular to the work done by Heather Brooke in the UK, which many of us will recall, regarding the revelations about the House of Commons and how moneys were spent.  People forget that it took her four years to overcome the hurdles involved despite having freedom of information in place.  Admittedly, freedom of information legislation in the UK is relatively limited, but nonetheless she operated under it and it still took her four years to get the information into the public domain.<\/p><p>Those in the media understand the use of data and records.  Senator Byrne was correct when he said many records are already in the public domain.  I hope we will see a sea change, whereby journalists will seek to use freedom of information in the manner in which it ought to be used in order to bring real light and exposure to the way decisions are made, including those which are made well and those which are made badly.  Journalists submit FOI requests to find out how many days Members of these Houses have reconciled in the past years.  Some of those inquiries are fishing expeditions and they can carry on doing that if they wish, but I am not sure that is what freedom of information ought to be about.<\/p><p>I look forward to further discussion on the Bill.  It is welcome.  This is a good day.  When governments water down, exclude or try to limit freedom of information, as was done in 2003, it sends a very clear signal to the public at large that it is okay for leaders, government and people in power to close the doors and keep things secret.

I did, but I now would advise caution to the Government.  There is far too much information being floated around all over the place.  It is the responsibility of the Government to govern and not to be constantly looking over its shoulders at what the public thinks about this, that or the other.

I remember an occasion when somebody who was a student of mine in Trinity College called from one of the tabloids.  I did not want to talk to him but was persuaded to do so.  He asked about expenses and what I received for this, that and the other, and raised various other matters.  I told him about the regime and told him that out of the 60 Senators I was the second lowest in this regard and that the only person who was lower than me was Senator Fergal Quinn.  Senator Quinn had just sold what he modestly called his shop for &euro;440 million, so I suppose he did not need the few bob.  What appeared in the newspaper was a headline reading &quot;Politicians with their snouts in the trough&quot;, a photograph of me and a line saying I received &euro;6,000.  All of those things were true individually, but together were calculated to promote a falsehood.<\/p><p>There are vexatious applications and so on.  The Minister referred to an overhaul of ethics legislation.  What a yawn.  One cannot legislate for ethics.  The crooks will get away with whatever they are at, regardless of whatever legislation is introduced, and it will be plodding auld fellas like myself on the bank bench who will have to waste time keeping records, getting accountants and all the rest, instead of doing what we are supposed to be doing, which is legislating and not dealing with receipts and all the rest.  It is complete rubbish.  One cannot legislate for ethics.  <\/p><p>There are questions of openness, accountability, transparency and all the ballsology that goes on.  Last night on &quot;Tonight with Vincent Brown&quot; a member of the Government acknowledged that Ministers being questioned in the D&aacute;il do not give answers, rather they stonewall, obfuscate and do not provide the information when they have it.  I would say people were astonished to hear that.  The Minister of State involved, Deputy Tom Hayes, is a very decent fellow, but they are all at it.  <\/p><p>There is the question of the Cabinet records.  Communication between members of a Government will no longer be exempt from FOI.  Of course they should be.  How can one possibly have decent government if one cannot have disputes and people taking unpopular positions which perhaps voters might not appreciate?  We hear from the Government and spokespersons all the time that they are paralysed and do not keep records of this, that and the other, but instead go into corners and huddle-muddle among themselves about decisions.  Exempting communication between members of Government should be done.  <\/p><p>I welcome the fact that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, public financial bodies such as the NTMA, NAMA and the Central Bank and the refugee agencies are being included.  That is fair enough if we are going to have this kind of thing.  <\/p><p>One of the major topics I took up during the debate on the 1997 legislation was the question of fees because I felt they were being introduced in order to deter people from making applications.  I very much welcome what the Government is doing.  There is a section in the Bill on fees, which is very good.  There is a code of best practice and a review will be carried out by an external group comprising academia, journalists and others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800017#R00600","speaker":"1136"},{"type":"speech","time":1411041000,"counter":145,"content":"<p>Interesting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800017#R00700","speaker":"1117"},{"type":"speech","time":1411041000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>That is rubbish.

In some instances An Taisce got involved and deprived the community of a much-needed house for a family.  In one instance, which was not a 100 miles from where I live, where a family with four members who had special needs, some of whom were adults, wanted a bigger house.  An Taisce objected and it was taken all the way to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and shot down.  The family should have been encouraged and granted aid and help.  What are the criteria for objecting to one-off rural housing and what are the criteria by which An Taisce frequently objects to various types of planning throughout the country?  I have seen a lot of bad planning in villages and towns throughout this country in the form of ghost estates but I never saw An Taisce speaking out and objecting to such developments.  Maybe I am wrong on this but I doubt I am.<\/p><p>We need to ensure it is included in this legislation and subject to freedom of information.  There are instances in West Cork and Kerry where An Taisce has been used subtly, by a developer or an objector who does not like his neighbour, through an agent whether a solicitor, an accountant or a third party, who gives An Taisce a small subscription and asks it to do his bidding.  In some instances I am certain that An Taisce has been naively unaware that it has been used.  Recently, when a SuperValu supermarket wanted to relocate within Bantry, properly zoned within all the parameters and outlines set by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, An Taisce objected.  I have seen doughnut developments around towns that have destroyed town centres where An Taisce has failed to act.  It seems to cherrypick.  It is being used.  How do we get the information on how it has been used and what are the criteria it uses for such objections? <\/p><p>I was pilloried when I said here that An Taisce was like the Ku Klux Klan because nobody seemed to know who its members are.  Maybe I went over the top.  A former Fine Gael Senator in the Beara Peninsula, who is now deceased, tried to find out who its members were in his area and encourage them to have open meetings, be transparent and discuss planning issues and policies with local councillors but that did not materialise.  We, as public representatives, should know about the funding of An Taisce, its statutory foundation, full remit, who and what its members are and its objectives.  We should peel away the layers of the notion that it is a beautiful holy body up in the sky protecting our heritage and environment.  I would love if that were the case.  There are Fine Gael, Labour and Independent councillors throughout the country who have had this difficulty with An Taisce and have been beating their heads off a brick wall. <\/p><p>I came across a family with an elderly member who had a disability whose son and his wife wanted to get planning permission on a site a farmer was providing.  The council said it was a difficult situation.  The county manager and senior planners said because of the criteria in Cork County Council they would bend the rules slightly to allow for this special need.  Somebody, not too far away, who did not like this couple building a house across the road, courted An Taisce, piggybacked on it and despite four years of efforts by the local authority overturned the planning permission because of An Taisce&rsquo;s powerful influence with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  My faith in An Bord Plean&aacute;la is also significantly diminished.  This is not the first time I have said it.  Its transparency and the reason it was set up are far from what they should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800018#S00400","speaker":"1127"},{"type":"speech","time":1411041600,"counter":151,"content":"<p>It needs to be abolished.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800018#S00500","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1411041600,"counter":152,"content":"<p>I say this although it is not the issue today.

I have had arguments with Senator Norris but I have said that it has a role to play.

That should be cleared up.<\/p><p>I would like under this Bill to see An Taisce explain why it objected to the cases I mentioned and others going back ten or 15 years, setting out its criteria, why it got involved and used its influence with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.

I know of the enthusiasm the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has brought to this area.  Our briefing note tells us that overall, the Bill has been cautiously welcomed by stakeholders and commentators.  The spirit of the Bill is very welcome.  In his speech the Minister referred to seven extensions but the Bill refers to 38 exemptions on pages 79 and 80.  Each one of those should be discussed on the next Stage.  How do people manage to talk themselves out of something which the Minister and Minister of State are persuaded of?  The clue I always seek in legislation is who has opted out.  Thirty-eight bodies have opted out.<\/p><p>I am nervous about the use of PR people.  The executives of State companies to whom we pay substantial sums of money should not employ PR agencies or departments.  They should answer questions.  I am critical of Irish Water in that regard.<\/p> <p>Will the Minister of State confirm the position of Irish Water in this regard?  The briefing notes we have state the exclusion from freedom of information of Irish Water has been criticised, in particular due to the fact the agency will have a monopoly on water provision in the State and derive 100% of its income from the public.  It was not mentioned in the Minister&rsquo;s speech but is contained in the briefing notes from the helpful Library and Research Service.<\/p><p>I have seen some of the correspondence concerning Part V planning applications, which is draconian, to say the least.  The public is treated with contempt by some county councils, which is against the spirit of this legislation.  The absence in the Minister&rsquo;s speech to local government was notable too and must be reviewed on subsequent Stages.  In the past, many decades ago, councillors were corrupt and, therefore, significant local government powers were transferred to county management.  This must be brought in under this legislation in the interests of the democratic openness as was intended by Eithne Fitzgerald when she introduced this legislation.<\/p><p>Senator Norris blamed the legislation for introducing a tradition of not writing anything down.  However, I do not blame the legislation but the way the Sir Humphreys responded to it in seeking to circumvent what the Houses wished to have implemented.  It is a serious problem in the banking inquiry, which the Minister of State knows about as he was on the Committee of Public Accounts which investigated it thoroughly two years ago.  At crucial stages, records were not kept, which the Department of Finance told the Committee of Public Accounts.  The phrase used by the committee was that it just ran into the sand investigating some matters.  Why did codes of conduct for bank directors disappear, for example?  There should not be a get-out-of-jail clause because of not writing matters down.  The incorporeal Cabinet meeting should also fall into this category.<\/p><p>The misleading answers to parliamentary questions goes right back to work Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe did many years ago.  The hundreds of hours and hundreds of thousands of euro spent on inquiries would not have been needed if people had answered parliamentary questions properly.  I hope this culture can be got out of the system.  The purpose of a parliamentary question is to give the information to the Deputy, not to conceal it to such a degree that so much parliamentary time and public moneys are subsequently wasted.<\/p><p>Tourism Ireland, InterTradeIreland and Waterways Ireland are exempted bodies but are vital North-South bodies created under the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements.  All politicians want to get together in a spirit of openness.  I do not understand how cross-Border bodies cannot disclose information to either Members, Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly or citizens of both jurisdictions.  How did 38 bodies, in the face of overwhelming public and Cabinet opinion regarding the extension of freedom of information, manage to persuade the Minister that they should not be included in it?<\/p><p>I support the Minister&rsquo;s intentions with this Bill.

Sinn F&eacute;in is committed to giving citizens a real say in how politics works.  We welcome the opening up of Government, which is needed to strengthen democracy and empower citizens as well as giving them ownership of the political system.  They can only participate fully if they have access to the relevant information.  Freedom of information legislation gives people access to information as to how public institutions are governed, taxpayers&rsquo; money is spent, etc.  Access to this information should be based on need, public interest and not necessarily on any ability to pay.  That is why we believe scrapping freedom of information fees is crucial for better governance.<\/p><p>The gutting of the freedom of information legislation in 2003 was a major step backwards for democracy because it restricted the oversight of public spending and Government policy-making.  We welcome this legislation as it proposes a reduction in the period of exemption for Cabinet papers, along with the extension of freedom of information to a new layer of public bodies which are significantly funded by the State.<\/p><p>Earlier, the Minister committed to restoring the legislation to its pre-2003 format, namely, the scrapping of fees.  This Bill does not fully scrap fees but introduces a new fees regime.  During the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform hearings on the legislative proposals, open data advocate Gavin Sheridan testified that Ireland is an exception rather the rule when it comes to fees.  The British Commons justice committee recognised that freedom of information fees set at a level high enough to recoup costs would deter requests with a strong public interest and, in turn, would defeat the purpose of the legislation.  The former Information Commissioner, Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, speaking in 2011 on the publication of her annual report, said, &ldquo;The punitive regime relating to fees should be overhauled so as not to discourage people from seeking out information&rdquo;.  It is worth remembering that following the introduction of fees, freedom of information requests had halved.<\/p><p>While a new regime has been introduced, our issue is that there are fees in the first place.  Access to information should not be a limited privilege in any guise but a fundamental right.  TASC, Think-tank for Action on Social Change, estimated in 2010 that, based on figures provided by the Government, the cost of freedom of information to the State was 0.012% of overall expenditure, noting it was far from an exorbitant price to pay for stronger democratic oversight.<\/p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in will be introducing amendments on Committee Stage in this regard which we look forward to discussing further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800019#T00200","speaker":"1155"},{"type":"speech","time":1411042200,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be here on behalf of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, who, as Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe pointed out, was sorry he was unable to take the full debate due to another commitment.<\/p><p>I thank all Senators for the constructive, informed and insightful contributions to this debate.  This legislation is a real example of how parliamentary democracy and scrutiny of legislation can work very well.<\/p> <p>We would all agree, including the Minister, Deputy Howlin, that the point at which we have now arrived with the Bill is even better than when it was first published.  When we consider legislation from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, all too often attention is on the public expenditure side, important as this is, but the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, this legislation, along with legislation on whistleblowers, a register of lobbyists which picks up on the point made by Senator Byrne on who wanders the corridors here, and Civil Service renewal, are some examples of how we have seen true and meaningful reform in how we operate as a State and how the agencies under the auspices of the State operate also.<br\/>The broad support for this crucial legislation is most welcome and mirrors the positive response the legislation has received from the current and former information commissioners, which reflects many recommendations made by the office to improve the operation and effectiveness of Ireland's freedom of information regime.<br\/>As was highlighted in the opening speech of the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and also reflected in many of the contributions in the debate, freedom of information plays a key role in helping to keep the Government honest.  It supports a climate underpinning more open, transparent and accountable government and administration.  The Government's commitment on freedom of information in the programme for Government could not have been more clear cut on the restoration of freedom of information and its extension to all public bodies.  The Bill delivers on these objectives.  However, it should be clear to any person who looks at the Bill in detail that it does much more than just restore the <i>status quo<\/i>.  In addition to consolidating freedom of information legislation, the Bill substantially modernises our freedom of information regime and contains significant innovations and enhancements.<br\/>It also strikes the right balance embodied in the Long Title of the original Freedom of Information Act, regarding enabling access by members of the public to official information consistent with the public interest, and we must remind ourselves of this.  When the then Minister, Eithne Fitzgerald, introduced the Freedom of Information Act it was with this very purpose in mind, to ensure access for members of the public to official information consistent with the public interest.  I am satisfied the Government's proposals navigate a balanced, proportionate and sensible course through the difficult and complex issues which can arise.<br\/>It should be emphasised that the principles of openness, transparency and accountability underpinning freedom of information are strengthened in the Bill by its provision for a general right of access to records and that they should be released unless they are found to be exempt.  What is more, in applying exemptions the right of access must only be set aside where the exemptions clearly support a refusal of access so the presumption is there that one should have access to records.<br\/>The Bill also makes explicit what was always intended, that in performing their functions under the Act public bodies must have regard to the need to achieve greater openness and promote transparency in Government and public affairs and strengthen the accountability of public bodies and improve the quality of decision-making.  As an aside, and it was touched upon during the debate, while we welcome the strengthening of freedom of information legislation as a society, State, Government and Oireachtas, we need to move to the point where information is readily available without the need to seek recourse to freedom of information.  Every Department has websites and I was struck by Senator Quinn's reference to the US website.  Let us put as much information as possible in the public domain to save people the hassle of having to go through freedom of information.<br\/>Transparency and accountability must be the yardsticks against which public bodies are measured when we speak of open government.  Irrespective of the quality of the legislative framework for freedom of information, if it does not operate effectively the overall value and potential contribution of Ireland's freedom of information is weakened.  Therefore, it is not surprising that many significant practical implementation and operational issues related to the implementation of freedom of information were also raised in the debate in this House, the other House and at committee meetings.  Contributions made included points on the need for public bodies to have better records management, proactive publication of information in open format, a consistency of approach in dealing with freedom of information requests, and adequate training for staff on freedom of information.  I and the Government strongly concur with all of these objectives and the drafting of a code of practice for freedom of information was embarked upon in this context.<br\/>As the Minister, Deputy Howlin, mentioned in his opening remarks, the preparation of the draft code was strongly informed by the work of an advisory group composed of experts on freedom of information drawn from the media, academia and civil society, with extensive experience of using the legislation to seek official information.  I note this gathering of individuals seems to have upset Senator Norris, but when putting together an advisory group to look at a draft code the balance of people from media, academia and civil society is quite appropriate in terms of harnessing the extensive experience these groups can offer the Government and the Oireachtas.<br\/>There is broad acceptance that the implementation of freedom of information is quite uneven, with clear examples of where public bodies have adopted quite different approaches in their interpretation of their legal responsibilities to make official information accessible and available to the public.  The code is strongly focused on addressing such inconsistencies and ensuring as much as possible that Ireland's freedom of information regime is operated by public bodies in a common template consistent with the aims and objectives of the legislation.  As the Minister, Deputy Howlin, mentioned, the intention is that the code, which is at public consultation phase, will be finalised in tandem with the enactment of the legislation.<br\/>As was the case in the D&aacute;il, there was a general welcome for the Government's proposals for the reform of the freedom of information fees regime, although I note Senator Reilly's comments to which I am sure we will return on Committee Stage.  Senators would agree that the fee proposals as outlined represent an enormous advance on the current situation, and the abolition of the application fee in particular has been very warmly welcomed by the NGO sector.  In terms of the public interest, it is essential to ensure the administrative system has the capability to effectively and efficiently manage the demand for freedom of information while at the same time being in a position to continue to provide a service to the public.  The five hours free search and retrieval time and the cap of &euro;500 on such charges should ensure the appropriate balance is achieved.  It is about balance and ensuring, as Senator Conway touched on, people can access information and there is no barrier in terms of costs, and that the public service can manage the demand and deal efficiently and effectively with queries and provide the public, in the public interest, with the information required.  Charging for actual time spent on search retrieval and copying in respect of a freedom of information request is a key feature of the many freedom of information fee regimes in OECD countries and is not one we propose to remove.<br\/>From the tone of the debate I reckon Senators welcome the provision included in the legislation which ensures freedom of information will apply automatically to all public bodies.  Several contributions were made on various exclusions in whole or in part included by the Government in the public interest, and I note the comments of Senator Barrett.  I am sure there will be an opportunity to debate and stress test these specific proposed exclusions on Committee Stage.  As should be clear from the Bill, however, the Government has sought to frame the exclusions as narrowly as possible and target them precisely where it was concluded by the Government there was risk of serious harm to the public interest if particular records of specific public bodies were potentially available for release under freedom of information.<br\/>Senators will also note that to the greatest extent possible the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has provided for exemptions in a Schedule to the Bill, so they can be amended by way of ministerial order in light of experience under the legislation, and the Government's intention is to keep the Schedule under regular review.<br\/>There will be an opportunity to debate these issues more thoroughly on Committee Stage, but I will attempt to provide some context to the issue raised by Senator Byrne on the differentiation between ports, and I am sure this can be returned to on Committee Stage.  All of the ports listed in the Schedule as exempt are those designated as commercial in legislation in the Harbours Act.  At the time, a number of harbour authorities were transferred to local authorities and they are now subject to freedom of information.  If there are further changes with more transfers to local authorities these can be considered in due course.<br\/>Senator Conway referred to electronic facilities.  We continue to do all we can to move towards e-Government.  We will have e-day on 19 September whereby public bodies will no longer accept cheques from businesses.  We cannot compel ordinary members of the public to make payments electronically, but the changing fees regime will assist in this regard.<br\/>Senator Quinn made a number of points on record management.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, has acknowledged this and it has been a feature of the debate that improvements can be made on records management, and this is provided for in the draft code of practice.  Senator Quinn also spoke about contractors providing services to the Government.  Where bodies provide services under contract to a freedom of information body, they will be covered by the regime.  I presume this will be a feature of the debate we will have on Committee Stage.<br\/>Senator O'Donovan sought clarification on whether An Taisce is covered by the legislation.  An Taisce is not covered under the Freedom of Information Act by which we are governed today.  Section 7 of the Bill contains a power to enable bodies funded by the Exchequer to be brought under the Act.  Consideration will be given to which bodies should be brought in as a priority in due course.  Criteria will have to be agreed as we need to ensure proportionality.  No Senator or Member of the Oireachtas wishes to see small bodies in receipt of small sums overburdened, but a number of bodies receive significant public funding and such bodies can be brought in under the Act by way of ministerial order with the passage of a positive resolution in both Houses.<\/p> <p>Obviously Senator O'Donovan has strong views in relation to An Taisce.  While this is an issue he can return to on Committee State, that is the factual position.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett referred to the issue of parliamentary questions.  All Ministers attempt to answer them and certainly the current Government is doing so in the most wholesome way possible.  Certainly I try to answer mine in that manner.  There is recourse for Members who are not satisfied with the answer to seek to have the Ceann Comhairle adjudicate or if a question is disallowed or if they feel the question has not been answered adequately.  I take the point he made which is similar to the point I made, namely, that if we can make more information readily available, people will not need to have recourse to FOI.<\/p><p>The six North-South bodies established under the British-Irish Agreement 1999, with Tourism Ireland which was established separately under the framework of the British-Irish Agreement, operate under an FOI code of practice for North-South bodies which has been approved by the North-South Ministerial Council and which has regard to the FOI legislation operating in both the UK and Ireland. <\/p><p>The Government has decided that it would be more appropriate for these bodies to continue to operate under the code of practice approved by the North-South Ministerial Council rather than to bring them under this FOI legislation in respect of their activities in this jurisdiction.  Those seven bodies are the language body, the special European Union programmes body, the Food Safety Promotion Board, the trade and business development body known as InterTradeIreland, Waterways Ireland, the Loughs Agency and Tourism Ireland.  That is the rationale behind those seven bodies.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for their insightful and detailed contributions.

This matter concerns one of the largest primary schools in County Donegal which has an enrolment of more than 440 children.  The school was placed on the capital building programme prior to the  2011 general election but the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, for reasons probably best known to himself, removed the school from the capital building programme.  While some progress has been made in the past 12 months in respect of getting a design team up and running, meetings between Department officials, the board of management and the architects appointed by the school, the danger is that if the project is not on the capital building programme all this work may be in vain.<\/p><p>The school was built in 1958 and an extension was built in 1974.  It has only 12 permanent classrooms, only four of which have toilet facilities and running water.  Approximately 40% of the children are being taught in prefabricated accommodation, including children with special needs.  The playground is extremely dangerous because it doubles onto a carpark which is used by the adjoining parish centre and St. Mary's Church.  There is major traffic congestion particularly in the mornings when a mass service takes place and in the evenings and also when weddings and funerals take place at the local church.<\/p><p>A new site has been identified.  I raise the issue to ascertain from the Department whether the project can be placed on the capital building programme.  While the Minister of State, who is a big Tipperary supporter and is getting ready for the weekend, is not responsible for this particular area I am not sure if he has good news to announce today.

Primary enrolments, which have already risen substantially in recent years, are projected to rise by almost 37,000 pupils by 2016 and they are set to continue to rise, with a likely peak in 2019.  In order to meet the needs of our growing population of school-going children, the Department must establish new schools as well as extending or replacing a number of existing schools in areas where demographic growth has been identified.  The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand, will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years.  Stranorlar has not been identified as an area of significant demographic growth.  In 2014-15 there appears to be a slight spike in enrolment in the area.  However, enrolment in the area is expected to gradually decline in the next few years.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding that Stranorlar has not been identified as an area of growth, a new site for the proposed new school was completed some time ago.  A project brief was prepared and the project has been advanced into the architectural planning process.<\/p><p>The project at Scoil Mhuire B&amp;amp;C, Stranorlar, will consist of a new three-storey, 24 classroom school with ancillary accommodation on a greenfield site.  The design team for this project was appointed in March 2014. The original project supervisor for the design process, PSDP, ceased trading shortly after their appointment and a replacement PSDP member of the design team has been subsequently appointed.<\/p><p>As conditional planning permission has already been granted by Donegal County Council for this project, the project has been authorised to advance directly to stage 2a, developed design.  Once the Department has received confirmation that the design team is prepared for the stage 2a stakeholders meeting, arrangements will be made to hold this meeting.  <\/p> <p> School building projects, including the project for Scoil Mhuire, which have not been included in the five-year construction programme but which were announced for initial inclusion in the building programme, will be ready to be progressed to the final planning stages in anticipation of the possibility of further funding being available to the Department in future years.

SOLAS also convenes the national apprenticeship advisory committee, representative of employers, unions, education and training bodies and State agencies, to advise on a range of issues relating to apprenticeship.  I understand from SOLAS that, as of 28 August this year, the total apprenticeship population in Ireland is 7,483.  This is made up of a live population of 6,331 and a redundant population of 1,152.  Of the live population, the total of those on the job is 5,591 while a further 740 are on off-the-job training.<\/p><p>Apprenticeship is a demand-led scheme and SOLAS approves an employer as competent to train apprentices but does not limit or control recruitment numbers.  The continuity of apprentice registrations and the number of apprentices registered with SOLAS is determined by individual employers within a broad range of occupational sectors.<\/p><p>In recognition of the fact that since the current system of apprenticeship was implemented in the early 1990s there have been major changes to the structure of the economy and the nature of employment, my predecessor established an independent review group to progress a consultation process and prepare recommendations on how the apprenticeship system could be improved.  The group's membership included employers, representatives of business and unions and academic experts.  Following a wide consultation process, the review group submitted its report in December 2013 and it was published in January 2014.<\/p><p>Key recommendations from the review group included new governance arrangements, including the appointment of an enterprise-led apprenticeship council hosted by SOLAS with close co-operation from the Higher Education Authority; a review of existing apprenticeship curricula as a matter of urgency; the expansion of the apprenticeship model into a range of new enterprise sectors; recruitment to apprenticeship to continue to be the responsibility of approved employers but with greater planning and control of numbers in apprenticeship; the development of clear occupational and academic progression routes; and a branding and promotion initiative illustrating the benefits of apprenticeship as a way of learning and the career opportunities arising.<\/p><p>The apprenticeship implementation plan was published on 30 June 2014.  The plan adopts a phased approach to implementation, recognising the need to progress current work on existing apprenticeships and to determine demand from new enterprise sectors through a call for proposals before embedding new arrangements in legislation.  The plan sets out how an apprenticeship council will be appointed and details a series of actions to renew existing apprenticeships and develop new ones, including a call for proposals for apprenticeships in new areas.  These actions will be delivered in three phases and are under way.<\/p><p>The Department is confident that we now have a good basis for renewing apprenticeship in Ireland as a strong model of learning in both further and higher education and training, thus ensuring that our apprenticeship system meets the needs of trainees and employers now and in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800022#W00300","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1411044000,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his answer.

Article 41 of the Constitution and Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights share the same understanding of the Family - with a capital \"F\".  Marriage is between men and women, marriage is inextricably linked to family and children and family is the natural and primary unit group in society and therefore demands protection from the State and indeed is guaranteed that protection in the Irish Constitution, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  Yet, Ireland decided to vote against a UN resolution calling for the convening of a discussion on \"the protection of the family\".  Instead, Ireland co-authored an amendment that greatly diluted the intended resolution by adding at its end the following quotation, \"bearing in mind that in different cultural, political and social systems, various forms of the family exist\".  The factual statement contained in Ireland's amendment is, no doubt, correct.  However, as a legal and political statement, the amendment proposed by Ireland is not coherent either with the Irish Constitution as it stands or with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UDHR, in terms of the respective understandings of the Constitution and the UDHR of the normative interrelationship between marriage, family and society.  Consequently, Ireland's vote against the resolution cannot have been motivated by any concern or respect for either Ireland's own constitutional position on the matter or that of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.<\/p><p>The question to which I seek an answer is what motivated the Irish decision to vote against this resolution?  I do not wish to believe it was any private ideology of the Minister, for whom I have great respect and who is an open-minded and thinking person, or one of his officials.  However, I must ask whether some private ideology or some kind of groupthink was at work?  I remind the Government that Ireland's presence at the United Nations is the presence of the Irish State, constituted by our basic law.  It is not the presence of either of the governing parties or of their party political manifestoes or of their Ministers.  I wish to ascertain whether the vote was dictated by an informal European Union voting alliance.  If so, that is wrong because the European Union has no legal competence in the area of marriage and family policy.  I wish to note that the official Irish statement made at a panel discussion on the protection of the family last Monday also openly departed from the current constitutional position on marriage and the family.  It is time that Members began to examine the position that is being taken up by Irish officials in international fora and testing whether they comply, not with the current ideological preferences of the mainstream media or within Government parties, but with the requirements of Irish law and of the Irish basic law in particular.  Can I have some objective rationale from the Government for the position it is taking?  My point is until we change the Constitution, the Government has no right to depart either from its spirit or its letter.  Perhaps an explanation is forthcoming from the Government.  While I have great respect personally for the Minister of State, as a Minister from another Department it is unfair to ask him to take an Adjournment matter on this issue.  No doubt a response has been prepared for him and while I look forward to hearing it, I would appreciate the opportunity to engage directly with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on this issue in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800023#X00200","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1411044600,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Ireland attaches great importance to family-related issues.  We recognise the crucial role of parents, care givers and extended families in improving outcomes for children and young people, the important role of families concerning responsibility and care for the elderly, as well as the need to provide support to families to enable them to play these important roles.  Families can provide an important framework to assist in the promotion and protection of human rights, in particular those of the family members themselves.  This is recognised in the inclusion of the concept of the family in Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948.<\/p><p>For many years, Ireland has supported resolutions on the family at the United Nations, including most recently at the session of the UN Commission for Social Development held in February 2014.  Ireland's engagement on these resolutions always has been guided by an understanding that negotiations among UN member states must be inclusive and must take into account the variety of human existence, while also ensuring the universal nature of human rights is respected.  Discussions at the UN on the family must take into account this diversity.  Past resolutions at the UN have consistently recognised that in different cultural, political, and social systems, various types of family exist, recognising the importance of the family to society while ensuring that our understanding of the family remains broad and inclusive.  From the poor grandmother in a village in Africa taking care of her grandchildren after their parents have passed away, to the single father in Dublin looking after his children with the help of extended family and to the more traditional forms of the family, we must ensure that our understanding of the family is broad enough to encompass the diversity of families that exist around the world today.<\/p><p>Throughout the course of negotiations on the resolution on the protection of the family during the 26th session of the UN Human Rights Council in June 2014, EU member states and other democratic countries repeatedly requested the inclusion of language in the draft resolution that would clearly acknowledge the diverse forms of the family.  Despite these consistent proposals on behalf of a sizeable number of states, the core group of countries proposing the draft resolution, namely, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, El Salvador, Mauritania, Morocco, Namibia, Qatar, Russia, Sierra Leone, Tunisia and Uganda, refused to include previously agreed and accepted language recognising that various forms of the family exist.  It was for this reason that Uruguay, together with Ireland, Chile, and France, tabled an amendment to the draft resolution to recognise this diversity of families, seeking to include agreed language from many previous UN resolutions, which state that in different cultural, political and social systems, various forms of the family exist.  However, the Russian Federation, supported by China and Indonesia, called for a &quot;no-action&quot; motion on this amendment to prevent the consideration of the amendment by the council.  The &quot;no-action&quot; motion passed with 22 votes in favour, four abstentions and 20 against, meaning that the Council was prevented from debating publicly the importance of recognising diversity in our efforts to protect the family.  Ireland profoundly regrets that such a deplorable tactic was used to stifle debate and dialogue.  Such &quot;no-action&quot; motions limit the ability of the council to discuss the substance of matters put before it and run contrary to the spirit of the council.  With debate on this important aspect of the resolution effectively shut down, the United Kingdom called for a vote on the draft resolution as a whole.  With the proponents of the draft resolution insisting on maintaining a narrow and exclusive definition and taking steps to prevent even a debate on its amendment, Ireland, along with all other EU member states that are members of the council, voted against the draft resolution.  The resolution passed with 26 votes in favour, six abstentions, and 14 opposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800023#X00300","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1411044600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for being present to give an answer.

It would be interesting to consider that question at another time.  However, I believe that Ireland's response does no service to the quality of the original proposal, which reaffirmed that states have primary responsibility to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings.  It also is a gratuitous slap at the Irish Constitution, because we have families headed by grandmothers in Ireland and other situations and yet that is compatible with Irish provisions on the family and those families are respected in Ireland.  Consequently, Ireland must get back to respecting its own Constitution in international fora and some of the language in this response was quite revealing of a certain disregard.  It almost is as though people feel they are off the reservation when they are in international fora and they are not obliged to worry too much about what the Irish Constitution currently provides.  This is an issue I will be taking up further, hopefully with the Minister and with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade because this important issue of respect for the Irish constitution by our officials in international fora is being brought to the surface here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800023#X00400","speaker":"1146"},{"type":"speech","time":1411044600,"counter":184,"content":"<p>Briefly, I am sorry the Minister is not available as he is otherwise engaged but I have no doubt that he will engage with the Senator.

Speaking to colleagues and others, it is widely recognised that he is the most helpful and the most approachable and I thank him for that.<\/p><p>The issue I raise is of national importance and relates to the whole fishing industry.  It affects Dingle, Killybegs, Castletownbere, Rossaveal and Dunmore East and relates to the new process of weighing fish.  The EU directive on the weighing of fish states that the fish will be weighed on the boat, on the pier or in the factory.  We have spoken many times about Ireland and its participation in the EU but the practice here currently is to do all three.  The fish, including herring and mackerel, the season for which opened two weeks ago tomorrow, are being weighed on the boat, dry weighed on the pier and weighed in the factory.<\/p><p>Approximately two years ago, the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government brought in administrative sanctions, fines and penalties for indiscretions in the fishing industry.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why they are not being implemented.  A sledge hammer is being used to crack a nut here.  Obviously, as in any industry, there is always a rogue or a couple of rogues but what is happening now is that the whole industry is being virtually shut down as a result of more red tape and bureaucracy.  There are an additional 12 conditions.<\/p><p>The factories in which the fish is processed must put in cameras.  I was trying to think of a comparable workplace, other than here where we are constantly looking into cameras, but I do not know of any other workplace in which there are cameras.  It is not as if the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority is short of staff.  It has 100 inspectors and we are talking about five places in the country which must be inspected.  <\/p><p>A compromise is needed here.  We are two weeks into the herring and mackerel season.  I spoke to a factory owner in Killybegs during the week and he informed me that he lost a boat during the week and a turnover of &euro;3 million.  That boat, laden with fish, went to Scotland so those fish did not land in Ireland.  The men and women were not working in the factory and the factory was effectively closed.  It does not make sense.  The fish are gone, the fish processors are closed and the fish processing workers will be gone.<\/p><p>As I said, two years ago, administrative sanctions were brought in by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to deal with rogues in the fishing industry and that is why they should be implemented.  Why not tie up someone's boat following an infringement and remove that person's licence following another infringement rather than tarnish everyone in the fishing industry as a rogue out to fiddle the system?  Rather than concentrate our focus on the Irish fishing industry, with which I have no issue, a compromise could be reached here.  We should focus more on the Faroese and the Icelandics who have taken 1 million tonnes of mackerel and herring in the past five years and not hammer our own little industry.  The factory workers will not have work and the factories will close.<\/p><p>The resolution lies with the 100 inspectors in the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  There should be random weighing checks and random checks in the factories with one weighing process, which is sought in the EU directive, and not three different weighing processes.  Anyone found to be breaking the law should be dealt with by the courts.  That is what should be done.  A resolution could be found very quickly.  As I said, we are two weeks into the herring and mackerel season.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800024#Y00200","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1411045200,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Sheahan for raising this issue.  All matters relating to the operational enforcement of sea fisheries law are, by statute, matters appropriate to the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  SFPA is the independent law enforcement agency of the State for sea fisheries law.<\/p><p>As Minister of State, I do not have responsibility in regard to the issues raised by the Senator.   Responsibility in these matters rests with SFPA, which has a challenging job to do.  Its statutory responsibility is to enforce EU and national law under the Common Fisheries Policy.  It also has responsibility to provide a level playing field for everybody in this industry.  If one boat or two or six boats are overfishing deliberately, it is not a victimless crime.  It has an impact on others who are law abiding and who are catching in accordance with the quotas allocated to them.<\/p><p>The market situation for pelagic fish is currently challenging, as Russia has banned the importation of pelagic fish and Russia has been an important market for mackerel, in particular.  If illegally caught fish are being placed on the market, it displaces and reduces prices for those operators, the majority of our industry, who are abiding by the rules set down.  In my view, it is in the interest of the industry as a whole to have strong and fair arrangements in place that give confidence that the rules apply across the board and that all operators are abiding by the quota allocations made available to them.<\/p><p>The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority has sent me a report on the issues that have given rise to the current situation, the actions taken and the current state of consultation between SFPA and the industry.  Arrangements for the monitoring and control of fisheries is set down in the EU Control Regulation 1224\/09.  Article 60(2) of the Council regulation requires that weighing of fisheries products shall be carried out on landing prior to the fisheries products being held in storage, transported or sold.  SFPA has allowed a derogation from the EU regulations and permitted the weighing of pelagic fish post-transport in every plant since 2012, based on assurances that proper systems and procedures that accurately recorded catches were in place in these plants.<\/p><p>However, there have been substantial indications that fish have been landed in weights that exceed those recorded by the weighing systems in factories.  These indications have arisen through the routine course of SFPA's work and as a result of joint inspections with other organisations, including the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  <\/p><p>SFPA has set out some of the issues that gave rise to concerns.  These include a high level of divergence between spot checks by SFPA and the official factory weight, even taking account of some divergence relating to water content; a trend of individual trucks recording substantially more fish when subject to SFPA official control compared to instances when not subject to such controls; and one instance of a simple on-off switch on the belt weigher in a factory which had the effect of allowing the belt to transit fish without being recorded on the meter.  If used in this way, fish would not be weighed or recorded.<\/p><p>The permits which allow in-factory weighing have lapsed due to SFPA's overall lack of confidence in the operation of the weighing systems.  SFPA has entered into discussions with both catchers and processors to implement systems and procedures that will restore confidence in the weighing systems in factories.<\/p> <p>The authority has set out to the factories certain requirements necessary before permits can be granted, thus allowing the renewal of in-factory weighing.  These requirements include provisions to give assurances that weigh belts in the factories are recording when moving.  They include confirmation of product flows into and out of plants and checks involving weighing of a sample of landings on the pier side as a means of validating factory weighing.<\/p><p>Several pelagic fish factories have in recent days applied for permits under the new requirements, albeit generally qualified by statements around non-acceptance of some of the requirements described by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  These applications are being considered by the SFPA.<\/p><p>While the representative bodies for the pelagic industry have acknowledged the need for change, they are not yet willing to support the SFPA requirement for a continuous remote monitoring facility to increase assurances of accurate recording.  Furthermore, the industry is not yet willing to provide stock movement records at the level of detail set out in the SFPA request.  Catchers have indicated they are not willing to move to recognise the validity of weighing at landing, even as a component cross-checking arrangement of an overall system of supporting factory permits.<\/p><p>I understand and appreciate that the new arrangements sought by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority for the effective control of pelagic fisheries involve some changes in practices.  However, in the long run it will be in the interests of the industry as a whole to commit to strengthened controls that give all catchers and processors assurances that there is a level playing field across the industry.  I encourage the industry to continue its dialogue with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  The SFPA is considering existing applications for in-factory weighing permits and is awaiting further applications from the remainder of the factories.  If there are additional technical issues to be sorted out, the authority has assured me that it remains available for further discussion with industry representatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800024#Y00300","speaker":"1089","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1411045800,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.  The easy way to secure a level playing pitch, a term the Minister of State used on several occasions, would be to tackle those who are impinging on the fishing industry, namely, the fishermen from the Faroe Islands and Iceland who are fishing just outside our waters and to whom quotas do not apply.  As I stated, they have taken 1 million tonnes of fish in the past five years.<\/p><p>To return to the issue, on-pier weighing requires the fish to be weighed dry.  This practice is not supported by the catchers or processors as it compromises the quality of the fish.  To ensure weighing results are accurate, fish will have to be weighed dry on the pier because one cannot weigh a tanker that is half full of sea water.  The quality of fish that have been weighed in this manner is compromised when it arrives at the processing plant.  This issue must be borne in mind. <\/p><p>As I stated, I do not raise or flag problems without proposing a resolution.  The solution in this case is to implement the administrative fines, sanctions and penalties the Minister introduced two years ago.  While I do not propose to name individuals, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority has identified a number of cases involving indiscretions or breaches of the law.  Those found to be breaking the law should be prosecuted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2014091800025#Z00200","speaker":"1163"},{"type":"speech","time":1411045800,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Sheahan for his contribution.
